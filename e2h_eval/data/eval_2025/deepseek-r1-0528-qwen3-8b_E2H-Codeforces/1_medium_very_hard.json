    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (0-indexed in our mind, but the problem says first one is i=1), the inner rectangle for that ring is:\n   width_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring itself has a width of 1 cell. The ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But wait: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives output 8.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n   w=3, h=3, k=1.\n   The first ring: \n        The inner rectangle is (3 - 0) x (3 - 0) = 3x3.\n        The ring is the border of this 3x3, which has 3*4 - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice) -> actually, for a rectangle of n x m, the border has 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the number of cells in the ring as:\n   top and bottom: each has (w - 4*(i-1)) - 2? Actually, no.\n\n Actually, the ring for the i-th time is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and then the border of that rectangle is the ring.\n\n The number of cells in the border of an n x m rectangle is: 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n However, let's check with the example:\n   i=1: n = w = 3, m = h = 3 -> 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n But what if we have multiple rings?\n Example: \"7 9 2\"\n   First ring (i=1): \n        n1 = 7, m1 = 9 -> 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n   Second ring (i=2):\n        The inner rectangle for the second ring: \n            width_2 = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7 - 4 = 3\n            height_2 = 9 - 4*(2-1) = 9 - 4 = 5\n        Then the ring is the border of 3x5: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40. But the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40.\n\n However, wait the example input provided is:\n     Input: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n     Output: ['8', '28', '40']\n\n So the example \"7 9 1\" gives 28 and \"7 9 2\" gives 40.\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second one 2 cells away, etc.\n\n However, there is a catch: the condition on k: \n   k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n This ensures that the inner rectangle for the last ring has at least 1 row and 1 column.\n\n However, we must also note that when subtracting 4*(i-1) from w or h, we must ensure that the resulting dimensions are at least 1. But the condition on k already takes care of that.\n\n Steps:\n   Read the three integers: w, h, k.\n\n   For the i-th ring (from 1 to k):\n        Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        Then the number of cells for the i-th ring is: 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n   However, wait: what if n_i < 1 or m_i < 1? But k is bounded so that n_i and m_i are at least 1 (since the condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) implies that the last ring has at least 1x1, and then the border of 1x1 would be 0? Actually, wait:\n\n   The problem says: the i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Then the border of that rectangle: if the rectangle is 1x1, then the border has 1 cell? But by our formula: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0. That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Let me reexamine the definition: the ring has width 1. The ring is the set of cells that are on the border of the inner rectangle. For a 1x1 rectangle, the border is the entire cell. So it should be 1 cell.\n\n   Our formula: 2*n + 2*m - 4 is correct for n>=2 and m>=2. For n=1 and m=1: \n        We cannot use that formula because it would subtract 4 from 2+2 which is 0.\n\n   But note the condition: k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So for example, if min(w, h)=3, then floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. So k=1 is allowed. Then the inner rectangle for the first ring is 3x3, which is okay.\n\n   However, for the next ring: we subtract 4, so for w=3, h=3, k=2: \n        n2 = 3 - 4 = -1 -> invalid. And the condition says k<=1 for w=h=3.\n\n   So the problem states that k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). Therefore, we don't have to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n   But wait: what if the inner rectangle becomes 1x1? Then the border of 1x1 is 1 cell. How do we account for that?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). The border of a 1x1 is 1 cell. Similarly, the border of a 1x2 rectangle is 2 cells (the two cells are adjacent, but wait: the border of a 1x2 is the entire thing? Actually, the border is the outer perimeter. In a 1x2 grid, the border consists of the two cells? Or is it the entire grid? \n\n   Let me define the border: for an n x m grid, the border is the set of cells that are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n   For 1x1: the only cell is in the first row, first column, last row, last column -> so the entire cell is the border. Count=1.\n\n   For 1x2: \n        Row1: both cells are the border (because they are the first and only row). Also, the first column and the last column: the first cell is the first column and the second cell is the last column. So both cells are borders. Count=2.\n\n   For 1x3: \n        The border: the entire row (all three cells) because there's only one row, and the first and last columns. But the middle column isn't a border? Actually, the definition of border in the problem is the set of cells that are adjacent to the edge of the inner rectangle. So in a 1x3, the border is the first and last cell (so 2 cells) OR is it the entire row? \n\n   Wait, the problem says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\". \n\n   The inner rectangle is the entire grid for the ring? Actually, the ring is drawn by going 2*(i-1) away from the edge. So for the second ring, we remove two cells from each side, meaning we take the grid from row 2 to row (w-1) and column 2 to column (h-1). Then the ring is the cells that are at the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n   So for the second ring (i=2) of the 3x3 plate: \n        The inner rectangle is (3-4) x (3-4) = -1? That's not valid, so k is bounded to 1.\n\n   But consider a larger example: w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\n   First ring: inner rectangle 5x5 -> border: 2*5+2*5-4 = 16.\n   Second ring: inner rectangle 5-4=1, so 1x1 -> border: 1.\n\n   However, according to the condition: k <= floor((min(5,5)+1)/4) = floor(6/4)=1. So k=2 is not allowed.\n\n   Now, let's take w=7, h=7, k=2: \n        Condition: floor((min(7,7)+1)/4) = floor(8/4)=2 -> k=2 is allowed.\n        First ring: 7x7 -> 2*7+2*7-4 = 28\n        Second ring: 7-4=3 -> 3x3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 8, total=36.\n\n   Now, if we try w=9, h=9, k=2: \n        First ring: 9x9 -> 2*9+2*9-4 = 34\n        Second ring: 9-4=5 -> 5x5 -> 2*5+2*5-4 = 16, total=50.\n\n   But wait, the example input was \"7 9 2\", which gives 28+12=40. In that case, the second ring is 3x5, not 3x3. \n\n   Correction: the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w - 4*(2-1)) x (h - 4*(2-1)) = (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n\n   So the general formula for the i-th ring is:\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then, the number of cells for the i-th ring is:\n        If n_i == 1 and m_i == 1: 1\n        Else if n_i == 1 or m_i == 1: then the shape is a straight line? Actually, if either dimension is 1, then the border is just the entire grid? \n\n   Actually, the border of an n x m grid (with n>=1, m>=1) is defined as the set of cells that are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n   The count is:\n        total_border = 0\n        If n_i >= 1 and m_i >= 1:\n            top and bottom rows: each has m_i cells, but if n_i==1 then top and bottom are the same, so we must avoid double counting?\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n                If n_i == 1 and m_i == 1: 1\n                If n_i == 1: then the entire row is the border -> m_i\n                If m_i == 1: then the entire column is the border -> n_i\n                Otherwise (n_i>=2 and m_i>=2): 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n   But wait, the example of 1x2: \n        n_i=1, m_i=2 -> we return 2. Correct.\n        2x1: n_i=2, m_i=1 -> returns 2. Correct.\n\n   However, the problem's condition on k ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1, but we might get 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2, etc.\n\n   We can write a helper function for the border of an n x m grid:\n\n        def border_cells(n, m):\n            if n == 1 and m == 1:\n                return 1\n            elif n == 1:\n                return m\n            elif m == 1:\n                return n\n            else:\n                return 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n   Then, for each ring i (from 1 to k):\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if n_i < 1 or m_i < 1: \n            # According to the problem condition, this shouldn't happen, but to be safe we break early.\n            break\n        else:\n            add border_cells(n_i, m_i)\n\n   However, the condition on k ensures that we don't go below 1 in both dimensions. But note: if one dimension becomes 0 or negative, we break.\n\n   But the problem says: k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has dimensions at least 1. However, note that the condition uses min(w, h). So if w and h are different, then the minimum might be the limiting factor.\n\n   Example: w=10, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. Then the first ring: n1=10, m1=5 -> valid. The second ring: n2=10-4=6, m2=5-4=1 -> valid (since 6>=1 and 1>=1). Then third ring: n3=10-8=2, m3=5-8=-3 -> invalid. But k is bounded by 1, so we only do one ring.\n\n   Actually, the condition says: k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So for w=10, h=5, k_max = 1. So we only do one ring.\n\n   Therefore, we can safely compute for i from 1 to k.\n\n   However, note: the condition uses the minimum of w and h. The problem says: \n        k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n   So we don't need to worry about negative dimensions because k is chosen such that the last ring has at least 1x1.\n\n   But wait: the condition is on the minimum of w and h. The inner rectangle for the i-th ring is (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). The minimum dimension of the inner rectangle is min(w-4*(i-1), h-4*(i-1)). The condition says k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   However, note that the minimum dimension of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring is at least min(w, h) - 4*(i-1). We require that the minimum dimension is at least 1, so we require min(w, h) - 4*(i-1) >= 1. Solving for i: \n        i <= (min(w, h) - 1) / 4 + 1.\n\n   The floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) is the maximum k. \n\n   Example: min(w, h)=5 -> floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then k_max=1, and the inner rectangle for the first ring is 5x? (if w=5, h=any) then the inner rectangle for the first ring is 5x... but wait, the condition uses the minimum, so if w=5, h=10, then min=5 -> k_max=1. Then the first ring: n1=5, m1=10 -> valid. The second ring: n2=5-4=1, m2=10-4=6 -> valid? But the condition says k_max=1, so we only do one ring.\n\n   However, the condition is stated as: k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So the bound is computed from the original w and h.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\". \n\n   The condition is given to ensure that the inner rectangle is non-negative in both dimensions, but actually we see that the inner rectangle might become 1x something even if the original min is 5. However, the condition is set so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 1 in the smallest dimension? \n\n   Actually, the condition is set to guarantee that the entire process for k rings is valid. \n\n   So, we can simply compute for i from 1 to k, and use the helper function for the border.\n\n   Example: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> 8.\n   Example: w=7, h=9, k=1 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n   Example: w=7, h=9, k=2 -> 28 + (border of (3,5)) = 28 + (2*3+2*5-4) = 28 + (6+10-4)=28+12=40.\n\n   However, wait: what if the inner rectangle has one dimension being 1? \n\n   Example: w=5, h=5, k=1: 2*5+2*5-4=20-4=16.\n   Example: w=5, h=5, k=2: \n        Condition: floor((min(5,5)+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> k=2 is not allowed. So we don't consider.\n\n   But if we have w=6, h=5, k=1: \n        Condition: floor((min(6,5)+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> k=1 allowed.\n        First ring: 6x5 -> 2*6+2*5-4 = 12+10-4=18.\n\n   Now, if we have w=6, h=5, k=2: \n        Condition: floor((min(6,5)+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed.\n\n   Another example: w=8, h=5, k=1: \n        Condition: floor((min(8,5)+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> k=1 allowed.\n        First ring: 8x5 -> 2*8+2*5-4=16+10-4=22.\n\n   Now, w=8, h=5, k=2: \n        Condition: floor((min(8,5)+1)/4)=1 -> not allowed.\n\n   Now, let's test a case that requires two rings but the condition allows two rings? \n        Condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n        We want min(w, h) to be at least 5 for k=2? Because floor((5+1)/4)=1, floor((6+1)/4)=1, floor((7+1)/4)=2, floor((8+1)/4)=2.\n\n        So for w=7, h=7: min=7 -> floor(8/4)=2 -> k=2 allowed.\n        Then the second ring: inner rectangle (7-4)=3x3 -> border=8, and the first ring: 7x7 -> border=28, total=36.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" is allowed because min(7,9)=7 -> floor((7+1)/4)=2, so k=2 is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            # Since k is bounded, n_i and m_i are at least 1 in the minimum dimension? Not necessarily: one might be 0 and the other positive, but the condition on k ensures the minimum dimension is at least 1 for the k-th ring, but note: the condition is based on the original min(w, h). However, we are told k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This condition does not guarantee that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions? Actually, it does: because the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has dimensions (w-4*(k-1)) and (h-4*(k-1)). The condition says k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) => 4*k <= min(w, h)+1 => 4*(k-1) <= min(w, h) - 1. So the minimum dimension of the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= (min(w, h)) - (min(w, h)-1) = 1. \n\n        So we can safely use the helper function.\n\n        We define:\n\n            def border(n, m):\n                if n < 1 or m < 1:\n                    return 0\n                if n == 1 and m == 1:\n                    return 1\n                if n == 1:\n                    return m\n                if m == 1:\n                    return n\n                return 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n        Then:\n\n            total += border(n_i, m_i)\n\n        Print(total)\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n            w=3, h=3, k=1\n            i=1: n_i=3, m_i=3 -> border(3,3)=2*3+2*3-4=8 -> total=8.\n\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n            i=1: n_i=7, m_i=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28.\n\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n            i=1: 28\n            i=2: n_i=7-4=3, m_i=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> total=40.\n\n        Example: \"5 5 1\" -> 2*5+2*5-4=16.\n\n        Example: \"5 5 2\" -> not allowed by condition, but if we try to compute: \n            Condition: floor((min(5,5)+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> so k=2 is invalid. But if we run the code with k=2, then:\n            i=1: 5x5 -> 16\n            i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1 -> border(1,1)=1 -> total=17.\n            However, the condition says k<=1, so we assume k=2 is not given.\n\n        But the problem says: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, note: the condition is given in the input, so we read k and then use it.\n\n   Let me test with a 1x1 inner rectangle: w=5, h=5, k=2 is not allowed. But what if we have w=7, h=7, k=2: \n        Condition: floor((7+1)/4)=2 -> allowed.\n        i=1: 7x7 -> 28\n        i=2: 3x3 -> 8 -> total=36.\n\n   Another example: w=9, h=9, k=3: \n        Condition: floor((9+1)/4)=floor(10/4)=2 -> so k=3 is not allowed. But wait, 9+1=10, 10//4=2. So k_max=2.\n\n        However, let me compute the inner rectangle for k=3: \n            n3 = 9-8=1, m3=9-8=1 -> border=1. But the condition says k<=2, so k=3 is not provided.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n        def border(n, m):\n            if n < 1 or m < 1:\n                return 0\n            if n == 1 and m == 1:\n                return 1\n            if n == 1:\n                return m\n            if m == 1:\n                return n\n            return 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            n_i = w - 4*i\n            m_i = h - 4*i\n            total += border(n_i, m_i)\n\n        print(total)\n\n   Wait, note: the problem says the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) away from the edge. So the first ring (i=1) is 0 away? Actually, the problem says \"the first one should go along the edge\", meaning it is at the edge. Then the second one is 2 cells away (so subtract 4? because we remove 2 cells from left, 2 from right, 2 from top, 2 from bottom?).\n\n   But wait: the inner rectangle for the i-th ring is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n   In the above code, I did: n_i = w - 4*i, which is for i starting at 0? \n\n   Correction: in the loop, i goes from 0 to k-1 (because range(k) gives 0,1,...,k-1). Then for the first ring, i=0: n_i = w - 0, m_i = h-0 -> correct for the first ring.\n\n   But the problem says the i-th ring (starting at i=1) is defined with (w - 4*(i-1)). \n\n   In our loop, for the first ring we want to use i=1, so we should use:\n\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust the index.\n\n   Let me change the loop to:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            total += border(n_i, m_i)\n\n   Then, for k=1, we use i=1: subtract 0 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the example \"7 9 1\": \n        i=1: n_i=7, m_i=9 -> 28.\n\n   Example \"7 9 2\":\n        i=1: 28\n        i=2: n_i=7-4=3, m_i=9-4=5 -> 12, total=40.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note that the condition on k is given by the problem, so we don't need to check for negative dimensions.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings, but we read from stdin. We assume one line.\n\n   Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n        def border(n, m):\n            if n < 1 or m < 1:\n                return 0\n            if n == 1 and m == 1:\n                return 1\n            if n == 1:\n                return m\n            if m == 1:\n                return n\n            return 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            total += border(n_i, m_i)\n\n        print(total)\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition says the plate is split into w x h cells, and the rings are drawn accordingly.\n\n   Let me test with the example that had one dimension 1: \n        w=5, h=2, k=1: \n            Condition: floor((min(5,2)+1)/4)=floor(3/4)=0 -> but k>=1, so k=1 is not allowed? \n\n   But wait, the problem says: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). For w=5, h=2, min=2 -> floor((2+1)/4)=floor(3/4)=0. Then k must be between 1 and 0 -> which is impossible. \n\n   However, the problem states: \"1 <= k <= ...\", so the input will satisfy that condition. Therefore, we don't have to handle the case where k=0 or negative.\n\n   The problem input constraints: 3<=w,h<=100, and k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   So the minimum value of min(w, h) is 3 (since w, h>=3). Then floor((3+1)/4)=1, so k=1 is the maximum for w=3, h=3.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Let me test with w=4, h=4, k=1: \n        Condition: floor((4+1)/4)=1 -> allowed.\n        n_i=4, m_i=4 -> border=2*4+2*4-4=8+8-4=12.\n\n   But wait, a 4x4 plate: \n        The first ring is the outer border: \n            top row: 4, bottom row: 4, and the two inner rows: the first and last column (each has 2 cells) -> but wait, the entire border: \n            top: 4, bottom: 4, left: 2 (without the top and bottom), right: 2 (without the top and bottom) -> total=4+4+2+2=12. Correct.\n\n   Another test: w=4, h=5, k=1: \n        Condition: floor((4+1)/4)=1 -> allowed.\n        n_i=4, m_i=5 -> border=2*4+2*5-4=8+10-4=14.\n\n   The 4x5 plate: \n        Top and bottom: 5 each -> 10\n        Left and right: 4-2=2 rows (excluding the top and bottom) -> 2 per side -> 2*2=4\n        Total=10+4=14. Correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n        def border(n, m):\n            if n < 1 or m < 1:\n                return 0\n            if n == 1 and m == 1:\n                return 1\n            if n == 1:\n                return m\n            if m == 1:\n                return n\n            return 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            total += border(n_i, m_i)\n\n        print(total)\n\n   We can also note that the inner rectangle for the i-th ring must have at least 1 in both dimensions (because of the condition on k). So we can remove the n<1 or m<1 check, but it's safe to leave it.\n\n   However, the problem constraints say k is bounded, so we don't expect negative or zero. But let's keep the helper function robust.\n\n   But wait, the condition on k is given by the problem, so we can rely on the input. However, the helper function is designed to handle any nonnegative n and m.\n\n   This code should be accepted.\n\n   Let me submit.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate by adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its distance from the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells away from the previous one. The solution involves determining the dimensions of each ring and then calculating the number of cells that form its border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w x h` cells. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate. Each subsequent ring is indented by 2 cells from the edges compared to the previous ring. The i-th ring is defined by an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The task is to compute the total number of cells in all `k` rings.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border can be calculated based on the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If the dimensions are both 1, the border consists of a single cell. If one dimension is 1, the border is the entire length of the other dimension. For larger dimensions, the border is calculated as `2*n + 2*m - 4`, accounting for the four corners being counted twice.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring, and use a helper function to determine the number of cells in its border. Sum these values for all rings to get the final result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `k` rings once, performing constant-time operations for each. Given that `k` is bounded by `floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)`, the complexity is O(k), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    def border(n, m):\n        if n < 1 or m < 1:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1 and m == 1:\n            return 1\n        if n == 1:\n            return m\n        if m == 1:\n            return n\n        return 2 * n + 2 * m - 4\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        width_i = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        height_i = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        total += border(width_i, height_i)\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Helper Function `border(n, m)`**: This function calculates the number of cells in the border of an `n x m` rectangle. It handles edge cases where either dimension is 1 or both are 1, and uses the formula `2*n + 2*m - 4` for larger dimensions.\n3. **Main Loop**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, the code computes the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both width and height (accounting for the indentations). The `border` function is called to get the number of cells in the current ring's border, which is added to the total.\n4. **Output**: The total number of cells across all rings is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
