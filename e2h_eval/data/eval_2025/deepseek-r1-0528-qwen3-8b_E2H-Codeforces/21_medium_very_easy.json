The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) for chests and one of m integers (b_j) for keys.\n\n Condition: a chest i can be opened by key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) is odd, i.e., \n   (a_i % 2 == 0 and b_j % 2 == 1) OR (a_i % 2 == 1 and b_j % 2 == 0)\n\n Since one key can open at most one chest and vice versa, we are to find the maximum matching between chests and keys that satisfy the condition.\n\n Observation:\n   The condition depends only on the parity (even/odd) of the numbers.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_count = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_count = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   For even chests and odd keys: we can use at most min(even_count, odd_keys) chests from the even ones.\n   For odd chests and even keys: we can use at most min(odd_count, even_keys) chests from the odd ones.\n\n However, wait: the problem is that the keys and chests are distinct and we cannot use the same key twice. But note the two conditions are independent because:\n\n   Even chest requires odd key -> uses odd keys.\n   Odd chest requires even key -> uses even keys.\n\n So the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint, and similarly the two sets of chests (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n\n   total = min(even_count, odd_keys) + min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n Let's validate with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd\n        even_count = 3, odd_count = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8->even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even\n        even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then, \n        even_chests (3) can be matched with odd_keys (1): min(3,1)=1\n        odd_chests (2) can be matched with even_keys (3): min(2,3)=2\n        total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example output.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_count=5, odd_count=0.\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0.\n\n   Then, \n        even_chests (5) with odd_keys (1): min(5,1)=1\n        odd_chests (0) with even_keys (0): 0\n        total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> even_count=1, odd_count=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0.\n\n   Then,\n        even_chests (1) with odd_keys (0): min(1,0)=0\n        odd_chests (0) with even_keys (4): 0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n So the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Then, answer = min(even_count, odd_keys) + min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n However, note: the problem does not require matching the entire set of keys to the entire set of chests arbitrarily. But our reasoning holds because the condition is purely based on parity and the two sets of keys (even and odd) are used independently for the two sets of chests (even and odd). \n\n But wait: what if there is a constraint that a key must be used only once? Our counting by independent sets already respects that because we are taking the minimum of the available chests and keys for each group.\n\n Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so we must count efficiently.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to specific parity conditions: an even-numbered chest must be paired with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be paired with an even-numbered key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity conditions. Each chest and key can be used at most once, so the solution involves counting how many chests and keys meet the necessary parity criteria and then finding the maximum possible matches between these groups.\n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing chests into even and odd counts and keys into even and odd counts, we can independently determine the maximum number of valid pairs for each category. The solution is the sum of the minimum values between the counts of even chests and odd keys, and the counts of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the chest list.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the key list.\n   - Calculating the maximum matches for each category (even chests with odd keys, and odd chests with even keys) by taking the minimum of the respective counts.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves linear scans of both the chest and key lists, resulting in an O(n + m) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5). The space complexity is O(1) as we only store counts during the processing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (even_chest) and how many have odd numbers (odd_chest). Similarly, it counts the even and odd numbers in the keys (even_key and odd_key).\n3. **Calculating Maximum Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by pairing even chests with odd keys (min(even_chest, odd_key)) and odd chests with even keys (min(odd_chest, even_key)). The sum of these two values gives the total number of chests Neko can open.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two minimum values calculated earlier.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal solution without any complex computations or data structures.",
