Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100000 souvenirs, each with weight in {1,2,3} and a cost (which can be up to 10^9). We have a maximum total weight m (up to 300000).\n\n Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, we can group the souvenirs by weight.\n\n Let:\n   type1 = list of costs for souvenirs with weight 1\n   type2 = list of costs for souvenirs with weight 2\n   type3 = list of costs for souvenirs with weight 3\n\n Then, we want to choose some number of items from each type such that:\n   x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m, and the total cost (sum of chosen x from type1, y from type2, z from type3) is maximized.\n\n However, note that we cannot use fractional items. We need to consider the best way to pick items from each group.\n\n Since the groups are independent, we can precompute:\n\n   For each type (weight), we want to have a sorted list (in descending order) of the costs, and then compute the prefix sums so that we can quickly get the top k items.\n\n But note: we are allowed to take any combination (with the constraint on total weight). The problem becomes a bounded knapSack with three types and small weights (only 1,2,3) but large n.\n\n However, note that the total weight m can be up to 300000, and we have three types. We can break down the total weight into:\n\n   Let a = number of weight-1 items, b = number of weight-2 items, c = number of weight-3 items.\n   Then a + 2b + 3c <= m.\n\n But note: the same weight might appear multiple times (but the input has distinct souvenirs). We have separate groups for each weight.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the souvenirs by weight (1,2,3). For each group, sort the costs in descending order and compute the prefix sums.\n\n 2. For each group, we also want to know the maximum total cost we can get by taking k items from that group (for k from 0 to the size of the group). Actually, we want the best k items.\n\n 3. Then we need to consider all possible combinations (a, b, c) such that a+2b+3c <= m. But note: a can be at most the count of type1, similarly for b and c.\n\n However, the counts for each type can be up to 100000, so iterating over a, b, c is not feasible.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the weights are only 1,2,3, we can think of the total weight as:\n\n   total_weight = a + 2b + 3c\n\n We can iterate over the number of type3 items (c) from 0 to min(floor(m/3), len(type3)), then for each c, we have remaining weight R = m - 3*c.\n\n Then, we have to distribute R between type1 and type2. Note that type1 items take 1 each and type2 take 2 each.\n\n So for fixed c, we have R = m - 3*c, and then we can use:\n\n   Let x be the number of type1 items (0<=x<=min(len(type1), R))\n   Then the number of type2 items would be at most floor((R - x)/2) but actually we can let y be from 0 to floor(R/2) and then x = R - 2*y, but wait: we are free to choose any x and y as long as x+y <= R? Actually, no: because we have two separate groups. We have to take the best items from type1 and type2 independently.\n\n Actually, we can break down the problem as:\n\n   We are going to use c items from type3, and then we have a remaining budget R = m - 3*c, which we will use for type1 and type2.\n\n   Now, we can use any amount of type1 and type2, but the total weight from type1 and type2 must be <= R.\n\n   However, we can use dynamic programming for the two types? But note: the two types are independent and we have many items (each type up to 100000). But note: we are only interested in the best k items from each type.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for type1 and type2 the best total cost for a given weight (which is the number of items from type1 and type2). However, since the weight for type1 is 1 and type2 is 2, we can do",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. The souvenirs are categorized by their weights (1, 2, or 3), which simplifies the problem compared to a general knapsack problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: First, we group the souvenirs by their weights (1, 2, or 3). For each group, we sort the items in descending order of their costs. This allows us to select the most valuable items first when forming combinations.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: For each group, we compute prefix sums of the sorted costs. This helps in quickly determining the total cost of selecting the top `k` items from any group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Combinations**: We consider all possible numbers of type-3 items (weight 3) that can be included. For each such number, we calculate the remaining weight available for type-1 and type-2 items.\n4. **Maximize Cost for Remaining Weight**: Using the prefix sums, we determine the maximum cost achievable for the remaining weight by combining items from type-1 and type-2 groups. This involves checking all feasible combinations of these items within the remaining weight limit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    index = 2\n    type1 = []\n    type2 = []\n    type3 = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        w = int(data[index])\n        c = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        if w == 1:\n            type1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            type2.append(c)\n        elif w == 3:\n            type3.append(c)\n            \n    type1.sort(reverse=True)\n    type2.sort(reverse=True)\n    type3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    len1 = len(type1)\n    len2 = len(type2)\n    len3 = len(type3)\n    \n    prefix1 = [0]*(len1+1)\n    for i in range(1, len1+1):\n        prefix1[i] = prefix1[i-1] + type1[i-1]\n        \n    prefix2 = [0]*(len2+1)\n    for i in range(1, len2+1):\n        prefix2[i] = prefix2[i-1] + type2[i-1]\n        \n    prefix3 = [0]*(len3+1)\n    for i in range(1, len3+1):\n        prefix3[i] = prefix3[i-1] + type3[i-1]\n        \n    best = 0\n    \n    max_c = min(len3, m // 3)\n    for c in range(0, max_c+1):\n        rem_weight = m - 3*c\n        if c > 0:\n            current_cost = prefix3[c]\n        else:\n            current_cost = 0\n            \n        if rem_weight < 0:\n            break\n            \n        x_max = min(len1, rem_weight)\n        y_max = min(len2, rem_weight // 2)\n        \n        max_rem_cost = 0\n        for x in range(0, x_max+1):\n            weight_used_by_x = x\n            rem_after_x = rem_weight - weight_used_by_x\n            y = min(y_max, rem_after_x // 2)\n            total_rem = prefix1[x] + prefix2[y]\n            if total_rem > max_rem_cost:\n                max_rem_cost = total_rem\n                \n        total_cost = current_cost + max_rem_cost\n        if total_cost > best:\n            best = total_cost\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of souvenirs `n` and the maximum weight capacity `m`.\n2. **Grouping Souvenirs**: Souvenirs are grouped by their weights (1, 2, or 3) into separate lists.\n3. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each group is sorted in descending order of cost, and prefix sums are computed to facilitate quick calculation of the total cost for any number of top-cost items.\n4. **Iterating Over Type-3 Items**: For each possible count of type-3 items, the remaining weight is calculated. The solution then checks all feasible combinations of type-1 and type-2 items within the remaining weight to maximize the total cost.\n5. **Output the Result**: The maximum total cost encountered during the iterations is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem using the constraints on item weights and leverages sorting and prefix sums to optimize the selection process, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
