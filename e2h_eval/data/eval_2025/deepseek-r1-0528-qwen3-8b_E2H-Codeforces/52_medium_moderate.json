Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a burned candle.\n   - We can use 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n Steps:\n   We start with 'a' candles. We burn them all (each gives 1 hour) and then we have 'a' burned candles.\n   Then, we can convert some burned candles into new ones: specifically, we can get floor(a / b) new candles and have a % b burned candles left from the initial burning.\n\n   However, note that the new candles can be burned as well, and then they too will become burned candles which can be recycled.\n\n   We can simulate the process until we don't have enough burned candles to make a new one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a loop:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   But note: we can think of it as:\n   While current_candles + burned >= b? Actually, we can use the burned candles to create more.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = a  # initial candles\n   leftover = 0\n\n   Then, while a >= b:\n      hours_from_this_round = a // b * 1   [but wait, actually we are burning all we have and then recycling]\n\n   Actually, let's model it step by step:\n\n   Step 1: Start with 'a' new candles. Burn them -> get 'a' burned candles and add 'a' hours.\n   Then, we can form 'a // b' new candles from the burned ones, and we have 'a % b' burned candles left.\n\n   Then we set a to the new candles (a // b) and add the leftover burned candles to the next cycle? Actually, we must carry over the leftovers.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But there is a better way: we can accumulate the total hours and update the number of candles we have.\n\n   total_hours += current  (because we burn all current candles, so we get current hours)\n   Then we can form new_candles = current + leftover (because we have the burned candles from this round plus any leftovers from previous rounds) but wait, in the first step we only had 'a' and no leftovers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n        total_hours += candles   # burn all candles\n        burned += candles        # these candles will become burned\n        candles = burned // b    # from the burned, we make new candles\n        burned = burned % b      # leftover burned candles\n\n   However, wait: in the above, after burning the current candles, we have 'burned' (which is the current candles plus the previous burned leftovers) and then we convert as many as possible to new candles.\n\n   Let me test with the example: a=4, b=2\n\n   Initially: candles=4, burned=0, total_hours=0.\n\n   First iteration:\n        total_hours += 4 -> 4\n        burned += 4 -> 4\n        candles = 4 // 2 = 2\n        burned = 4 % 2 = 0\n\n   Second iteration:\n        total_hours += 2 -> 6\n        burned += 2 -> 2\n        candles = 2 // 2 = 1\n        burned = 2 % 2 = 0\n\n   Third iteration:\n        total_hours += 1 -> 7\n        burned += 1 -> 1\n        candles = 1 // 2 = 0\n        burned = 1 % 2 = 1\n\n   Then the loop ends because candles becomes 0.\n\n   This gives 7, which matches the sample.\n\n   But wait, in the second iteration we used the burned candles from the first iteration (which were 4) and then we added the new candles (2) to the burned count for the next cycle? Actually, the above code does:\n\n        burned is updated by adding the current candles (which are the ones we just burned). Then we use all the burned (from previous cycles and this cycle) to make new candles.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: we light up new candles. The process is: we have a set of new candles (candles) and burned candles (burned). Then we can use the burned candles to make new ones.\n\n   The above simulation is correct.\n\n   But note: the above simulation might run into an infinite loop if we don't break when candles become zero? Actually, the condition is while candles > 0, but when candles becomes zero, we break.\n\n   However, we must note that we are using the entire burned set to make new candles. This is correct because we can use any burned candle regardless of when it was burned.\n\n   Let's test with the second example: Input \"6 3\"\n\n   a=6, b=3\n\n   Iteration1:\n        total_hours = 6\n        burned = 6\n        candles = 6//3 = 2\n        burned_leftover = 0\n\n   Iteration2:\n        total_hours = 8\n        burned = 2\n        candles = 2//3 = 0\n        burned_leftover = 2\n\n   Then stop. Output 8.\n\n   But wait, the example output is 8, so that's correct.\n\n   However, let me think: the process should be:\n\n        Burn 6 candles -> 6 hours, then from 6 burned we make 2 new candles (since 6/3=2).\n        Then burn those 2 candles -> 2 more hours, so total 8.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n        total_hours += candles\n        burned += candles\n        candles = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n\n   But wait, in the above, we are adding the current candles to the burned count, and then we are converting the entire burned set (which now includes the current candles) to new candles.\n\n   However, note: we just burned the candles, so they are now burned. Then we use the burned ones to make new ones.\n\n   But what happens to the burned candles that we haven't used? They are stored in 'burned' and then we take the leftover and carry over.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, we must note that the problem does not require breaking the process into separate steps for each candle, but the above loop does exactly that.\n\n   But let's consider edge cases.\n\n   Example: a=1, b=2\n        total_hours = 0, candles=1, burned=0\n        First iteration: \n            total_hours = 1\n            burned = 1\n            candles = 1//2 = 0\n            burned = 1 % 2 = 1\n        Then break. Output 1.\n\n   Example: a=1, b=1 -> but note b>=2 per input, so no.\n\n   Example: a=0 -> then no candles, output 0.\n\n   Since the input constraints say a>=1, we don't need to worry about 0.\n\n   But wait, the problem states: 1<=a<=1000, 2<=b<=1000.\n\n   We can write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: we are updating 'burned' by adding the current candles (which we are burning) and then using the entire burned set to make new candles. This is correct because we can use any burned candle to make a new one.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\". So we are using the total burned candles (from previous cycles and the current cycle) to make new ones.\n\n   The above algorithm is efficient because the number of iterations is logarithmic (base b) in a.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: we have to read from stdin.\n\n   Example input format: a single line with two integers.\n\n   So:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   a = int(data[0])\n   b = int(data[1])\n\n   Then run the simulation.\n\n   However, note: we are updating the burned variable. In the first iteration, we start with 0 burned, then we burn 'a' candles and add them to burned. Then we convert as many as possible.\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't specify the order, but the process is: we have a set of new candles and a set of burned candles. Then we burn the new candles, and then we use the burned candles (including the ones from the new candles) to make more.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        burned += current\n        current = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: a=4, b=2 -> total=7, correct.\n   Example 2: a=6, b=3 -> total=8, correct.\n\n   Another example: a=10, b=5\n        First: total=10, burned=10, current=10//5=2, burned=10%5=0 -> then total=12 (10+2), then burned=2, current=0 -> total=12.\n\n   Process: \n        Burn 10 -> 10 hours, then from 10 burned, we make 2 new candles. Then burn the 2 -> 2 hours. Total 12.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we have multiple cycles? For example, a=11, b=5\n        First: total=11, burned=11, current=11//5=2, burned=11%5=1 -> total=11\n        Then: total += 2 -> 13, burned = 1 (leftover) + 2 = 3, current=3//5=0 -> done. Total 13.\n\n   Process: \n        Burn 11 -> 11 hours, then from 11 burned, we make 2 new candles and leave 1 burned.\n        Then burn the 2 new candles -> 2 hours, and then we have 1 (from before) + 2 (just burned) = 3 burned, which is not enough for a new candle. So total 13.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: Vasily can use b went out candles to make a new one. So the leftover 1 is kept for the next cycle, even though we don't use it until we get more.\n\n   The simulation is correct.\n\n   But wait, in the first example with a=4, b=2, we ended with 1 burned candle at the end. But we don't use it because we don't have enough to form a new candle (we need 2). So the simulation stops.\n\n   Therefore, we output the total hours.\n\n   Let me check the example from the problem statement: \n        Input: ['4 2', '6 3'] -> Output: ['7', '8']\n\n   Our code produces 7 and 8.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well?\"\n\n   And our simulation uses all available candles (both initially and those made from burned ones) and burns them until we cannot form a new candle.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n   One more thing: efficiency. Since a and b are at most 1000, the while loop will run at most around log_b(a) times, which is very small (for a=1000, b=2: log2(1000) ~ 10). So it's efficient.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem input is one line with two integers.\n\n   Example input: \"4 2\"\n\n   We'll read that.\n\n   Code:\n\n   def main():\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            return\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n        total = 0\n        current = a\n        burned = 0\n        while current > 0:\n            total += current\n            burned += current\n            current = burned // b\n            burned = burned % b\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, we can also use a mathematical formula? Maybe, but the problem constraints are small so a loop is acceptable.\n\n   However, let's see if we can avoid a loop (though not necessary). \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total = a\n        current = a\n        while current >= b:\n            total += current // b\n            current = current // b + current % b\n\n   But wait, in this version, we are not accounting for the fact that we can use the leftover burned candles in the next cycle.\n\n   Actually, the above simulation in the loop is the same as:\n\n        total += current\n        burned += current\n        current = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n\n   But note: the total is the sum of all candles we ever lit (which is the initial and all recycled).\n\n   The alternative version without tracking burned separately:\n\n        total = a\n        current = a\n        while current >= b:\n            # From the current burned candles (which is at least current, but wait we are not tracking burned) we can't do that.\n\n   Actually, the above alternative version is not straightforward.\n\n   Let me stick with the original.\n\n   However, note: the original simulation does not require the condition `current >= b` because we can still have current < b but if we have leftover burned from previous cycles, we can continue? \n\n   Wait, no: in the simulation, we combine the burned from the current burning with the leftover from previous cycles. The condition in the while loop is `current > 0`, which is correct because even if current is 1 (and 1 < b) but if we have leftover burned from previous cycles, then the total burned might be >= b? \n\n   But wait, let's see: we update burned at the beginning of the loop by adding the current candles (which we are burning). Then we set current to burned // b and burned to burned % b.\n\n   However, in the first iteration, burned is 0, then we add current (a) so burned becomes a. Then we set current to a//b and burned to a % b.\n\n   In the next iteration, we add current (which is a//b) to burned (which is a % b). Then we set current to (a % b + a//b) // b and burned to (a % b + a//b) % b.\n\n   So the condition `current > 0` is sufficient.\n\n   But wait, what if we have burned from previous cycles and we are going to burn current (which might be 0) but we still have burned candles? \n\n   Actually, in the simulation, we burn the current candles (which are the ones we have at the beginning of the loop) and then we use the total burned (current + leftover) to make new candles.\n\n   The key is: we don't carry over the burned candles from one cycle to the next unless they are part of the current candles? \n\n   Actually, no: we do carry over. We have a variable 'burned' that accumulates the leftover from previous cycles. Then at the beginning of the next cycle, we add the current candles (which are the new candles we just created) to the burned count.\n\n   But wait, in the simulation:\n\n        We start with current = a (the initial candles) and burned = 0.\n\n        Then we burn the current candles (so we add them to burned) and then we make new candles from the total burned.\n\n        Then we set current to the number of new candles, and burned to the leftover.\n\n        Then we repeat.\n\n   So the variable 'burned' is the leftover from the previous cycles (if any) plus the current candles we are about to burn.\n\n   But note: the current candles we are burning in the next iteration are the ones we made from the burned candles of the previous iteration.\n\n   So the condition is: while we have current candles (which are the ones we can burn) OR while the total burned (which includes the leftover from previous cycles and the current candles) is enough to make more candles? \n\n   Actually, the while condition is on 'current' being positive. But note: the current candles are the ones we have to burn, and they are the result of the previous conversion. The variable 'burned' is the leftover burned candles from the previous cycles (not including the current candles we are about to burn).\n\n   However, the condition for continuing is that we have at least one candle to burn. And that candle might come from the recycled burned ones (which are stored in 'burned') and then we use them to create new ones.\n\n   But wait, in our simulation we are updating:\n\n        total += current\n        burned += current   -> so we are adding the current candles to the burned count, meaning we are burning them and they become burned.\n\n        Then we use the entire burned set to create new candles.\n\n   So the condition is: we break when current becomes 0. But note that current is set from the burned set of the previous iteration. \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read a and b, then:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        burned += current\n        current = burned // b\n        burned %= b\n\n   Then print(total)\n\n   But wait, in the assignment, we set burned to the remainder. And then the next current is the quotient (how many new candles we got). \n\n   However, note: the above code uses integer division and modulus.\n\n   We can also write:\n\n        new_candles = burned // b\n        current = new_candles\n        burned = burned % b + 0   # but wait, we don't add anything else because we are burning the current candles in the next iteration?\n\n   Actually, no: in the next iteration, we will burn the current candles (which are new_candles) and then we will add them to the burned count. But note that the burned count already has the leftover from the previous cycle (burned % b). However, in the next iteration, we do:\n\n        total += current   (which is new_candles)\n        burned += current   (so we add the new_candles to the burned count)\n\n   But wait, we already have the leftover from the previous cycle (burned % b) and then we are adding the new_candles (which are the ones we just burned) to the burned count. This is correct because we are accumulating the burned candles.\n\n   However, in the code above, we are storing the entire burned set (including the leftovers) in the variable 'burned'. Then we use that entire set to compute the next current.\n\n   But in the code, we are updating:\n\n        burned += current   (at the beginning of the loop)\n\n   Then we set:\n\n        current = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        total_burned_so_far = burned (which includes the leftovers from previous cycles and the current cycle's candles)\n        current_new = total_burned_so_far // b\n        leftover = total_burned_so_far % b\n\n   Then we set current to current_new and burned to leftover.\n\n   But note: the next time we enter the loop, we add the current_new (which is the candles we just got) to the burned count (which is the leftover from the previous cycle). \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, we can optimize the code by not having two variables (current and burned) but one variable for the current candles and then having a separate variable for the leftover burned candles. But the above is clear.\n\n   Let me run the example a=4, b=2 again with the code:\n\n   a=4, b=2\n\n   total=0, current=4, burned=0\n\n   Iteration1:\n        total = 4\n        burned = 4\n        current = 4//2 = 2\n        burned = 4 % 2 = 0\n\n   Iteration2:\n        total = 6\n        burned = 2\n        current = 2//2 = 1\n        burned = 2 % 2 = 0\n\n   Iteration3:\n        total = 7\n        burned = 1\n        current = 1//2 = 0\n        burned = 1 % 2 = 1\n\n   Then break.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But wait, in the third iteration, we set current to 0 and break. The leftover burned=1 is not used because we cannot form a new candle (need 2). So we stop.\n\n   The code is correct.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is two integers in a single line.\n\n   We assume the input is always valid.\n\n   Code:\n\n   def main():\n        data = input().split()\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n        total = 0\n        current = a\n        burned = 0\n        while current > 0:\n            total += current\n            burned += current\n            current = burned // b\n            burned = burned % b\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, I just realized: the variable 'burned' is updated twice: once by adding 'current' and then by setting to the modulus. However, we are using the same variable 'burned' for the entire process.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, let me change the code to use different variable names for clarity? Or keep it as is.\n\n   Since the problem is small, we can keep it.\n\n   But note: we are updating 'burned' in the same way: we add the current candles, then we set it to the remainder of the division by b.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let me run the example a=1, b=2 again:\n\n   a=1, b=2\n\n   total=0, current=1, burned=0\n\n   Iteration1:\n        total=1\n        burned=1\n        current=1//2=0\n        burned=1%2=1\n\n   Then break. Output 1.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Now, let me try a=10, b=3\n\n   Step-by-step:\n\n   Initial: total=0, current=10, burned=0\n\n   Iteration1:\n        total=10\n        burned=10\n        current=10//3=3\n        burned=10%3=1\n\n   Iteration2:\n        total=13\n        burned=1+3=4\n        current=4//3=1\n        burned=4%3=1\n\n   Iteration3:\n        total=14\n        burned=1+1=2\n        current=2//3=0\n        burned=2%3=2\n\n   Break. Total 14.\n\n   Check: \n        Burn 10 -> 10 hours, then from 10 burned, we make 3 new and have 1 leftover.\n        Burn 3 -> 3 hours (total 13), then from 3+1=4 burned, we make 1 new and have 1 leftover.\n        Burn 1 -> 1 hour (total 14), then from 1+1=2 burned, we cannot make a new candle.\n\n   So 14 is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is two integers.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, considering that he can recycle burned-out candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour and produces one burned-out candle. For every `b` burned-out candles, Vasily can create a new candle, which can then be burned again. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the recycling rate (`b`).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: \n   - **Burning Phase**: Each iteration of the loop represents burning all available candles. The total hours lit is incremented by the number of candles burned in that iteration.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: After burning, the total number of burned-out candles (including any leftovers from previous cycles) is used to create new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of the total burned-out candles by `b`, and the leftover burned-out candles are the remainder of this division.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are candles left to burn (i.e., the current number of candles is greater than zero). Once no more candles can be formed or burned, the loop exits, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles until no more candles can be created, ensuring optimal usage of all available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    current = a\n    burned = 0\n    while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        burned += current\n        current = burned // b\n        burned %= b\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to create a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total` keeps track of the total hours the room is lit. `current` holds the number of candles available to burn in each iteration, starting with `a`. `burned` accumulates the total burned-out candles from each burning phase.\n3. **Loop Execution**: \n   - **Burning**: In each iteration, the `current` number of candles is burned, adding their count to `total` hours.\n   - **Recycling**: The total burned-out candles (`burned`) are divided by `b` to determine how many new candles (`current`) can be made. The remainder (`burned % b`) represents the leftover burned-out candles that cannot form a new candle.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when `current` becomes zero, meaning no more candles can be burned. The total hours are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring all possible hours of illumination are accounted for. The loop's logarithmic nature ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
