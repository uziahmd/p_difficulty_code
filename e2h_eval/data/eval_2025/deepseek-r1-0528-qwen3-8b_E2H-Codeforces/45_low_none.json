There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a single integer n (from 2 to 10^18) and we need to compute the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, the total number of games is n-1. However, the condition restricts that two players can only play if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n We are to find the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the minimum number of players needed so that a player can have k wins (i.e., play k games) under the given rule.\n\n How do we build the tournament?\n\n Consider: \n   - The winner must win k games.\n   - The rule says that when the winner plays his k-th game, his opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k games? Actually, the rule is about the number of games already played.\n\n But note: the problem does not fix the entire grid, so we can arrange the matches arbitrarily as long as the rule holds.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can think of the tournament as having rounds, but the rule allows for a more flexible structure.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let k be the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Then, consider the structure of the tournament:\n\n   Game 1: Winner plays one game against someone (say A). Now winner has 1 game, A has 1 game (lost).\n   Game 2: Winner plays again against someone else (B). Now winner has 2 games. But the rule: the opponent (B) must have at most 2-1 = 1 difference from 1 (the winner's previous count). So B must have played 0, 1, or 2 games. Since B hasn't lost (because we are arranging arbitrarily to maximize the winner's games) then B must have played 0 or 1 game.\n\n However, note that we are trying to maximize the winner's games. We can design the tournament so that the winner gets as many games as possible.\n\n Let's try to build a bracket that allows the winner to play k games:\n\n   In the first game, the winner must play one opponent. Then, the next opponent must have either 0, 1, or 2 games? Actually, the rule says the number of games the opponent has played must differ by at most one from the winner's current number of games (which is 1). So the opponent must have 0 or 1 game.\n\n But wait, how did that opponent get 1 game? They must have won a game. So there must be a subtree that leads to that opponent.\n\n We can model the tournament as a complete binary tree? Not necessarily complete because the rule allows for a different structure.\n\n Actually, we can use a recurrence:\n\n   Let a_k be the minimum number of players required for a player to win k games.\n\n   Base case: \n        k = 0 -> 1 player (the winner without playing) but actually we start from 0 wins and then we have to set up the tournament.\n\n   For k=1: \n        The winner must defeat one player. That player must have played 0 or 1 game? But wait, the rule: the winner (with 0 games) can play an opponent with 0 or 1 game? Actually, at the first game, the winner has 0 games and the opponent must have 0 or 1 game. But the opponent hasn't played any game? Or maybe the opponent has 0 games? \n\n   However, note: the tournament is built from the ground up. The opponent must have won some games to get to the match. But in the first round, we can have two players: the winner and one opponent. So:\n\n        k=1: requires at least 2 players.\n\n   But wait: what if the opponent has 0 games? Then that opponent didn't win any game? Actually, the opponent must be eliminated at the first match. So the minimal setup for k=1 is 2 players.\n\n   Now for k=2:\n        The winner must win two games. The first opponent must have 0 or 1 game. To maximize the winner's games, we want to use as few players as possible.\n\n        Option 1: The first opponent has 0 games. Then the first opponent didn't win any game. Then the second opponent must have 0 or 1 game (since the winner now has 1 game). But wait, the rule for the second game: the winner has 1 game, so the opponent must have between 0 and 2 games. Actually, the rule says \"no more than one\", so 0,1, or 2.\n\n        However, if we want the winner to play two games, we can set up:\n\n          First game: winner vs A (A has 0 games) -> winner advances, now winner has ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if their previous game counts differ by no more than one. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and finding a pattern or mathematical formula to compute the answer efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that each player must win all their games to continue. The key constraint is that when a player wins a game, their opponent must have played between 0 and 2 fewer games than the winner's current game count. This constraint affects how the tournament bracket is constructed to maximize the winner's game count.\n2. **Insight**: The solution can be derived by recognizing that the problem resembles constructing a binary tree where each node represents a game, and the depth of the tree (number of games) is maximized under the given constraints. The minimal number of players required for a winner to play `k` games follows a specific recurrence relation.\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: The minimal number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games, `a(k)`, can be defined as:\n   - `a(0) = 1` (no games played)\n   - `a(1) = 2`\n   - For `k >= 2`, `a(k) = 2 * a(k-1) + a(k-2)`\n   However, since `n` can be as large as \\(10^{18}\\), we need an efficient way to compute the answer without directly calculating large values. Instead, we find the largest `k` such that `a(k)` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    k = 1\n    a0 = 1\n    a1 = 2\n    \n    while a1 <= n:\n        k += 1\n        next_val = 2 * a1 + a0\n        a0 = a1\n        a1 = next_val\n        \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If `n` is 2, the winner can play at most 1 game, so the output is 1.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: The loop calculates the minimal number of players required for increasing game counts (`k`) using the recurrence relation `a(k) = 2 * a(k-1) + a(k-2)`. The loop continues until the required players exceed `n`.\n4. **Result Determination**: The loop exits when the next `a(k)` exceeds `n`, and the result is `k - 1`, representing the maximum games the winner can play without exceeding the number of players.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the answer by leveraging the recurrence relation and avoiding direct computation for very large numbers, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
