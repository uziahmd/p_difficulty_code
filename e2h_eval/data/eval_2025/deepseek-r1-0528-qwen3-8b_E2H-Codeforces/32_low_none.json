    "thought": "\n We are going to do the following:\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the list of n integers.\n 3. Sort the array.\n 4. The instability after removing an element is defined by the new max minus the new min.\n    Note: Removing an element can only change the max or the min (or both) if the element being removed is the current max or min.\n\n Observation:\n Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1].\n\n Without removal, the instability is b[n-1] - b[0].\n But we are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Consider: \n   If we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, then the new min is still b[0] and the new max is still b[n-1].\n   So the instability remains the same.\n\n Therefore, we must consider removals that might improve the instability.\n\n Possibilities:\n   Option 1: Remove the smallest element (b[0]). Then the new array is from b[1] to b[n-1]. The instability becomes b[n-1] - b[1].\n   Option 2: Remove the largest element (b[n-1]). Then the new array is from b[0] to b[n-2]. The instability becomes b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n However, note that there might be duplicate values. But observe:\n\n   Example: [1, 3, 3, 7] -> sort to [1,3,3,7]\n     Removing the first 1: [3,3,7] -> instability = 7-3 = 4.\n     Removing the last 7: [1,3,3] -> instability = 3-1 = 2.\n\n   But wait, why isn't there a possibility of removing an occurrence of 3? \n   Actually, if we remove a 3, then the array becomes [1,3,7] (if we remove the first 3) or [1,3,7] (if we remove the second 3). \n   Then the instability is 7-1=6.\n\n   So the best option is to remove the largest element.\n\n   However, what if we have duplicates? For example, [1,1,2,3,4]?\n     Removing the smallest: [1,2,3,4] -> instability 3\n     Removing the largest: [1,1,2,3] -> instability 2\n     But also, what if we remove a middle element? \n        Removing 1 (the smallest): [1,2,3,4] -> 3\n        Removing 2: [1,1,3,4] -> 3\n        Removing 3: [1,1,2,4] -> 3\n        Removing 4: [1,1,2,3] -> 2\n\n   So the idea is: the removal of an element that is not at the ends doesn't help. \n\n   However, note: sometimes removing a duplicate minimum or maximum might not change the min or max.\n\n   Therefore, we only need to consider two candidates:\n      candidate1: remove the first element -> instability = b[n-1] - b[1]\n      candidate2: remove the last element -> instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the smallest but appears multiple times? Then the smallest element remains, so the min doesn't change. Similarly for the largest.\n\n   However, note: the problem says we remove exactly one element.\n\n   Actually, the above two candidates cover the cases where the min or max changes. But what if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, but the array has duplicates? \n\n   Example: [1,1,2,3,4] \n     Removing a 1 (the first one) leaves the smallest as 1, so the instability is 4-1=3.\n     Removing the last element (4) leaves the smallest as 1 and the largest as 3, so instability=3-1=2.\n\n   But what if we remove a non-min and non-max that is a duplicate? In [1,1,2,3,4], removing the second 1: the array becomes [1,2,3,4] -> instability 3.\n\n   So we are correct to only consider the two candidates: removing the first element and removing the last element.\n\n   However, note: sometimes the array has only two elements. Then removing either one leaves one element, so the instability is 0.\n\n   But wait, the problem states: \n        \"In the second example you can remove either 1 or 100000 then instability of the remaining array will be 100000 - 100000 = 0 and 1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can only potentially change the minimum or maximum (or both) if the removed element is the current minimum or maximum. Removing any other element does not affect the overall min or max, thus leaving the instability unchanged.\n2. **Intuition**: To find the minimal instability, we should consider two scenarios:\n   - Removing the smallest element (first element in the sorted array), which sets the new minimum to the next smallest element.\n   - Removing the largest element (last element in the sorted array), which sets the new maximum to the next largest element.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Calculate the instability for both scenarios (removing first or last element) and choose the smaller value between them.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 10^5. The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    arr.sort()\n    candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    result = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculations**: \n   - `candidate1` represents the instability when the smallest element is removed (new min is the second element).\n   - `candidate2` represents the instability when the largest element is removed (new max is the second last element).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value between `candidate1` and `candidate2` is printed as the result, which is the minimal possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting to simplify the identification of potential candidates for removal. The solution ensures optimal performance with a clear and concise implementation.",
