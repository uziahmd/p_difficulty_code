There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of l, r, x.\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might be overlapping and we need to satisfy all.\n\n However, note that the constraints are small (n, m up to 50) but the state space for heights is from 0 to h (which is up to 50). But we have 50 houses, so if we try to do DP with state as (house index, current height) then we have 50*51 states, but then we must check the restrictions for each state? That seems too heavy because we have multiple restrictions.\n\n Alternate idea: since the restrictions are given by ranges and require that the maximum in the range is <= x_i, we can think of the problem as assigning a height to each house (from 0 to h) such that for each restriction [l_i, r_i] the maximum height in that interval is <= x_i, and maximize the sum of squares.\n\n Note: The profit function is separable (each house's profit is its own square) but the constraints are global (over intervals).\n\n We can use an approach that considers the restrictions. Since m is at most 50, we can first combine the restrictions: if two restrictions overlap, then the effective maximum for a particular house might be constrained by multiple restrictions.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Preprocess the restrictions: for each house i (from 1 to n), we can compute the minimum allowed maximum value from all restrictions that cover this house? Actually, no: the restrictions are about entire intervals having maximum <= x_i. For a house j, we must ensure that for every restriction [l_i, r_i] that covers j, the height of house j must be <= x_i. But wait, actually: the condition is that the tallest house in the entire interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. This does not directly set an upper bound on each house j individually (unless the restriction is just [j,j]), but note: if a house j is the tallest in some interval [l_i, r_i] that includes j, then it must be <= x_i. However, if there are multiple restrictions, then house j must be <= the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j? Not exactly: consider two restrictions: one [1,3] with x=2 and another [2,3] with x=1. Then house 3 must be <=1 (because of the second restriction) and also house 3 must be <=2 (from the first) but the binding constraint is 1. Similarly, house 2: must be <=2 (from first) and <=1 (from second) -> 1. House 1: only the first restriction -> <=2.\n\n However, note: the condition for the first restriction [1,3] is that the maximum of houses 1,2,3 <=2. The second restriction [2,3] requires the maximum of houses 2,3 <=1. Therefore, the overall condition is that the maximum of houses 2 and 3 must be <=1, and house 1 can be at most 2, but note that if house 1 is 2 and houses 2,3 are 1, then the entire [1,3] has max(2,1,1)=2 which is okay. But house 1 is only constrained by the first restriction. However, house 2 and 3 must be <=1.\n\n So for each house j, we can define an upper bound U_j as the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j. But wait: what if a restriction doesn't cover j? Then we don't care. However, is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: if we set house j to a value <= U_j (the minimum x_i for which j is in [l_i, r_i]), then for any restriction [l_i, r_i] that covers j, we have house j <= x_i (because U_j is the minimum x_i for those covering j, and x_i >= U_j). But what about a restriction [l_i, r_i] that does not cover j? Then we don't constrain j directly, but the condition for that restriction is about the entire interval. However, note that if we set every house j to at most U_j, then for a restriction [l_i, r_i] we have that every house in that interval is <= U_j (where j runs over the interval) but wait, U_j for a house j in the interval [l_i, r_i] might be different from x_i. We must ensure that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. \n\n But note: we defined U_j as the minimum x_i among restrictions that cover j. However, a restriction [l_i, r_i] might have an x_i that is lower than some U_j for j in the interval? Actually, no: consider a house j in [l_i, r_i]. Then j is covered by the restriction [l_i, r_i] so U_j <= x_i. Therefore, if we set every house j to at most U_j, then the entire interval [l_i, r_i] will have values <= U_j <= x_i. Thus, the condition is satisfied.\n\n But wait: what if a house j is not covered by any restriction? Then U_j would be set to h (if we initialize with h) or maybe we don't have any restriction? Actually, the problem says the maximum height in each spot is between 0 and h, so without any restriction, we can go up to h. However, the input says \"There are n spots available ... in each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" and the restrictions are additional. So if there is no restriction covering a spot, then we can use up to h.\n\n However, note: the problem says the maximum height overall is h, so even if no restriction, the house cannot exceed h. But the above definition of U_j would ignore the base h. We must account for the base h.\n\n Let's define:\n   U_j = min{ h, min_{for each restriction i that covers j} {x_i} }\n\n Then, the condition for house j is that 0 <= a_j <= U_j.\n\n Now, the problem reduces to: assign to each house j a value a_j in [0, U_j] such that the conditions from the restrictions are automatically satisfied (by our definition of U_j) and maximize the sum of a_j^2.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning shows that setting each house j to at most U_j ensures that all restrictions are satisfied. But is that the only constraints? Yes, because the restrictions are only about the maximum in intervals and we've set each house to at most the minimum x_i that covers it (and the base h). \n\n But wait: is it possible that by setting a house j to less than U_j we could violate a restriction? No, because the condition for a restriction [l_i, r_i] is that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. Since every house j in the interval is <= U_j <= x_i (because j is in the interval and so the restriction i gives x_i and we take the minimum including x_i, so U_j <= x_i), then the entire interval is <= x_i.\n\n Therefore, the problem becomes: choose an integer a_j in [0, U_j] for each j from 1 to n, to maximize sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j^2.\n\n However, note: the above transformation is valid, but let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=3, h=3, m=3, restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n   Compute U_j for j=1: \n        restriction [1,1,1] -> x=1; other restrictions don't cover -> so U_1 = min(3, 1) = 1.\n   j=2: \n        restriction [2,2,3] -> x=3; no other -> U_2 = min(3,3)=3.\n   j=3:\n        restriction [3,3,2] -> x=2; no other -> U_3 = min(3,2)=2.\n\n   Then we want to maximize: a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2, with 0<=a1<=1, 0<=a2<=3, 0<=a3<=2.\n\n   The maximum for a1 is 1 (gives 1), for a2 is 3 (gives 9), for a3 is 2 (gives 4). Total 1+9+4=14 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: 4 10 2\n           2 3 8\n           3 4 7\n\n   We have two restrictions.\n\n   j=1: no restriction -> U_1 = min(10, ...) but no restriction so we take 10. Actually, how do we compute U_j? We start with h (10) and then take the min with all x_i from restrictions that cover j.\n\n   j=1: no restriction -> U_1 = 10.\n   j=2: covered by [2,3,8] -> U_2 = min(10,8)=8.\n   j=3: covered by [2,3,8] and [3,4,7] -> U_3 = min(10,8,7)=7.\n   j=4: covered by [3,4,7] -> U_4 = min(10,7)=7.\n\n   Then we want to maximize: a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2 + a4^2.\n\n   a1: choose 10 -> 100\n   a2: choose 8 -> 64\n   a3: choose 7 -> 49\n   a4: choose 7 -> 49\n\n   Sum = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> matches.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, h, m.\n   Step 2: Initialize an array U of length n (for houses 1-indexed, but we'll use 0-indexed) with h.\n   Step 3: For each restriction (l, r, x):\n            For j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed) we set U[j] = min(U[j], x)\n\n   But wait: is that correct? In the example, for house 3 (index2) we had two restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]. We did min(10,8,7)=7. However, if we do:\n\n        Initially: U = [10,10,10,10]\n        Restriction [2,3,8]: update indices 1 to 2: U[1]=min(10,8)=8, U[2]=min(10,8)=8.\n        Then restriction [3,4,7]: update indices 2 to 3: U[2]=min(8,7)=7, U[3]=min(10,7)=7.\n\n   This gives [10,8,7,7] which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the maximum height in a spot is h, and the restrictions can be applied multiple times. The above update is correct.\n\n   Step 4: For each house j, we choose the integer a_j in [0, U_j] that maximizes a_j^2.\n\n   Since the function f(a) = a^2 is increasing for a>=0, the best is to choose a_j = U_j (if U_j is an integer and non-negative, which it is) because (U_j)^2 is the maximum square we can get for that house.\n\n   Therefore, the total profit is the sum for j from 0 to n-1 of (U_j)^2.\n\n   BUT WAIT: is that always the case? Consider if we have two adjacent houses that are constrained by overlapping restrictions and we set one to the maximum, does that break a restriction? \n\n   Let me reexamine: our transformation sets U_j for each house j independently. Then we set each house to its maximum allowed value. However, note: the condition for a restriction [l_i, r_i] is that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. And we set each house j to at most the minimum x_i that covers it. Then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most the minimum x_i that appears in the restrictions covering any house in [l_i, r_i]. But note: we don't necessarily set the entire interval to the minimum x_i, but the condition is automatically satisfied because the maximum value in the interval cannot exceed the minimum x_i (since for each house j in the interval, we set it to at most the minimum x_i that covers j, and note that the restriction i (with x_i) covers the whole interval, so for each j in the interval, we have set j to at most x_i (because j is covered by the restriction i, and our U_j is the minimum of all x_i that cover j, so U_j <= x_i). Therefore, the maximum in the interval is <= x_i.\n\n   However, is it possible that by setting each house to its individual maximum we get a higher profit than necessary? Yes, and that is the goal: we want to maximize the profit.\n\n   But note: the function is separable and the constraints are independent per house (in the sense that the condition for the entire interval is satisfied by each house being at most the minimum x_i that covers it). Therefore, we can independently set each house to its maximum allowed value (U_j) and that satisfies all restrictions and gives the maximum profit.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is simply the sum for j=0 to n-1 of (U_j)^2.\n\n   However, wait: consider the following example with two houses and one restriction [1,2,1]. Then U_1 = 1, U_2=1, and we set both to 1. Profit = 1+1=2.\n\n   But what if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 1? Then profit=0+1=1, worse. Or house1=1, house2=0: same. So indeed, the maximum is achieved when each house is set to its maximum.\n\n   However, consider a more complex scenario: two houses and two restrictions: [1,2,1] and [1,2,2]. Then the first restriction requires the maximum in [1,2] <=1, and the second requires <=2. The first is more restrictive. Then U_1 = min( h, 1, 2 ) = 1, U_2 = 1. Then we set both to 1, profit=2.\n\n   What if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 1? Then the maximum in [1,2] is 1, which satisfies the first restriction (<=1) and the second (<=2). But profit=0+1=1, which is worse than 2.\n\n   Therefore, the greedy assignment (each house to its individual maximum) is optimal.\n\n   But wait, what if we have two houses and two restrictions: [1,2,2] and [1,2,1]? Then the first restriction allows up to 2, the second up to 1. Then U_1 = min(h,2,1)=1, U_2=1. Same result.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the base maximum is h. So if h is 3 and we have two restrictions: [1,2,2] and [1,2,1], then for house1: min(3,2,1)=1, for house2: 1. Then we set both to 1.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        # Initialize U with h for each of the n houses\n        U = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            # Update the segment [l-1:r] (0-indexed)\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < U[i]:\n                    U[i] = x\n\n        profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            profit += U[i] * U[i]\n\n        print(profit)\n\n   However, wait: the example input format is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   We are reading m restrictions. But note: the example input has two examples. The problem reads from stdin, so we should read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", then m lines. So we are reading one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two separate strings. But the problem says \"You are planning to build...\", meaning one instance.\n\n   But the sample output is two numbers: 14 and 262. Actually, the example input is provided as two separate test cases? Or is the example input a single string containing two test cases?\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. It says \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", and then m lines.\n\n   The example input is:\n\n        Input: ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is two separate inputs. But the problem says \"Print a single integer\", so if there are multiple test cases we would have to read until EOF. However, the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. But note the example input is given as two separate strings.\n\n   Looking at the example output: ['14', '262'].\n\n   So the problem expects two separate runs? Or one run with two test cases?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. But the sample input is provided as two separate test cases. However, the typical competitive programming problem may have multiple test cases, but here the constraints say n, h, m up to 50, and m up to 50, but the input format does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \"You are planning to build housing on a street.\" - singular. But the sample input has two examples.\n\n   The problem says: \"Each of the next m lines\" meaning one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two separate strings. This might be because the problem statement is showing two examples. In competitive programming, if there are multiple test cases, the input starts with the number of test cases.\n\n   But the problem does not mention multiple test cases. Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as two separate test cases. How do we know?\n\n   Let me look at the sample input: the first example input is \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\" and the second is \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\".\n\n   This is two separate test cases. Therefore, the problem might actually have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. The input format description does not say \"the first line is t\", so it is one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two test cases. This is confusing.\n\n   Clarification: the problem statement says:\n\n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m (1 ≤ n, h, m ≤ 50)\n\n   Then the next m lines...\n\n   So we are reading one test case.\n\n   But the sample output is two numbers. This suggests that the example input is two separate runs.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem setter intended to provide two examples. \n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" (singular). So we output one integer.\n\n   But the example input is two separate examples. \n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. Then the example input is given as two strings. This is just for illustration.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n   But wait: the sample input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   And the expected output is:\n\n        ['14', '262']\n\n   This means the problem setter is providing two test cases. But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   However, note: the constraints say n, h, m up to 50, and the problem does not specify the number of test cases. \n\n   But the sample input format is: first line n, h, m, then m lines. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n   I suspect the example input is provided as two separate test cases for illustration. In many problems, they show multiple examples.\n\n   But the problem says \"Print a single integer\", meaning one integer per test case.\n\n   If we are to read multiple test cases, the input might look like:\n\n        t\n        n h m\n        ...\n\n   However, the problem does not say that.\n\n   Let's stick to the problem statement: it says the first line has n, h, m. So we read one test case.\n\n   But the example input is two test cases. This is a discrepancy.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competitive programming context, and the sample input is provided as two test cases, I must consider that the judge will provide multiple test cases? Or one?\n\n   The problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. Then the example input is two test cases. \n\n   Actually, looking at the example input: it is given as two separate strings. This is just for display. In reality, the input is one string containing two test cases? Or two separate inputs?\n\n   The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. Then they show two examples. \n\n   To be safe, we must clarify: the problem does not specify the number of test cases, but the constraints (n, h, m <=50) and the input format (first line n, h, m) implies one test case.\n\n   However, the example output is two integers. This is confusing.\n\n   Let me check the original problem link? But we don't have a link.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, but the constraints are small, we can assume that the input has one test case.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"m\" is the number of restrictions, and then m lines. So one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we output one integer.\n\n   However, the sample input provided in the example is two test cases. This is likely a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is two separate inputs. So if we run the program twice, we get two answers.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem setter intended to give two examples, and the code must handle one test case.\n\n   So we write the code for one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Print a single integer\", so we do.\n\n   Let me run the code on the first example:\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        U = [3,3,3] initially.\n        Process [1,1,1]: update index0 to min(3,1)=1 -> [1,3,3]\n        Process [2,2,3]: update index1 to min(3,3)=3 -> [1,3,3]\n        Process [3,3,2]: update index2 to min(3,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n\n        Then profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n   Second example:\n\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        restrictions: [2,3,8] -> update indices1 and2: [10,8,8,10] -> then [3,4,7]: update indices2 and3: [10,8,7,7]\n        profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   So the code is correct for the examples.\n\n   But wait: what if a house is constrained by multiple restrictions, but we update by taking the minimum? Yes, we do.\n\n   However, note: the above update is done sequentially. But if we have two restrictions [1,3,1] and [1,3,2], then:\n\n        Initially: [10,10,10] (for n=3, h=10)\n        First restriction [1,3,1]: update indices0,1,2: [1,1,1]\n        Second restriction [1,3,2]: update indices0,1,2: [min(1,2)=1, min(1,2)=1, min(1,2)=1] -> still [1,1,1]\n\n   This is correct because the first restriction is more restrictive.\n\n   But what if the restrictions are given in reverse order? \n\n        First: [1,3,2] -> [2,2,2]\n        Then: [1,3,1] -> [min(2,1)=1, min(2,1)=1, min(2,1)=1]\n\n   So the order of processing does not matter because we are taking the minimum.\n\n   Therefore, we can update in any order.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        U = [h] * n\n        for i in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < U[j]:\n                    U[j] = x\n\n        total = 0\n        for num in U:\n            total += num * num\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: what if a house is constrained by two restrictions with different x's? Our update takes the minimum, so that's correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the house cannot exceed h. Our initial value is h, and then we take the minimum with the x's. So if an x is greater than h, we would set U[j] to h (since h is the initial). But the problem states x_i in [0,h] (from the input: 0<=x_i<=h). So x_i is at most h, so we don't need to worry about x_i > h.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"0<=x_i<=h\", so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the example input has x_i=3 and h=3, so x_i can be equal to h. Then we set U[j] = min(3,3)=3, which is okay.\n\n   However, what if we have a restriction with x_i=4 and h=3? The problem states 0<=x_i<=h, so x_i cannot be 4 if h=3. So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        U = [h] * n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < U[j]:\n                    U[j] = x\n\n        total = 0\n        for num in U:\n            total += num * num\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait: the problem says the house can be built with height from 0 to h. We set each house to U_j (which is at most h) and that is the maximum value we can set to get the maximum profit. And we are allowed to set it to any integer in [0, U_j]. Since the square function is increasing, we choose the maximum.\n\n   However, consider: what if we set a house to a value less than U_j? Then the profit decreases. So we want the maximum.\n\n   Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n   But wait: there is a catch! \n\n   Consider two houses and two restrictions:\n\n        Restriction1: [1,2,2] -> meaning the entire two houses must have maximum <=2.\n        Restriction2: [1,1,1] and [2,2,1] -> then each house must be <=1.\n\n        Then U[0] = min(2,1)=1, U[1]=min(2,1)=1. Then we set both to 1, profit=2.\n\n        Now, if we set house1 to 2 and house2 to 1, then the entire interval [1,2] has maximum 2 (which is okay for the first restriction) but house1 is set to 2 which violates the second restriction (which requires house1<=1). \n\n        But wait, the second restriction is [1,1,1] and [2,2,1]. So the first house must be <=1 and the second house must be <=1. Therefore, the first restriction [1,2,2] is automatically satisfied because the maximum in [1,2] is 1<=2.\n\n        So the above code is correct.\n\n   Another catch: what if the restrictions are inconsistent? \n\n        Example: n=1, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [1,1,5] and [1,1,3]. Then the house must be <=5 and <=3 -> so <=3. Then we set it to 3, profit=9.\n\n        The code: \n            U[0] = 10\n            First restriction: set to 5\n            Second restriction: set to min(5,3)=3.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify that the restrictions are consistent. But our method of taking the minimum x_i (which is the most restrictive) ensures that we satisfy all restrictions.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        U = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < U[i]:\n                    U[i] = x\n\n        total = 0\n        for a in U:\n            total += a * a\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait: the problem says the house can be built with height between 0 and h. Our U[i] is at most h, and we set the house to U[i] (which is an integer between 0 and h). This is valid.\n\n   However, what if the minimum x_i is negative? The problem says x_i>=0, so no.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the maximum height is h, and we set the house to U[i] which is <= h. So we are within the allowed range.\n\n   But note: what if a house is constrained to be <=0? Then we set it to 0, which is the only possibility. Then the square is 0.\n\n   Example: n=1, h=10, m=1, restriction [1,1,0]. Then U[0]=0, profit=0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        U = [3,3,3]\n        Process restriction1: [1,1,1] -> update index0 to min(3,1)=1 -> [1,3,3]\n        Process restriction2: [2,2,3] -> update index1 to min(3,3)=3 -> [1,3,3]\n        Process restriction3: [3,3,2] -> update index2 to min(3,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n\n        Profit = 1^2+3^2+2^2 = 1+9+4=14 -> correct.\n\n   Example2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        U = [10,10,10,10]\n        First restriction: [2,3,8] -> update indices1 and2: [10,8,8,10]\n        Second restriction: [3,4,7] -> update indices2 and3: [10,8,7,7]\n\n        Profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the restrictions are given by [l_i, r_i] inclusive. Our update uses inclusive range.\n\n   We are using for j in range(l-1, r): which is from l-1 to r-1 (because range in Python is [start, end) and we want to include r-1). \n\n   But wait: the restriction [l_i, r_i] covers houses from l_i to r_i. In 0-indexed, that is from l_i-1 to r_i-1. So we should update from l_i-1 to r_i-1 (inclusive). \n\n   The range function in Python: range(start, stop) goes from start to stop-1.\n\n   So to update from l_i-1 to r_i-1 (inclusive), we set the stop to r_i (so that the last index is r_i-1).\n\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n   This updates indices from l-1 to r-1 (because the stop is exclusive). So that is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test with the example [1,1,1]: l=1, r=1, then j from 0 to 0 (exclusive of 1) -> only index0. Correct.\n\n   Example [2,3,8]: l=2, r=3 -> j from 1 to 2 (exclusive of 3) -> indices1 and 2. Correct.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        # Create an array U of n elements, each initialized to h.\n        U = [h] * n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            # Update the houses from index l-1 to r-1 (inclusive)\n            for idx in range(l-1, r):\n                if x_val < U[idx]:\n                    U[idx] = x_val\n\n        total_profit = 0\n        for height in U:\n            total_profit += height * height\n\n        print(total_profit)\n\n   However, note: the problem says the house can be built with height from 0 to h, and our method sets the house to the maximum allowed (which is the minimum x_i that covers it, or h if none). But what if the minimum x_i is negative? The problem states x_i>=0, so no.\n\n   We assume the input is as described.\n\n   We output the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem constraints say n, h, m up to 50. The above loops are O(m*n) which is 50*50=2500, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the code on the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n        Output: 14\n\n   Example2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n        Output: 262\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"There are n spots available on the street\", and the spots are labeled 1 to n. Our indexing is 0-indexed, which corresponds to house1 being index0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the house can be built with height from",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints specify that within certain ranges (defined by the restrictions), the tallest house must not exceed a specified height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction dictates that the maximum height in a specific range of spots must not exceed a given value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights, considering these constraints.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes it. This means for any house, the effective maximum height is the minimum of all the restriction values (x_i) that apply to it, or the global maximum height (h) if no restrictions apply.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Initialization**: Start with each house's height set to the global maximum (h).\n   - **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowable height for all houses within its range to the minimum of the current value and the restriction's height (x_i).\n   - **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, compute the profit by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating each house in its range. With n houses and m restrictions, the complexity is O(m*n), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nU = [h] * n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n    for idx in range(l-1, r):\n        if x_val < U[idx]:\n            U[idx] = x_val\n\ntotal_profit = sum(height * height for height in U)\nprint(total_profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The array `U` is initialized with the global maximum height `h` for each house.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the relevant houses in the specified range. The update ensures that each house's height does not exceed the most restrictive applicable restriction's height.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: After all restrictions are processed, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the final heights in the array `U`. This sum is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently incorporates all constraints to determine the optimal heights for maximum profit while ensuring compliance with the zoning restrictions. The solution leverages the observation that the most restrictive constraint for each house dictates its maximum allowable height, simplifying the problem to a straightforward computation after preprocessing the constraints.",
