He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The function for trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n But note: we are not directly solving for n given m, but rather for each m, we want to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros function Z(n) is non-decreasing. So for a fixed m, the n's that satisfy Z(n)=m must lie in a contiguous range (or possibly multiple ranges? Actually, no: because once you hit a multiple of 5, you get an extra zero, and then until the next multiple of 5, the count remains constant until the next power of 5 kicks in. But note: the function Z(n) increases only at multiples of 5, and by the exponent of 5 in the factorization. However, we are counting the total zeros, so if m is fixed, then:\n\n Let f(n) = Z(n). Then we are looking for n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: the same m might appear for a consecutive range of n. For example, for m=1, n from 5 to 9: \n   f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, then f(10)=2.\n\n Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is a contiguous interval [L, R] (if it exists). But note: sometimes there might be gaps? Actually, no: because the function f(n) is non-decreasing and it only increases when n is a multiple of 5, and then the increase is by the exponent of 5 at that n (which is at least 1). So if we have a value m, then there will be a minimal n (say L) such that f(L)=m, and then as long as we don't hit a number that causes f(n) to jump to m+1 or more, the zeros remain m. However, the next jump (when n is the next multiple of 5 that adds at least one zero) will break the sequence.\n\n But wait: what if m is very large? We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and then check the boundaries.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. But we need the exact n for which f(n)=m.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the number of n (k) and then the list of these n (in increasing order).\n\n But note: the set of n with exactly m zeros might not be contiguous? Actually, no. Because the function f(n) is non-decreasing and it only increases at certain points. So for a fixed m, the set of n is all integers from the smallest n0 such that f(n0)=m to the largest n1 such that f(n1)=m, and then we break when we hit a jump to m+1 or more.\n\n However, observe:\n\n   f(0)=0, f(1)=0, ... f(4)=0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, ... f(9)=1, f(10)=2, f(11)=2, ... f(14)=2, f(15)=3, etc.\n\n So for m=1, the n's are from 5 to 9 (inclusive). \n\n How to find the boundaries?\n\n Let L(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m? Actually, we want the smallest n such that f(n) = m, and then the largest n such that f(n) = m.\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   L(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n   But then we want the smallest n0 such that f(n0) >= m, then we check if f(n0)==m? Actually, we need to find the minimal n such that f(n) == m, and then the maximal n such that f(n) == m.\n\n But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing and jumps by more than one sometimes. For example, when n=25, f(24)=4, f(25)=6 (because 25 contributes two factors of 5). So for m=5, the minimal n is 20? Let's compute:\n\n   f(20)=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the product. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the problem reduces to counting the number of factors of 5 in \\( n! \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor \\). This formula counts the total number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. This is done using binary search over possible values of \\( n \\). Similarly, we find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **Checking Valid Range**: Once we have the lower bound \\( L \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes) and the upper bound \\( R \\) (largest \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes), all integers between \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (e.g., when \\( m \\) is very large), we should return an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    L = low\n    \n    high_bound = 5 * m + 4\n    while L <= high_bound:\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(L)\n        if zeros > m:\n            break\n        L += 1\n    else:\n        L -= 1\n    R = L - 1\n    \n    if R < L:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        k = R - L + 1\n        print(k)\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R + 1)]\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound (L)**: The binary search starts between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\) (a safe upper limit). It finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **Finding Upper Bound (R)**: After finding \\( L \\), we incrementally check higher values of \\( n \\) starting from \\( L \\) until the number of trailing zeroes exceeds \\( m \\). The value just before this exceeds \\( m \\) is \\( R \\).\n\n4. **Output**: If \\( R \\) is less than \\( L \\), it means no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition, and we print 0. Otherwise, we print the count of valid \\( n \\) values and the list of these values in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search and incremental checks, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
