    "thought": "\n We are given an integer n and then a list of n integers.\n We are to remove exactly one element so that the instability (max-min) is minimized.\n\n Observation:\n The instability of the entire array is max(a) - min(a). However, by removing one element we can potentially:\n   - Remove the current minimum, then the new min might be the next smallest.\n   - Remove the current maximum, then the new max might be the next largest.\n\n But note: there could be multiple occurrences of min and max. So when we remove one occurrence, if there are duplicates, \n the min or max might still be present.\n\n However, note that the instability of the remaining array is determined by the overall min and max of the remaining elements.\n\n Let:\n   original_min = min(a)\n   original_max = max(a)\n\n If we remove an element, the new min will be at least original_min (unless we remove the only occurrence of original_min) and the new max will be at most original_max (unless we remove the only occurrence of original_max).\n\n We can consider two main cases:\n\n 1. Removing the original_min: Then the new min is the next smallest number (if there are multiple original_min, then the new min is still original_min because there's another one? Actually no: if we remove one occurrence, then the new min is the smallest number that remains. So if there are duplicates, then after removal the min may stay the same if there's another original_min. Similarly for the max.\n\n Actually, we cannot simply assume that removing the min will make the min the second smallest. We have to consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove one occurrence of the original_min. Then the new min is:\n   new_min1 = the smallest value in the array if we remove one occurrence of original_min?\n   Actually, we can compute:\n      candidate1 = (if we remove one occurrence of original_min, then the new min is the next smallest value that is >= original_min, but note: the array might have duplicates)\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the sorted array and the frequency of each number.\n\n However, note that the problem size is up to 10^5, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Sort the array. Then the original_min is the first element and original_max is the last.\n\n Consider: \n   Removing the i-th element (from the sorted array) and then the instability is (last element - first element) but wait, we remove one element so the first and last might change?\n\n Actually, in the sorted array, the instability of the entire array (without removal) is a[-1] - a[0].\n\n When we remove an element, we can consider:\n\n   Case 1: Remove an element that is not the first or last. Then the min is still a[0] and the max is still a[-1], so instability remains a[-1]-a[0].\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the current min? Then the new min becomes a[1] (the next smallest) and the max remains a[-1] -> instability = a[-1] - a[1].\n   Similarly, if we remove the current max, then the new max becomes a[-2] and the min is a[0] -> instability = a[-2] - a[0].\n\n   What if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then both min and max remain, so the instability is unchanged.\n\n   However, what if the array has duplicate values? Then removing one occurrence of the min (if there are multiple) doesn't necessarily change the min. So we must account for duplicates.\n\n But note: the sorted array will have the same min until we remove all occurrences of the min.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Let b = sorted(a)\n\n   The instability when removing an element at index i (0-indexed) from the sorted array is:\n\n      If we remove an element that is the first occurrence of the minimum (and there is only one occurrence of the minimum) then the new min is b[1] (if exists) and the max is still b[-1]. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the last occurrence of the maximum, then the new max is b[-2].\n\n   However, if there are duplicates, then:\n\n      Example: [1, 1, 3, 7] \n        Removing one of the 1's: the new min is still 1 (because there's another 1) and the max is 7 -> instability 6.\n\n      But wait, let's compute:\n\n        Original: [1,1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n        Removing the first 1: [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n        Removing the second 1: [1,3,7] -> same.\n\n      So in this case, removing a min element doesn't help.\n\n   We can generalize:\n\n      For any removal, the new min is the original min if there is at least one other element equal to the original min. Otherwise, it is the next smallest distinct value (which is the next element in the sorted array, but note: the next element might be greater than the original min).\n\n   Similarly for the max.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n      Let b = sorted(a)\n\n      The overall instability without removal is b[-1] - b[0].\n\n      We are going to consider removing one element. The resulting instability is:\n\n          instability_i = max(b[-1], b[i+1] if i < n-1 else -10**18) - min(b[0], b[i-1] if i > 0 else 10**18)\n\n      But wait, that is too simplistic because we are removing one element and the array has n-1 elements. Actually, the min and max of the remaining array are:\n\n          new_min = b[0] if the removed element is not the only occurrence of b[0]? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is b[0] and there are multiple b[0]'s, then the new min is still b[0]. \n\n      Actually, the new min is:\n          If we remove an element that is b[0] and there are k copies of b[0] (k>=1), then after removal there are k-1 copies. The new min is b[0] if k-1 >= 1, else if k==1 then the new min is the next smallest distinct value (which is b[1]).\n\n      Similarly for the max.\n\n   We can also think: the instability after removal is:\n\n        candidate_instability = max(b[-1], b[i]) - min(b[0], b[i])\n\n      But wait, that doesn't work because we are removing an element. We should consider the entire set without that element.\n\n   Actually, the instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array. \n\n   We can consider the following:\n\n        Let L = b[0] and R = b[-1]\n\n        The best candidate removals are those that either reduce the current max or the current min.\n\n        Specifically, consider:\n\n          candidate1: remove the current min -> then the new min is the next distinct value (if there is one) or remains the same (if there are duplicates). But note: we can remove one occurrence, so if there are duplicates, the min doesn't change. Therefore, the reduction in the min is only when we remove the last occurrence of the min.\n\n        Similarly for the max.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We want to minimize the instability.\n\n        We can consider two types of removals:\n\n          Type 1: Removing an element that is the global min (but note: if we remove a min that is duplicated, the min doesn't change, so the instability remains the same as the original, which is not helpful). So we are interested in removals that remove the only occurrence of the min (or the only occurrence of the max) to actually change the min or max.\n\n        However, note: sometimes removing an element that is not the min or max might also help? Actually, no: because the min and max are fixed by the entire array. Removing an element that is not the min or max does not change the min or max (unless the min or max appears only once and we remove an element that is part of the set but not the extreme? Actually no: the min and max are the extremes, and if we don't remove the min or max then the min and max remain).\n\n        Therefore, the only removals that can change the min are those that remove the min (and if there is only one min, then the min increases; if there are multiple, the min stays the same). Similarly for the max.\n\n        Thus, the candidate removals are:\n\n          candidate1: remove the only occurrence of the min (if exists) -> then the new min is the next smallest distinct value (which is b[1] if there was only one min, but if there are multiple mins, then we might have to remove more than one to change the min? Actually, we are only removing one element. So:\n\n          Actually, we can consider:\n\n            candidate1: remove the min (if the min appears only once, then the new min is b[1]; if the min appears multiple times, then the new min is still the min, so the instability remains the same as the original).\n\n          Similarly, candidate2: remove the max (if the max appears only once, then the new max is b[-2]; if multiple, then the new max is still the max, so instability remains the same).\n\n          candidate3: remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain, so the instability is the original (b[-1]-b[0]). This candidate is not better than the original? But we are allowed to remove any element, so we are comparing with the original? Actually, we are minimizing the instability, and the original instability is one possibility (if we remove an element that isn't the min or max) but note: the problem says \"exactly one element\", so we must remove one.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require to keep the same min and max. We are allowed to remove any element.\n\n        But observe: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain the same as the original. So the instability is the same as the original.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n          candidate1: if we remove one occurrence of the min (and there is only one min) then the instability becomes b[-1] - b[1]\n          candidate2: if we remove one occurrence of the max (and there is only one max) then the instability becomes b[-2] - b[0]\n          candidate3: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the instability is b[-1]-b[0] (which is the original)\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min but there are multiple? Then the instability remains b[-1]-b[0]. Similarly for the max.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. We are not forced to remove the min or the max. But if we remove an element that is the min and there are multiple, then the min remains the same. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max and there are multiple, the max remains the same.\n\n        Therefore, the only chance to reduce the instability is to remove the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max (or both if they are the same). But note: the min and max might be the same (then the array has all same numbers, then removing one element leaves the same min and max, so the instability is 0). \n\n        Actually, we can combine:\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Sort the array.\n\n          Step 2: The original instability is b[-1]-b[0].\n\n          Step 3: Consider:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = None\n            candidate_remove_max = None\n\n            If the first element appears only once (i.e., b[0] != b[1]), then removing the first element will set the new min to b[1]. Then the instability would be b[-1] - b[1].\n\n            Similarly, if the last element appears only once (i.e., b[-1] != b[-2]), then removing the last element sets the new max to b[-2], and the instability would be b[-2] - b[0].\n\n            Also, we must consider the possibility of removing an element that is not the min or the max? But note: if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the instability remains b[-1]-b[0]. \n\n          However, there is a catch: what if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, but the min and max are still the same? Then we get the same instability.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to remove any element. The minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum over:\n\n            candidate1: if we remove the only min (if exists) -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n            candidate2: if we remove the only max (if exists) -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n            candidate3: removing any other element -> instability = b[-1]-b[0]\n\n          However, we can also consider: maybe removing an element that is in the middle might allow us to use a different pair of min and max? Actually, no: the min and max of the entire array are fixed by the smallest and largest elements. Unless we remove the smallest or the largest, the min and max remain.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate1: (if we can remove the only min) then candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n            candidate2: (if we can remove the only max) then candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n            candidate3: the original instability (which is the same as if we remove an element that is not the min or max, but note: if we remove an element that is the min (but duplicated) then the instability remains the same, and similarly for max.\n\n          But wait, what if the array has only two elements? Then removing one element leaves one element, so the instability is 0.\n\n          Example: [1, 100000] -> removing either gives 0.\n\n          In our method:\n\n            n=2, sorted = [1, 100000]\n\n            candidate1: remove the only min (if the min is 1 and it appears only once) -> then instability = 100000 - 1 (which is 99999) but wait, no: if we remove the min (1) then the remaining array is [100000] -> instability = 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n\n          So we must consider: when we remove an element, the new min and max are the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n          How to compute for an arbitrary removal?\n\n          Actually, we can consider: the instability after removal of element x is:\n\n            new_min = min(b[0:i] + b[i+1:])   # but this is O(n) and we have 10^5 elements -> too slow.\n\n          We need an efficient way.\n\n          Alternate Insight:\n\n          The instability is determined by the remaining min and max. Since the array is sorted, we can consider:\n\n            Let left[i] = the minimum value in the array excluding the i-th element? Actually, we can precompute:\n\n            The min of the entire array without the i-th element is:\n                if b[i] == b[0] and the first occurrence is at i, then the new min is the next smallest? Actually, we can do:\n\n            Instead, note that the min of the remaining array is:\n                if we remove an element that is the first element (and if there are duplicates of the min, then the min remains the same) then the new min is the smallest value that is not removed. But the array is sorted.\n\n            We can break the array into two parts: the left part (including the first element) and the right part (including the last). But removal can be anywhere.\n\n          However, note: the min of the remaining array is the smallest element that is not removed. Since the array is sorted, the smallest element that is not removed is:\n\n            If we remove an element that is not the first element, then the smallest element is still b[0].\n            If we remove the first element and there is no duplicate of the first element, then the smallest element becomes b[1].\n\n          Similarly, the max of the remaining array is:\n\n            If we remove an element that is not the last element, then the largest element is still b[-1].\n            If we remove the last element and there is no duplicate of the last element, then the largest element becomes b[-2].\n\n          But wait, what if we remove an element that is the first element and there are duplicates? Then the smallest element is still b[0] (because there is another copy). Similarly, if we remove the last element and there are duplicates, the largest element is still b[-1].\n\n          Therefore, for a given removal at index i:\n\n            new_min = \n                if i == 0 and b[0] == b[1]: then the new_min is b[0] (because there's another copy of the min)\n                if i == 0 and b[0] != b[1]: then the new_min is b[1]\n\n                if i > 0 and b[i] == b[0]: then the new_min is b[0] (because we didn't remove the last occurrence of the min? Actually, we removed one occurrence, so if there were multiple, then the min remains. But note: we don't know the frequency. However, we can determine the new min by:\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            new_min = b[0] if (there exists at least one occurrence of b[0] in the array excluding the removed element) else the next smallest.\n\n          But how to check quickly?\n\n          Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            The min of the entire array without the element at i is:\n\n                if i == 0 and the frequency of b[0] is 1: then the min becomes b[1]\n                else if i == 0 and frequency of b[0] > 1: then the min remains b[0]\n                if i != 0 and b[i] == b[0] and the frequency of b[0] is 1? Actually, no: if we remove a non-first occurrence of the min, then the min remains unless we remove the last occurrence of the min.\n\n          Actually, we can precompute the frequency of the min and max.\n\n          But note: we are only concerned with the extremes. And the array is sorted.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let freq_min = the frequency of b[0] in the entire array.\n            Let freq_max = the frequency of b[-1] in the entire array.\n\n          Then:\n\n            For removal at index i:\n\n            new_min = \n                if we remove the first occurrence and the removed element is the min and freq_min==1: then the new min is b[1]\n                else: the min remains b[0]\n\n            Similarly, new_max = \n                if we remove the last occurrence and the removed element is the max and freq_max==1: then the new max is b[-2]\n                else: the max remains b[-1]\n\n          However, wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first element but is a min? Then the min remains. But if we remove an element that is the min and there are multiple, then the min remains.\n\n          But note: the min is the smallest element. Even if we remove an occurrence of the min that is not the first, the min remains. Similarly for the max.\n\n          Therefore, the new min and max are:\n\n            new_min = \n                if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min (i.e., the removed element is the min and freq_min==1) then the new_min is the next smallest distinct value (which is the smallest value that is greater than the original min). But note: the next smallest distinct value might not be contiguous? Actually, the array is sorted so the next distinct value is the first element that is greater than the min.\n\n          However, we can compute:\n\n            new_min = \n                if the removed element is the only min: then b[1] (because the array is sorted, and b[0] is the min, and if we remove the only min then the next smallest is b[1])\n                else: b[0]\n\n          Similarly, new_max = \n                if the removed element is the only max: then b[-2]\n                else: b[-1]\n\n          Then the instability after removal is: new_max - new_min.\n\n          But note: if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is b[-1]-b[0].\n\n          However, if we remove an element that is the min (but not the only min) then the min remains b[0] and the max remains b[-1] (unless the removed element is also the max? Actually, if the array has more than one distinct value, then min and max are distinct. But if the array is all the same, then removing one element: the min and max remain the same (so the instability is 0).\n\n          Actually, if the array is all the same, then:\n\n            b[0] == b[-1] and removing one element leaves an array of all the same, so the instability is 0.\n\n          But wait, the original instability is 0, and we are trying to minimize. However, the problem says \"exactly one element\", so we must remove one.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not require that the removal changes the min or max. The above formula for new_min and new_max works even for arrays with all same:\n\n            If we remove an element (any element) from an array of all same, then:\n\n              new_min = (if the removed element is the only occurrence of the min? Actually, the min is the same as the max, so the removed element is the min and the max. And the frequency of the min (which is the same as the max) is n. So if n>1, then removing one element leaves n-1 copies, so the min and max remain the same.\n\n            Then the instability is (new_max - new_min) = (same value) - (same value) = 0.\n\n          Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate_ans = []\n\n            We consider removal of every element? That would be O(n) and we have 10^5 elements, and for each removal we do O(1) if we precomputed the frequency of the min and max and the positions of min and max?\n\n          Alternatively, note that the only removals that can change the instability are those that remove the only min or the only max. Because if we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max, then the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability is the same as the original.\n\n          However, what if the array has two distinct values? Example: [1,2,2,3] -> min=1, max=3. \n            Removing the 1: then the min becomes 2, and the max is 3 -> instability 1.\n            Removing the 3: then the min is 1, and the max becomes 2 -> instability 1.\n            Removing a 2: then the min is 1 and the max is 3 -> instability 2 (original).\n\n          Therefore, the minimal instability is 1.\n\n          But note: the original instability is 3-1=2.\n\n          Now, what if we consider:\n\n            candidate1: remove the only min (if exists) -> instability = 3 - 2 = 1.\n            candidate2: remove the only max (if exists) -> instability = 2 - 1 = 1.\n            candidate3: remove any other -> 2.\n\n          So the answer is 1.\n\n          But how do we know the only min and only max?\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Sort the array.\n\n            Step 2: Let m = b[0], M = b[-1]\n\n            Step 3: Count the frequency of m and M.\n\n            Step 4: Consider two possibilities:\n\n                Possibility 1: Remove the first occurrence of m (if the first element is m and the frequency of m is 1) then the new_min is the next distinct value (which is the first element that is greater than m). But note: we don't know the next distinct value from the frequency? We can use the sorted array.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    candidate1 = None\n                    candidate2 = None\n\n                    # Removing the min (if it is the only occurrence) then the new array's min is the next smallest distinct value, which is the smallest value greater than m. But note: the array is sorted, so we can find the first element that is greater than m.\n\n                    However, we can also consider:\n\n                    candidate1: if the first element is m and the second element is greater than m (i.e., we have only one m at the beginning) then removing the first element (which is m) gives a new min of b[1] (which is the next distinct value). But what if the array is [1,1,2,3]? Then the first element is 1, but the second is 1, so we cannot remove the first element and change the min? Actually, no: the min remains 1. So we must check the frequency.\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                      If the frequency of m is 1, then removing the min (any occurrence, but note: the min might appear only at the beginning and the end? Actually, the array is sorted so all m's are consecutive at the beginning) then the new min is the next distinct value (which is the first element that is not m). Since the array is sorted, the next distinct value is the first element that is greater than m, which is b[len([x for x in b if x==m])] (but we don't need to do that, we can just use the sorted array and the fact that the next distinct value is the first element that is not m).\n\n                    Similarly, for the max.\n\n            However, note: the array is sorted, so:\n\n              The first element is m, and the last is M.\n\n              The next distinct value for the min (if we remove the only min) is the first element that is not m. Since the array is sorted, we can find the first index where the element is not m.\n\n            But we can do simpler:\n\n              candidate1 = float('inf')\n              candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n              # If we remove the only min (if exists) then the instability becomes (M) - (next_min)\n              # But note: we might not remove the min? Actually, we are considering removal of the min (if it is the only one) and removal of the max (if it is the only one). But there might be other removals that yield a lower instability? Actually, no: because the min and max are fixed by the entire array, and the only way to reduce the instability is to remove the only min or the only max.\n\n              However, what if we remove an element that is in the middle? Then the min and max remain the same. So the instability is the original.\n\n              Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n\n                  candidate1: if there is exactly one occurrence of the min (i.e., frequency(min)==1) then candidate1 = M - b[1]   [because the next distinct value after min is b[1] (since the array is sorted and the min is repeated consecutively at the beginning)]\n                  candidate2: if there is exactly one occurrence of the max (i.e., frequency(max)==1) then candidate2 = b[-2] - m\n\n                  candidate3: the original instability (if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, or if removing the min or max doesn't change the min or max then the instability is the original)\n\n              But wait, if we remove the only min, then the instability is (M) - (b[1]) and if we remove the only max, then the instability is (b[-2]) - (m). And if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, then the instability is M - m.\n\n              However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. The minimal instability is the minimum among candidate1, candidate2, and the original? Actually, no: because if we remove the min (even if there are duplicates) the instability doesn't change (so we don't consider that as a candidate for improvement). Similarly, if we remove the max (with duplicates) the instability doesn't change.\n\n              Therefore, the candidates we must consider are:\n\n                 candidate1 = (if the min appears exactly once) then M - b[1]\n                 candidate2 = (if the max appears exactly once) then b[-2] - m\n                 candidate3 = (if we remove an element that is not the min or the max) then M - m\n\n              But note: we are allowed to remove an element that is the min (even if duplicated) and then the instability remains M-m. Similarly for the max.\n\n              However, we want the minimum instability. So we can do:\n\n                 ans = M - m   # because at worst, we get the original.\n\n                 Then we consider:\n\n                 if the min appears exactly once:\n                     candidate = M - b[1]\n                     ans = min(ans, candidate)\n\n                 if the max appears exactly once:\n                     candidate = b[-2] - m\n                     ans = min(ans, candidate)\n\n              But wait, what if the array has only two elements? Then:\n\n                 Example: [1, 100000] -> sorted is [1,100000]\n\n                 Frequency of 1 is 1 -> candidate1: 100000 - 100000 (which is 0) -> but wait, after removing the 1, the array is [100000] -> instability 0.\n                 Frequency of 100000 is 1 -> candidate2: 1 - 1 (0) -> so the answer is 0.\n\n                 Another example: [1,2,3,4] (all distinct)\n\n                 Original: 3 (4-1)\n                 candidate1: remove 1 -> 4-2 = 2\n                 candidate2: remove 4 -> 3-1 = 2\n                 Then the answer is min(3,2,2) = 2.\n\n              However, is 2 the correct answer for [1,2,3,4]? \n\n                 We can remove any one element.\n\n                 Removing 1: [2,3,4] -> instability 2\n                 Removing 2: [1,3,4] -> instability 3\n                 Removing 3: [1,2,4] -> instability 3\n                 Removing 4: [1,2,3] -> instability 2\n\n                 So yes, the minimal instability is 2.\n\n              But note: we did not consider candidate3 (the original) because we are already including the original (ans = 3) and then we take min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n          However, wait: why do we consider candidate3 (the original) when we are only allowed to remove one element? Actually, we are always allowed to remove one element, and if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, we get the original instability. But we are also allowed to remove the min or the max (if duplicates exist) and then we get the original instability. So the worst-case is the original instability.\n\n          Therefore, we can set:\n\n            ans = original_instability   # which is M - m\n\n            Then, if the min occurs only once, then we can remove the min and get a new instability (M - b[1]), so we update ans to be the minimum of ans and (M - b[1]).\n            Similarly, if the max occurs only once, then we can remove the max and get a new instability (b[-2] - m), so we update ans to be the minimum of ans and (b[-2] - m).\n\n          However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4] and we remove the min (1) then the instability is 4-2=2. But note: the array [2,3,4] has min=2 and max=4. But wait, the next distinct value for the min is 2 (which is b[1]). \n\n          But what if the array is [1,1,2,3]? Then:\n\n            original_instability = 3-1 = 2.\n\n            Frequency of 1 is 2 (not 1) -> so we don't consider candidate1.\n            Frequency of 3 is 1 -> candidate2 = 2-1 = 1.\n\n            Then answer = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\n          This matches: [1,1,2,3] -> remove the 3: [1,1,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n\n          But wait, what if we remove a 1 from [1,1,2,3]? Then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2. So the minimal instability is 1 (by removing the 3).\n\n          However, note: the above candidate2 is computed as b[-2] (which is 2) minus m (which is 1) -> 1.\n\n          But wait, what if the array is [1,2,2,3]? Then:\n\n            original_instability = 3-1=2.\n\n            Frequency of 1 is 1 -> candidate1 = 3 - 2 = 1.\n            Frequency of 3 is 1 -> candidate2 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n            Then answer = min(2,1,1)=1.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: what if the array is [1,2,3,3]? Then:\n\n            original_instability = 3-1=2.\n\n            Frequency of 1 is 1 -> candidate1 = 3-2=1.\n            Frequency of 3 is 2 -> candidate2 is not considered.\n\n            Then answer=1.\n\n          However, what if we remove the 3 (one of them)? Then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2. But wait, we can remove the 1: [2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1.\n\n          So the candidate1 is valid.\n\n          But wait, in [1,2,3,3] the min is 1 and appears once, so candidate1 is 3-2=1.\n\n          But note: the next distinct value for the min is the next smallest distinct value, which is 2. However, in the sorted array, the next distinct value after the min (which is 1) is 2. But the array after removal of 1 is [2,3,3] -> the min is 2 and the max is 3, so instability 1.\n\n          However, what if the array is [1,1,2,3]? Then removal of 1 (the only occurrence? no, there are two) so we don't consider candidate1. But wait, the min is 1 and appears twice. Then we don't consider candidate1.\n\n          But in [1,1,2,3] the min is 1 and appears twice, so we don't consider candidate1. Then we consider candidate2 (max appears once) -> 2-1=1.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          However, note: what if the array has multiple distinct values and we remove an element that is not the min or the max? Then the instability is the original. But our candidate1 and candidate2 are only considered if we remove the min (only occurrence) or the max (only occurrence). \n\n          But note: there might be a scenario where removing an element that is not the min or the max can lead to a lower instability? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,4,5] -> all distinct. Then:\n\n            candidate1: remove 1 -> instability 5-2=3\n            candidate2: remove 5 -> instability 4-1=3\n            candidate3: remove any other -> 5-1=4 (worse)\n\n          So the minimal is 3.\n\n          But wait, is there a removal that yields less than 3? \n\n            Removing 1: [2,3,4,5] -> 3\n            Removing 2: [1,3,4,5] -> 4\n            Removing 3: [1,2,4,5] -> 4\n            Removing 4: [1,2,3,5] -> 4\n            Removing 5: [1,2,3,4] -> 3\n\n          So 3 is the minimal.\n\n          But note: the original instability is 4 (5-1). Our candidate1 and candidate2 are 3 and 3, so we set ans=min(4,3,3)=3.\n\n          So the algorithm:\n\n            Read n\n            Read list a of n integers\n\n            b = sorted(a)\n            original_instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n            # Count frequency of min and max\n            from collections import Counter\n            freq = Counter(a)\n            count_min = freq[b[0]]\n            count_max = freq[b[-1]]\n\n            ans = original_instability\n\n            # If the min appears only once, then we can remove it and the new min is b[1]\n            if count_min == 1:\n                # But note: if we remove the min, the new min is the next distinct value, which is the smallest value greater than the min. Since the array is sorted, the next distinct value is the first element that is not",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the only occurrence of the minimum element or the only occurrence of the maximum element in the array. If these elements have duplicates, removing one occurrence does not change the minimum or maximum values, so the instability remains the same as the original array. \n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Case 1**: If the minimum element appears only once, removing it reduces the minimum value to the next smallest distinct value in the array, potentially lowering the instability.\n   - **Case 2**: Similarly, if the maximum element appears only once, removing it reduces the maximum value to the next largest distinct value, which might also lower the instability.\n   - **Case 3**: If neither the minimum nor the maximum elements are unique, removing any element will not change the minimum or maximum values, so the instability remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Step 1**: Sort the array to easily identify the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - **Step 2**: Calculate the original instability as the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.\n   - **Step 3**: Check the frequency of the minimum and maximum elements. If they appear only once, compute the potential instability after their removal.\n   - **Step 4**: The answer is the minimum between the original instability and the computed instabilities from removing the unique minimum or maximum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    b = sorted(a)\n    original_instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n    \n    freq = Counter(a)\n    count_min = freq[b[0]]\n    count_max = freq[b[-1]]\n    \n    ans = original_instability\n    \n    if count_min == 1:\n        candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n        if candidate1 < ans:\n            ans = candidate1\n            \n    if count_max == 1:\n        candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n        if candidate2 < ans:\n            ans = candidate2\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n3. **Original Instability Calculation**: The initial instability is the difference between the last (maximum) and first (minimum) elements of the sorted array.\n4. **Frequency Check**: The frequency of the minimum and maximum elements is counted using a counter. If either appears only once, the potential instability after their removal is calculated.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value between the original instability and the computed instabilities from removing the unique minimum or maximum. This result is printed as the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the critical cases where removing an element can potentially reduce the instability, leveraging sorting and frequency counting for optimal performance.",
