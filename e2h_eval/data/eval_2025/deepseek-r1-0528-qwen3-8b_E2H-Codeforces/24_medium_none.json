She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r.\n\n The cursor starts at `pos` (which is between 1 and n) and there are n tabs.\n\n Operations allowed in one second:\n   - Move the cursor left: from current tab i to max(i-1, a), where a is the current minimum unclosed tab index.\n   - Move the cursor right: from current tab i to min(i+1, b), where b is the current maximum unclosed tab index.\n   - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (so set a = current_cursor_index, but note: the cursor is at i, then we close [a, i-1] so new a becomes i? Actually, after closing, the minimum unclosed tab becomes i. Similarly, closing the right sets the maximum unclosed tab to i.\n\n However, note that we are only allowed to close the entire left or right part. So if we have tabs from a to b, and we close the left, then the new segment becomes [i, b]. Similarly, closing the right gives [a, i].\n\n But note: initially, a=1 and b=n. Then as we close, a and b change.\n\n However, the problem is: we want to leave only [l, r]. So we must close all tabs not in [l, r]. This means we must close all tabs < l and all tabs > r.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can consider two main strategies:\n\n 1. First, we may need to move the cursor to the left boundary of the desired segment (l) and then close the left part (if there are any tabs left of l). Similarly, we may need to move to the right boundary (r) and close the right part.\n\n But note: we can also close one side without necessarily moving to the edge first? Actually, we can close the left part from a position that is >= l, and similarly for the right.\n\n However, the operation \"close all tabs to the left\" when the cursor is at i will close from a to i-1. So if we are at a position i >= l, then closing the left will remove tabs from a to i-1 (but we don't want to remove any tab in [l, r] so we must ensure that i>=l and that we don't close any tab above l? Actually, we are allowed to close the left even if we are at a position beyond l, but then we must not close beyond l. However, note that the operation doesn't know about the desired [l, r]; it just uses the current a and i. But our goal is to have [l, r] remain. So we must close all tabs outside [l, r]. \n\n How do we think?\n\n We must end up with tabs [l, r]. Therefore, we must close:\n   - All tabs from 1 to l-1 (left part)\n   - All tabs from r+1 to n (right part)\n\n The operations we can do:\n\n   Operation 1: Move left/right until the cursor is at a tab within [l, r] (or perhaps beyond? but note: if we close the left, we must be at a tab that is at least l, because if we are at a tab < l, then closing the left would close from a to i-1, but then we might close some part of [l, r]? Actually, no: if we are at i (with i < l), then closing the left would close from a to i-1, which is safe because i-1 is below l. However, we cannot use the left close operation to close the left part of [l, r] if we are at a tab less than l? Actually, we can, but then we would have closed too much: the operation doesn't care about l and r, it just closes from a to i-1. But note: we are allowed to close only the tabs that are outside [l, r]. However, the problem does not require that we don't close more than necessary? Actually, the goal is to leave only [l, r]. So if we are at a tab i and i < l, then we can close the left (which will close from the current a to i-1). Since i < l, then i-1 is <= i < l, so we are safe. But wait, what if there are tabs between a and l that haven't been closed? We are closing everything from a to i-1, and if i-1 >= l, then we would close from a to i-1 which includes [l, ...] part? No, because if i < l, then i-1 < l-1, so we are not closing any tab in [l, r] because l is greater than i-1. So yes, we can use a cursor at i (with i < l) to close the left part (from a to i-1) and that will remove the left part we need to remove.\n\n Similarly, if we are at i (with i > r) we can close the right part.\n\n However, we are allowed to do multiple operations and the boundaries a and b change.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n We have two regions to close: left (tabs 1 to l-1) and right (tabs r+1 to n).\n\n There are two ways to close the left: \n   Option A: Close the left from the current cursor if the cursor is at a position >= l (then we can close the left without affecting [l, r]).\n   Option B: Alternatively, we might move the cursor to the left (to a tab that is still in [l, r]) and then close the left? Actually, no: if we are at a tab >= l, then we can close the left and it won't touch [l, r] because the closure is from a to i-1 and i-1 is at least l-1, but note: if we are at i (>=l) then closing the left removes from a to i-1. Since we are in the middle of the process, a might be less than l. But we must eventually close the left part (from 1 to l-1). So if we are at a tab i (>=l) and we close the left, then we remove from a to i-1. But if a is already >= l, then we don't have to remove anything from the left? Actually, we have to remove from 1 to l-1. So we must have a set of operations that remove the left part and the right part.\n\n Actually, we can also do:\n\n   Step 1: Move the cursor to l (if we are not already there) and then close the left (which will close from the current a to l-1). But note: initially a=1, so after closing the left, the new a becomes l.\n\n   Step 2: Then move the cursor to r (if we are not at r) and then close the right (which will close from the current b (which is initially n) to r? Actually, after closing the left, the current b is still n? Then we move from l to r (if we are at l, then we move right to r) and then close the right (which will close from r+1 to n).\n\n But note: we might not need to do both moves if we can use the same movement to cover both.\n\n Another idea: we can consider doing the operations in any order, and we can close the left and/or the right from different positions.\n\n However, note that we can also close the left from a position that is not the very left (like l) and similarly for the right.\n\n But let's think about the minimal steps:\n\n There are two types of operations: moving and closing.\n\n We have two close operations: left and right.\n\n We must close the left part and the right part. Each close operation is done once (for the entire left or entire right).\n\n But note: we might not have to close each side separately if the cursor is already at an edge? Actually, the problem requires leaving [l, r]. So we must close the left part (if l>1) and the right part (if r<n). \n\n Let's define:\n\n   left_side_exists = (l > 1)\n   right_side_exists = (r < n)\n\n If both exist, we must do at least two close operations (one for left and one for right). But we can interleave moves and closes.\n\n However, we can also consider:\n\n   - If we are already in [l, r], then we can close the left and right from the same position? Not necessarily, because closing left requires being at a tab >= l, and closing right requires being at a tab <= r. And if we are at a tab in [l, r] then we can do:\n\n        Option 1: Close left and then close right.\n        Option 2: Close right and then close left.\n\n   But note: after closing one side, the boundaries change and the cursor remains at the same tab. Then we can close the other side from the same tab.\n\n   Example: Input \"6 3 2 4\" -> output 5.\n\n   Steps for example 1 (n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4):\n\n      Operation 1: Move left to 2 (1 move). Now cursor is at 2.\n      Operation 2: Close left (closing tabs 1). Now the segment is [2,6] and a=2, b=6.\n      Operation 3: Move right to 4 (from 2 to 3 to 4: 2 moves). Now cursor is at 4.\n      Operation 4: Close right (closing tabs 5,6). Now the segment is [2,4].\n\n      Total moves: 1 (left move) + 2 (right moves) + 2 (two close operations) = 5 seconds.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have:\n\n      Operation 1: Move left to 2 (1 second).\n      Operation 2: Close left (1 second) -> now segment [2,6]\n      Operation 3: Move right to 4 (2 seconds) -> total 4 moves so far, then Operation 4: Close right (1 second) -> total 5.\n\n   But note: we did two moves (left and then two rights) and two closes.\n\n   What if we do:\n\n      Operation 1: Close left from 3? Then we close [1,2] -> but wait, we don't want to close 2 because 2 is in [2,4]. So that would remove 2 and then we lose the desired segment.\n\n   Therefore, we must be careful: we cannot close the left if the cursor is at a tab that is in [l, r] and we are closing the left, because that would close the tab at l (if the cursor is exactly at l, then closing left closes [a, l-1] which does not include l). So from l, we can safely close the left (because l-1 is the last one to close on the left). Similarly, from r, we can safely close the right (because it closes [r+1, b]).\n\n   So the problem reduces to:\n\n   We must get the cursor to a tab in [l, r] (if it isn't already). Then, we can choose to close the left from a tab that is >= l (and we want to minimize the moves) and then close the right from a tab that is <= r.\n\n   However, note that after closing the left, the leftmost tab becomes l, so we can then move the cursor to the right to close the right, but we must be able to reach r from the current cursor (which is at the same place as before closing left? Actually, no: the cursor remains at its position during a close operation.\n\n   Let me restate:\n\n   After closing the left from a tab i, the new left boundary is i, so the segment becomes [i, b] (with b unchanged). Then we have to close the right, which requires being at a tab j <= r (so that we don't close any part of [l, r]). \n\n   Steps:\n\n   Case 1: The initial cursor is already in [l, r] (pos is between l and r inclusive). Then we can:\n\n        Option A: Close the left and then the right from the same starting position? Or we can move to l to close left, then move to r to close right.\n\n        But note: we can also close the left from the starting position if the starting position is >= l (which it is, because it's in [l, r]), then we can close left. Similarly, we can close the right from the starting position if the starting position is <= r (which it is). \n\n        However, if we close the left from the starting position, then the left boundary becomes the starting position, so we must be at a position >= l (which we are) and then we can close the left. Then we have to close the right from the same starting position? But after closing the left, the starting position is still the same, and we can then close the right if the current position is <= r (which it is). \n\n        So if we are already in [l, r], we can do:\n\n            Option 1: Close left (if there is a left to close) and then close right (if there is a right to close). This takes 2 seconds (the two close operations) plus any moves needed to get to the edges? Actually, no: we don't need to move because we are already at a tab from which we can close both sides (if we are at a tab that is both >=l and <=r, then we can close both). \n\n        But wait: what if we are in [l, r] but we don't want to close the left and right from the same tab? Actually, we can. However, sometimes we might need to move to minimize the total steps.\n\n        Actually, we have two independent actions: closing the left and closing the right. We can do:\n\n            If we have to close the left, then we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that the left closure doesn't remove any desired tab). Similarly, for the right we must be at a tab j <= r.\n\n        Since we are already in [l, r], we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Close left (if left exists) -> 1 second.\n            Step 2: Close right (if right exists) -> 1 second.\n\n        But wait, what if we are at a tab that is exactly l? Then closing left is safe. Then we can then move to r (if we aren't already) to close the right. However, if we are at l and we want to close the right, we have to move from l to r. The number of moves from l to r is (r - l) (each move is one second). Then close the right.\n\n        Alternatively, we can close the left from the same position and then close the right without moving? \n\n        Actually, after closing the left, the left boundary becomes l (the cursor was at l, so we closed [a, l-1] and now a=l). Then we can close the right from the same position (l) only if l <= r (which it is) and we haven't closed anything to the right? But note: we haven't closed the right, so the entire right part is still open. We can close the right from l (since l<=r) and that will close [l+1, n] (if any). \n\n        However, if we are at l, then we can close the right without moving. Similarly, if we are at r, we can close the left without moving? Actually, no: to close the left from r, we require r>=l (which it is) and then we close [a, r-1]. But if we are at r, then we can close the left without moving? Yes, because the condition is that the cursor is at r (which is >=l) so we can close the left.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that we do the closes from the same tab. We can do:\n\n            If we are at a tab i in [l, r]:\n                We can close the left (if l>1) from i (if i>=l) -> then the left is closed, and the new boundaries are [i, n] (if we didn't close the right yet).\n                Then we can close the right (if r<n) from i (if i<=r) -> then the right is closed.\n\n        However, if we close the left from i, then the left boundary becomes i (so if i was l, then we set a = i = l). Then we can then close the right from the same i (if i<=r) because the right closure requires the cursor to be <= r.\n\n        Therefore, we can do both closes from the same tab if we are in [l, r]. \n\n        Then the steps for the case when we are already in [l, r] and both sides exist:\n\n            Steps = (if left exists: 1 close, else 0) + (if right exists: 1 close, else 0)\n\n            But wait, we don't need to move at all.\n\n        However, what if the initial cursor is in [l, r] but we don't have to close both sides? For example, if l==1, then we don't need to close the left. Similarly, if r==n, then we don't need to close the right.\n\n        So:\n\n            If l == 1 and r == n: then we don't need to close anything, so 0 seconds.\n\n            If l == 1 and r < n: then we only need to close the right. We can do that from the current pos (if pos<=r) which it is (since pos is in [l, r] and l=1, so pos>=1 and <=r). Then we do 1 second.\n\n            Similarly, if l>1 and r==n: 1 second.\n\n        But wait, the example: \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n        In this example: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n        We are already at 3 (which is in [1,3]). We only need to close the right (because the left is 1, so we don't need to close the left). Then we can close the right from 3: 1 second.\n\n        Now, what if the initial cursor is not in [l, r]?\n\n        Example: n=6, pos=1, l=2, r=4.\n\n        Then we start at tab 1 (which is outside [2,4]). We must close the left? Actually, we don't have to close the left because l=2, so the left part is [1,1] (we need to close that). But wait, the problem says: leave only [l, r]. So we must close tab 1. However, note that the initial state has all tabs. We must close all tabs not in [2,4]. So we must close tab 1 and tabs 5,6.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Option 1: \n            Start at 1.\n            We can close the left? But if we close the left from 1, then we close [a, 0] -> but a is 1, so [1,0] is empty? Actually, the operation: closing the left from 1 would close [a, 0] -> but since 0 is less than 1, the operation probably doesn't close anything (because the segment [a, i-1] = [1,0] is empty). So we cannot close the left from 1.\n\n          Then we must move to the right to get into [2,4]. \n\n          How many moves? From 1 to 2: 1 move (right).\n\n          Then, from 2 (which is in [2,4]), we can close the left: because 2>=2, so we close [a,1] (which is [1,1]). Then we can close the right from 2? Actually, we can also close the right from 2: because 2<=4, so we close [3, n] but wait, we don't want to close 3,4? Actually, we want to leave [2,4]. So if we close the right from 2, we close [3, n] which includes 3 and 4? No, we close [3, n] (if n=6) then we remove 3,4,5,6 -> that leaves only 2, which is correct? Actually, no: we must leave [2,4]. So we cannot close 3 and 4.\n\n          Therefore, we must close the left from 2 (which closes [1,1]), and then we must close the right from a tab that is in [2,4] and that is at least 5? Actually, we need to close the right (tabs 5 and 6). To close the right, we must be at a tab i (<=4) and then close [i+1, n]. \n\n          So after closing the left, the segment is [2,6]. Then we must move from 2 to 4 (so 2 moves: 2->3->4) and then close the right (1 second). \n\n          Steps:\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Move right to 2: 1 second.\n            Close left: 1 second (now segment [2,6]).\n            Move right from 2 to 4: 2 seconds (because we are at 2, then 3, then 4).\n            Close right: 1 second.\n\n          Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5 seconds.\n\n          Alternatively, we could have:\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Move right to 4: 3 seconds (1->2->3->4).\n            Then close the right: but wait, if we close the right from 4, we close [5,6] (safe). Then we have to close the left: we are at 4, and 4>=2, so we can close [a,3] (which is [2,3] -> but wait, we don't want to close 2 and 3 because they are in [2,4]! \n\n          So we cannot do that.\n\n          Therefore, we must close the left first (from a tab >=2) and then the right (from a tab <=4). \n\n          But note: we can also close the left from 4? Actually, we can, because 4>=2. Then we close [2,3] (the left part from 2 to 3) but wait, that would remove 2 and 3, which are part of [2,4]! That is bad.\n\n          So we must close the left from a tab that is at least the left boundary (l=2) but we must not close the desired tabs. Therefore, we must close the left from a tab that is exactly l (or beyond)? Actually, the operation closes [a, i-1]. We want to close [1,1] and leave [2,4]. \n\n          To close [1,1], we must have i-1 >= 1, but we don't want to close any tab >=2. So we can set i=2 (then we close [a,1] and a is 1, so [1,1] is closed). \n\n          Therefore, we must be at 2 to close the left without affecting [2,4]. Similarly, to close the right (without affecting [2,4]), we must be at 4 (then we close [5,6]).\n\n          So the steps:\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Move to 2 (1 second).\n            Close left (1 second).\n            Move to 4 (2 seconds: 2->3->4).\n            Close right (1 second).\n\n          Total 5.\n\n        But note: we might be able to do:\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Move to 2 (1 second).\n            Close left (1 second) -> now the segment is [2,6] and a=2, b=6.\n            Now we are at 2. We need to close the right. We can move to 4 (2 seconds) and then close the right (1 second): total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\n        Alternatively, we can move from 1 to 4 first (3 seconds) and then close the right (1 second) and then move from 4 to 2 (2 seconds) and close the left (1 second): 3+1+2+1=7 -> worse.\n\n        Another alternative: \n\n            Start at 1.\n            Move to 2 (1s).\n            Then instead of closing the left, we move to 4 (2s) and then close the right (1s) and then we have to close the left (from 4: but wait, from 4 we can close the left? [a,3] -> but a is 1? Actually, no: we haven't closed the left so a is still 1. Then closing the left from 4: closes [1,3]. Then we remove 1,2,3 -> but we wanted to leave [2,4]. So that removes 2 and 3, which is bad.\n\n        Therefore, the correct strategy is to close the left first (from 2) and then the right (from 4).\n\n        How do we generalize?\n\n        We have two independent regions to close: left (from 1 to l-1) and right (from r+1 to n).\n\n        We must:\n\n            - For the left: we must have the cursor at a tab i such that i>=l (so that we don't close any desired tab) and then we close the left (which closes [a, i-1]). This operation is valid only if i>=l, and then the left boundary becomes i (so we set a=i). \n\n            - For the right: we must have the cursor at a tab j such that j<=r (so that we don't close any desired tab) and then we close the right (which closes [j+1, b]).\n\n        The challenge is to minimize the total seconds (moves + two close operations).\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let left_moves = 0\n            Let right_moves = 0\n\n            We have two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: Close the left first, then the right.\n\n            Possibility 2: Close the right first, then the left.\n\n            But note: the operations of closing one side change the boundaries, so the movement for the second close might be affected.\n\n        However, note: the left close operation sets the left boundary to the cursor's position, and the right close operation sets the right boundary to the cursor's position. But we don't need to worry about the boundaries for movement because the movement is defined by the current boundaries. But the problem says:\n\n            When moving, from current tab i, we can go to max(i-1, a) or min(i+1, b)\n\n        So after closing the left, the new a is the cursor's position (if we closed the left) and the new b remains the same (unless we close the right). Similarly, closing the right sets the new b to the cursor's position.\n\n        Therefore, the movement in the second part (for the second close) is constrained by the updated boundaries.\n\n        How to compute the minimal steps?\n\n        We can consider:\n\n            Let A = the set of tabs that are initially outside [l, r] (so [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]).\n\n            We must close these two intervals.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Option 1: Close the left first, then the right.\n\n                Step 1: Move the cursor from `pos` to a tab i (>=l) that is as close to `pos` as possible, but we must be able to close the left (so i>=l). Then close the left (1 second).\n\n                Step 2: Then move the cursor from i to a tab j (<=r) (again, the movement is constrained by the current boundaries: after step 1, the left boundary is i and the right boundary is still n (if we haven't closed the right)). Then close the right (1 second).\n\n            Option 2: Close the right first, then the left.\n\n                Step 1: Move the cursor from `pos` to a tab j (<=r) (as close as possible). Then close the right (1 second).\n\n                Step 2: Then move the cursor from j to a tab i (>=l) (constrained by the new boundaries: after step 1, the right boundary becomes j, so the available tabs are [1, j] (if we haven't closed the left). Then close the left (1 second).\n\n            Option 3: Maybe we can close one side from a tab that is not the edge? Actually, we must close the entire left (from 1 to l-1) and the entire right (from r+1 to n). The operation for closing the left from a tab i (>=l) will close the entire left (because the operation closes from the current a (which is 1 initially) to i-1, and i-1 is at least l-1, so if we set i=l, then we close [1, l-1] exactly). Similarly, for the right, setting i=r will close [r+1, n] exactly.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal way to close the left is to be at l (so we don't overshoot) and the minimal way to close the right is to be at r.\n\n        Then the problem becomes:\n\n            We need to get to l (for closing the left) and then to r (for closing the right) OR to r (for closing the right) and then to l (for closing the left).\n\n            But note: we might not need to go to the exact edges if we can use the same path to cover both? \n\n            Actually, we have to close the left from a tab >=l, and the minimal movement to get to a tab >=l is to go to l (if we are left of l, then we must go right until we hit l; if we are right of l, then we might be already in [l, r] or even beyond, but then we can close the left from there). Similarly for the right.\n\n        Let's break down the cases:\n\n            Case 1: The initial cursor is in [l, r]. Then:\n\n                If we need to close the left (l>1) and the right (r<n): then we can do two close operations (each 1 second) without moving -> total 2 seconds.\n\n                If we need to close only the left (l>1 and r==n): then 1 second.\n                If we need to close only the right (l==1 and r<n): then 1 second.\n                If we need to close none (l==1 and r==n): then 0 seconds.\n\n            Case 2: The initial cursor is to the left of l (pos < l). Then:\n\n                We must close the left (if l>1) and the right (if r<n). \n\n                Steps:\n\n                    Option 1: Go to l (distance = l - pos) and then close the left (1 second). Then go to r (distance = r - l) and then close the right (1 second). Total: (l-pos) + (r-l) + 2.\n\n                    Option 2: Maybe we can close the right first? But we are at pos (which is < l, and l<=r) so we are also < r (if r>l). Then we can move to r (distance = r-pos) and then close the right (1 second). Then move to l (distance = r-l, but wait: after closing the right, the right boundary becomes r, so the movement from r to l is (r-l) but note: we are at r, and we need to move left to l, so the distance is (r-l). Then close the left (1 second). Total: (r-pos) + (r-l) + 2.\n\n                But wait, after closing the right, the right boundary becomes r (so the available tabs are [1, r]), so to move from r to l is |r-l| (which is r-l, since l<=r). \n\n                However, which option is better?\n\n                    Option1: (l-pos) + (r-l) + 2 = (r-pos) + 2.\n                    Option2: (r-pos) + (r-l) + 2.\n\n                Since (r-pos) is the same in both, then Option1 is better because (r-pos) + 2 vs (r-pos) + (r-l) + 2, and (r-l) is nonnegative.\n\n                But wait, in Option1 we are moving from l to r, and the movement from l to r is (r-l). So total moves in Option1: (l-pos) + (r-l) = r-pos.\n\n                Then Option1: total seconds = (r-pos) + 2.\n\n                Option2: total seconds = (r-pos) + (r-l) + 2.\n\n                Since (r-pos) + (r-l) >= (r-pos) (because r-l>=0), Option1 is better.\n\n                However, we must consider: is Option1 valid? \n\n                In Option1, we close the left from l (which is valid) and then we move from l to r (which is allowed because the left boundary is now l and the right boundary is still n (until we close the right)). Then we close the right from r.\n\n                But note: the movement from l to r: the distance is (r-l). So the total seconds is (l-pos) [moving from pos to l] + (r-l) [moving from l to r] + 2 (the two closes) = (r-pos) + 2.\n\n                Alternatively, we might not have to go all the way to r? \n\n                Actually, to close the right, we must be at a tab <= r (which we are, because we are going to r) and we must close the entire right (from r+1 to n). So we must be at a tab <= r (and we are at r, which is <=r) so that's valid.\n\n                But what if we close the right from a tab that is less than r? Then we don't have to move all the way to r. However, to close the right, we must be at a tab i such that i<=r, and the operation will close [i+1, n]. We want to close [r+1, n] (and leave [l, r]). So if we are at i (<=r) then we close [i+1, n]. But we don't want to close [l, r] (so we require that i+1 > r? Actually, no: we require that i+1 > r so that [i+1, n] doesn't include any part of [l, r]. But wait, we want to leave [l, r] and remove [r+1, n]. \n\n                Actually, the condition for closing the right without affecting [l, r] is that the cursor is at i <= r, and then the operation will close [i+1, n]. We don't want to close [l, r] (which is [l, r]). Since i<=r, then i+1 might be <=r or >r. We only want to close from r+1 to n. Therefore, we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i>=r+1? \n\n                Wait, no: we are at i (<=r). Then we close [i+1, n]. We must not close any tab in [l, r]. The set [i+1, n] must be disjoint from [l, r]. Since [l, r] is [l, r], then we require that i+1 > r. But i<=r, so i+1<=r+1. \n\n                Therefore, to not close any part of [l, r], we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i>=r+1. But we are at i (<=r) so i>=r+1 is impossible. \n\n                This leads to a contradiction.\n\n                Let me clarify: \n\n                The operation \"close all tabs to the right\" closes the segment [i+1, b] (where b is the current maximum tab index). We want to leave [l, r] and remove [r+1, n]. \n\n                The operation will remove [i+1, b]. We don't want to remove [l, r]. Therefore, the removed part [i+1, b] must not intersect [l, r]. \n\n                Since [l, r] is contiguous, we require that either:\n\n                    Case A: i+1 > r   OR   Case B: b < l   (but initially b=n, and we haven't closed the left so l might be >1, but if we have closed the left then the left boundary changed but the right boundary remains until we close the right). \n\n                Actually, we are trying to close the right and we are in the middle of the process. \n\n                But note: we have already closed the left (so the current segment is [l, n]). Then we are at a tab i (in [l, n]). We want to close the right (from i+1 to n). We don't want to close [l, r] (which is part of [l, n]). \n\n                The operation will close [i+1, n]. We want to avoid closing [l, r]. Therefore, we require that [i+1, n] does not overlap [l, r]. \n\n                Since [l, r] is [l, r] and [i+1, n] is [i+1, n], they overlap if i+1 <= r. \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The cursor starts at a given position, and each second, Luba can either move the cursor left or right by one tab (within the current boundaries) or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Initial Setup**: The browser has `n` tabs, with the cursor initially at `pos`. The goal is to leave only tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive.\n   - **Operations**: Each operation (move left/right or close left/right) takes 1 second. Closing left/right from the cursor's position removes all tabs outside the desired segment without affecting the tabs within [l, r].\n   - **Key Insight**: The minimal steps involve moving the cursor to the edges of the desired segment (either `l` or `r`) and then performing the close operations. The order of operations (close left first or close right first) depends on the initial cursor position.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - If the cursor is already within [l, r], the solution involves closing the left and/or right segments if they exist, which takes 0 to 2 seconds.\n   - If the cursor is outside [l, r], the solution involves moving the cursor to the nearest edge of the segment (either `l` or `r`) and then performing the close operations. The movement cost is calculated based on the distance from the initial position to the target edge.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: Cursor is within [l, r]. The answer is 0 if no segments need closing; otherwise, it's 1 or 2 seconds for closing the left/right segments.\n   - **Case 2**: Cursor is to the left of `l`. The answer is the distance from `pos` to `r` plus 2 seconds (for closing left and right).\n   - **Case 3**: Cursor is to the right of `r`. The answer is the distance from `pos` to `l` plus 2 seconds.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if pos < l:\n        ans = (l - pos) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif pos > r:\n        ans = (pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    else:\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            ans = 0\n        elif l == 1:\n            ans = 1\n        elif r == n:\n            ans = 1\n        else:\n            ans = 2\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Case 1 (Cursor within [l, r])**:\n  - If the entire segment [1, n] is needed (`l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed (0 seconds).\n  - If only the left segment needs closing (`l == 1`), closing the right segment from the current position takes 1 second.\n  - If only the right segment needs closing (`r == n`), closing the left segment takes 1 second.\n  - If both segments need closing, two close operations (2 seconds) suffice.\n  \n- **Case 2 (Cursor left of `l`)**:\n  - Move the cursor to `l` (distance `l - pos`), then to `r` (distance `r - l`), and perform two close operations (total `l - pos + r - l + 2` seconds).\n\n- **Case 3 (Cursor right of `r`)**:\n  - Move the cursor to `r` (distance `pos - r`), then to `l` (distance `r - l`), and perform two close operations (total `pos - r + r - l + 2` seconds).\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal steps by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
