The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n (number of rounds), string A, and string B.\n The sequences A and B are cyclic. We can think of the game as having n rounds, and in round i (0-indexed) we use:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n We need to count the total number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\n Remember: \n   - If both choose the same, it's a draw.\n   - Otherwise, the rules: \n        Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n        Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n        Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n So, if we let:\n   For a round, if a == b -> 0 red spots for both.\n   Else:\n        If a wins against b: then Polycarpus gets a red spot (since Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses).\n        If b wins against a: then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n But note: \n   From Nikephoros' perspective: \n        He is using sequence A, and Polycarpus is using sequence B.\n\n   In a round:\n        If Nikephoros uses 'R' and Polycarpus uses 'S': then Nikephoros wins -> Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n        If Nikephoros uses 'R' and Polycarpus uses 'P': then Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n Actually, we can define the outcome by comparing the two:\n\n Let outcome(x, y) be:\n        x beats y if: \n            (x,y) is ('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')\n\n So, if (a, b) is one of these, then a wins -> so Polycarpus loses (so we add 1 to his red spots? No, wait: \n\n Correction: \n   When Nikephoros (using A) wins, then Polycarpus (using B) loses, so we add one red spot for Polycarpus.\n   When Polycarpus (using B) wins, then Nikephoros loses, so we add one red spot for Nikephoros.\n\n Therefore, for each round i (0-indexed):\n   a = A[i % m]\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   if a == b: nothing.\n   else if (a, b) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: then Polycarpus loses (so add 1 to his red spots)\n   else: then Nikephoros loses (add 1 to his red spots)\n\n However, note that n can be up to 2e9 and the sequences A and B have at most 1000 characters. We cannot simulate n rounds.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem:\n\n Let M = length of A, K = length of B.\n The entire game is periodic with period LCM(M, K). But note that we are only doing n rounds.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the rounds in terms of indices modulo M and modulo K.\n\n But note: the total number of rounds is n, so we can consider the rounds from 0 to n-1.\n\n Another idea: \n   We can compute the outcome for one full cycle (cycle being the least common multiple of M and K) but note that n might not be divisible by LCM(M,K). However, we can do:\n\n   Let L = LCM(M, K) = (M * K) / GCD(M, K). Then the pattern of outcomes repeats every L rounds.\n\n   But note: n can be up to 2e9 and L might be as large as M*K (if M and K are coprime) which is 1e6 (since M, K <= 1000, so maximum LCM is 1000*1000 = 1e6). Then we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the outcome for one full cycle (from round 0 to L-1) and store the counts for how many times each player loses in one cycle.\n\n   However, note that the outcome in round i depends on (i mod M, i mod K). The state (i mod M, i mod K) repeats every LCM(M, K) rounds.\n\n   So, we can precompute an array for one cycle (of length L) and then:\n\n        total_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        Then the total red spots for Nikephoros = total_cycles * (losses_Nikephoros_per_cycle) + (losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n        Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n   But note: the cycle length L can be up to 1e6 (which is acceptable because 1e6 is about 1 million, and we have two such arrays? Actually, we can simulate the entire cycle without too much memory because 1e6 is acceptable in Python if we do it once).\n\n   Steps:\n\n        M = len(A), K = len(B)\n        L = lcm(M, K)   [we can compute gcd first and then lcm = (M*K)//gcd(M,K)]\n\n        We will create an array `count` of length L, but actually we don't need to store all rounds, we can just store two counters: one for when Nikephoros loses and one for when Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over one cycle and for each round i (from 0 to L-1) we do:\n\n            a_index = i % M\n            b_index = i % K\n            a_char = A[a_index]\n            b_char = B[b_index]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # Then Polycarpus loses (so add to polycarpus_loss_count)\n                polycarpus_loss += 1\n            else:\n                nikephoros_loss += 1\n\n        Then, we know that the entire cycle has `n_cycles = total_cycles = n // L` cycles.\n\n        Then, we need to simulate the remaining `rem = n % L` rounds.\n\n        But wait: we have already computed the outcome for one cycle, but we don't have the breakdown for the first `rem` rounds. \n\n        We can precompute the outcomes for one cycle and then store the cumulative losses for the first j rounds (for j from 0 to L) or simply recompute the first `rem` rounds.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            total_nike_loss = (n_cycles * nike_loss_per_cycle) + (simulate_remaining_rounds(0, rem-1) for Nikephoros losses)\n            total_poly_loss = (n_cycles * poly_loss_per_cycle) + (simulate_remaining_rounds(0, rem-1) for Polycarpus losses)\n\n        But note: the remaining rounds are from round index `n_cycles * L` to `n-1`, which corresponds to the first `rem` rounds (from 0 to rem-1) in the cycle.\n\n        We can precompute two arrays for the entire cycle (for the first L rounds) and then use prefix sums.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n            nike_losses_cycle = []\n            poly_losses_cycle = []\n\n            Then, for i in range(L):\n                ... same as above ...\n\n            And then build two arrays: \n                nike_prefix[i] = number of losses for Nikephoros from round 0 to round i (inclusive)\n                poly_prefix[i] = number of losses for Polycarpus from round 0 to round i (inclusive)\n\n        Then for the remaining rounds, we take the first `rem` rounds and add:\n\n            nike_remaining = nike_prefix[rem-1]   [if rem>0, else 0]\n            poly_remaining = poly_prefix[rem-1]\n\n        But note: our simulation for the cycle was from 0 to L-1, so we can store the cumulative counts.\n\n        However, we can also avoid storing the entire prefix array by just simulating the first `rem` rounds again. Since `rem < L` and L is at most 1e6, and we are going to do this only once, it's acceptable.\n\n        But to avoid double computation, we can store the outcomes for the cycle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total_rounds = n\n            cycle_length = L = lcm(M, K)\n            num_cycles = total_rounds // cycle_length\n            rem = total_rounds % cycle_length\n\n            # Precompute the loss counts for one cycle (each round in the cycle)\n            nike_cycle_loss = 0\n            poly_cycle_loss = 0\n            for i in range(cycle_length):\n                a_char = A[i % M]\n                b_char = B[i % K]\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    poly_cycle_loss += 1\n                else:\n                    nike_cycle_loss += 1\n\n            # Now, we need to compute the losses in the remaining 'rem' rounds (from 0 to rem-1)\n            nike_rem_loss = 0\n            poly_rem_loss = 0\n            for i in range(rem):\n                a_char = A[i % M]\n                b_char = B[i % K]\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    poly_rem_loss += 1\n                else:\n                    nike_rem_loss += 1\n\n            total_nike = num_cycles * nike_cycle_loss + nike_rem_loss\n            total_poly = num_cycles * poly_cycle_loss + poly_rem_loss\n\n        Then output: str(total_nike) + \" \" + str(total_poly)\n\n   However, note: the cycle_length might be very large (up to 1000*1000 = 1e6) and we are iterating over 1e6 for the cycle and then up to 1e6 for the remainder. But note that the remainder is less than the cycle length, so worst-case we do 2 * 1e6 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But wait: what if the cycle_length is 0? Actually, M and K are at least 1, so cycle_length is at least 1.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the LCM calculation must be done correctly.\n\n   Steps for LCM:\n\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            if b == 0:\n                return a\n            return gcd(b, a % b)\n\n        Then, lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n   But note: if M or K is zero? The problem says m,k>=1.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Here, M=3, K=4 -> LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        We simulate 12 rounds for the cycle? But wait, we are only playing 7 rounds.\n\n        Then, num_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem = 7.\n\n        Then we simulate the first 7 rounds (i from 0 to 6) and count the losses.\n\n        Expected: \n            Round0: (R,R) -> draw -> no loss.\n            Round1: (P,S) -> Polycarpus loses -> poly_loss=1\n            Round2: (S,P) -> Nikephoros loses -> nike_loss=1\n            Round3: (R,P) -> Nikephoros loses -> nike_loss=2\n            Round4: (P,R) -> Polycarpus loses -> poly_loss=2\n            Round5: (S,S) -> draw -> no change\n            Round6: (R,P) -> Nikephoros loses -> nike_loss=3\n\n        So, total_nike = 3, total_poly = 2.\n\n        This matches the sample.\n\n   Another sample: \n        Input: \n            5\n            RRRRRRRR\n            R\n\n        Output: 0 0.\n\n        Why? Because the sequences are both all 'R'. Then every round is a draw.\n\n        So, we should get 0 and 0.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n   So we must read from stdin.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Read n (as integer)\n        Read A (string)\n        Read B (string)\n\n        M = len(A), K = len(B)\n\n        Compute gcd and then lcm.\n\n        Then, if n==0: then output \"0 0\"\n\n        But note: n>=1.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A_str)\n        k = len(B_str)\n\n        # Compute LCM(m, k)\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        g = gcd(m, k)\n        lcm_m_k = (m * k) // g\n\n        # But note: the cycle length is the LCM of the two lengths.\n\n        num_cycles = n // lcm_m_k\n        rem = n % lcm_m_k\n\n        # Count losses in one cycle (lcm_m_k rounds)\n        nike_cycle_loss = 0\n        poly_cycle_loss = 0\n\n        # But note: we are going to simulate one cycle, but we can also note that the state in round i is (i % m, i % k)\n        # We can iterate i from 0 to lcm_m_k-1.\n\n        # However, we can also use the fact that the cycle is periodic and we are repeating the entire cycle, but we are already computing the entire cycle.\n\n        # But note: the cycle length might be large (1e6) but that's acceptable.\n\n        for i in range(lcm_m_k):\n            a_char = A_str[i % m]\n            b_char = B_str[i % k]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) == ('R','S') or (a_char, b_char) == ('S','P') or (a_char, b_char) == ('P','R'):\n                poly_cycle_loss += 1\n            else:\n                nike_cycle_loss += 1\n\n        # Now, simulate the remaining rounds (from 0 to rem-1)\n        nike_rem_loss = 0\n        poly_rem_loss = 0\n        for i in range(rem):\n            a_char = A_str[i % m]\n            b_char = B_str[i % k]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) == ('R','S') or (a_char, b_char) == ('S','P') or (a_char, b_char) == ('P','R'):\n                poly_rem_loss += 1\n            else:\n                nike_rem_loss += 1\n\n        total_nike = num_cycles * nike_cycle_loss + nike_rem_loss\n        total_poly = num_cycles * poly_cycle_loss + poly_rem_loss\n\n        print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\n   However, note: the condition for the winning pairs can be simplified. We can write:\n\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n\n   This is the same.\n\n   But note: the condition for the else part is the other three possibilities: \n        (R,P), (P,R), (S,R)\n\n   Actually, the rules are defined by:\n\n        Rock (R) beats Scissors (S) -> so (R,S) is win for R (i.e., Polycarpus loses)\n        Scissors (S) beats Paper (P) -> (S,P) is win for S (Polycarpus loses)\n        Paper (P) beats Rock (R) -> (P,R) is win for P (Polycarpus loses)\n\n        The other three are:\n        (R,P): then R vs P -> P beats R? No, wait: R vs P: according to the rules, P beats R -> so that means Polycarpus wins (because he used P) so Nikephoros loses.\n        (P,R): same as above, but here Nikephoros used P and Polycarpus R -> P beats R? Yes, so Polycarpus wins? Wait, no: \n            In (P,R): \n                a_char = 'P', b_char = 'R'\n                According to the rule: Paper beats Rock -> so the winner is the one who showed Paper (Nikephoros). So Polycarpus loses? \n            But wait, let me check: \n                In the condition, we said: \n                    if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: then Polycarpus loses.\n\n            So (P,R) is included in the list, meaning Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Then what is the else part?\n\n        The else part includes:\n            (R,P): which is not in the list -> then we say Nikephoros loses.\n            (S,R): which is not in the list -> then we say Nikephoros loses.\n            (P,P): but that's a draw, so skipped.\n\n        Actually, the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] covers the cases where the first element (from A) beats the second (from B).\n\n        The other non-draw cases are the ones where the second element (from B) beats the first (from A). These are:\n            (R,P): because P beats R -> so B wins (Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses)\n            (P,R): wait, (P,R) is in the list? Yes, because 'P' beats 'R' is one of the rules. So (P,R) is in the list and Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Then the else part should be the other non-draw cases: (R,P) and (S,R) and (P,P) but (P,P) is draw and skipped.\n\n        Actually, the non-draw cases are:\n\n            (R,S): R beats S -> Polycarpus loses (included)\n            (R,P): R vs P -> P beats R -> so Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses (else)\n            (S,P): S beats P -> Polycarpus loses (included)\n            (S,R): S vs R -> R beats S -> so Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses (else)\n            (P,R): P beats R -> Polycarpus loses (included)\n            (P,S): P vs S -> S beats P -> Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses (else)\n\n        So the else part is: \n            (R,P), (S,R), (P,S)\n\n        We can check by:\n\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # Polycarpus loses\n            else:\n                # if it's a draw, we skip, but note: the condition above doesn't include draw. So we must check for draw first.\n\n        But wait, we did:\n\n            if a_char == b_char: skip\n            else: then check the list.\n\n        So the else part is only the non-draw and non-winning-by-A cases.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                ...\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # Polycarpus loses\n            else:\n                # Nikephoros loses\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   Let me test with (R,P): \n        a_char = 'R', b_char = 'P'\n        not equal -> then check if ('R','P') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no -> so else: Nikephoros loses.\n\n   (S,R): \n        ('S','R') -> not in the list -> else: Nikephoros loses.\n\n   (P,S): \n        ('P','S') -> not in the list -> else: Nikephoros loses.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the LCM calculation: \n\n        lcm_m_k = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n        But what if m or k is 0? The problem states m,k>=1, so safe.\n\n   But note: the example input \"5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR\" (with 8 R's and 1 R) -> \n        n=5, A='RRRRRRRR', B='R'\n\n        Cycle length = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n        Then, num_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, rem=5.\n\n        Then we simulate 5 rounds: \n            Each round: \n                a_char = 'R' (since 0%8=0 -> 'R', 1%8=1 -> 'R', ...)\n                b_char = 'R'\n\n            So every round is draw -> no loss.\n\n        Then output \"0 0\", which is correct.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n            1\n            R\n            S\n\n        Output: \n            n=1, m=1, k=1 -> LCM(1,1)=1.\n            Cycle: round0: (R,S) -> in [('R','S')] -> True -> Polycarpus loses.\n            Then, num_cycles=1//1=1, rem=0 -> so we only use the cycle and then no remainder.\n\n            total_nike = 1 * 0 (because in the cycle of 1 round, we had 0 losses for Nikephoros) + 0 = 0\n            total_poly = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1\n\n            Output: \"0 1\"\n\n        But wait, the sample input was 1 round: \n            Nikephoros: 'R', Polycarpus: 'S' -> Polycarpus loses, so Nikephoros gets 0, Polycarpus gets 1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   However, note: the above example is 1 round and we simulated the entire cycle (which is 1 round) and then no remainder.\n\n   But what if n=0? The problem says n>=1, so we don't handle n=0.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A_str)\n        k = len(B_str)\n\n        # If n==0, then output \"0 0\", but n>=1 per the problem.\n\n        # Compute gcd and then lcm\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            if b == 0:\n                return a\n            return gcd(b, a % b)\n\n        g = gcd(m, k)\n        lcm_m_k = (m * k) // g\n\n        num_cycles = n // lcm_m_k\n        rem = n % lcm_m_k\n\n        nike_cycle_loss = 0\n        poly_cycle_loss = 0\n\n        # Iterate for one cycle: from 0 to lcm_m_k-1\n        for i in range(lcm_m_k):\n            a_char = A_str[i % m]\n            b_char = B_str[i % k]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                poly_cycle_loss += 1\n            else:\n                nike_cycle_loss += 1\n\n        nike_rem_loss = 0\n        poly_rem_loss = 0\n        for i in range(rem):\n            a_char = A_str[i % m]\n            b_char = B_str[i % k]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                poly_rem_loss += 1\n            else:\n                nike_rem_loss += 1\n\n        total_nike = num_cycles * nike_cycle_loss + nike_rem_loss\n        total_poly = num_cycles * poly_cycle_loss + poly_rem_loss\n\n        print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        m=3, k=4 -> gcd(3,4)=1 -> lcm=12.\n        num_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem=7.\n\n        We simulate 7 rounds (from i=0 to 6):\n\n        i=0: (R,R) -> draw -> skip.\n        i=1: (P,S) -> ('P','S') -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> else -> Nikephoros loses? \n            But wait, let's check: \n                (P,S): Paper vs Scissors -> according to rules, Scissors beats Paper -> so Polycarpus wins? \n                But wait, in the condition: \n                    We check if (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n                    (P,S) is not there. \n                So we go to else -> which means we add to nike_cycle_loss? \n\n            But wait, the rule: \n                In (P,S): \n                    a_char = 'P' (from A), b_char = 'S' (from B)\n                    The rules: Paper (P) vs Scissors (S) -> Scissors beats Paper, so the loser is the one who played Paper? \n                    Actually, no: the one who plays Paper (A) loses to Scissors (B). So Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n            But the condition for Polycarpus losing is when (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n            (P,S) is not in that list, so we go to else and add to Nikephoros's loss.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example says:\n            Round1: (P,S) -> Polycarpus loses.\n\n        But according to our condition, we are adding to Nikephoros's loss. \n\n        There's a mistake in the condition.\n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n            Condition for Polycarpus losing: \n                We said: if (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] then Polycarpus loses.\n\n            In round1: \n                a_char = 'P' (from A) and b_char = 'S' (from B)\n                According to the rules, Polycarpus loses if his move beats Nikephoros's move?\n                But wait, the rule: \n                    Rock beats Scissors -> so if Polycarpus plays Rock and Nikephoros plays Scissors, then Polycarpus wins? No, wait:\n\n                Actually, the rule is symmetric. The outcome is determined by:\n\n                    Rock (R) beats Scissors (S) -> so if you play Rock and your opponent plays Scissors, you win.\n\n                In round1: \n                    Nikephoros plays 'P', Polycarpus plays 'S'.\n                    The rule: Scissors beats Paper -> so Polycarpus wins.\n\n                So we should be adding to Polycarpus's loss? Or wait, no: the problem says:\n\n                    \"the loser gets pinched\"\n\n                    So when Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros is the loser.\n\n                But wait, the problem says:\n\n                    \"If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing... \"\n\n                    Otherwise, the winner gives the loser a pinch.\n\n                So when Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros is the one getting pinched. So we add to Nikephoros's count.\n\n                But wait, the problem asks: \n                    \"Print two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\"\n\n                So we are counting the red spots on both.\n\n                In the example: \n                    Round1: Polycarpus wins -> so Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n                So the condition is: \n                    if (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros wins) -> so we add to Nikephoros's loss? \n                    But wait, no: the problem counts the red spots on the loser.\n\n                Actually, the condition we have is backwards.\n\n                Let me re-map:\n\n                    Outcome table:\n\n                    a_char (Nikephoros) | b_char (Polycarpus) | Winner | Loser\n                    R                   |   R                  |   Draw | \n                    R                   |   S                  |   R wins -> Loser: Polycarpus (so we add to Polycarpus's red spots)\n                    R                   |   P                  |   P wins -> Loser: Nikephoros\n                    S                   |   R                  |   R wins -> Loser: Nikephoros\n                    S                   |   S                  |   Draw\n                    S                   |   P                  |   S wins -> Loser: Polycarpus\n                    P                   |   R                  |   P wins -> Loser: Polycarpus\n                    P                   |   S                  |   S wins -> Loser: Nikephoros\n                    P                   |   P                  |   Draw\n\n                So the condition for Polycarpus being the loser is when:\n                    (a_char, b_char) is ('R','S') OR ('S','P') OR ('P','R')? \n                    Actually, from the table:\n                        Polycarpus is the loser in:\n                            (R,S): yes\n                            (S,P): yes\n                            (P,R): yes\n\n                But wait, in (R,S): \n                    a_char=R, b_char=S -> R wins, so Polycarpus loses -> so we add to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n                And in (S,P): \n                    a_char=S, b_char=P -> S wins, so Polycarpus loses -> add to his red spots.\n\n                And in (P,R): \n                    a_char=P, b_char=R -> P wins, so Polycarpus loses -> add to his red spots.\n\n                But then what about (R,P): \n                    a_char=R, b_char=P -> P wins, so Nikephoros loses -> add to his red spots.\n\n                So the condition in the code was:\n\n                    elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        poly_cycle_loss += 1   -> which is the red spots for Polycarpus\n\n                    else:\n                        nike_cycle_loss += 1\n\n                But wait, in the example round1: (P,S) -> \n                    a_char='P', b_char='S' -> this is (P,S) -> is it in the list? \n                    The list is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> (P,S) is not in the list.\n\n                Then we go to else and add to nike_cycle_loss. \n\n                But according to the table, (P,S) is a win for Polycarpus? Actually no: (P,S) is a win for the one who plays S (Polycarpus) because Scissors beats Paper.\n\n                But wait, the table says for (P,S): \n                    a_char='P', b_char='S': \n                        Paper vs Scissors -> Scissors beats Paper -> so the winner is the one who played Scissors (Polycarpus) and the loser is the one who played Paper (Nikephoros).\n\n                So we should add to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n                Therefore, the condition was correct.\n\n                Now, let me check round1 in the example:\n\n                    Round1: (P,S) -> (a_char, b_char) = ('P','S') -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so we add to Nikephoros's loss.\n\n                And the example says: \n                    P - S. Nikephoros loses.\n\n                So that is correct.\n\n                But wait, in the example output: \n                    \"Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\"\n\n                The rounds that cause losses for Polycarpus (second integer) are:\n\n                    Round1: (P,S) -> Nikephoros loses (so not Polycarpus) -> so that's one for Nikephoros.\n                    Round2: (S,P) -> Polycarpus loses (so one for Polycarpus)\n                    Round3: (R,P) -> Nikephoros loses (so two for Nikephoros)\n                    Round4: (P,R) -> Polycarpus loses (so two for Polycarpus)\n                    Round6: (R,P) -> Nikephoros loses (three for Nikephoros)\n\n                So indeed, Nikephoros has 3, Polycarpus has 2.\n\n                Therefore, the condition is correctly implemented.\n\n   However, note: the condition for Polycarpus losing (thus adding to his red spots) is when (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')].\n\n   But wait, in the example round2: (S,P) -> \n        a_char='S', b_char='P' -> ('S','P') is in the list -> so we add to poly_cycle_loss (Polycarpus's red spots).\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But note: the example round4: (R,P) -> \n        a_char='R', b_char='P' -> ('R','P') is not in the list -> so we add to nike_cycle_loss (Nikephoros's red spots).\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   One more: round6: (R,P) -> same as round4: adds to Nikephoros.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n   However, note: the example input \"7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\" produces:\n\n        Round0: (R,R) -> draw -> skip.\n        Round1: (P,S) -> else -> Nikephoros loses: count_nike=1\n        Round2: (S,P) -> in [('S','P')] -> Polycarpus loses: count_poly=1\n        Round3: (R,P) -> else -> Nikephoros loses: count_nike=2\n        Round4: (P,R) -> ('P','R') is in the list -> Polycarpus loses: count_poly=2\n        Round5: (S,S) -> draw -> skip.\n        Round6: (R,P) -> else -> Nikephoros loses: count_nike=3\n\n        So total_nike=3, total_poly=2.\n\n   The code is correct.\n\n   However, note that the example input is given as:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n   But wait, the second sample input is:\n\n        5\n        RRRRRRRR\n        R\n\n   And we already tested that.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input is:\n\n        The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.\n        The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters.\n\n   So we read the inputs accordingly.\n\n   Let me run the code with the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample1: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Output: 3 2\n\n   Sample2:\n        Input:\n            5\n            RRRRRRRR\n            R\n\n        Output: 0 0\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say n can be up to 2e9, and the cycle length LCM(m,k) can be up to 1e6 (which is acceptable because 1e6 is 10^6, which is acceptable in a for-loop in Python if we do it twice (cycle and remainder) and 1e6+1e6 is 2e6, which is acceptable).\n\n   But wait: what if m and k are both 1000? Then LCM(1000,1000)=1000, so the cycle length is 1000, which is even better.\n\n   Actually, the LCM of two numbers a and b is (a*b)//gcd(a,b). The maximum value of a*b is 1000*1000=1e6, so the LCM is at most 1e6.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A_str)\n        k = len(B_str)\n\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        g = gcd(m, k)\n        lcm_m",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a specified number of rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, following their respective cyclic sequences. The solution involves efficiently simulating the game without processing each round individually for large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played for `n` rounds, with each player using a cyclic sequence of moves. The outcome of each round depends on the current move in each player's sequence. The challenge is to count the total losses (red spots) for both players over `n` rounds without iterating through each round one by one, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. This periodicity allows us to compute the outcomes for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the remaining rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Calculation**: Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For one full cycle, simulate all rounds and count the losses for both players.\n   - **Remainder Handling**: For any remaining rounds after complete cycles, simulate those rounds separately.\n   - **Efficiency**: By focusing on the cycle and the remainder, the solution efficiently handles large `n` without excessive computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n        \n    g = gcd(m, k)\n    lcm_m_k = (m * k) // g\n    \n    num_cycles = n // lcm_m_k\n    rem = n % lcm_m_k\n    \n    nike_cycle_loss = 0\n    poly_cycle_loss = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_m_k):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            poly_cycle_loss += 1\n        else:\n            nike_cycle_loss += 1\n            \n    nike_rem_loss = 0\n    poly_rem_loss = 0\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            poly_rem_loss += 1\n        else:\n            nike_rem_loss += 1\n            \n    total_nike = num_cycles * nike_cycle_loss + nike_rem_loss\n    total_poly = num_cycles * poly_cycle_loss + poly_rem_loss\n    \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths is computed to determine the cycle length. This helps in identifying the repeating pattern of game outcomes.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: The code simulates one full cycle of rounds, counting how many times each player loses (i.e., receives a red spot). The simulation checks each round's outcome based on the current move in the sequences.\n4. **Remainder Handling**: After processing complete cycles, any remaining rounds are simulated separately to account for partial cycles.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total losses for both players are computed by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of complete cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n6. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
