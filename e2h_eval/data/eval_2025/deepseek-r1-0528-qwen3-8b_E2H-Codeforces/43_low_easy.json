He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S of length between 1 and 5000, consisting of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because A appended some 'b' and B is guaranteed to have at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n 2. The string must be split into three parts: \n    - First part: only 'a's (from A)\n    - Second part: only 'b's (appended by B)\n    - Third part: only 'c's (appended by C)\n\n However, note that the problem states:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - Then B appends some number of 'b's (so the entire string so far is all 'a's then all 'b's).\n   - Then C appends some number of 'c's (the count of 'c' is either equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' or both).\n\n But note: the example 'bbacc' is \"NO\". Why?\n   The example 'bbacc': \n     If we break it down, we see that there are two 'b's in the middle. However, note that the first part must be 'a's and then 'b's. \n     In 'bbacc', there is no 'a' at all? Actually, wait: the condition says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\". \n     But the example input does not necessarily have to be split by contiguous blocks? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string.\"\n\n So the string should be non-decreasing: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 'aabc' -> Output: 'YES'\n\n Let's break down 'aabc':\n   Count of 'a' = 2, 'b' = 1, 'c' = 1.\n   Condition for C: the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. \n        Here, number of 'c' is 1, which equals the number of 'b' (which is 1). So that satisfies.\n\n But what about the order? The problem says B appends 'b' to the end, and C appends 'c' to the end. So the string must be in the form: [some 'a's] [some 'b's] [some 'c's].\n\n However, note: the example 'bbacc' is given as NO. \n   'bbacc': \n        It has 'b's at the beginning and then an 'a'? That breaks the order.\n\n Therefore, the conditions are:\n   Condition 1: The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: [a's], [b's], [c's]. \n   Condition 2: There must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (so the second segment must exist, meaning at least one 'b') and the third segment (if any) is c's. \n   Condition 3: The number of 'c' must be either equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (or both).\n\n However, note: it is also possible that the entire string might not have a 'c' part? \n   The problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", so if C appends zero 'c', then the condition would require that 0 equals the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. \n   But the problem states that they append \"some number\", which usually means at least one? But note: the problem says \"some number\" of letters 'c' (in the context of the story) and then specifies that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. \n\n However, the problem does not explicitly say that the number must be positive. But note the condition: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\". \n\n Since the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', then the number of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1. \n   - If C appends 0 'c', then we require 0 == (number of 'a') or 0 == (number of 'b'). But number of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, so 0 != 1. Hence,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations. The operations involve appending 'b's and 'c's to a string of 'a's under certain conditions. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must consist of three contiguous segments: one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then zero or more 'c's. Any deviation from this structure (like 'b's before 'a's or 'c's mixed with other characters) makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Conditions**: The number of 'c's must either equal the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both). Additionally, there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string has any 'c' before 'b' or any 'b' before 'a'\n    if 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s or 'c' in s[:s.find('b')] or 'b' in s[s.find('b')+1:]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Structure Check**: The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a' and one 'b'. It also ensures that all 'c's appear after all 'b's and no 'b's appear before 'a's. If any of these conditions are violated, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters are then determined.\n3. **Condition Validation**: The solution checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., the string structure is correct and the count condition holds), the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the required conditions by leveraging simple string checks and character counting, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
