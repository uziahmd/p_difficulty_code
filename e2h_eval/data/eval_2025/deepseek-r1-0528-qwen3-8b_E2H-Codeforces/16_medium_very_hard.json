Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The block containing a point can be described by the side of each line (either positive or negative). \n\n However, note that we are allowed to cross a road only at a common border (which is the entire line? but actually the problem says: move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero. Since the roads are infinite lines, the common border between two adjacent blocks is exactly a segment of one of the roads? Actually, no: two blocks are adjacent if they share a common segment (so the entire road is the border between two opposite sides). But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that if two blocks share an entire road (so the common border is the entire road, which has infinite length), then they are adjacent.\n\n However, note the example: \"if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment\" — meaning that two blocks that meet at a single point (like three or more roads crossing at a point) do not share a common border of positive length. Therefore, we cannot cross from one to another in one step.\n\n Now, the problem becomes: We start at home (x1,y1) and want to get to university (x2,y2). Each road i divides the plane, and we can consider the sign of (aix + biy + ci) for the home and the university.\n\n Let's define for each road i:\n   s1_i = sign(a*x1 + b*y1 + c_i)   [we can use 1 for positive, -1 for negative, 0 for zero but guaranteed not to be zero]\n   s2_i = sign(a*x2 + b*y2 + c_i)\n\n Then, the home and the university are in the same block if for every road i, s1_i == s2_i. Otherwise, we need to cross some roads.\n\n But note: crossing a road changes the side. However, the problem does not allow arbitrary crossing: we can only move from one block to an adjacent one (i.e., crossing one road at a time) and we require that the two blocks share a common border (so we must cross one entire road). \n\n However, wait: the problem states that the minimum number of steps. And note that we are allowed to cross multiple roads in one step? Actually, no: \"in one step you can move from one block to another\" — so we cross one road at a time? But note: the common border condition is satisfied when two blocks share a segment of a road. This means that to go from one block to a non-adjacent one, we must cross multiple roads, but one step only allows crossing one road? \n\n Let me clarify with the example: \n   Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n\n   The two roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0 (the x-axis)\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n   Home (1,1) is above the x-axis and to the right of the y-axis.\n   University (-1,-1) is below the x-axis and to the left of the y-axis.\n\n   To get from (1,1) to (-1,-1), we must cross two roads: first the x-axis (from above to below) and then the y-axis (from right to left). However, note that the two roads intersect at (0,0). The blocks are divided by these two roads into four quadrants.\n\n   But note: we cannot go directly from the first quadrant to the third quadrant without passing through the second or the fourth? Actually, we can cross one road at a time. However, the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another\" if they share a common border. \n\n   In this example, the home is in the first quadrant and the university is in the third. They do not share a common border (they are separated by two roads). So we must take two steps: \n        Step1: from first quadrant to second (crossing the y-axis) OR to fourth (crossing the x-axis).\n        Step2: then from second to third (crossing the x-axis) OR from fourth to third (crossing the y-axis).\n\n   However, wait: the problem does not specify the order. But note: the common border condition: two blocks must share a segment of a road. So:\n\n        The first quadrant and the second quadrant share the y-axis (x=0). Similarly, the first and fourth share the x-axis (y=0). Similarly, the second and third share the x-axis, and the fourth and third share the y-axis.\n\n   So we can cross one road at a time. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads we must cross.\n\n   But wait: is it always the number of roads with different signs? \n\n   Actually, consider: we start at home and the university. For each road, if the home and the university are on the same side, then we don't need to cross that road. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road an odd number of times. However, we are allowed to cross a road multiple times? \n\n   But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of steps. In each step, we cross one road. However, if we cross a road twice, that would mean we went back and forth. That would not be minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university? \n\n   However, wait: is that true? Consider that we might have to cross a set of roads, and the order of crossing might matter because the common border condition requires that we are moving from one block to an adjacent one. But note: the entire road is the border, and we can cross any road that separates the current block from the next.\n\n   Actually, the answer is the number of roads that have different signs for the home and the university? \n\n   Why? Because each such road must be crossed an odd number of times. However, we can plan a path that crosses each separating road exactly once. And we cannot avoid crossing all of them. Moreover, we can cross one road per step.\n\n   But note: sometimes we might have to cross a road more than once if the arrangement is complex? However, observe: the roads are linear and the plane is divided into convex regions (actually, the arrangement of lines divides the plane into cells, and each cell is defined by the side of each line). The minimal path from home to university must cross each separating line exactly once.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads i for which the sign of (a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i) at home is different from that at university.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n\n        Road1: y=0 -> for (1,1): 1>0 -> positive; for (-1,-1): -1<0 -> negative -> different.\n        Road2: x=0 -> for (1,1): 1>0 -> positive; for (-1,-1): -1<0 -> negative -> different.\n\n        Count = 2 -> output 2.\n\n Example 2:\n        Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n\n        Road1: x=0 -> same as above: different.\n        Road2: y=0 -> same as above: different.\n        Road3: x+y-3=0 -> for (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0 -> negative; for (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5 <0 -> same.\n\n        Count = 2 -> output 2.\n\n   So the answer is the count of roads for which the sign differs.\n\n   However, wait: what if there are more than two roads and the home and university are separated by multiple roads? The reasoning still holds: each road that separates them must be crossed, and we can do it in one step per road.\n\n   But note: what if the home and university are separated by two roads, but the two roads are the same? The problem guarantees that no two roads are the same.\n\n   Also, note: the problem says \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about being on a road.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read x1, y1, then x2, y2, then n, and the n roads (each with a, b, c).\n\n        For each road (a, b, c):\n            value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            value2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            Check the sign of value1 and value2 (taking care of zeros? but guaranteed not zero). \n\n        Count the number of roads for which (value1 * value2) < 0.\n\n        Print that count.\n\n   However, wait: is that always the minimal steps? \n\n   Consider: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n   This implies that we can cross one road per step. And we must cross every road that separates the home and the university. And we cannot avoid crossing a road that separates them. Moreover, we can cross the roads in any order.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\n   But note: the example output is 2 for both examples.\n\n   However, let me test with a different example.\n\n   Example 3: \n        Home: (0,0) — wait, but we are guaranteed that home and university are not on a road. So let me choose:\n\n        Home: (0,0) is on the road? Not necessarily: if a road is defined by ax+by+c=0, then (0,0) is on the road if c=0. But the input does not guarantee that c is nonzero. However, note: the road equation is given as aix+b iy+ci=0, and the point is not on the road.\n\n        Let me choose: \n        Home: (1,0)\n        University: (0,1)\n        Roads: \n          1: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0 -> then (1,0): 1>0 -> positive; (0,1): 0==0 -> but wait, (0,1) is on the road? Actually, the problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\". So we cannot have this.\n\n        Let me choose:\n        Home: (1,0) and University: (0,1)\n        Road: x=0 -> then (1,0): 1>0, (0,1): 0==0 -> but wait, (0,1) is on the road? Actually, the equation for the road x=0 is 1*x+0*y+0=0, so (0,1) satisfies 0*x+0*y+0=0? No, wait: the equation is 1*x+0*y+0=0 -> x=0. Then (0,1) is on the road. So we must avoid that.\n\n        Let me choose a road that doesn't pass through either point.\n\n        Example 3 corrected:\n        Home: (1,0) and University: (0,1)\n        Road: x+y=1 -> equation: x+y-1=0.\n\n        Then for home: 1+0-1=0 -> but wait, (1,0) is on the road? Yes. So we must pick a road that does not pass through either.\n\n        Let me choose:\n        Home: (1,0) and University: (0,1)\n        Road: x+y=2 -> equation: x+y-2=0.\n\n        Then home: 1+0-2 = -1 -> negative.\n        University: 0+1-2 = -1 -> negative.\n\n        Then they are on the same side. So no crossing.\n\n        Now, let me add a road that separates them: \n        Road: x+y=0 -> equation: x+y=0.\n\n        Then home: 1+0=1 -> positive.\n        University: 0+1=1 -> positive.\n\n        Still same side.\n\n        How about a road that is between them? \n\n        Road: x+y=1.5 -> equation: x+y-1.5=0.\n\n        Home: 1+0-1.5 = -0.5 -> negative.\n        University: 0+1-1.5 = -0.5 -> negative.\n\n        Now, how about a vertical road? \n\n        Road: x=0.5 -> equation: x-0.5=0.\n\n        Home: 1-0.5=0.5 -> positive.\n        University: 0-0.5=-0.5 -> negative.\n\n        So this road separates them.\n\n        Then the minimal steps should be 1.\n\n        According to our method: we have one road that separates, so output 1.\n\n        Now, is that correct? \n\n        The home (1,0) and university (0,1) are in two different half-planes of the road x=0.5. The entire road is the common border between two blocks. So we can cross the road in one step.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal steps is 1.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        Read x1, y1\n        Read x2, y2\n        Read n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            Read a, b, c\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # Since neither is on the road, val1 and val2 are nonzero.\n            # Check if they have opposite signs\n            if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But wait, what if the road equation is normalized differently? For example, if the equation is given as -ax-by-c=0, then the sign might be flipped. However, the condition (val1 * val2 < 0) is equivalent to (val1>0 and val2<0) or (val1<0 and val2>0). \n\n   However, note: the sign of the equation is arbitrary. But the definition of the road is ax+by+c=0. The sign of the expression (ax+by+c) defines the side. \n\n   But note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the equation becomes -ax-by-c=0, and then the sign of the expression for a point would be the opposite. However, the separation condition (opposite signs) remains the same: if originally (val1*val2 <0) then after flipping the equation, the product becomes ( (-val1)*(-val2) ) = val1*val2, so same sign. Wait, no: if we flip the equation, then the expression for the point becomes - (ax+by+c). Then the sign is flipped. But then the condition (val1>0 and val2<0) becomes (-val1<0 and -val2>0) which is the same as (val1>0 and val2<0) because both conditions are negated. So the condition (val1 * val2 <0) is invariant under flipping the equation.\n\n   However, in our code we don't flip, so we must be consistent.\n\n   But note: we are only using the product to check for opposite signs. We could also do:\n\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   However, due to potential overflow? The values can be as large as 10^6 for a,b,c,x1,y1,x2,y2. So the product can be as large as (10^6 * 10^6) * 3 (for coefficients) ... wait, let's compute:\n\n        a, b, c: up to 10^6 in absolute value, and x1,y1,x2,y2: up to 10^6.\n\n        So the maximum absolute value for val1 and val2 is:\n\n        |a*x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12\n        Similarly, |b*y1| <= 10^12, |c| <= 10^6.\n\n        Then |val1| <= 10^12 + 10^12 + 10^6 ~ 2e12, so the product is up to 4e24, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but we are comparing the sign, so we don't care about the magnitude. However, we must avoid using multiplication if we are concerned about overflow in other languages, but here we are in Python.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n\n   But note: if val1 is negative and val2 is positive, then (val1<0) is True and (val2<0) is False -> True != False -> True.\n        if val1 positive and val2 negative: (val1<0) is False and (val2<0) is True -> True != False -> True.\n\n   This is the same.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if the product overflows in other languages? But the problem says the input is up to 10^6, and the product would be up to (10^6 * 10^6) * (at most 3 terms) so 3e12, which is within the range of 64-bit integers (which can go up to about 9e18). So even in C++ we could use multiplication. But the problem is in competitive programming and we are using Python, so we can use multiplication.\n\n   However, let me check: the worst-case absolute value of the product is (2e12)*(2e12)=4e24. In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. But if we were in C++, we would use:\n\n        long long for the product? The maximum value is 4e24 which is 400000000000000000000000, which is less than 2^100 (about 1e30) so it's acceptable for Python but in C++ we would use `long long` and the product would be within the range (since 4e24 is about 4000...0 and 2^64 is about 1.8e19, so 4e24 is too big for 64-bit integer). \n\n   But the problem does not specify the language, and we are writing in Python. So we can use:\n\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n   However, to be safe and avoid the huge product (though Python handles it, but maybe we don't want to do the multiplication for performance? n is only 300, so 300 multiplications of numbers up to 2e12 is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the multiplication and just check the signs. \n\n   Let me do:\n\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n\n   This avoids the multiplication and is just two comparisons per road.\n\n   But note: what if one of the values is zero? The problem states that the home and university are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are never zero. So we don't have to worry.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a, b, c = data\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Road1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> val1 = 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 -> positive; val2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> count becomes 1.\n        Road2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> val1 = 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 -> positive; val2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> count becomes 2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Road1: same as above -> 1 and -1 -> count=1.\n        Road2: same as above -> 1 and -1 -> count=2.\n        Road3: a=1, b=1, c=-3 -> val1 = 1*1+1*1-3 = 2-3=-1 -> negative; val2 = 1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3 = -1-1-3=-5 -> negative -> no crossing.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   However, wait: the example input was given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   But note: the second example input in the array is: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   Our code reads the second example correctly.\n\n   One more edge: what if there are no roads? n=0. Then we output 0.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            0 0\n            0 0\n            0\n\n        Then we read n=0, and the loop runs 0 times, output 0.\n\n   But note: the problem says n>=1, so we don't have to handle n=0? Actually, the input says n>=1.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says that the roads divide the plane into connected regions. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. This is a well-known fact: the minimal number of lines to cross to go from one region to the other is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require crossing the roads in a straight line. We can take any path. However, the arrangement of lines is such that the regions are defined by the sides. The minimal number of crossings is the number of separating lines.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: there is a known issue in computational geometry: the arrangement of lines might not be in general position (they can be parallel). But our method does not depend on the arrangement being in general position. We are simply checking for each line whether the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n   Example: two parallel lines. Then the two points can be on the same side, or one on one side and the other on the other, or one between the two. But note: if a line separates the two points, then they are on opposite sides. If they are not, then they are on the same side (or one is between the two, but then they are not separated by this line). \n\n   However, consider two parallel lines and two points: \n        Line1: x=0, Line2: x=1.\n        Home: (2,0), University: (-1,0)\n\n        For Line1: x=0 -> home: 2>0, university: -1<0 -> separated by Line1.\n        For Line2: x=1 -> home: 2>1, university: -1<1 -> separated by Line2.\n\n        Then the minimal steps is 2.\n\n        But wait, we can cross Line1 and then Line2, or Line2 and then Line1. The path must cross both. \n\n        However, note that the two lines are distinct and parallel. The plane is divided into three regions: x<-1, -1<x<0, x>0? Actually, no: the lines are x=0 and x=1. The regions are: x<-1, -1<=x<0? Actually, the lines are infinite. The regions are: \n            Region1: x < 0\n            Region2: 0 <= x < 1\n            Region3: x >= 1\n\n        But wait: the equation of the road is given as ax+by+ci=0. For x=0: 1*x+0*y+0=0. For x=1: 1*x+0*y-1=0.\n\n        The home (2,0) is in Region3, the university (-1,0) is in Region1. They are separated by two lines.\n\n        Now, is there a direct connection? No, because the common border between Region3 and Region1 is not a single road. The borders are the two lines. So we must cross both.\n\n        Our code counts both because for each road, the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n   Another example: two parallel lines, and the two points are separated by one line but not the other.\n\n        Home: (0.5,0) [between the two parallel lines] and University: (-1,0) [left of both]\n\n        Then for Line1: x=0 -> home: 0.5>0, university: -1<0 -> separated by Line1.\n        For Line2: x=1 -> home: 0.5<1, university: -1<1 -> same side.\n\n        Then the answer is 1.\n\n        Indeed, we only need to cross Line1 to get from home to university.\n\n   Therefore, the method works.\n\n   Code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # Since the points are not on the road, we know val1 and val2 are not zero.\n            if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But note: we must be cautious of the sign. The product being negative means opposite signs.\n\n   However, the multiplication might be negative even if one of the values is zero? But the problem states that the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are not zero. So no problem.\n\n   Let me change to the multiplication version because it's simpler and clear.\n\n   However, let me test with the example of two parallel lines again.\n\n        Example: \n            Home: (0.5,0) -> for x=0: 0.5 -> positive, for x=1: 0.5-1 = -0.5 -> negative? Actually, wait: the equation for x=1 is x-1=0, so for (0.5,0): 0.5-1 = -0.5 -> negative. And for (-1,0): -1-1=-2 -> negative. So same side for the second road.\n\n        Then for the second road: (-0.5)*(-2)=positive -> not counted.\n\n        First road: (0.5)*(-2) = -1 -> negative -> counted.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n        print(count)\n\n   We'll output the count.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement example outputs are 2 and 2, and our code produces 2 and 2. \n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\"\n\n   And we are counting the number of roads that separate the two points. Is that the same as the minimal steps?\n\n   Yes, because we can cross one road per step, and we must cross every separating road.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   It matches.\n\n   I think we are good.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and the home and university blocks are separated by certain roads. The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate these two blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking for each road whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, crossing that road is necessary to move from one block to the other. The minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we evaluate the sign of the expression \\(ax + by + c\\) at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each road, computing the value of the line equation at both points, and checking if the product of these values is negative (indicating opposite signs). The count of such roads gives the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. With \\(n\\) roads (up to 300), the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The line equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Separation**: If the product of the evaluations at the two points is negative, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed. The count of such roads is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of roads separating the home and university is printed, which represents the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road's contribution to separating the two points and leverages simple arithmetic to determine the necessary crossings, ensuring optimal performance.",
