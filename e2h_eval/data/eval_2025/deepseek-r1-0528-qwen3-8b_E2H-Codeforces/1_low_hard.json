    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n The border (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is a x b (with a>=3 and b>=3, because we have borders), then the border consists of:\n     top row: a cells\n     bottom row: a cells\n     left and right columns, but without the corners (already counted) so (b-2) for left and (b-2) for right, for the middle rows.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   total cells in the border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2a+2b]\n\n But wait, actually: \n   The border of a rectangle (without any inner parts) has: \n      top: a\n      bottom: a\n      left: b-2 (excluding the top and bottom ones)\n      right: b-2\n   So total = 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the first ring is along the edge of the plate. The plate is w x h, so the first ring (i=1) has:\n   a = w, b = h? Actually, no: the first ring is the outer border, so the inner rectangle for the first ring isn't defined by subtracting anything? \n\n Let me re-read: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n This means that the i-th ring is the border of the rectangle that is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n However, note that the entire plate is the starting rectangle. Then the first ring is the border of the entire plate (which is the outer ring). The second ring is the border of the next inner rectangle which is (w-4) x (h-4), meaning we have removed the outer two layers (so two rings already?).\n\n Actually, the problem says: the first ring goes along the edge, the second one 2 cells away from the edge, etc.\n\n So the first ring is the outermost border (which is the entire perimeter of the plate). Then the second ring is the border of the rectangle that is two units inside (so the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4)), and so on.\n\n Therefore, the i-th ring is the border of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\n But note: the condition on k: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This means we don't go beyond the point where the inner rectangle would have negative dimensions or zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n For the i-th ring (with i from 1 to k), the rectangle is:\n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n Then the number of cells for the i-th ring is:\n   If w_i < 3 or h_i < 3, then the ring doesn't exist? But the input constraint ensures that k is such that we don't get negative or zero for the inner rectangle? Actually, the condition says k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4) so the inner rectangle for the last ring will have at least 3x3? Let's check:\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, k=2 -> \n   First ring: w0=7, h0=9 -> cells = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4=28.\n   Second ring: w1=7-4=3, h1=9-4=5 -> cells = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate by adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge, and the width of each ring is 1 cell. The first ring is along the outer edge of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells inside, and so on. The task is to compute the total number of cells covered by these rings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the perimeter of concentric rectangles within the given plate dimensions. For each ring, the inner rectangle's dimensions are derived by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both the width and height, where `i` is the ring number (starting from 1). The perimeter (number of cells) of each ring is then calculated using the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`, where `a` and `b` are the width and height of the inner rectangle, respectively.\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of cells in each ring depends on the dimensions of the inner rectangle. The formula accounts for the top and bottom rows (each contributing `a` cells) and the left and right columns (each contributing `b-2` cells, since the corners are already counted in the top and bottom rows).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the inner rectangle dimensions, then apply the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in that ring. Sum these values across all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `k` rings once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints (k ≤ floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        inner_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        inner_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if inner_w <= 0 or inner_h <= 0:\n            break\n        if inner_w < 3 or inner_h < 3:\n            continue\n        cells_in_ring = 2 * inner_w + 2 * inner_h - 4\n        total_cells += cells_in_ring\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - **Inner Dimensions Calculation**: The inner rectangle's dimensions are computed by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both `w` and `h`. This adjustment accounts for the cells occupied by previous rings.\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes non-positive, the loop breaks as further rings are not possible. If either dimension is less than 3, the ring cannot exist (since a rectangle must have at least 3x3 cells to form a border), so it is skipped.\n   - **Perimeter Calculation**: The number of cells in the current ring is calculated using the formula `2*inner_w + 2*inner_h - 4`, which effectively computes the perimeter of the inner rectangle.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of gilded cells is printed after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
