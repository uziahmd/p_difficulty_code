The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. The president wants to remove k districts (so we keep n-k districts) such that the remaining graph is connected (i.e., forms a connected tree) and the total fan count (which is 2^district_number) is maximized.\n\n Observation:\n Since the fan count for district i is 2^i, note that higher-numbered districts have exponentially more fans. Therefore, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\n However, the remaining set must form a connected subgraph (since removing k nodes from a tree and requiring connectivity implies that the remaining n-k nodes form a connected subtree).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the entire nation is a tree. Removing k nodes must leave a connected tree. This means that the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree. In a tree, a connected subgraph is just a tree (or a subset of the original tree) that is connected.\n\n 2. The problem is equivalent to: remove k nodes so that the remaining n-k nodes form a connected component, and we wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining nodes.\n\n 3. Since 2^i grows exponentially, we prefer to keep the largest numbered nodes (because 2^6 > 2^5+2^4+...). Therefore, ideally we would like to keep the n-k largest numbered nodes.\n\n 4. However, we must ensure that the kept nodes form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to: choose a connected subtree with exactly n-k nodes that includes as many large-numbered nodes as possible.\n\n 5. Note: The entire set of kept nodes must be connected. In a tree, the minimal connected set containing a set of nodes is the union of all simple paths between those nodes. Therefore, if we want to keep a set S of nodes, then S must lie entirely within one connected component when we remove the other nodes.\n\n 6. Alternate approach: consider that the connected component we keep must be a subtree (in a tree, any connected subgraph is a tree). The best way to maximize the sum is to take the largest n-k nodes (by node value) and then check if they form a connected subtree? But note: it might not. For example, if we take the two highest nodes but they are disconnected, then we cannot do that.\n\n 7. Actually, we can use the following idea: the entire tree is rooted arbitrarily. However, note that the problem does not specify root. But we can think of the problem as: we wish to remove k nodes and leave a connected component. This is equivalent to choosing a rooted subtree that spans n-k nodes, but note that the connectivity condition is independent of root.\n\n 8. Another idea: since we want to maximize the sum, we would like to keep the largest numbers. So we start by considering the largest n-k nodes (by node index). Then we check if they form a connected subtree? However, the problem is that the nodes are labeled arbitrarily (the labels are the district numbers, which are from 1 to n, but the edges are arbitrary). The connectivity is defined by the given tree.\n\n 9. Let's reframe: we want to choose a connected subgraph (subtree) with n-k nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Because the function 2^i is strictly increasing, the optimal set is the set of the largest n-k nodes (by their label) provided that they form a connected subtree. But if they don't, we have to drop some of the smallest ones and replace them with others to maintain connectivity?\n\n 10. However, note: the problem requires that we remove k nodes, so we keep n-k nodes. The total number of nodes kept is fixed. So we are looking for a connected subtree with exactly n-k nodes that has the maximum sum.\n\n 11. How to solve this?\n\n Insight: In a tree, we can use the concept of \"must keep\" nodes. We know that the highest node (n) must be kept if we are to maximize the sum? Not necessarily: because if n is isolated from the rest (but note the entire graph is a tree, so n is connected to the rest by one edge). Actually, the entire graph is a tree, so the highest node is connected to the rest. But what if we don't keep n? Then we can only get up to 2^(n-1). But 2^n is much bigger. So we should definitely keep the highest node.\n\n Similarly, we should keep the next highest until we have a connected set.\n\n 12. We can think greedily: we want to keep the highest n-k nodes. But if these n-k nodes are not connected, then we need to connect them by including some lower nodes (which we don't want to do because they have less fan value). Alternatively, we can consider: the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts to remove from a tree-structured network such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected subgraph and the total fan count (sum of 2^i for each remaining district i) is maximized. The key insight here is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the fan count, so we prioritize keeping the highest-numbered districts while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node (district) has a value (2^i). The goal is to select n-k nodes such that they form a connected subtree and their sum is maximized. Given the exponential nature of the values, the optimal solution will include the highest-numbered nodes possible, provided they remain connected.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The largest nodes (highest numbers) should be kept. However, if these nodes are not connected, we need to adjust by including some lower-numbered nodes to maintain connectivity. This suggests a two-step approach: first, identify the top n-k nodes by their numbers; then, ensure these nodes form a connected subtree by possibly replacing some smaller nodes with necessary connectors.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Top Nodes Selection**: Start by selecting the top n-k nodes (highest numbers).\n   - **Connectivity Check**: Verify if these nodes form a connected subtree. If not, replace the smallest nodes in the selected set with necessary nodes to ensure connectivity, starting from the smallest replacement to minimize the loss in fan count.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves sorting the nodes (O(n log n)) and traversing the tree (O(n)), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    k = int(next(it))\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(next(it))\n        b = int(next(it))\n        edges.append((a, b))\n    \n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for a, b in edges:\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    sorted_nodes = sorted(range(1, n+1), reverse=True)\n    keep_count = n - k\n    selected = set(sorted_nodes[:keep_count])\n    \n    parent = [0] * (n+1)\n    children = [set() for _ in range(n+1)]\n    stack = [1]\n    parent[1] = 0\n    order = []\n    while stack:\n        node = stack.pop()\n        order.append(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent[node]:\n                continue\n            parent[neighbor] = node\n            children[node].add(neighbor)\n            stack.append(neighbor)\n            \n    def get_subtree_root(node):\n        while node != 1:\n            node = parent[node]\n        return 1\n        \n    root = 1\n    for node in order[::-1]:\n        if node not in selected:\n            root = get_subtree_root(node)\n            break\n            \n    if root != 1:\n        selected.remove(root)\n        selected.add(root)\n        sorted_selected = sorted(selected, reverse=True)\n        to_remove = set(sorted_selected[:keep_count-1])\n        to_remove.discard(root)\n        for num in range(1, n+1):\n            if num not in selected:\n                if num < root:\n                    to_remove.add(num)\n                    selected.add(num)\n                    keep_count += 1\n                    if len(selected) > keep_count:\n                        selected.remove(sorted_selected[keep_count-1])\n                    break\n                else:\n                    pass\n                    \n    result = sorted(selected)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k), followed by the tree edges.\n2. **Graph Construction**: A graph adjacency list is built from the edges.\n3. **Node Selection**: Nodes are sorted in descending order to prioritize higher-numbered nodes.\n4. **Connectivity Check**: Using a post-order traversal, the algorithm checks if the selected nodes form a connected subtree.
