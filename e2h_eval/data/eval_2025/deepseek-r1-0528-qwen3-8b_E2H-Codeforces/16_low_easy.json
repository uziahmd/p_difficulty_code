Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. Moreover, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent (and can be moved in one step) if they share a nonzero boundary segment, meaning they are separated by exactly one road.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to physically cross the roads one by one, but to count the minimum number of steps (each step crossing one road) to get from home to university.\n\n But note: It's not just about the number of roads crossed. Actually, the problem states that we are allowed to move from one block to another if they share a common border of nonzero length. This means that if two blocks are separated by one road, then you can cross that road in one step.\n\n However, the catch is: if you cross multiple roads at once (if your path goes through an intersection of two or more roads), then you might cross several roads at the same time? But wait, the problem says that we are moving from one block to another. Each step must be from one block to an adjacent block (sharing a border). The borders are segments of the roads. So if you cross one road, you move from one block to the next. If you cross two roads at an intersection, then you are actually crossing two roads at the same time, so you would be moving from one block to a third block? \n\n Actually, let me think: In planar graphs (which this forms), the dual graph has nodes as faces (blocks) and edges between faces that share an edge (not just a vertex). When we cross a single road, we move from one face to an adjacent face. But if we cross two roads at an intersection, then we are crossing two roads at the same time, and that would take us from one face to a face that is separated by two roads? However, note the condition: we can only move in steps that cross one road? Actually, the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is a segment of one road. Therefore, each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n But wait: what if two roads meet at a point and you want to cross both at once? Then the step would be invalid because the two blocks that are separated by two roads do not share a common border (they are separated by two roads, so the border between them is actually two roads, which is not a continuous border). Therefore, we cannot cross two roads in one step.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: how many distinct roads must we cross to go from the home block to the university block?\n\n However, note: it is possible that we cross the same road twice? But we don't have to: we are only concerned with the minimum steps.\n\n Actually, the problem is analogous to determining the minimum number of roads that separate the home from the university. But note: the roads are infinite lines. We can also consider that the entire plane is divided by the n lines. The arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions. The home and university are in two regions.\n\n The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that must be crossed to go from home to university. But note: we can cross the roads in any order, and we can choose the path arbitrarily (as long as we don't go through a road).\n\n However, there is a catch: if we cross a road, then we are in a new region. The minimal number of roads to cross is the minimal number of lines that separate the two points. But note: the lines are infinite and the two points are not on any road.\n\n How do we compute the minimal number of lines that separate two points in an arrangement of lines?\n\n Alternatively, consider: if we draw a set of lines, the two points are separated by a line if the two points lie on opposite sides of the line. The minimal number of steps is the size of the smallest set of lines such that if we remove those lines, the two points become connected? Actually, no: we are allowed to cross one line per step.\n\n But note: the entire plane is divided by the lines. We can think of the problem as: we start at home and we need to get to university. Each time we cross a road, we flip from one side of that road to the other. The home and university are fixed on two sides of some roads.\n\n However, observe: the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that must be crossed. And note that if a road separates the two points, then we must cross it. But if a road does not separate the two points, then we don't need to cross it.\n\n Why? Because if the two points are on the same side of a road, then we can avoid crossing that road. Only the roads that separate the two points must be crossed.\n\n But wait: what if we cross a road that does not separate the two points? Then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town. The key insight is that each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that must be crossed to go from the home position to the university position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves navigating through regions divided by infinite lines (roads). The goal is to find the minimal number of line crossings needed to move from the home position to the university position, without passing through any roads.\n2. **Key Insight**: A road must be crossed if the home and university lie on opposite sides of it. Roads where both positions lie on the same side do not need to be crossed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, check the side of the home and university relative to the road. If they are on opposite sides, count this road as a necessary crossing. The total count of such roads gives the minimal number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Checking Road Sides**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the value of the expression \\(ax + by + c\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these values differ, it means the two points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus this road must be crossed.\n3. **Counting Necessary Crossings**: The total number of such roads gives the minimal number of steps required to reach the university from home, as each crossing moves you to an adjacent block.\n4. **Output Result**: The count of necessary road crossings is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leading to an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
