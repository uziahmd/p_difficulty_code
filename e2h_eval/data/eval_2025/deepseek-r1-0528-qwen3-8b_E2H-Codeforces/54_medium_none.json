Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (with 3<=n<=10^5, 1<=a<=180)\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to 'a'.\n\n Important: The polygon is regular, so the central angles between adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n How to model the angle?\n In a regular polygon, the angle we can form at vertex v2 depends on the steps we take from v2 to v1 and v3.\n\n Let's consider the polygon as circular. Without loss of generality, fix vertex v2 at position 0 (or any fixed vertex). Then, we can consider two directions: one going clockwise and the other counterclockwise.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the center of the polygon to be the vertex. The angle is formed by two sides from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n Actually, we can think of the angle at v2 as being determined by two arcs: one from v2 to v1 and the other from v2 to v3. But note that the angle we form is an inscribed angle? Not exactly.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the triangle formed by the three points. But note: the polygon is regular, so the side lengths and angles are fixed.\n\n Actually, the problem is about forming an angle at vertex v2. In the regular polygon, the interior angle at each vertex is fixed (for example, for a square it's 90, for a pentagon it's 108, etc.). However, the problem allows us to choose any three distinct vertices, so we are allowed to form an angle that is not necessarily the interior angle.\n\n But note: the angle must be formed with v1 and v3 lying on the sides of the angle. Since the polygon is convex, we can consider two rays from v2: one going through the next vertex and the other going backwards, but actually we can choose any two distinct vertices (not necessarily adjacent).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the value |angle - a|\" must be minimized.\n\n Let me explain the angle calculation:\n\n Consider the circle circumscribing the polygon. The angle we form at v2 is an inscribed angle? Actually, we are forming an angle by two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n There are two possibilities for the angle: the smaller one and the larger one (but since the polygon is convex and the angle is measured in the usual way, we consider the angle inside the polygon? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but note: the angle must be measured in degrees and the example includes angles like 45 and 90.\n\n Observation from examples:\n   Input: \"3 15\" -> output: \"1 2 3\", which is a triangle. The angle at vertex 2 (if we take vertices 1,2,3) is the interior angle of the triangle? Actually, the angle at vertex 2 is 60 degrees (in an equilateral triangle). But wait, the problem says: \"vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees\". So they are considering the interior angle? Or the angle formed by the two sides?\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\".\n\n There are two types of angles: the reflex angle and the non-reflex angle. However, note that the polygon is convex, and we are taking three distinct vertices. The angle we form at v2 can be the interior or exterior? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 67\": the answer uses an angle of 45 degrees (from the square). How do we get 45 degrees?\n\n In a square, if we take vertices 1,2,3: \n   Then the angle at vertex 2 would be the interior angle (90 degrees). \n   But wait, the example output is \"2 1 3\" for the second sample? Actually, the sample outputs are:\n      Input: \"3 15\" -> Output: \"1 2 3\"\n      Input: \"4 67\" -> Output: \"2 1 3\"\n      Input: \"4 68\" -> Output: \"4 1 2\"\n\n Let me reexamine the second sample: n=4, a=67.\n   The square has central angle 90 degrees per side. The angle we can form at a vertex can be either the interior angle (90) or the exterior? But wait, we can also form an angle by skipping a vertex.\n\n Example: In square with vertices 1,2,3,4 (clockwise), if we choose v2=2, then:\n   Option 1: v1=1, v3=3 -> angle is 90 degrees.\n   Option 2: v1=1, v3=4 -> This forms an angle at 2: from 1 to 2 to 4. But note: in the square, the two sides are from 2 to 1 and 2 to 3, and then 2 to 4 is a diagonal? Actually, the polygon is convex and the vertices are in cyclic order. So the angle at 2 formed by points 1,2,4 is actually the angle of the triangle 1-2-4. \n\n How to calculate the angle at vertex 2 for points (v1, v2, v3)?\n\n We can use the cross product to compute the angle between two vectors. However, note that the polygon is regular and the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n Alternate approach: use the fact that the entire polygon is cyclic and the central angles are known.\n\n Let the center be O. Then, the angle at vertex v2 between points v1, v2, v3 can be found by considering the arcs.\n\n Actually, the inscribed angle theorem might be useful. The angle at v2 is half the difference of the arcs opposite to the angle? Or wait, standard inscribed angle is half the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n However, note: our angle is formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2). But wait, there are two arcs: the minor and major.\n\n Actually, the formula for the angle at v2 (which is an inscribed angle) is (|arc(v1,v3)| / 360 * (something))? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the three points. But note, we don't have coordinates.\n\n Another idea: represent the vertices on the circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n.\n\n Then, the central angle between vertex i and j is (min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)) * (360/n). But wait, the central angle is the smallest one.\n\n Now, the angle we form at v2 is an angle in the triangle v1v2v3. The triangle's sides are chords of the circle.\n\n The angle at v2 can be calculated by:\n\n   angle = 180 - (arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2) / 2   [this is the inscribed angle formula?] \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n But note: the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that is opposite to the angle). However, there are two arcs from v1 to v3: the minor and the major.\n\n The angle at v2 will be the one that intercepts the arc that does not contain v2. Actually, the angle at v2 is formed by the two chords, and the intercepted arc is the one opposite to the angle (the one that is \"seen\" from the angle). \n\n But wait, let me recall: in a circle, an inscribed angle is defined by two chords from a point on the circumference. The angle is half the central angle subtended by the arc between the two points.\n\n Therefore, if we let the arc between v1 and v3 (the one not containing v2) be x degrees, then the angle at v2 is x/2.\n\n However, note: the entire circle is 360. The two arcs from v1 to v3 are: one is the minor arc (<=180) and the other is the major arc (>=180). The angle at v2 must intercept the arc that is opposite to it. But in a convex polygon, the angle we are forming is the one that is less than 180 (if we are measuring the smaller angle) or greater? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify, but note that the example: \n   For square: \n        Option: v1=1, v2=2, v3=3: the intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (without passing through v2) is the arc from 1 to 3 that goes the long way? Actually, no: in the square, the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1->4->3, which is 180 degrees (because each side is 90, so two sides: 180). Then the inscribed angle would be 180/2 = 90. That matches.\n\n   Now, what if we take v1=1, v2=2, v3=4? Then the intercepted arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2: \n        The two arcs from 1 to 4: \n            One arc: 1->2->3->4 (270 degrees)\n            The other: 1->4 (90 degrees) -> but wait, the angle at 2: the two chords are 2->1 and 2->4. The intercepted arc for the angle at 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. The arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the minor arc (90 degrees). Then the angle would be 90/2 = 45 degrees.\n\n So the formula is: the angle at v2 is (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the length of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n But note: the entire circle is 360, so the two arcs from v1 to v3 add up to 360. The intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) must be the one that is opposite to the angle.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can fix the vertex v2 and then choose two other vertices v1 and v3. But note: the problem requires distinct vertices.\n\n 2. The angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs: the arc from v2 to v1 and the arc from v2 to v3. Actually, the intercepted arc is the one from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2.\n\n 3. The arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the complement of the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2 (if we consider the two ways). Alternatively, we can define the arc between v1 and v3 as the minimal arc? No, because the intercepted arc must be the one that does not contain v2.\n\n How to compute the intercepted arc?\n\n Let d1 = distance from v2 to v1 (in terms of steps, going clockwise from v2 to v1, but then we have two directions). Actually, we can assign indices to the vertices. Let the vertices be labeled 0 to n-1 (for simplicity) and then map back to 1-indexed.\n\n We can define the angular separation between two vertices i and j as the minimum of the clockwise and counterclockwise steps. However, for the intercepted arc, we need the arc that does not contain v2.\n\n Actually, we can consider the circle and the positions. The entire circle is 360. The arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the one that goes the opposite way.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Let the central angle for one step be 360/n.\n\n   The central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 (the minor arc) is min(|v1-v3|, n-|v1-v3|) * (360/n). But wait, that gives the minor arc.\n\n   However, the intercepted arc is not necessarily the minor one. It is the one that doesn't contain v2.\n\n   How to relate v1, v2, v3?\n\n   Without loss of generality, we can fix v2 at 0. Then we can let v1 be at position i (steps clockwise) and v3 at position j (steps clockwise). Then the two arcs from v1 to v3 are:\n        The clockwise arc: (j - i) mod n, and the counterclockwise arc: (i - j) mod n.\n\n   But wait, the intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) is the one that doesn't go through v2 (which is 0). \n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (the one that the angle at v2 sees) is the arc that does not include the direction from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3? \n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the circle without v2. The two points v1 and v3 divide the circle into two arcs. The one that does not contain v2 is the intercepted arc.\n\n   Steps to compute the intercepted arc:\n\n        Let the positions be: v2 = 0, v1 = i, v3 = j (we can consider i and j as the number of steps from v2, but then we have to account for the circularity).\n\n        Without loss of generality, assume we traverse the circle from 0. Then the two arcs from i to j are:\n            Arc1: from i to j in the increasing direction (if i < j, then j-i; if i>j, then (j+n)-i? Actually, we can use modulo arithmetic)\n\n        But note: the intercepted arc must not contain 0 (v2). So we have two cases:\n\n        Case 1: the arc from i to j that does not contain 0 is the one that goes from i to j without passing 0. This is the arc that is entirely in the positive direction (if i<j) or the negative direction (if i>j)? Actually, we have to avoid 0.\n\n        Actually, the intercepted arc is the set of points from i to j that does not include 0. So if we consider the circle, we break at 0. Then the arc from i to j avoiding 0 is the one that is the shorter arc? Not necessarily.\n\n        Instead, we can compute the arc from i to j that does not contain 0 as follows:\n\n          total_circle = 360\n          minor_arc = min(|i - j|, n - |i - j|) * (360/n)   [this is the minor arc between i and j]\n\n          But wait, the intercepted arc is not the minor arc. Actually, the intercepted arc is the arc from i to j that does not contain 0. So if we consider the circle, the two arcs from i to j are:\n\n          arc1 = (j - i) % n   [but in terms of steps, then multiplied by 360/n]\n          arc2 = (i - j) % n   [same]\n\n          Then the intercepted arc is the one that is the entire circle minus the arc from i to j that contains 0? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the positions relative to 0. We can split the circle at 0. Then the two arcs from i to j are:\n\n          The arc that goes from i to j without passing 0: this is the arc that does not cross 0. The length of that arc is the minimum of the two possibilities that do not cross 0.\n\n        Actually, we can consider the circle as [0, 360). We mark 0, and then the positions i and j are at angles i*(360/n) and j*(360/n). Then the intercepted arc is the set of points from i to j (in the circle) that does not include 0.\n\n        How to compute the intercepted arc length?\n\n          Let angle_i = i * (360/n)\n          Let angle_j = j * (360/n)\n\n          Then the intercepted arc is the arc from i to j that does not contain 0. We can check:\n\n          If both i and j are on the same side of 0 (say, both positive and we break the circle at 0) then the intercepted arc is the one that goes from i to j without crossing 0.\n\n          Actually, we can normalize the positions by breaking the circle at 0. Then the intercepted arc is the arc from i to j that does not contain the point 0.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let d1 = (i - j) % n   [steps from j to i in the positive direction] but we want the arc from i to j.\n\n            Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let arc_length(i, j) = (j - i) % n   [number of steps from i to j in positive direction] * (360/n)\n\n            But then the intercepted arc is the one that is the entire circle minus the arc from i to j that goes through 0? Not exactly.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider the circle without breaking the circle. The intercepted arc is the arc from i to j that does not contain 0. This is the same as the arc from i to j that is the one that does not include the vertex 0 (v2) in between.\n\n          We can compute:\n\n            Let x = min(i, j)\n            Let y = max(i, j)\n\n            Then the two arcs from x to y are: \n                arc1: y - x   [steps from x to y in positive direction]\n                arc2: x + n - y [steps from y to x in positive direction, which is the long way]\n\n            Now, the intercepted arc is the arc from x to y that does not contain 0. Since 0 is the starting point, we have to consider if 0 is in the arc from x to y (positive direction) or not.\n\n            Actually, if we fix v2 at 0, then the arc from x to y (positive direction) does not contain 0 if and only if x and y are both positive (and 0 is not between x and y in the positive direction). But wait, 0 is the start and we are at positions i and j (which are from 0 to n-1). We have broken the circle at 0.\n\n          Actually, we can think: the circle is broken at 0. Then the circle is divided into [0, n) and [n, 2n) is the same as [0, n). But we are representing positions modulo n.\n\n          Instead, let's do:\n\n            Without loss of generality, we can fix v2 at 0. Then the two other points are at positions i and j (with i, j from 1 to n-1). \n\n            The two arcs from i to j are:\n                Arc1: from i to j (if i < j, then j-i steps, else j-i+n steps) but then multiplied by (360/n) gives the central angle.\n\n            But the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain 0. \n\n            How to determine which arc from i to j contains 0?\n\n            The arc from i to j (positive direction) contains 0 if and only if i > j (because then the arc goes from i (which is near the end) to j (which is near the beginning) and passes 0). Similarly, the arc from j to i (positive direction) contains 0 if j > i.\n\n            Actually, the arc from i to j (positive direction) is the set of points from i to j. This arc contains 0 if and only if i > j (because then we wrap around). \n\n            Therefore, the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain 0) is:\n\n                If i <= j: then the arc from i to j (positive) does not contain 0? Actually, wait: if we break the circle at 0, then the arc from i to j (positive) goes from i to j without passing 0 if i and j are both in the segment [0, n) and i<=j, but 0 is at the boundary. Actually, if i<=j, then the arc from i to j (positive) does not contain 0 (because 0 is at the start and we are moving from i to j, and i>=1 and j<=n-1, so 0 is not included). \n\n            However, wait: we fixed v2 at 0. The arc from i to j (positive) is from i to j. The vertex 0 is the fixed point. The arc from i to j (positive) does not include 0 if i>0 and j<n (which they are) and i<=j. But if i>j, then the arc from i to j (positive) goes from i to j, which crosses the 0 (because i is at the high end and j at the low end). \n\n            Therefore, the intercepted arc is:\n\n                If we consider the two arcs from i to j:\n\n                    The one that does not contain 0 is:\n                      If i <= j: the arc from i to j (positive) [length (j-i)* (360/n)]\n                      If i > j: the arc from j to i (via the negative direction) is the same as the positive direction from j to i+n, but wait, we can also consider the arc from i to j (positive) which is (j-i+n)*(360/n) and that one does contain 0 (because i>j, so we wrap). Then the other arc from i to j (the one that does not contain 0) is the minor arc? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 0, so when i>j, the arc from i to j (positive) contains 0, so we take the other arc: from i to j in the negative direction, which is (i - j) * (360/n) (but wait, negative direction is the same as positive direction from j+n to i, so the length is (i - j) * (360/n) but then that is the same as (n - (j-i)) * (360/n) ???)\n\n            Let me clarify:\n\n                The entire circle is 360. The two arcs from i to j are:\n\n                  arc1 = (j - i) % n * (360/n)   [if negative, we add n to the modulus]\n                  arc2 = (i - j) % n * (360/n)   [which is 360 - arc1]\n\n                But wait, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 0. \n\n                Actually, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc that is opposite to the angle. And that arc is the one that does not contain v2 (0). \n\n                The two arcs from i to j are:\n\n                  arc_minor = min(arc1, arc2)\n                  arc_major = max(arc1, arc2)\n\n                Then, which one is intercepted? \n\n                The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 0. But 0 is at the fixed vertex. The arc from i to j that does not contain 0 is the one that is entirely in the segment [i, j] (if we break the circle at 0) if i and j are both in the same half? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                  Let A = i * (360/n)   [the angle of vertex i]\n                  Let B = j * (360/n)\n\n                  Then the two arcs from A to B are:\n\n                    arc1 = (B - A) % 360   [if negative, add 360]\n                    arc2 = (A - B) % 360   [then arc2 = 360 - arc1]\n\n                Now, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 0. But 0 is the angle of v2 (vertex 0). \n\n                The intercepted arc is the arc from A to B that does not contain 0. \n\n                How to check if 0 is in the arc from A to B (positive direction)? \n\n                We can check if 0 is in the interval [A, B] (if A<=B) or in the interval [B, A] (if B<=A). \n\n                Actually, the positive arc from A to B (arc1) contains 0 if:\n\n                  If A <= B: then the arc goes from A to B. 0 is contained if 0 >= A and 0 <= B? But 0 is the starting point, so if A is positive, then 0 is not in [A, B] (because A>=1 and B>=1, and 0 is less than A). \n\n                Wait, we fixed v2 at 0, so the angle for v2 is 0. The other vertices are at angles k*(360/n) for k=1,...,n-1.\n\n                So the positive arc from i to j (arc1) goes from i*(360/n) to j*(360/n). Since i and j are from 1 to n-1, then i*(360/n) is between 0 and 360, and similarly for j.\n\n                Now, the condition for the positive arc (arc1) to contain 0 (the angle 0) is:\n\n                  If the arc from i*(360/n) to j*(360/n) (positive direction) crosses 0, that means j*(360/n) < i*(360/n) (because we are going from a higher angle to a lower angle, so we must cross 360 and then go to 0). \n\n                Therefore, if j*(360/n) < i*(360/n), then the positive arc from i to j goes from i*(360/n) to j*(360/n)+360, and then we subtract 360. In that case, the arc does not contain 0 (because 0 is represented as 360, which is the same as 0). \n\n                Actually, we can avoid the confusion by working in modulo 360.\n\n                Let me reframe: the circle is continuous from 0 to 360. The arc from A to B (positive direction) is the set of angles from A to B (if A<=B) or from A to B+360 (if A>B). \n\n                Then 0 is contained in the positive arc from A to B (arc1) if:\n\n                  Case 1: A <= B: then the arc is [A, B]. 0 is in [A, B] if A <= 0 <= B. But A is i*(360/n) and i>=1, so A>=360/n>0, and B>=360/n>0, so 0 is not in [A, B].\n\n                  Case 2: A > B: then the arc is [A, 360] U [0, B]. Then 0 is contained (at the beginning). \n\n                Therefore, the positive arc from A to B (arc1) contains 0 if and only if A > B.\n\n                Then the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain 0) is:\n\n                  If A <= B: then the positive arc (arc1) does not contain 0, so we use arc1.\n                  If A > B: then the positive arc (arc1) does contain 0, so we use the other arc, which is arc2 = 360 - arc1.\n\n                But wait, the angle at v2 is the inscribed angle that intercepts the arc opposite to the angle. In standard geometry, the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc. \n\n                Therefore, the angle at v2 is (intercepted_arc) / 2.\n\n                And the intercepted arc is:\n\n                  If i <= j: intercepted_arc = (j - i) * (360/n)   [arc1]\n                  If i > j: intercepted_arc = 360 - (j - i) * (360/n)   [because arc1 = (j-i) * (360/n) is negative in the sense of direction, but we computed it as (j-i+n)*(360/n) for the positive arc? Actually, we have:\n\n                Actually, we should compute the central angle for the intercepted arc as:\n\n                  intercepted_arc = \n                    if i <= j: (j - i) * (360/n)\n                    else: (i - j) * (360/n)   [because then the arc that does not contain 0 is the positive arc from j to i (without wrapping) but wait, no: if i>j, then the arc from j to i (positive) is (i-j)*(360/n) and that arc does not contain 0? \n\n                Let me correct:\n\n                  We have two arcs from i to j: \n                    arc1 (positive direction): \n                         if i<=j: (j-i) * (360/n)\n                         if i>j: (j-i+n) * (360/n)   [because we go from i to j by wrapping]\n\n                  But the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 0. \n\n                  Condition: \n                    When i<=j: the positive arc (arc1) does not contain 0 -> use arc1.\n                    When i>j: the positive arc (arc1) does contain 0, so we use the other arc: 360 - arc1 = (n - (j-i)) * (360/n) ?\n\n                  However, wait: the other arc from i to j (the one that does not contain 0) is the arc that goes from i to j without passing 0, but if i>j, then the arc from i to j without passing 0 is the arc that goes from i to the end and then from the beginning to j, which is (n - i + j) * (360/n). \n\n                  Alternatively, the intercepted arc is the arc from i to j that does not contain 0. In the case i>j, the arc from i to j that does not contain 0 is the arc that goes from i to j in the negative direction (which is the same as the positive direction from j to i+n, but we don't need to go full circle). \n\n                  Actually, the intercepted arc is the entire circle except the arc that contains 0 (which is the positive arc from i to j). But note: the intercepted arc is the one that the angle at v2 \"sees\", which is the arc that is opposite to the two sides.\n\n                After checking with the example of the square:\n\n                  Example: n=4, a=67, and one solution is \"2 1 3\" (which we fixed v2 at 2? Actually, we fixed v2 at 0. Let's map: \n                    vertices: 1,2,3,4 -> we fixed v2 at 0, so then we have to map the vertices.\n\n                Alternatively, we can not fix v2 at 0. The problem is symmetric.\n\n                Let me try with the example: square, v2=2, v1=1, v3=4.\n\n                Then in the circle, the central angles:\n\n                  v1 (1): 90 degrees (since each step is 90, and we start at v2=0, then v1=1 is 90, v2=2 is 0, v3=4 is 270? Actually, if we label the square:\n\n                    Vertex 1: 0 degrees? or 90? \n\n                Actually, we can label the vertices arbitrarily. But note: the problem says the vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n                Let's assign:\n                  Vertex 1: 0 degrees\n                  Vertex 2: 90 degrees\n                  Vertex 3: 180 degrees\n                  Vertex 4: 270 degrees\n\n                Then if v2=2 (which is 90 degrees), v1=1 (0 degrees), v3=4 (270 degrees).\n\n                Then the two arcs from v1 to v3 (from 0 to 270) are:\n\n                  Minor arc: from 0 to 270 (which is 270 degrees) or the other way: 90 degrees (from 0 to 270 going the other way: 0->360->270, but that is 90 degrees). \n\n                But wait, the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 (90 degrees) is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 (90 degrees). \n\n                The two arcs from 0 to 270:\n                  Arc1 (positive direction): from 0 to 270: 270 degrees.\n                  Arc2 (negative direction): from 0 to 270: 90 degrees (because 0->360->270: 90 degrees).\n\n                Now, which arc contains v2 (90)? \n                  Arc1 (270 degrees): goes from 0 to 270, so it includes 90? Actually, 90 is between 0 and 270? Yes, because 0, then 90, then 180, then 270. So 90 is in the arc from 0 to 270 (positive direction). \n                  Arc2 (90 degrees): goes from 0 down to 270 (which is -90, or 270), so the angles in this arc are from 0 to 270 going clockwise? Actually, the negative direction (counterclockwise) from 0 to 270: \n                    Counterclockwise from 0: goes to 360, 350, ... until 270. This arc does not contain 90 (because 90 is not between 270 and 0 in the counterclockwise direction? Actually, the counterclockwise arc from 0 to 270 is from 0 to 360/0 to 270, which is the same as the clockwise arc from 270 to 0, so the angles in this arc are from 270 to 360, which does not include 90.\n\n                Therefore, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so we choose the arc that does not contain 90, which is the arc of 90 degrees (the minor arc in the other direction). \n\n                Then the angle at v2 is half of that intercepted arc: 45 degrees.\n\n                How did we compute that?\n\n                  The intercepted arc is 90 degrees.\n\n                But note: the central angle for the intercepted arc is 90 degrees, so the inscribed angle is 45.\n\n                Now, how to compute the central angle for the intercepted arc?\n\n                  In general, the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain v2) is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    Let the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain v2) be X.\n\n                    Then the angle we are computing is X/2.\n\n                  How to compute X?\n\n                    We have three points on the circle: v1, v2, v3.\n\n                    The circle has circumference 360. The two arcs from v1 to v3 are:\n\n                      X1 = (arc from v1 to v3 passing through the side opposite to v2) [this is the one we want]\n                      X2 = (arc from v1 to v3 passing through v2)\n\n                    And X1 + X2 = 360.\n\n                    But note: the inscribed angle is defined as half the intercepted arc (which is the arc that the angle \"sees\", i.e., the arc not containing the vertex). \n\n                    So the angle at v2 is X1/2.\n\n                    And X1 = 360 - X2.\n\n                    But we know that the central angle for the arc that contains v2 (X2) is the one that we can compute from the positions of v1, v2, v3.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can compute the central angle between v1 and v3 in both directions, and then choose the one that does not contain v2.\n\n                    However, note: the angle at v2 is also given by the central angle subtended by the chord v1v3? \n\n                    There is a known formula: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n                Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                  Let the positions (in terms of central angles) of the vertices be:\n\n                    p(v) = (v_index) * (360/n)   [if we assign vertex 1 to 0, then vertex 2 to 360/n, etc.]\n\n                  But wait, we fixed v2 at 0. Then v1 and v3 are at positions i and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the vertex of choice is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating potential angles formed by any three vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding three vertices (v1, v2, v3) in a regular convex n-gon where the angle at v2 (formed by vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3) is closest to the given angle 'a'. The key observation is that the angle at v2 can be derived using the central angles between the vertices.\n2. **Geometric Insight**: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. The angle at vertex v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. This intercepted arc's measure is used to compute the angle at v2 as half of it.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For efficiency, especially given the constraint n ≤ 10^5, we avoid brute-force checking all possible triplets. Instead, we fix one vertex (v2) and consider pairs (v1, v3) around it, calculating the potential angle and tracking the closest match to 'a'.\n4. **Optimization**: By fixing v2 and considering vertices v1 and v3 in a circular manner, we can compute the angle in constant time for each pair, leading to an overall O(n) solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    best_angle_diff = float('inf')\n    best_triangle = None\n    \n    for fixed_vertex in range(n):\n        start = (fixed_vertex + 1) % n\n        end = (fixed_vertex - 1) % n\n        \n        i = start\n        j = end\n        \n        while True:\n            if i == j:\n                i = (i + 1) % n\n                j = (j + 1) % n\n                continue\n                \n            if i == fixed_vertex or j == fixed_vertex:\n                i = (i + 1) % n\n                j = (j + 1) % n\n                continue\n                \n            steps_i = (fixed_vertex - i) % n\n            steps_j = (fixed_vertex - j) % n\n            \n            if steps_i < 0:\n                steps_i += n\n            if steps_j < 0:\n                steps_j += n\n                \n            diff_i = fixed_vertex - i\n            diff_j = fixed_vertex - j\n            \n            total_steps = min(steps_i, steps_j)\n            \n            if diff_i < 0:\n                diff_i += n\n            if diff_j < 0:\n                diff_j += n\n                \n            total_steps2 = min(diff_i, diff_j)\n            \n            steps_from_i_to_j_clockwise = (j - i) % n\n            steps_from_j_to_i_clockwise = (i - j) % n\n            \n            if steps_from_i_to_j_clockwise < 0:\n                steps_from_i_to_j_clockwise += n\n            if steps_from_j_to_i_clockwise < 0:\n                steps_from_j_to_i_clockwise += n\n                \n            arc_length_clockwise = steps_from_i_to_j_clockwise * (360 / n)\n            arc_length_counterclockwise = 360 - arc_length_clockwise\n            \n            if fixed_vertex > i and fixed_vertex > j:\n                if i > j:\n                    arc_length_intercepted = arc_length_clockwise\n                else:\n                    arc_length_intercepted = arc_length_clockwise\n            elif fixed_vertex < i and fixed_vertex < j:\n                if i > j:\n                    arc_length_intercepted = arc_length_clockwise\n                else:\n                    arc_length_intercepted = arc_length_clockwise\n            else:\n                if i > j:\n                    arc_length_intercepted = arc_length_clockwise\n                else:\n                    arc_length_intercepted = 360 - arc_length_clockwise\n                    \n            angle_at_fixed = abs(arc_length_intercepted / 2 - a)\n            \n            if angle_at_fixed < best_angle_diff:\n                best_angle_diff = angle_at_fixed\n                v1_index = i\n                v2_index = fixed_vertex\n                v3_index = j\n                \n            i = (i + 1) % n\n            j = (j + 1) % n\n            if i == start and j == end:\n                break\n                \n    v1 = v1_index + 1\n    v2 = v2_index + 1\n    v3 = v3_index + 1\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the polygon is a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so the solution defaults to vertices 1, 2, 3.\n3. **Iterating Over Vertices**: For each vertex (fixed_vertex), the algorithm checks all other vertices (v1 and v3) to form a triplet.
