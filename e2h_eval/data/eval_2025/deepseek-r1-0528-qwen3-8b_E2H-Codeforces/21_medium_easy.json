The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) for chests and one of m integers (b_j) for keys.\n\n Condition: a chest i can be opened by key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) is odd, i.e., \n   (a_i % 2 == 0 and b_j % 2 == 1) OR (a_i % 2 == 1 and b_j % 2 == 0)\n\n Since one key can open at most one chest and vice versa, we are to find the maximum matching between chests and keys that satisfy the condition.\n\n Observation:\n   The condition depends only on the parity (even/odd) of the numbers.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_count = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_count = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   For even chests: we need odd keys. The maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is min(even_count, odd_keys)\n   For odd chests: we need even keys. The maximum matching from odd chests to even keys is min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n However, wait: is that really independent? Actually, yes because the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint and the two sets of chests (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice. However, in our breakdown, we are using odd keys for even chests and even keys for odd chests. There is no overlap in keys used. Similarly, there is no overlap in chests.\n\n Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n   total = min(even_count, odd_keys) + min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> parities: [odd, even, even, even, odd]\n        even_count = 3, odd_count = 2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> parities: [even, even, odd, even]\n        even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then: \n        even_count (3) uses odd_keys (1) -> min(3,1)=1\n        odd_count (2) uses even_keys (3) -> min(2,3)=2\n        Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_count=5, odd_count=0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd -> even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n\n        even_count (5) uses odd_keys (1) -> min(5,1)=1\n        odd_count (0) uses even_keys (0) -> 0\n        Total = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n        Chest: [10] -> even_count=1, odd_count=0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n        even_count (1) uses odd_keys (0) -> 0\n        odd_count (0) uses even_keys (4) -> 0\n        Total = 0 -> matches.\n\n So the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count the number of even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Then compute:\n        part1 = min(even_count, odd_keys)\n        part2 = min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n   Print part1 + part2.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so counting is efficient.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to specific parity conditions: an even-numbered chest must be paired with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be paired with an even-numbered key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity conditions. Each chest and key can be used at most once, so the solution involves finding the maximum bipartite matching between two disjoint sets:\n   - Chests with even numbers paired with keys having odd numbers.\n   - Chests with odd numbers paired with keys having even numbers.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on counting how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and the keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the list of keys.\n   - Calculating the possible matches for each category (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys) and summing them up.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves linear scans of the input lists to count parities, resulting in an O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is optimal for the given constraints (n, m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n            \n    even_keys = 0\n    odd_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n        else:\n            odd_keys += 1\n            \n    part1 = min(even_count, odd_keys)\n    part2 = min(odd_count, even_keys)\n    \n    print(part1 + part2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests have even and odd numbers, and similarly for the keys.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of even chests that can be matched with odd keys and the maximum number of odd chests that can be matched with even keys. These two values are summed to get the total number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two calculated values.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened without any complex computations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
