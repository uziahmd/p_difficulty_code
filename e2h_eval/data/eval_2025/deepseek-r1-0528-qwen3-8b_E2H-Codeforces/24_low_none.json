She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (with boundaries defined by the current minimum and maximum unclosed tab indices)\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that initially all tabs from 1 to n are open, and we want to leave only [l, r] open.\n\n The idea is to consider that we need to close:\n   - All tabs with index < l (left part)\n   - All tabs with index > r (right part)\n\n We can close the left part by being at a tab i (where i <= l) and then closing the left side (which will close everything from the current left boundary to i-1). Similarly for the right.\n\n But note: when we close, the boundaries change. However, the problem is small (n<=100) so we can consider cases.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: If the desired segment [l, r] is the entire set of tabs (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n Otherwise, we have two sides to close: left (if l>1) and right (if r<n).\n\n We are allowed to move the cursor and then close. Also note that after some closing operations, the boundaries change.\n\n However, note the operations: \n   - When we close the left, we set the new left boundary to the current cursor's tab (and similarly for the right).\n   - But note: the problem says that the cursor is always at an unclosed tab? Actually, the problem states that the cursor moves in the current set of unclosed tabs.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can think of two independent tasks: closing the left part and closing the right part.\n\n But note: we can interleave movements and closings.\n\n However, note the following:\n\n  Option 1: Close the left part first and then the right part.\n      Steps:\n        - Move to the left boundary (or to a tab from which we can close the left part) and then close the left.\n        - Then move to the right boundary (for closing the right) and then close the right.\n\n  Option 2: Close the right part first and then the left part.\n\n  Option 3: Maybe we can do one closing while the other is done by moving? But note: closing operations only close entire sides.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that we have to cover two intervals: [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n How about we consider the following:\n\n  Let A = number of seconds to close the left part (if needed) and B = number of seconds to close the right part (if needed).\n\n  But note: we start at `pos`. We might have to move to the left part and then close, then move to the right part and then close, or vice versa.\n\n  However, we can also consider:\n\n  - If the entire segment [l, r] is already the whole set, then 0.\n\n  - If there is no left part (l == 1) and no right part (r == n), then 0.\n\n  - Otherwise, we have two possibilities:\n\n    Possibility 1: Close the left part and then the right part.\n\n        Steps for left part:\n          - We must get to a tab that is <= l (because we want to close the left part from a tab that is at least l? Actually, we can close the left from any tab that is at least the left boundary we wish to keep? Let me clarify:\n\n        According to the operation: \"close all the tabs to the left\" will close the segment [a, i-1]. We wish to leave [l, r]. So if we are at a tab i (which must be >= l) and we close the left, then we remove [a, i-1]. But note that a is the current minimum index. Initially a=1. After closing, the new a becomes i. To remove all tabs below l, we must have i-1 at least as large as l? Actually, no: we want to remove all tabs from the current left boundary (which is 1) up to i-1. We want to remove everything < l. So if we set i to be l, then we remove [1, l-1] exactly. Similarly, for the right: we set i to be r, then we remove [r+1, b] (which is [r+1, n]).\n\n        Therefore, to close the left part we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that we don't accidentally close some part of [l, r]). Similarly, to close the right part we must be at a tab i <= r.\n\n        Now,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given tab position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and considering the most efficient sequence of operations to achieve the desired result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (within the current unclosed tabs) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The key insight is that closing operations can be performed from the boundaries of the desired segment.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n) is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - Otherwise, we need to close tabs to the left of l and/or right of r.\n   - The optimal strategy involves moving the cursor to the appropriate boundary (either l or r) and then performing the closing operation.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Check if the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (l == 1 and r == n). If yes, output 0.\n   - Calculate the time required to move to the left boundary (if l > 1) and perform the left closing operation.\n   - Similarly, calculate the time for the right boundary (if r < n).\n   - The total time is the sum of the time taken for each necessary operation, considering the starting position and movement directions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l_val > 1)\n    right_needed = (r_val < n)\n    \n    time_left = 0\n    time_right = 0\n    \n    if left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l_val)\n        time_left = steps + 1\n        \n    if right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r_val)\n        time_right = steps + 1\n        \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        if left_needed and right_needed:\n            print(min(time_left + time_right - 2 * min(abs(pos - l_val), abs(pos - r_val)), \n                     time_left + time_right - 1))\n        elif left_needed:\n            print(time_left)\n        else:\n            print(time_right)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] includes all tabs (l == 1 and r == n), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Left and Right Operations**: Determine if operations are needed on the left (l > 1) or right (r < n) of the segment.\n3. **Time Calculation**:\n   - For the left operation, calculate the steps to move from the starting position to l, then add one second for the closing operation.\n   - Similarly for the right operation, calculate steps to move to r and add one second for closing.\n4. **Combining Operations**: If both left and right operations are needed, the minimal time is derived by considering the overlap in movement paths. The solution efficiently computes the minimal time by adjusting for the closest boundary first.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed based on whether left, right, or both operations are required, ensuring optimal path calculation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal time is computed by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks.",
