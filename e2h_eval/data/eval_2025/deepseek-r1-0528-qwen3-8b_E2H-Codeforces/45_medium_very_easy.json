There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament structure is constrained by the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to allow the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n The key idea is that the tournament can be broken down into rounds, and the winner must go through several rounds. However, the constraint on the difference of games played may force us to arrange the bracket in a way that the winner has opponents that are \"close\" in terms of their game counts.\n\n Alternatively, consider:\n\n - The winner must win k games. Then, the tournament must have at least 2^k players? Not exactly, because the tournament doesn't have to be balanced.\n\n But note: the problem allows non-standard arrangements as long as the rule holds. However, we know that the winner must beat k opponents, and each opponent must have come from a subtree of the tournament.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to building a binary tree (each match has two players) but with a twist: the winner can have two types of wins: one type from matches where he plays against someone who has played x games, and the next type against someone who has played x or x+1 games (but the rule says at most one difference).\n\n However, note the example:\n\n   Input: 4 -> Output: 2\n\n   Explanation: With 4 players, the winner can play 2 games. One way is to have two semifinals and then the final.\n\n   But why not 3? Because to play 3 games, the winner would have to beat three opponents. However, with 4 players, you can't have three wins for the same player without having more than 3 players? Actually, let's see:\n\n   Tournament with 4 players: \n      Round 1: two semifinals (player1 vs player2, player3 vs player4)\n      Then the winner (say player1) must play against the winner of the other semifinal (player3 or player4). So only 2 games.\n\n   Now, what if we have 5 players?\n\n   How can the winner play 3 games? We need to have at least 5 players.\n\n   Example with 5 players:\n\n   One possibility: \n        First, we can have a bye for one player? But wait, the problem does not specify byes. Actually, the problem says two players can play only if the condition holds.\n\n   However, note the problem: \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one\"\n\n   So, for the winner to play 3 games, we need to set up the tournament such that the winner can accumulate 3 wins.\n\n   Let me try:\n\n   We have 5 players: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n   We want player1 to win 3 games.\n\n   Game 1: player1 vs player2 -> player1 wins (now player1 has 1 game, and players left: 1,3,4,5)\n\n   Now, we cannot have player1 play again immediately because then the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 game. But the next opponent must have won at least one game (so they must have at least one game). However, we have two other players (3,4,5) who haven't played. But they haven't played any game. So the rule says: two players can play only if their game counts differ by at most one. Currently, player1 has 1 and the others have 0. Then the difference is 1, so they can play.\n\n   But wait, the rule applies to both: if we pair player1 (with 1 game) with a player that hasn't played (0 games), that's allowed (difference 1). However, we can also pair two unplayed players together.\n\n   However, we are trying to maximize the winner's games.\n\n   So, after the first game, we have:\n\n        Option 1: Play two more games that involve the remaining players without using the winner until the next round.\n\n        But note: the winner must win all his games. So we need to set up the tournament so that the winner faces opponents that are available according to the rule.\n\n   Let's build:\n\n        Game 1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins (games: 1 has 1, others 0)\n        Now, we can have two possibilities:\n\n          Possibility A: Have two players (the ones not including 1) play a game: say 3 vs 4 -> 5 wins? No, we need to set the bracket.\n\n        Actually, we need to design the entire bracket. The rule must hold for every game.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a recursive or mathematical approach.\n\n   After reading the examples:\n\n        Input: 2 -> 1\n        Input: 3 -> 2\n        Input: 4 -> 2\n        Input: 10 -> 4\n\n   Let me check n=3:\n\n        With 3 players, the winner must play 2 games.\n\n        How?\n          We have 3 players: [1,2,3]\n\n          One way: \n            First, have two games? But wait, with 3 players, we can do:\n\n            Option 1: \n                Game1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins (then we have two players: 1 and 3). Then Game2: 1 vs 3 -> 1 wins. So two games.\n\n            Option 2: \n                But can we have a different arrangement? The rule: when 1 has 0, then 1 vs 2 is allowed (both 0 and 0 -> difference 0). Then after winning, 1 has 1, and 3 has 0. Then 1 vs 3 is allowed (difference 1). So yes.\n\n        Now, n=4: maximum 2 games (as explained above).\n\n        n=5: \n\n          We want the winner to play 3 games.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Let the winner be 1.\n\n          Game1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins (now 1 has 1 game)\n\n          Now, we have 3,4,5 left.\n\n          We can arrange the remaining three players in a way that produces one winner (say from 3,4,5) and then 1 will face that winner.\n\n          But wait, the winner from 3,4,5 must have played one game (if arranged in a standard way). Then 1 (with 1 game) vs that winner (with 1 game) is allowed.\n\n          However, we need three wins for 1. So we need two more games for 1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can have:\n\n          First, we need to have two more wins for 1, meaning two more opponents.\n\n          But the total number of players is 5. The winner must eliminate 4 opponents. However, in a knockout tournament, the total number of games is 4, but the winner only participates in 3 of them.\n\n          How to arrange 5 players?\n\n          One way:\n\n            Round1: \n                Game1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins (1 has 1 game)\n                Game2: 3 vs 4 -> 3 wins (3 has 1 game)\n                Now, we have two winners: 1 and 3, and one player left: 5 (with 0 games).\n\n            Now, we have three players: 1 (1 game), 3 (1 game), 5 (0 games).\n\n            Then, we can have:\n\n                Game3: 1 vs 5 -> 1 wins (1 has 2 games)\n                Then, we have two players: 1 (2 games) and 3 (1 game). The difference is 1, so they can play.\n\n                Game4: 1 vs 3 -> 1 wins (1 has 3 games)\n\n          But wait, in the first round we used 4 players (1,2,3,4) and left 5. Then we have 3 rounds for player1: 3 wins.\n\n          However, is this valid for the rule at every step?\n\n            Game1: 1 and 2 (both 0) -> ok.\n            Game2: 3 and 4 (both 0) -> ok.\n            Game3: 1 (1 game) and 5 (0 games) -> difference 1 -> ok.\n            Game4: 1 (2 games) and 3 (1 game) -> difference 1 -> ok.\n\n          So yes, with 5 players, the winner can play 3 games.\n\n          Now, what is the pattern?\n\n          We can observe:\n\n            n=2: 1\n            n=3: 2\n            n=4: 2\n            n=5: 3\n            n=6: 3\n            n=7: 3\n            n=8: 3\n            n=9: 4\n\n          It seems that the maximum number of games for the winner is the largest integer k such that:\n\n            k*(k+1)//2 + 1 <= n   ?\n\n          Why? Because the tournament structure can be thought of as a complete binary tree with k levels, but the winner must have k wins, and the total number of players required is:\n\n            In the path of the winner, we have k wins, and at each round (except the last) the winner must have beaten one player, and the players that the winner beats must themselves have beaten some players (until the leaves). \n\n          Alternatively, consider the entire tournament as being built in rounds, but the winner must accumulate k wins. The minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins is:\n\n            Let f(0) = 1 (the winner by default, no game)\n            To have the first win, we need at least 2 players (including the winner). Then the winner must have one win.\n\n            For the second win, the winner must have played one game, and then we need to have one more opponent. But the opponent must have been obtained by playing a match, so we need at least one other player (who might have been alone or from a previous match). Actually, the minimal construction:\n\n            k=0: 1 player (the winner)\n            k=1: 2 players (the winner and one opponent)\n            k=2: 3 players? Actually, no: with 3 players, we can have the winner play two games. But the minimal number for k wins is:\n\n            We can represent the tournament as a full binary tree with k levels (for the winner's path) and the leaves are the players. However, the entire tournament must have at least the winner and the players eliminated along his path.\n\n            Actually, the minimal n for k wins is the sum of the first k+1 triangular numbers? Or something else.\n\n          Another way: \n\n            The winner's path: \n              Level 0: 1 player (the winner, 0 games)\n              Level 1: 1 player (the first opponent, which requires 1 additional player: the one that the opponent beat? Actually, no: the first opponent is just one player, but that player didn't have to win any game. So the first win requires 2 players.\n\n            However, for the second win, the winner must have one game, and the opponent must have either 0 or 1 game. \n\n            We can have two cases for the second win:\n\n            Case 1: The opponent has 0 games (then we haven't used that opponent's potential to eliminate others). Then the total players so far: winner, first opponent, and second opponent -> 3 players.\n\n            But we can also use a structure where the second opponent has 1 game. Then the second opponent must have won a preliminary match. That requires 2 players for that match. So total players: winner, first opponent, and the two players that the second opponent beat (one of which is the second opponent) -> wait, no: the second opponent is one player, and that player beat one other player. So the second opponent and that one other player make 2. Then total: winner (1) + first opponent (1) + second opponent and the one he beat (2) -> 4.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal n for k=2 (two wins) is 3? But wait, we saw that with 3 players we can have two wins. So the minimal n for k wins is the smallest n such that we can form a chain for the winner to win k games.\n\n            Actually, the minimal n for k wins is:\n\n              k=0: 1\n              k=1: 2\n              k=2: 3\n              k=3: 5? (because for the third win, we need the third opponent to have 1 or 2 games. If we use an opponent with 2 games, then that opponent must have beaten two players, so that gives 3 players (the two that the third opponent beat, plus the third opponent). Then total: 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (second opponent and the one he beat) + 3 (the third opponent and the two he beat) -> wait, no: actually, the third opponent must have 2 wins, so he must have beaten two players. Then the total number of players is 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (second opponent and his one opponent) + 3 (third opponent and his two opponents) = 1+1+2+3 = 7? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the minimal n by having the third opponent having 1 game. Then the third opponent must have beaten one player. Then total: 1 (winner) + 1 (first) + 1 (second) + 2 (the third opponent and the one he beat) = 5.\n\n            So the minimal n for k=3 is 5.\n\n            Similarly, for k=4, the minimal n is 1+1+2+ (then for the fourth win, we can choose an opponent with 2 or 3 games). \n\n            We can model it as:\n\n              Let T(k) be the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\n              Then, for k wins, the winner must have k-1 wins already, and then one more win against an opponent.\n\n              The opponent for the k-th win must have either:\n\n                a) 0, 1, 2, ... , k-1 games? But the rule allows up to k-1 (if the winner has k-1, then the opponent can have k-2 or k-1). However, we are building minimally.\n\n              Actually, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n                T(0) = 1\n                T(1) = 2\n                T(2) = 3\n                T(3) = 5\n\n              This looks like the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n              But let me check:\n\n                k=0: 1\n                k=1: 2\n                k=2: 3 -> T(2) = T(1) + T(0) ? 2+1=3 -> yes.\n                k=3: T(3) = T(2) + T(1) = 3+2=5 -> yes.\n\n              Then T(4) = T(3)+T(2)=5+3=8\n                    T(5)=13, etc.\n\n              Now, note the sample: \n                n=10 -> output=4\n\n              For k=4, minimal n is 8. Then for n=8, the winner can play 4 games.\n\n              Then for n=10, since 10>=8, the maximum wins is 4.\n\n              How about n=9? 9>=8 -> so 4 wins.\n\n              But wait, the example input 10 gives 4. So our answer for n=10 is 4.\n\n              What if n=8? then 4 wins.\n\n              What if n=7? \n                T(3)=5, T(4)=8 -> so for n=7, the maximum wins is 3? (since 7<8, so we cannot get 4 wins)\n\n              Now, let's verify with n=5: \n                T(3)=5 -> so n=5 gives 3 wins -> matches.\n\n              And n=3: T(2)=3 -> so 2 wins -> matches.\n\n              And n=4: \n                T(2)=3, T(3)=5 -> since 4<5, then the maximum wins is 2 -> matches.\n\n              And n=2: T(1)=2 -> wins=1 -> matches.\n\n              And n=1: not in the range (n>=2) but anyway.\n\n          So the solution:\n\n            We are given n (number of players). We need to find the maximum k (number of wins) such that T(k) <= n.\n\n            Where T(0)=1, T(1)=2, and for k>=2, T(k)=T(k-1)+T(k-2)\n\n            Actually, T(k) is defined for k>=0 as the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number? Let me list:\n\n              k: 0 -> 1\n                 1 -> 2\n                 2 -> 3\n                 3 -> 5\n                 4 -> 8\n                 5 -> 13\n\n            The Fibonacci sequence usually starts: F0=0, F1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, ...\n\n            So T(k) = F_{k+2} (if we define F1=1, F2=2, then F3=3, F4=5, ...) but wait:\n\n            Alternatively, we can index the Fibonacci sequence as:\n\n              fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, fib(6)=8, fib(7)=13.\n\n            Then T(k) = fib(k+2) doesn't hold because:\n\n              k=0: fib(2)=1 -> matches.\n              k=1: fib(3)=2 -> matches.\n              k=2: fib(4)=3 -> matches.\n              k=3: fib(5)=5 -> matches.\n\n            So yes, T(k) = fib(k+2) (using the standard Fibonacci starting at index 0: fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, fib(6)=8, ...)\n\n            But wait: the standard Fibonacci sequence is defined as:\n              fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(n)=fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)\n\n            Then:\n              fib(0)=0\n              fib(1)=1\n              fib(2)=1\n              fib(3)=2\n              fib(4)=3\n              fib(5)=5\n              fib(6)=8\n              fib(7)=13\n\n            So T(k) = fib(k+2) is correct.\n\n            However, note: the problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in, which is exactly k (the number of wins).\n\n            So we need to find the maximum k such that fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n            But note: the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. Since n can be up to 10**18, we can compute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Let k=0, and we know T(0)=1, T(1)=2, T(2)=3, T(3)=5, etc.\n\n              We can generate Fibonacci numbers until we get one that is greater than n, and then the previous one is the T(k) for k being the last valid.\n\n              But note: we want the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n            Example: n=10\n\n              k=0: fib(2)=1 <=10 -> valid, k=0\n              k=1: fib(3)=2<=10 -> valid, k=1\n              k=2: fib(4)=3<=10 -> valid, k=2\n              k=3: fib(5)=5<=10 -> valid, k=3\n              k=4: fib(6)=8<=10 -> valid, k=4\n              k=5: fib(7)=13>10 -> invalid.\n\n              Then the maximum k is 4.\n\n            But wait, k here is the index in T(k)=fib(k+2). So the number of wins is k? \n\n            Actually, the number of wins is k (the k we are iterating) because:\n\n              T(0)=1 -> 0 wins (just the winner, no games)\n              T(1)=2 -> 1 win\n              T(2)=3 -> 2 wins\n              T(3)=5 -> 3 wins\n              T(4)=8 -> 4 wins\n\n            So the answer is k (the last k for which T(k)<=n).\n\n            However, note: the example input 2 -> output 1, which corresponds to k=1 (since T(1)=2<=2, then k=1). \n\n            So we are returning k (the exponent) as the number of wins.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n              We want to find the maximum k (nonnegative integer) such that fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n              Steps:\n\n                Let a, b = 1, 1   [but wait, we need fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, ...]\n\n                Actually, we can start:\n\n                  fib0 = 0\n                  fib1 = 1\n                  fib2 = 1\n                  fib3 = 2\n                  fib4 = 3\n\n                But we want T(k)=fib_{k+2}. \n\n                Alternatively, we can define:\n\n                  Let i = 0, and we are going to iterate until we have a Fibonacci number > n.\n\n                We are interested in the Fibonacci numbers for indices 2,3,... until we exceed n.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  fib0 = 0\n                  fib1 = 1\n                  # Then fib2 = 1, fib3=2, fib4=3, fib5=5, ...\n\n                But we want to check:\n\n                  k=0: fib2 = 1\n                  k=1: fib3 = 2\n                  k=2: fib4 = 3\n                  k=3: fib5 = 5\n\n                We can generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n                However, note: the Fibonacci numbers grow very fast (exponential). Since n can be up to 10**18, we only need about 90 iterations (because Fibonacci numbers grow as fast as the golden ratio to the power n).\n\n            Implementation:\n\n              We'll use:\n\n                a, b = 0, 1   # a = fib0, b = fib1\n                count = 0       # we are going to count the index in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n                But we need to check fib_{index} for index from 2 upwards until we exceed n.\n\n                Actually, we don't care about the index, we care about the value.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let i = 2 (which corresponds to T(0)=fib2)\n                  But wait, we can start from:\n\n                  We know:\n                    fib0 = 0\n                    fib1 = 1\n                    fib2 = 1\n                    fib3 = 2\n                    fib4 = 3\n                    fib5 = 5\n\n                  We want to check for k from 0 to ... such that fib_{k+2} <= n.\n\n                  We can iterate:\n\n                    Let k = 0, then fib_{k+2}=fib2=1\n                    k=1: fib3=2\n                    k=2: fib4=3\n                    ...\n\n                  We can generate Fibonacci numbers and count how many we can have until exceeding n, then the k is the index minus 2? \n\n                Alternatively, we can generate until we have a Fibonacci number that exceeds n, and then the number of wins is the index of the last Fibonacci number that was <= n, minus 2, but wait.\n\n                Actually, the k (number of wins) is the index i (in the Fibonacci sequence) minus 2? \n\n                But note: \n                  When k=0, we are at fib2 -> index2, then k = 2 - 2 = 0.\n                  k=1: fib3 -> index3, then k = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\n                So k = index - 2.\n\n                But we don't know the index. We can generate until we exceed n, and then subtract the index by which we exceeded.\n\n                Better: \n\n                  Let fib0 = 0, fib1 = 1.\n                  Then we want to consider fib2, fib3, ... until we exceed n.\n\n                  Let count = 2   (meaning we are generating fib2)\n                  Then, while fib2 <= n:\n                      count++ (to generate next)\n                      fib_next = fib0 + fib1   (but we are shifting)\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                  a, b = 0, 1   # a = fib0, b = fib1\n                  k = 0          # number of wins we are going to return is k, but we are going to iterate until we get a Fibonacci number for T(k) (which is fib_{k+2}) that is <= n.\n\n                  But note: we want to check fib_{k+2} for k=0,1,2,...\n\n                  Instead, we can:\n\n                    Let i = 2   (the index we are at in the Fibonacci sequence) and then we are going to compute fib_i until we exceed n.\n\n                    Then the maximum k is i-2.\n\n                However, we don't know the index i, but we can compute the Fibonacci numbers and keep track of the index.\n\n                Alternatively, we can note that the number of wins k is the same as the index i (in the Fibonacci sequence) minus 2, but we are generating the Fibonacci numbers for indices starting from 2.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  fib0 = 0\n                  fib1 = 1\n                  # We want to consider fib2, fib3, ... \n\n                  Let x = 1   (this is fib2, for k=0)\n                  wins = 0\n\n                  Then while x <= n:\n                    # Then k = wins (which is the current wins) is valid.\n                    Then we compute the next Fibonacci number: fib3 = fib0 + fib1 = 0+1=1? No, we should update properly.\n\n                  Let me reinitialize:\n\n                    a, b = 0, 1   # a = fib0, b = fib1\n                    Then next is fib2 = a+b = 1, then set a=b, b=fib2.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                    a, b = 0, 1\n                    # We are at fib0 and fib1.\n\n                    Then we want to consider fib2 = a+b = 1 -> then k=0 (wins) is valid.\n\n                    Then update: a, b = b, a+b   -> now a=1, b=1 (which is fib1 and fib2)\n\n                    Then fib3 = a+b = 1+1=2 -> k=1 is valid.\n\n                    Then update: a, b = b, a+b -> a=1, b=2 (fib2 and fib3)\n\n                    Then fib4 = a+b = 1+2=3 -> k=2 is valid.\n\n                    Then update: a, b = 2, 3\n\n                    Then fib5 = 2+3=5 -> k=3 is valid.\n\n                    Then update: a, b = 3,5\n\n                    Then fib6=3+5=8 -> k=4 is valid.\n\n                    Then update: a, b=5,8\n\n                    Then fib7=5+8=13 -> k=5: 13>10 (if n=10) -> stop.\n\n                    Then the answer is k=4.\n\n                  But note: k is the number of wins, and we are counting the wins as the index in the Fibonacci sequence for the current fib value (which is T(k)) is k+2.\n\n                  In the loop, we are generating fib_{i} for i from 2 to ... \n\n                  The variable 'a' becomes fib_{i-2} and 'b' becomes fib_{i-1} at the start of the loop?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using the Fibonacci sequence, where the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games corresponds to the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that each game eliminates one player, and the winner must win all their games. The constraint is that two players can only compete if their previous game counts differ by at most one. This leads us to observe that the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games is the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This is because each Fibonacci number in this sequence represents the minimal players required for the winner to have `k` wins.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively, starting from the base values (0 and 1), and check if each subsequent Fibonacci number (which corresponds to `T(k) = fib_{k+2}`) is less than or equal to `n`. The loop continues until the Fibonacci number exceeds `n`, and the count of valid `k` values gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently generates Fibonacci numbers until the condition is met. Given that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, the number of iterations required is logarithmic in `n`, making the solution efficient even for very large `n` (up to \\(10^{18}\\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a, b = 0, 1\n    k = 0\n    while True:\n        fib_k2 = a + b\n        if fib_k2 > n:\n            break\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, fib_k2\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players in the tournament.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the winner plays 0 games, so the output is 0.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The algorithm initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, representing the first two Fibonacci numbers. It then enters a loop where it calculates the next Fibonacci number (`fib_k2`) as the sum of `a` and `b`.\n4. **Condition Check**: For each generated Fibonacci number, the code checks if it is greater than `n`. If it is, the loop breaks; otherwise, it increments `k` (the count of valid games the winner can play) and updates `a` and `b` to the next pair of Fibonacci numbers.\n5. **Output Result**: After exiting the loop, the value of `k` is printed, which represents the maximum number of games the winner can participate in under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the solution with minimal computational overhead, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
