Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and the university are in some blocks (regions). The movement from one block to another is allowed only if they share a common border (i.e., the two regions are separated by exactly one road). Therefore, moving from home to university requires crossing a set of roads.\n\n However, note that we are not just counting the roads between the two points, but the minimum number of steps (each step being a move from one block to an adjacent block with a nonzero common border). But note: the problem says that in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero. This essentially means that we can cross one road at a time, and each crossing moves us to an adjacent block.\n\n But note: the entire journey might require crossing several roads, and the minimal steps would be the minimal number of road crossings? However, observe that the regions are divided by multiple roads, and the home and university are in two different regions. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of road crossings required to get from the home region to the university region.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes you can cross multiple roads at once? But note the definition: a step is defined as moving from one block to another only if they share a nonzero border. So we are effectively crossing one road at a time.\n\n But consider: if two roads are parallel, then they don't intersect, so the plane is divided by two parallel lines. Then the regions are three (or more if more parallels) and the two points might be separated by one or two roads. However, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to count the number of roads between the two points, because the same road might separate the two points from multiple directions. Actually, we can think of it as: we start at home and we want to get to university. We must cross every road that separates the two points.\n\n But wait: if a road has the home and university on opposite sides, then we must cross that road. If they are on the same side, we don't. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points (i.e., the roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides).\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1, 1)\n        University: (-1, -1)\n        Roads: \n            \"0 1 0\" -> x = 0 (vertical line through origin)\n            \"1 0 0\" -> y = 0 (horizontal line through origin)\n\n   How many roads separate the two points?\n     For x=0: \n        At home: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0.\n        At university: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite, so cross.\n     For y=0:\n        At home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 > 0.\n        At university: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite, so cross.\n\n   Therefore, we must cross two roads. So the answer is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n        Home: (1,1)\n        University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads:\n            \"1 0 0\" -> x=0\n            \"0 1 0\" -> y=0\n            \"1 1 -3\" -> x+y-3=0\n\n   Now, check the third road:\n        At home: 1+1-3 = -1 < 0.\n        At university: -1-1-3 = -5 < 0 -> same side, so no crossing.\n\n   Therefore, only two roads separate the two points, so the answer is 2.\n\n But wait, what if the roads are not aligned with the axes?\n\n Consider: Each road is a line. The condition for a road i separating the two points is:\n        sign(ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci) != sign(ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci)\n\n So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the blocks are defined by the arrangement of all the roads. The step condition is that we can move across a nonzero border (i.e., we cross one road at a time). Therefore, we must cross every road that separates the two points.\n\n But note: if two roads are crossed in one step? Actually, no. Because when you cross one road, you enter a new block. Then to cross another road, you have to do another step. However, if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in specific blocks, and the minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate these two blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). For a road to separate the two points, they must lie on opposite sides of the line. This is determined by evaluating the sign of \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the road separates them.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating through each road and checking if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. The count of such roads gives the minimal number of steps needed, as each step corresponds to crossing one such road.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing a constant-time check for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the code checks if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the road. This is done by evaluating the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: If the signs of the expressions for the two points differ, the road is counted as separating them. The total count of such roads is the answer, representing the minimal steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the count of roads separating the two points.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging geometric properties of lines and point positions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
