Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n Since R, B are at most 10, we can use a combinatorial approach.\n\n However, note: We require a perfect matching (so R must equal B? Actually the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\" and \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so it's a bijection. Therefore, we require R == B. But the input might not necessarily have R==B? The example inputs do, but the problem says: \"For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, ...\", and then B lines. And the condition is that no two points coincide and no three are colinear.\n\n But note: the example input format is two integers R, B and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n\n However, the example input string is: '3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2' -> which means R=3, B=3.\n\n And the second example: '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1' -> R=2, B=1.\n\n But the problem says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\". So if R != B, then it's impossible. However, the example output for the second example is 'No'. But note: in the second example, R=2 and B=1, so we cannot assign two spaceships to one base (because each base must have exactly one guardian) and also we cannot assign two spaceships to two different bases because there is only one base. So the condition requires a bijection, hence R must equal B.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If R != B, output \"No\".\n 2. Otherwise, we have a set of R rebels and R bases (since R=B). We need to assign each base to one rebel such that the segments (from base to rebel) do not intersect (except at endpoints) and the assignment is a perfect matching.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\"\n\n This is equivalent to saying that the straight line segments connecting the bases to their assigned rebels should not cross.\n\n We can think of it as: we have 2R points (R rebels and R bases) and we want to pair each base with a rebel. The condition is that the segments (base_i, rebel_j) do not intersect.\n\n Note: Two segments AB and CD (with A,B being base/rebel pairs) would intersect if they are not nested. In fact, one standard way to check non-intersection is to consider the ordering of the points.\n\n Observation: We can fix an order for the bases and the rebels. For example, we can sort the bases and the rebels by their x-coordinate (and if x is same, by y-coordinate). Then, we can try to match the i-th base (in sorted order) with the i-th rebel (in sorted order). Why?\n\n Actually, consider the following: if we sort all the points (both bases and rebels) by x, then the matching that connects consecutive points (if we interleave the two sets) might be the one that does not cause crossings. But note: the problem does not require consecutive, but we can use the following idea:\n\n In computational geometry, a non-crossing matching between two sets of points (with the same cardinality) can be achieved by matching the leftmost base to the leftmost rebel, the next leftmost base to the next leftmost rebel, and so on? Not necessarily, because the relative positions might matter.\n\n However, note the condition: no three points are colinear and no two coincide.\n\n There is a well known fact: if you have two sets of points (say red and blue) and you want a non-crossing matching, then one way is to use the following:\n\n  Sort all the bases and all the rebels by x (and then y). Then, if we connect the i-th base (in sorted order) to the i-th rebel (in sorted order), then we must check that the segments do not cross. But note: even if we connect in sorted order, the segments might still cross if the points are interleaved in a bad way.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recursive or backtracking method since R, B <= 10 (but actually R=B<=10, so maximum 10! = 3628800 which is acceptable for worst-case in a contest but we can do better).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"perfect matching\" and the condition is that the segments do not cross. We can use the following:\n\n Condition for two segments (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) (where a1,a2 are bases and b1,b2 are rebels) to not cross: \n   They do not share an endpoint and the points are interleaved in the plane. Specifically, we can check with orientation (cross product) whether the two segments intersect.\n\n But note: we are going to have multiple segments and we don't want any two to cross. So we need to check for every pair of edges in the matching that they do not cross.\n\n However, we are going to try all permutations? That would be factorial in R (which is up to 10, so 10! = 3628800) which is acceptable in worst-case in a contest environment (C++/Java would handle it, but in Python we must be careful). But note: the problem constraints say R, B at least 1 and at most 10, and if R != B we output \"No\", so when R=B we have to check all permutations.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the matching is a bijection. We can use recursion/backtracking to assign bases to rebels and check for crossings as we build the matching.\n\n However, we can use a more efficient idea:\n\n There is a known result: for two sets of points (bases and rebels) in the plane, a non-crossing matching exists if and only if there exists an ordering of the bases and an ordering of the rebels such that if we connect the i-th base to the i-th rebel, the segments do not cross. Moreover, if we sort the bases and rebels by the same coordinate (like x) then the matching that matches the i-th smallest base to the i-th smallest rebel is non-crossing? Not always. Consider:\n\n Example: \n   Bases: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n   Rebels: [(1,1), (3,1)]\n\n If we sort by x: bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]; rebels: [(1,1), (3,1)].\n Then we connect (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (3,1). These two segments do not cross.\n\n But what if:\n   Bases: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n   Rebels: [(1,1), (-1,1)]\n\n Now, sorted by x: bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]; rebels: [(-1,1), (1,1)].\n Then we connect (0,0) to (-1,1) and (2,0) to (1,1). These two segments do not cross.\n\n However, what if:\n   Bases: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n   Rebels: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n Then sorted by x: bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]; rebels: [(1,-1), (1,1)].\n Then we connect (0,0) to (1,-1) and (2,0) to (1,1). These two segments do not cross.\n\n But now consider a crossing example:\n\n   Bases: [ (0,0), (2,2) ]\n   Rebels: [ (1,1), (1,-1) ]\n\n Sort by x: bases: [ (0,0), (2,2) ] and rebels: [ (1,-1), (1,1) ].\n Then we connect (0,0) to (1,-1) and (2,2) to (1,1). The two segments cross.\n\n So the naive matching by sorted order doesn't work.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can use a greedy matching by considering the convex hulls or using the concept of planarity. But note: we are allowed to use any matching. We want to know if there exists at least one non-crossing matching.\n\n Since the number is small (R=B<=10), we can try all permutations (factorial of 10 is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if we optimize the crossing checks).\n\n Steps for the algorithm:\n\n 1. Read R, B. If R != B, print \"No\" and exit.\n 2. Read the R rebels and B bases. Then, we have 2*R points. But note: the rebels and bases are distinct sets.\n\n 3. Generate all permutations of the R bases (or equivalently, assign the i-th base to the j-th rebel). But actually, we have to assign each base to one rebel. We can represent the matching as a permutation: for each base index i, assign it to rebel index perm[i].\n\n 4. For each permutation (matching), check that no two segments (base_i, rebel_perm[i]) and (base_j, rebel_perm[j]) for i < j cross.\n\n How to check if two segments (A, B) and (C, D) cross?\n\n We can use the following: \n   Two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) do not intersect (except possibly at endpoints) if the points p3 and p4 lie on the same side of the line defined by p1 and p2, and vice versa.\n\n But note: we are only concerned with straight line segments and non-endpoint intersections.\n\n However, we are drawing segments from a base to a rebel. We have to check every pair of segments.\n\n But note: the entire matching has R segments. We have to check every unordered pair of edges.\n\n Condition for two segments (A,B) and (C,D) to not cross (without sharing an endpoint) is that the four points are in convex position and the segments are the diagonals? Actually, we can use the orientation test.\n\n We can define a function `segments_intersect` that takes four points (A, B, C, D) and returns True if the segments AB and CD intersect (and not just one point if they are adjacent). But note: in our matching, the segments are disjoint in endpoints (each base and each rebel appears exactly once). So we don't have to worry about sharing an endpoint.\n\n Standard way to check if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\n   def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n        # Check if the orientations around the segment AB are different for C and D, and similarly for CD for A and B.\n        def orientation(O, A, B):\n            # returns the cross product (O->A) x (O->B)\n            oa = (A[0]-O[0]) * (B[1]-O[1])\n            ob = (B[0]-O[0]) * (A[1]-O[1])\n            return oa - ob\n\n        def clockwise(O, A, B):\n            # returns 1 if clockwise, -1 if counterclockwise, 0 if collinear (shouldn't happen by problem condition)\n            o = orientation(O, A, B)\n            if o < 0:\n                return 1\n            elif o > 0:\n                return -1\n            else:\n                return 0\n\n        # Check general position: no three colinear, so we assume no zero.\n\n        # Check if points C and D are on opposite sides of AB\n        o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n        o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n        o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n        o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n        # If the orientations are different for AB and CD, then they might intersect.\n        if ((o1 < 0 and o2 > 0) or (o1 > 0 and o2 < 0)) and ((o3 < 0 and o4 > 0) or (o3 > 0 and o4 < 0)):\n            return True\n\n        # But wait: sometimes the segments are collinear? The problem states no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        # However, there is another possibility: the endpoints lie exactly on the line? The problem states no three points are colinear, so no.\n\n        # Actually, the above condition is necessary but not sufficient. We must also check that the segments are not overlapping. But note: the endpoints are distinct and no three colinear, so the only intersection is at endpoints if they share an endpoint, which they don't.\n\n        # However, the above condition is actually the standard condition for two segments to intersect (given that the endpoints are distinct and no three colinear). \n\n        # But wait: the standard condition is that the two segments intersect if the orientations of the two points (for one segment) with respect to the other segment are different, and vice versa. However, the above condition is the same.\n\n        # However, let me write the standard method:\n\n        # Two segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n        #   (A and B are on opposite sides of CD) and (C and D are on opposite sides of AB)\n\n        # But note: the above condition is exactly what we checked.\n\n        # However, there is a corner case: if the segments are collinear, but the problem says no three points are colinear, so we skip.\n\n        # But wait: what if the segments share an endpoint? We don't have that because the matching is a bijection and the sets of bases and rebels are disjoint.\n\n        # So we can use this.\n\n        # However, note: our segments are from base to rebel, and the bases and rebels are distinct sets, so no shared endpoints.\n\n        # But wait: the condition I wrote is not exactly the standard condition. The standard condition is:\n\n        #   Let o1 = orientation(A, B, C), o2 = orientation(A, B, D), o3 = orientation(C, D, A), o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n        #   Then the segments AB and CD intersect if:\n        #       (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n        # However, there is a special case: if one of the points is collinear, but we assume not.\n\n        # But note: the above condition is sufficient for proper intersection (not including endpoints). However, if the segments are collinear, then we have a problem, but the problem says no three points are colinear.\n\n        # However, wait: the four points might form a quadrilateral and the segments are the diagonals? Then they cross. Or they might be two separate segments that don't cross.\n\n        # The above condition (using the product of the orientations) is the standard one.\n\n        # But note: sometimes the segments might be degenerate? No, because the problem says no three points are colinear.\n\n        # However, there is a known issue: the orientation function can be negative or positive, but we must also check that the segments are not aligned. But again, no three colinear.\n\n        # But wait: the condition above is symmetric. However, there is an alternative: we can use the bounding box method, but the orientation method is simpler.\n\n        # However, I recall: the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0) is the standard condition.\n\n        # But let me test with the example:\n\n        # Example: A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(1,1), D=(1,-1) -> actually wait, that example was used differently.\n\n        # Actually, let me take two segments that cross: \n        #   Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n        #   Segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n        # For segment1: (0,0) to (2,2); for segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n        # Check with A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(0,2), D=(2,0)\n\n        # o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = orientation((0,0),(2,2),(0,2)) \n        #   = (0-0)*(2-0) - (0-0)*(2-0) ? Actually, wait: our orientation function:\n\n        #   orientation(O, A, B) = (A.x-O.x)*(B.y-O.y) - (B.x-O.x)*(A.y-O.y)\n\n        # For O=(0,0): \n        #   (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4\n        # o2 = orientation(A, B, D) = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 0 - 0 = 0 -> wait, that gives 0, meaning D is collinear? But (2,0) is not on the line from (0,0) to (2,2). \n\n        # Let me recalc: \n        #   orientation(O, A, B) for O=(0,0), A=(2,2), B=(2,0):\n        #   (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 2*0 - 2*2 = -4.\n\n        # Correction: The standard orientation function for points O, A, B is:\n        #   (A.x - O.x)*(B.y - O.y) - (B.x - O.x)*(A.y - O.y)\n\n        # So for (0,0) to (2,2) and point (0,2):\n        #   (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4.\n        # For (0,0) to (2,2) and point (2,0):\n        #   (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 2*0 - 2*2 = -4.\n\n        # Then o1=4, o2=-4 -> product is negative, so first condition holds.\n\n        # Now for the other segment (0,2) to (2,0): \n        #   orientation(C, D, A) = orientation((0,2), (2,0), (0,0))\n        #   (2-0)*(0-2) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 2*(-2) - 2*(-2) = -4 - (-4) = 0 -> wait, that's zero, meaning (0,0) is collinear with (0,2) and (2,0)? \n\n        # Actually, the segment from (0,2) to (2,0) has equation: y = -x+2, and (0,0) is not on that line. \n\n        # Let me recalc: \n        #   orientation(C, D, A) = (A.x-C.x)*(D.y-C.y) - (D.x-C.x)*(A.y-C.y)\n        #   C=(0,2), D=(2,0), A=(0,0)\n        #   (0-0)*(0-2) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 0*(-2) - 2*(-2) = 0 +4 = 4.\n        #   orientation(C, D, B) = (B.x-C.x)*(D.y-C.y) - (D.x-C.x)*(B.y-C.y)\n        #   B=(2,2): (2-0)*(0-2) - (2-0)*(2-2) = 2*(-2) - 2*0 = -4.\n\n        # Then o3=4, o4=-4 -> product negative.\n\n        # So the condition is met: both products are negative, so the segments intersect.\n\n        # But wait, the standard condition is that the two segments intersect if the two points (for one segment) are on opposite sides of the other segment and vice versa.\n\n        # However, in our calculation, for the first segment (0,0)-(2,2) we found that (0,2) and (2,0) are on opposite sides (because 4 and -4 have opposite signs). Similarly, for the second segment (0,2)-(2,0) we found (0,0) and (2,2) are on opposite sides (4 and -4). So they do intersect.\n\n        # But note: the above condition does not account for the fact that the endpoints might be on the line? But we already know that no three are colinear.\n\n        # However, the standard condition is actually:\n\n        #   The segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n        #       (A and B are on opposite sides of CD) AND (C and D are on opposite sides of AB)\n\n        # And that is exactly what we checked.\n\n        # But wait: there is a catch: the endpoints of the segments are part of the sets. However, we are checking for two distinct segments (edges) in the matching, and we don't care about endpoints? Actually, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect\", meaning they shouldn't share interior points. So if the segments share an endpoint, that is allowed? But note: the matching is a bijection and the endpoints are distinct (bases and rebels are distinct). However, two segments in the matching might share an endpoint if the matching is self-intersecting at endpoints? But wait, the endpoints are fixed: each base is connected to one rebel and each rebel to one base. So the segments are disjoint except for the endpoints? Actually, no: the endpoints are distinct by the problem statement (the sets are disjoint). So no two segments share an endpoint.\n\n        # Therefore, the condition is safe.\n\n        # However, there is a more robust way: the standard orientation method for checking segment intersection (with the condition that no three are colinear) is:\n\n        def ccw(A, B, C):\n            # returns True if the three points A, B, C are in counterclockwise order (oriented positively)\n            return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0]) > 0\n\n        Then, two segments AB and CD intersect (properly) if and only if:\n            ccw(A, C, B) != ccw(D, C, B) and ccw(C, A, D) != ccw(B, A, D)\n\n        But note: the above condition is for proper intersection (not including endpoints). However, we don't have endpoints in common, so that is acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n            # Check orientation of the four points for the two segments\n            def cross(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (b[0]-o[0])*(a[1]-o[1])\n\n            def sign(x):\n                return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n\n            # Check if the orientations are different for the two sides\n            o1 = cross(A, B, C)\n            o2 = cross(A, B, D)\n            o3 = cross(C, D, A)\n            o4 = cross(C, D, B)\n\n            # General case: the four points are in convex position and the segments are the diagonals?\n            if sign(o1) != sign(o2) and sign(o3) != sign(o4):\n                return True\n\n            # Check if the segments are collinear? We assume no, but if one of the orientations is 0 then we have a problem. Since no three colinear, we can skip.\n\n            return False\n\n        However, the above condition is similar.\n\n        But note: the standard condition is:\n\n            if (ccw(A,C,B) != ccw(A,D,B)) and (ccw(C,A,D) != ccw(C,B,D)):\n                return True\n\n        But wait, let me define ccw:\n\n        def ccw(A, B, C):\n            return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n        Then, the condition for two segments AB and CD to intersect is:\n\n            (ccw(A, C, B) * ccw(D, C, B) < 0) and (ccw(C, A, D) * ccw(B, A, D) < 0)\n\n        But note: the above condition is for the two segments to intersect (including the case when they are collinear, but we don't have that). \n\n        Actually, the common method is:\n\n            def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                # Check if the two segments intersect\n                def orient(O, A, B):\n                    return (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (B[0]-O[0])*(A[1]-O[1])\n\n                o1 = orient(A, B, C)\n                o2 = orient(A, B, D)\n                o3 = orient(C, D, A)\n                o4 = orient(C, D, B)\n\n                if (o1*o2 < 0) and (o3*o4 < 0):\n                    return True\n                return False\n\n        However, wait: the above condition is the same as our previous one.\n\n        But note: the above condition does not consider the case where one of the points is collinear? The problem states no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, there is a known issue: the above condition does not work for the case when the segments are collinear, but we are told no three colinear.\n\n        But wait: what if the four points are in convex position and the segments are the diagonals? Then the condition holds.\n\n        Actually, the condition is correct for simple intersections.\n\n        However, let me test with the example that crosses: (0,0)-(2,2) and (0,2)-(2,0)\n\n        For segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n        For segment2: (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n        o1 = orient( (0,0), (2,2), (0,2) ) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4\n        o2 = orient( (0,0), (2,2), (2,0) ) = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 0 - 0 = 0 -> wait, that's 0? \n\n        Wait, let me recalc the orient function correctly.\n\n        The standard cross product for vectors AC and BC (if we have points A, B, C) is:\n            (C.x - A.x)*(B.y - A.y) - (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y)\n\n        But wait, the definition I used above is: \n            orient(O, A, B) = (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (B[0]-O[0])*(A[1]-O[1])\n\n        That is the same as the cross product of (A-O) and (B-O). \n\n        For O=(0,0), A=(2,2), B=(2,0):\n            (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 2*0 - 2*2 = 0 - 4 = -4.\n\n        So o2 = -4.\n\n        Then o1=4, o2=-4 -> product negative.\n\n        Now for the other segment (0,2) to (2,0): \n            o3 = orient( (0,2), (2,0), (0,0) ) = (0-0)*(0-2) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 0*(-2) - 2*(-2) = 0 +4 = 4\n            o4 = orient( (0,2), (2,0), (2,2) ) = (2-0)*(2-2) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 2*0 - 2*(-2) = 0 +4 = 4\n\n        Then o3=4, o4=4 -> product positive, so condition fails.\n\n        But wait, the second segment's two points (0,0) and (2,2) should be on the same side of (0,2) to (2,0). Indeed, the line from (0,2) to (2,0) is y = -x+2. \n        (0,0): 0 < -0+2 -> below the line.\n        (2,2): 2 < -2+2 -> 2<0 -> false, so (2,2) is above the line? Actually, the line is y = -x+2, so (2,2): 2 = -2+4 -> above? \n\n        Let me draw: \n            The line goes from (0,2) to (2,0). The point (0,0): x=0, y=0 -> below the line (since the line at x=0 is y=2). \n            The point (2,2): x=2, y=2 -> above the line (since the line at x=2 is y=0). \n\n        So they are on opposite sides? Then the product should be negative.\n\n        But our calculation for o3 and o4: \n            o3 = orient( (0,2), (2,0), (0,0) ) = (0-0)*(0-2) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 0*(-2) - 2*(-2) = 0 +4 = 4 (positive)\n            o4 = orient( (0,2), (2,0), (2,2) ) = (2-0)*(2-2) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 2*0 - 2*(-2) = 0 +4 = 4 (positive)\n\n        Why is (0,0) considered positive? \n\n        The function orient(O, A, B) returns the cross product (A-O) x (B-O). \n\n        For (0,2) to (2,0) and (0,0): \n            Vector from O to A: (2-0, 0-2) = (2, -2)\n            Vector from O to B: (0-0, 0-2) = (0, -2)\n            Cross product: 2*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4 - 0 = -4 -> negative.\n\n        But wait, our function: \n            (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (B[0]-O[0])*(A[1]-O[1])\n            = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-0)*(0-2)   [Wait, no: the parameters are O, A, B: so the points are O, then A, then B.\n\n        Let me clarify: \n            Our function: orient(O, A, B) = (A.x - O.x)*(B.y - O.y) - (B.x - O.x)*(A.y - O.y)\n\n        For O=(0,2), A=(2,0), B=(0,0):\n            = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-0)*(0-2) \n            = 2*(-2) - 0*(-2) = -4.\n\n        Similarly, for O=(0,2), A=(2,0), B=(2,2):\n            = (2-0)*(2-2) - (2-0)*(0-2)\n            = 2*0 - 2*(-2) = 0 +4 = 4.\n\n        So then o3 = -4, o4=4 -> product negative.\n\n        So the condition holds: (4 * -4 < 0) and (-4 * 4 < 0) -> both negative? Actually, the first condition: 4 * -4 = -16 <0 -> true. The second condition: -4 * 4 = -16 <0 -> true. So the segments intersect.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition is (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0). \n\n        But wait, the example that I thought didn't cross earlier (by drawing) did cross, and the condition returned true, which is correct.\n\n        Another example: two segments that do not cross.\n\n        Example: \n          Segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n          Segment2: (1,1) to (1,-1)\n\n        These are two vertical lines, one from (0,0) to (0,2) and the other from (1,1) to (1,-1). They don't cross.\n\n        Check:\n\n        For segment1: (0,0) to (0,2)\n        For segment2: (1,1) to (1,-1)\n\n        o1 = orient((0,0), (0,2), (1,1)) \n            = (1-0)*(2-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 1*2 - 0*1 = 2\n        o2 = orient((0,0), (0,2), (1,-1))\n            = (1-0)*(-1-0) - (0-0)*(-1-0) = 1*(-1) - 0*(-1) = -1\n\n        Then o1 * o2 = 2 * (-1) = -2 <0 -> first condition holds.\n\n        Now for the other segment: \n        o3 = orient((1,1), (1,-1), (0,0))\n            = (0-1)*(-1-1) - (1-1)*(0-1) = (-1)*(-2) - 0*(-1) = 2\n        o4 = orient((1,1), (1,-1), (0,2))\n            = (0-1)*(2-1) - (1-1)*(2-1) = (-1)*1 - 0*1 = -1\n\n        Then o3 * o4 = 2 * (-1) = -2 <0 -> second condition holds.\n\n        But wait, the segments do not cross, so the condition should return false? \n\n        However, according to the condition, the two segments do intersect? \n\n        Let me plot: \n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (0,2) is the y-axis from 0 to 2.\n          Segment2: from (1,1) to (1,-1) is the line x=1 from y=-1 to 1.\n\n        They do not share any points and they are parallel (both vertical) and do not meet. \n\n        But the condition says they do? \n\n        What's the issue? \n\n        The condition (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0) is intended for checking if the two segments cross, but note: the condition is derived from the fact that the segments are diagonals of a quadrilateral. \n\n        Actually, the condition is not sufficient for non-collinear segments? \n\n        Wait, no: the condition is based on the sides of the line. The two segments are not the same line, so they are either crossing or not. \n\n        However, the condition we are using is for two segments that are not necessarily connected. \n\n        The standard condition for two segments (AB and CD) to intersect is:\n\n          (A and B are on opposite sides of CD) AND (C and D are on opposite sides of AB)\n\n        But in our example, are (0,0) and (0,2) on opposite sides of the segment from (1,1) to (1,-1)? \n\n        The segment from (1,1) to (1,-1) is the line x=1. The entire segment1 (which is x=0) is on the left side of x=1. So (0,0) and (0,2) are on the same side (left) of the segment2. \n\n        Then the first condition (o1 * o2 < 0) should not hold? \n\n        Let me recalc the orientations for the first segment with respect to segment2:\n\n        We are checking for the segment2: (1,1) to (1,-1) and points (0,0) and (0,2)\n\n        We need to compute:\n          o1 = orient((1,1), (1,-1), (0,0)) \n          o2 = orient((1,1), (1,-1), (0,2))\n\n        The function",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying that no two segments cross each other.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a bijection between R bases and R spaceships (since each must be matched exactly once). The key constraint is that the segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect. \n\n2. **Key Insight**: For any two segments to not intersect, the orientations of their endpoints relative to each other must satisfy specific conditions. We use the cross product to determine the orientation of points around a segment. If two segments intersect, the orientations of their endpoints will differ in a particular way.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (R and B are at most 10), we can generate all possible permutations of assignments (R! possibilities) and check each permutation for segment intersections. For each permutation, we verify that no two segments cross by checking the orientations of all pairs of segments.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations for R=10 is 10! (3,628,800), which is computationally feasible for modern systems, especially since R and B are small (≤10). Each permutation requires checking all pairs of segments (O(R^2) per permutation), leading to an overall complexity of O(R! * R^2).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it)); B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    def orient(O, A, B):\n        return (A[0] - O[0]) * (B[1] - O[1]) - (B[0] - O[0]) * (A[1] - O[1])\n    \n    def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n        o1 = orient(A, B, C)\n        o2 = orient(A, B, D)\n        o3 = orient(C, D, A)\n        o4 = orient(C, D, B)\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                seg1 = (bases[i], rebels[perm[i]])\n                seg2 = (bases[j], rebels[perm[j]])\n                if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of Rebels (R) and Bases (B). If R and B are not equal, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n\n2. **Rebels and Bases Storage**: The coordinates of the Rebels and Bases are stored in lists.\n\n3. **Orientation Calculation**: The `orient` function computes the cross product to determine the relative orientation of three points. This helps in checking if points lie on the same side or opposite sides of a line segment.\n\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross products to determine if two segments intersect. It checks if the endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\n5. **Permutation Check**: All permutations of assigning bases to Rebels are generated. For each permutation, the code checks if any two segments intersect. If a valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments and ensures the solution meets the problem's constraints.",
