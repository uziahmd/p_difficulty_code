Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given m (number of modifications) and then m lines each containing either '0' or '1'\n\n We are building a string S one character at a time. After each modification, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code.\n\n Important: The valid Morse code strings for English letters (using 0 for dot and 1 for dash) are all binary strings of length 1 to 4 except the four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\n Observation:\n We are counting distinct sequences of letters. However, note that the same Morse string might represent multiple letters? Actually, no: each string of length 1 to 4 (except the four invalid) corresponds to a distinct English letter. But note: two different letters might have the same Morse code? Actually, the problem states: \"each Morse code representation of an English letter\" and \"each string ... translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four\". So there are 30 - 4 = 26 valid strings, which is exactly the 26 letters.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". This means we are counting words (sequences) of one or more letters.\n\n But note: the same Morse string might appear as a substring multiple times, but we are counting distinct sequences. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". So if the same sequence (i.e., the same word) can be represented by multiple substrings, we count it only once.\n\n However, wait: the example after \"111\": \n   \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"O\" (from \"111\")\n   Then sequences: \n        \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\"\n        \"M\", \"MT\", \"MM\"? -> But wait, \"MM\" would require \"11\" twice, but in \"111\" we have two consecutive \"11\": actually the substring \"11\" appears twice? But note: the substring \"11\" is the same as \"11\", so we get the same letter 'M' repeated. However, the example lists:\n        \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n But note: the example output for \"111\" is 7. The example counts:\n   Single letters: T, M, O -> 3\n   Two-letter words: TT, TM, MT -> 3 (but not MM? because the two-letter word MM would be \"11\", but note: the substring \"11\" is present, and also the substring \"11\" again? Actually, the problem says \"distinct\" sequences. So the two-letter word \"MM\" is represented by the substring \"11\", but note: the same substring \"11\" is used, but the word is the same. However, we are counting distinct words, not distinct substrings.\n\n But wait: the example says \"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". \n\n However, note that the example does not list \"MM\" and \"TT\" and \"TTT\" and \"T\" and \"M\" and \"O\" and then the two-letter words. Let's break down:\n\n   One-letter words: \n        \"T\" (from substring \"1\")\n        \"M\" (from substring \"11\")\n        \"O\" (from substring \"111\")\n\n   Two-letter words:\n        \"TT\" (substring \"11\" from the first two characters, but wait: the two-letter word \"TT\" is represented by \"11\", which is the same as the one-letter word \"M\". However, the problem says \"sequence of English letters\", so \"TT\" is two T's. But note: the Morse code for T is \"1\", so \"TT\" is \"11\", which is also the Morse code for M. \n\n This is the catch: the same string of bits might represent two different words? Actually, no: the representation of a word is the concatenation of the Morse codes for each letter. And the Morse code for T is \"1\", so \"TT\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is the same as the Morse code for M. \n\n However, the problem says: the Morse code representation for a letter is fixed. But when we break a substring of S, we must break it according to the Morse code boundaries? Actually, no: the problem does not specify how to break the substring. It says \"some substring of S in Morse code\". \n\n But note: the example input \"111\" (three ones). How do we get \"TT",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using substrings of a string S, which is built incrementally by appending '0's (dots) or '1's (dashes) one at a time. The Morse code representations for the letters are binary strings of lengths 1 to 4, excluding four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each valid Morse code substring of S must represent a sequence of English letters. However, the same substring might represent multiple sequences if it can be split into valid Morse codes in different ways. For example, the substring \"11\" could represent either two 'T's or one 'M'. \n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending exactly at position `i` in the string S. This helps in efficiently counting all valid sequences as we build S character by character.\n\n3. **Transition Handling**: For each new character added to S, we check all possible valid Morse code sequences ending at the current position. A valid sequence is one that does not contain any of the four invalid strings. We update the DP array by considering sequences of lengths 1 to 4 (since Morse codes are up to 4 characters long).\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm processes each character in O(m) time per character, where m is the length of S. Given that m can be up to 3000, the total complexity is O(m^2), which is feasible for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        char = s_list[i]\n        new_dp = dp[:]\n        new_dp[i+1] = 1\n        for j in range(i+1, m+1):\n            if j < i+1:\n                continue\n            end_index = j\n            start_index = j - 3\n            if start_index < 0:\n                start_index = 0\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[k] for k in range(start_index, end_index))\n            if len(substr) > 4:\n                continue\n            if substr in [\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"]:\n                continue\n            new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + new_dp[j-1]) % MOD\n            if j-2 >= 0:\n                new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + new_dp[j-2]) % MOD\n            if j-3 >= 0:\n                new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + new_dp[j-3]) % MOD\n            if j-4 >= 0:\n                substr4 = ''.join(s_list[k] for k in range(j-4, j))\n                if len(substr4) == 4 and substr4 in [\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"]:\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + new_dp[j-4]) % MOD\n        dp = new_dp\n        total = sum(dp[1:]) % MOD\n        ans.append(total)\n    for a in ans:\n        print(a)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes a DP array to keep track of valid sequences ending at each position in the string S.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to S, the code checks all possible valid sequences ending at the current position by examining substrings of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid (i.e., not one of the four invalid strings), it updates the DP array.\n3. **Result Calculation**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences is computed by summing the DP array values from the start to the current position, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n4. **Output**: The results after each character addition are printed sequentially.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all distinct valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming to avoid recomputation and ensure optimal performance.",
