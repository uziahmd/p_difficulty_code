Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the entire street from 0 to l.\n 3. We need to cover the entire segment [0, l] with intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d]. \n    Since the lanterns can be at the same point, we first sort the array.\n\n 4. The key observation:\n    - The gaps that might require attention are between consecutive lanterns, and also the gap from the start (0) to the first lantern, and the gap from the last lantern to l.\n\n 5. Steps:\n    a. If there are no lanterns, then we must cover the entire street [0, l] so d must be at least l/2 (if we put one lantern in the middle, but actually we have no lanterns so we need to cover from 0 to l with one interval? Actually, without any lantern, we would need a lantern that covers [0, l], so d must be at least max(0, ...) but wait: the problem says we have n lanterns. So n>=1 by the constraints (n>=1). So we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n    b. Sort the lanterns: let `a` be the sorted list.\n\n    c. We note that the entire street must be covered. The coverage of the street is broken down into segments:\n\n        Segment 1: From 0 to the first lantern's position (a[0]). \n            The first lantern must extend from 0 to a[0]. Therefore, the required d for this segment is a[0]/2.\n\n        Segment 2: Between consecutive lanterns. For each i from 0 to n-2, the gap between a[i] and a[i+1] is (a[i+1] - a[i]). \n            To cover the gap, the two adjacent lanterns must cover the space between them. The condition is that the right lantern's left coverage (a[i+1]-d) must meet the left lantern's right coverage (a[i]+d). \n            So we require: a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d  => 2*d >= a[i+1] - a[i] => d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        Segment 3: From the last lantern (a[-1]) to l. Similarly, we need d >= (l - a[-1])/2.\n\n    d. Then the answer is the maximum of the three values: \n        candidate1 = a[0] / 2.0\n        candidate2 = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 for i in range(n-1) )\n        candidate3 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0\n\n    But note: it's possible that one of these candidates is not needed because the lanterns might already cover beyond the endpoints? However, the problem states that we have to light the whole street from 0 to l.\n\n    However, note: the above conditions are necessary and sufficient. We must have d at least as large as the maximum value among these three.\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        Sorted: [2,5]\n        candidate1 = 2/2 = 1.0\n        candidate2 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        candidate3 = (5-5)/2 = 0.0\n        Then the answer is max(1.0, 1.5, 0.0) = 1.5 -> but the example output is 2.0000000000.\n\n    Wait, let me check: \n        In the example, the street is from 0 to 5. \n        With two lanterns at 2 and 5, and d=1.5:\n            First lantern: [2-1.5, 2+1.5] = [0.5, 3.5] -> does not cover [0, 0.5] and leaves a gap from 0 to 0.5.\n            Second lantern: [3.5, 6.5] -> which is beyond 5, but the gap from 0 to 0.5 is not covered.\n\n    Alternatively, let me recast:\n\n        We need to cover [0,5]:\n            From 0 to 2: we require d to be at least 2 (to cover from 0 to 2) but wait, if d=2, then first lantern covers [0,4] and second lantern covers [3,7]. Then [0,4] and [3,7] together cover [0,7] which includes [0,5]. \n\n        However, the above formula for candidate1 was a[0]/2 = 1, but actually the requirement for the first part is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the next lantern or to the end. \n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n        The first lantern at 2 must cover from 0 to 2. The distance from 0 to 2 is 2, so the lantern must have d at least 2 (because the farthest point 0 is 2 units away). So candidate1 should be 2, not 1.\n\n        What went wrong?\n\n        Actually, the condition for the first segment: \n            The first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. So the required d is at least a[0] (because the lantern must reach from 0 to a[0], so the distance from a[0] to 0 is a[0], so d must be >= a[0]). But wait, no: the lantern at a[0] lights all points within d. So to cover 0, we require that 0 >= a[0] - d  => d >= a[0]. However, note: the entire segment from 0 to a[0] must be covered. The leftmost point is 0, and the lantern is at a[0]. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. Therefore, the required d for the left side is at least a[0] (because we need to cover from 0 to a[0], so the left part requires d >= a[0])? \n\n        But wait, if d = a[0], then the lantern covers from 0 to 2*a[0]? Actually, no: the lantern covers [a[0]-d, a[0]+d]. We want to cover 0, so we require a[0]-d <= 0 => d >= a[0]. Similarly, for the right side, we require the last lantern to cover up to l: a[-1] + d >= l => d >= l - a[-1].\n\n        However, consider the middle gaps: between two lanterns, we require that the gap is covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The condition is that the right lantern's coverage must meet the left lantern's coverage. The left lantern covers up to a[i] + d, and the right lantern covers from a[i+1] - d. So we require a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d, which gives d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n        Now, the example: \n            n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n\n            candidate1: d >= 2 (from the left side: 0 to 2)\n            candidate2: d >= (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n            candidate3: d >= (5-5)=0\n\n            So the maximum is 2.\n\n        Then the answer is 2.0.\n\n        Why did I initially use a[0]/2? That would be for the case where we have two lanterns and they are symmetric? Let me think again.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the left side: the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. Therefore, the required d is at least a[0] (not a[0]/2). Similarly, for the right side, we require d at least (l - a[-1]).\n\n        But wait, what if we have multiple lanterns? Consider a single lantern in the middle of the street.\n\n        Example: one lantern at position x in [0, l]. Then we require:\n            x - d <= 0   => d >= x\n            x + d >= l   => d >= l - x\n            So d >= max(x, l-x)\n\n        Now, if we have more than one lantern, then the condition for the left side is still that the first lantern must cover 0, so d >= a[0] (if we have only one lantern, then yes). But if we have multiple lanterns, then the first lantern doesn't necessarily have to cover the entire left side by itself. However, the coverage from the first lantern must at least reach 0. So the condition for the first lantern is d >= a[0] (because the lantern at a[0] must cover 0). Similarly, the last lantern must have d >= l - a[-1].\n\n        But wait, what if there is a lantern at 0? Then a[0]=0, then d>=0, which is always true. Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then d>=0.\n\n        However, consider two lanterns: [0, l]. Then we require d>=0 (from the first) and d>=0 (from the last) and d>= (l-0)/2 from the middle? Actually, the middle gap is from 0 to l, and we require d >= l/2. Also, the first lantern must cover from 0 to 0+l? Actually, the first lantern at 0 must cover up to 0+d, and the second lantern at l must cover from l-d. To cover the entire street, we require that 0+d >= l-d? Then d>=l/2. But also, the first lantern must cover 0 (which is automatic since it's at 0) and the second lantern must cover l (automatic). However, the entire street must be covered: from 0 to l. The condition from the first lantern is that it covers [0-d, 0+d] = [-d, d]. The second lantern covers [l-d, l+d]. The gap between d and l-d must be covered. We require d >= l-d => d>=l/2.\n\n        Now, let me reframe the conditions:\n\n        Condition 1: The first lantern must cover 0. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. Therefore, d must be at least a[0] (so that 0 is included: a[0]-d <= 0).\n\n        Condition 2: The last lantern must cover l. Therefore, d must be at least (l - a[-1]).\n\n        Condition 3: For each consecutive pair (a[i], a[i+1]), we require that the two lanterns together cover the gap between them. The left lantern covers up to a[i]+d, and the right lantern covers from a[i+1]-d. We require that a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, i.e., d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        So the answer is the maximum of:\n            candidate1 = a[0]  (if we use the left condition: d>=a[0])\n            candidate2 = (l - a[-1])\n            candidate3 = max_{i}( (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 )\n\n        But wait, in the example with two lanterns at 0 and l: \n            candidate1 = 0\n            candidate2 = 0\n            candidate3 = (l-0)/2 = l/2\n\n            Then d = l/2.\n\n        Now, let's test with the sample input: \n            Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n            Sort: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n            candidate1 = 0\n            candidate2 = (15-15)=0\n            candidate3 = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ) \n                       = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5\n\n            Then the answer is 2.5.\n\n        However, the example output is 2.5000000000.\n\n        But wait, let me check the example input: \n            Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n            Then: \n                candidate1 = 2\n                candidate2 = 0\n                candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n            Then the answer is max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, wait: in the first sample, the lanterns are at [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The condition for the first lantern (at 0) requires d>=0, which is fine. The last lantern (at 15) requires d>=0. The gaps require d>=2.5. But is d=2.5 sufficient?\n\n            Check the entire street [0,15]:\n\n            First lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so [0,2.5] is covered.\n            Second lantern at 3: covers [0.5, 5.5] -> so from 0.5 to 5.5.\n            Third lantern at 5: covers [2.5, 7.5] -> so from 2.5 to 7.5.\n            Fourth lantern at 7: covers [4.5, 9.5] -> so from 4.5 to 9.5.\n            Fifth lantern at 9: covers [6.5, 11.5] -> so from 6.5 to 11.5.\n            Sixth lantern at 14: covers [11.5, 16.5] -> so from 11.5 to 16.5, but we only need up to 15.\n            Seventh lantern at 15: covers [12.5,17.5] -> but wait, the last lantern is at 15, and d=2.5, so it covers [12.5,17.5] which is beyond 15, but that's okay.\n\n            Now, check the coverage from 0 to 15:\n\n            We have:\n                [0,2.5] by first lantern.\n                [0.5,5.5] by second: so from 0 to 5.5 is covered.\n                [2.5,7.5] by third: so from 0 to 7.5 is covered.\n                [4.5,9.5] by fourth: so from 0 to 9.5 is covered.\n                [6.5,11.5] by fifth: so from 0 to 11.5 is covered.\n                [11.5,16.5] by sixth: so from 0 to 16.5 is covered.\n\n            The entire street [0,15] is covered.\n\n            But wait, the gap between the first and second lantern: the first lantern covers up to 2.5, and the second lantern starts at 0.5, so the entire [0,5.5] is covered. The critical gap is the one between the fifth and sixth lantern: the fifth lantern covers up to 11.5, and the sixth lantern starts at 11.5 (since 14-2.5=11.5). So the point 11.5 is covered by both. Then the entire street is covered.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and l.\n            Step 2: Read the list of n integers and sort them.\n            Step 3: \n                candidate1 = a[0]  # because we must cover from 0 to a[0]: the first lantern must have d >= a[0] (to cover 0)\n                candidate2 = l - a[-1] # because we must cover from a[-1] to l: the last lantern must have d >= l - a[-1]\n                candidate3 = 0.0\n                For i in range(len(a)-1):\n                    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                    half_gap = gap / 2.0\n                    if half_gap > candidate3:\n                        candidate3 = half_gap\n\n            Step 4: d = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n        However, wait: what if the street has only one lantern? Then we have:\n            candidate1 = a[0] (must be >= a[0])\n            candidate2 = l - a[0] (must be >= l - a[0])\n            candidate3 = 0 (since there are no consecutive pairs)\n\n            Then d = max(a[0], l-a[0])\n\n        Example: one lantern at position 5 on a street of length 10. Then d = max(5, 5) = 5.0. Is that correct?\n            The lantern at 5 must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 5 to 0 is 5, and from 5 to 10 is 5. So d=5 is required.\n\n        Another example: one lantern at 3 on a street of length 10. Then d = max(3, 7)=7.0. Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d>=a[0] to cover 0. Similarly, if the last lantern is not at l, then d>=l-a[-1] to cover l.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the first lantern is that it must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. So the required d is a[0]. Similarly, the last lantern must cover l, so d must be at least l - a[-1].\n\n        But what if we have multiple lanterns? Then the first lantern might not be the only one covering 0. However, the condition for 0 is that at least one lantern must cover 0. The closest lantern to 0 is the first one (since sorted), so we require that the first lantern (or any lantern) must have d at least the distance from 0 to the first lantern. However, if there's a lantern closer to 0 than the first one? No, because we sorted.\n\n        But note: the condition for the entire street is that every point must be covered. The point 0 must be covered by at least one lantern. The closest lantern to 0 is at a[0]. Therefore, the minimal d for 0 is a[0] (if we use the first lantern). However, if there is a lantern at 0, then a[0]=0, so d>=0.\n\n        However, consider two lanterns: one at 1 and one at 3, and the street is from 0 to 5.\n\n            candidate1 = 1 (to cover 0 from the first lantern at 1: we need d>=1)\n            candidate2 = 5-3=2 (to cover 5 from the last lantern at 3: we need d>=2)\n            candidate3 = (3-1)/2 = 1.0\n\n            Then d = max(1,2,1)=2.\n\n            Check: \n                Lantern at 1 with d=2: covers [-1,3] -> so [0,3] is covered.\n                Lantern at 3 with d=2: covers [1,5] -> so [1,5] is covered.\n                Together, [0,5] is covered.\n\n        But wait, the first lantern at 1 with d=2 actually covers 0 (because 1-2=-1<=0) and extends to 3. The second lantern at 3 with d=2 covers from 1 to 5. So the entire [0,5] is covered.\n\n        However, the condition for the first lantern was set to 1, but the condition for the last lantern set d to 2, so we take 2.\n\n        The above algorithm works.\n\n        But wait, what if the first lantern is not the one that covers 0? Actually, we are using the first lantern (the smallest coordinate) to determine the left condition. However, there might be a lantern that is not the first one that is closer to 0? No, because we sorted. The first element is the smallest.\n\n        However, note: the condition for covering 0 is that there exists a lantern such that the lantern's coverage includes 0. The minimal d required to cover 0 is the distance from 0 to the closest lantern (which is a[0]). Similarly, the minimal d required to cover l is the distance from l to the closest lantern (which is a[-1]).\n\n        Therefore, we can also compute:\n\n            candidate1 = a[0]  # because the closest lantern to 0 is at a[0], so we need d>=a[0] to cover 0 (if we use that lantern to cover 0, but note: maybe a different lantern can cover 0 with a smaller d? Actually, no: the lantern that covers 0 must be at least at distance a[0] from 0. \n\n        Actually, the minimal d required to cover 0 is the minimum distance from 0 to any lantern, which is a[0] (since the lanterns are sorted). Similarly, the minimal d required to cover l is the minimum distance from l to any lantern, which is (l - a[-1]).\n\n        And for the gaps, the minimal d required to cover the gap between two consecutive lanterns is (gap)/2.\n\n        So the overall minimal d must be the maximum of:\n            - the distance from 0 to the first lantern (a[0])\n            - the distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1])\n            - the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\n        Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the gaps is that the two lanterns must cover the entire gap. The gap between two consecutive lanterns is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The coverage from the left lantern goes to a[i]+d, and from the right lantern starts at a[i+1]-d. To have no gap, we require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, i.e., d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        But what if there are multiple lanterns? Then the gaps are independent.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            d = max( a[0], \n                     (l - a[-1]),\n                     max( (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 for i in range(n-1) ) )\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left side is that the first lantern must cover 0, which is a[0]. But what if the first lantern is not the one that covers the leftmost part? Actually, the first lantern is the leftmost, so it is the one that must cover the leftmost part.\n\n        But wait, consider if we have two lanterns: [1, 3] and the street is from 0 to 10. Then the leftmost lantern is at 1, so we require d>=1 to cover 0. However, the gap condition requires d>= (3-1)/2 = 1.0. Then the last lantern condition requires d>=10-3=7. So d=7. \n\n        Check: \n            With d=7, first lantern at 1: covers [1-7, 1+7] = [-6,8] -> covers 0.\n            Second lantern at 3: covers [3-7,3+7]=[-4,10] -> covers up to 10.\n            The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        However, the gap between 1 and 3 is covered by the first lantern (which goes to 8) and the second lantern (which starts at -4) so the gap is covered.\n\n        But note: the condition for the left side is 1, for the gap is 1, and for the right side is 7. So we take 7.\n\n        But why do we require the first lantern to cover 0? Because 0 is not covered by the second lantern? Actually, the second lantern at 3 with d=7 covers from -4 to 10, so 0 is covered by the second lantern as well. However, the condition we set for the left side was based on the first lantern, but actually we don't require the first lantern to cover 0. We require that at least one lantern covers 0. The minimal d required to cover 0 is the minimal distance from 0 to any lantern, which is min(a[0], ...). But wait, we sorted, so the closest lantern to 0 is a[0]. Therefore, the minimal d to cover 0 is a[0]. However, in the above example, we used a lantern (the second one) that is farther away to cover 0. But that lantern requires d>= (distance from 3 to 0)=3, which is less than 7. So why do we use a[0]?\n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n        The condition for covering 0 is: there must exist a lantern at position x such that |x - 0| <= d, i.e., d >= x. But we can choose which lantern to use. However, the minimal d required to cover 0 is the minimal x (the distance from 0 to the closest lantern) because if we use the closest lantern, then d must be at least that distance. But if we use a farther lantern, then d must be at least the distance from that lantern to 0, which is larger. Therefore, the minimal d that can cover 0 is the distance to the closest lantern (a[0]).\n\n        Similarly, the minimal d that can cover l is the distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1]), because the closest lantern to l is a[-1].\n\n        However, wait: the condition for covering the entire street is that we must cover 0 and l and the gaps. The minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n            - the minimal d to cover 0 (which is a[0])\n            - the minimal d to cover l (which is l - a[-1])\n            - the minimal d to cover the largest gap (which is (max_gap)/2)\n\n        But note: the condition for the gaps is independent and is the same regardless of which lantern we use.\n\n        However, in the example above with two lanterns [1,3] and street [0,10], the minimal d to cover 0 is 1 (using the first lantern) but we can also cover 0 with the second lantern with d>=3. However, the minimal d that satisfies all conditions must be at least 7 (because of the right side). So we are taking the maximum of the three.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the street is from 0 to 10, and we have two lanterns at [0,10]? Then:\n            candidate1 = 0\n            candidate2 = 0\n            candidate3 = (10-0)/2 = 5\n            Then d=5.\n\n        Check: \n            First lantern at 0: covers [-5,5]\n            Second lantern at 10: covers [5,15]\n            Together: [0,10] is covered.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        One more edge: what if the street is from 0 to 10, and we have one lantern at 5? Then:\n            candidate1 = 5\n            candidate2 = 5\n            candidate3 = 0 (no consecutive gaps)\n            Then d=5.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left side is 5, meaning the first lantern (at 5) must cover 0: so d>=5 (because 5-5=0, so 0 is included). Similarly, the last lantern (same) must cover 10: 5+5=10, so included.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n, l = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort()\n\n            # If there's only one lantern, then we have to consider the entire street from 0 to l.\n            # But our method works for one lantern too.\n\n            # Condition 1: cover 0\n            cond1 = a[0]\n\n            # Condition 2: cover l\n            cond2 = l - a[-1]\n\n            # Condition 3: cover the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n            cond3 = 0.0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n                # We need to cover the gap: the required d for this gap is gap/2\n                if gap > 0:  # if there's a gap\n                    half_gap = gap / 2.0\n                    if half_gap > cond3:\n                        cond3 = half_gap\n\n            # But note: what if there are no gaps? Then cond3 remains 0.0, which is fine.\n\n            # However, note: the condition for the gaps is only for consecutive lanterns. The gaps at the ends are handled by cond1 and cond2.\n\n            # But wait, what if the first two lanterns are the same? Then gap=0, and we skip, but that's okay.\n\n            # Now, we take the maximum of cond1, cond2, cond3.\n\n            d = max(cond1, cond2, cond3)\n\n            # Format the output to have 9 decimal places.\n\n            print(\"{:.9f}\".format(d))\n\n        However, wait: in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", we get:\n            a = [2,5]\n            cond1 = 2\n            cond2 = 5-5 = 0\n            cond3: gap = 5-2=3 -> half_gap=1.5 -> cond3=1.5\n            Then d = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The first lantern must cover 0: the distance from 2 to 0 is 2, so d>=2. The last lantern must cover 5: the distance from 5 to 5 is 0, so d>=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so d>=1.5. So the maximum is 2.\n\n        However, note: the entire street is [0,5]. The lantern at 2 with d=2 covers [0,4] and the lantern at 5 with d=2 covers [3,7]. Together they cover [0,7] which includes [0,5]. \n\n        But wait, what if we use d=1.5? \n            First lantern: [0.5, 3.5] -> does not cover 0 (0 is not in [0.5,3.5]).\n            Second lantern: [3.5, 6.5] -> covers from 3.5 to 6.5, so the part [0,0.5) is not covered.\n\n        So d=1.5 is not enough. Therefore, d must be at least 2.\n\n        But note: the condition for the left side (cond1) is 2, which is the distance from the first lantern to 0. This is correct.\n\n        However, consider an alternative: what if we have a lantern at 0 and then another lantern at 5? \n            Input: \"2 5\\n0 5\"\n            Then:\n                cond1 = 0\n                cond2 = 0\n                cond3 = (5-0)/2 = 2.5\n                d = 2.5\n\n            Check: \n                First lantern at 0: covers [-2.5,2.5] -> so 0 to 2.5 is covered.\n                Second lantern at 5: covers [2.5,7.5] -> so 2.5 to 5 is covered.\n\n            Entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n        Now, consider if the first lantern is at 0 and the second at 4, and the street is from 0 to 5.\n            Input: \"2 5\\n0 4\"\n            Then:\n                cond1 = 0\n                cond2 = 5-4=1\n                cond3 = (4-0)/2=2.0\n                d = max(0,1,2)=2.0\n\n            Check: \n                First lantern: [-2,2] -> covers [0,2] (and beyond, but we need up to 5)\n                Second lantern: [2,6] -> covers from 2 to 5 (since 5<=6) and from 2 to 5 is covered.\n\n            The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n        But wait, what if we set d=1.5?\n            First lantern: [-1.5,1.5] -> covers [0,1.5]\n            Second lantern: [4-1.5,4+1.5] = [2.5,5.5] -> so [0,1.5] and [2.5,5.5] -> gap from 1.5 to 2.5 is not covered.\n\n        So d=1.5 is not enough. Then why did we get d=2.0? Because the gap condition requires d>= (4-0)/2 = 2.0.\n\n        However, note: the gap condition is for the entire gap between the two lanterns. The first lantern covers up to 0+d and the second lantern covers from 4-d. To have no gap, we require 0+d >= 4-d? Actually, no: the entire street must be covered. The gap between the first lantern and the second lantern is from 0 to 4, but we break the street into two parts: from 0 to 4 and then from 4 to 5. \n\n        Actually, we have two conditions for the gap between the two lanterns? \n\n        The condition for the gap between two consecutive lanterns is that the coverage of the left lantern (going right) and the right lantern (going left) must meet. The left lantern (at 0) covers up to 0+d, and the right lantern (at 4) covers from 4-d. The condition is that 0+d >= 4-d, i.e., d>=2. Then the entire [0,4] is covered. But then the last part from 4 to 5 is covered by the second lantern (with d=2, the second lantern covers from 2 to 6, which includes [4,5]). \n\n        Therefore, the gap condition is correctly capturing the need to bridge the gap between 0 and 4.\n\n        However, note: the gap condition is only for consecutive lanterns. In this case, the consecutive lanterns are [0,4]. The gap is 4, so we require d>=2.\n\n        But wait, the gap condition is defined as (a[i+1]-a[i])/2. For the two lanterns [0,4], the gap is 4, so 4/2=2.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n            n, l = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort()\n\n            cond1 = a[0]  # to cover 0\n            cond2 = l - a[-1]  # to cover l\n            cond3 = 0.0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n                half_gap = gap / 2.0\n                if half_gap > cond3:\n                    cond3 = half_gap\n\n            d = max(cond1, cond2, cond3)\n\n            print(\"{:.9f}\".format(d))\n\n        However, wait: in the example with one lantern at 0 and one at 4, the gap is 4, so cond3=2.0, and the other conditions are 0 and 1 (for cond2). So d=2.0.\n\n        But note: the entire street is [0,5]. We have:\n            First lantern (0) with d=2: covers [-2,2] -> so [0,2] is covered.\n            Second lantern (4) with d=2: covers [2,6] -> so [2,5] is covered.\n\n        The point 2 is covered by both.\n\n        However, consider if the street ends at 5, and the second lantern is at 4, then the last part from 4 to 5 is covered by the second lantern because 4+2=6>=5.\n\n        But what if the street ends at 3? Then the last lantern is at 4, so we require d>= 3-4? That would be negative, so we take 0. Actually,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street from 0 to `l` are covered by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to ensure every point on the street (from 0 to `l`) is within the light radius `d` of at least one lantern. The solution involves checking three main conditions:\n   - **Leftmost Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0). The required `d` here is the distance from the first lantern to 0.\n   - **Rightmost Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (`l`). The required `d` here is the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light radii. The required `d` for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal `d` needed is the maximum value among the three conditions mentioned above. This ensures that all segments of the street, including the edges and the gaps between lanterns, are adequately covered.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to easily access the first and last positions, as well as consecutive pairs for gap analysis.\n   - **Condition Calculation**: Compute the three conditions (leftmost, rightmost, and largest gap) and take the maximum value among them.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent steps involve linear scans to compute the conditions, which take O(n) time. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    cond1 = a[0]\n    cond2 = l - a[-1]\n    cond3 = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        half_gap = gap / 2.0\n        if half_gap > cond3:\n            cond3 = half_gap\n            \n    d = max(cond1, cond2, cond3)\n    \n    print(\"{:.9f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of the leftmost and rightmost coverage conditions.\n3. **Condition Calculation**:\n   - **Leftmost Condition (`cond1`)**: The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0).\n   - **Rightmost Condition (`cond2`)**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n   - **Gap Condition (`cond3`)**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the required `d` to cover the gap between them is half the distance between the two lanterns. The largest such value is taken.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value among `cond1`, `cond2`, and `cond3`, ensuring all parts of the street are covered.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 9 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine the minimal light radius required to illuminate the entire street, leveraging sorting and linear scans for optimal performance.",
