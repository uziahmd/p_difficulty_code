Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the entire street from 0 to l.\n 3. We need to cover the whole street [0, l] with intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d]. \n    Since the lanterns can be at the same point, we can ignore duplicates? Actually, we don't need to because sorting will take care.\n\n Steps:\n - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern. The required d must be at least (first lantern position)/2, but actually we have to cover from 0 to the first lantern.\n   So the left gap is from 0 to the first lantern. The light from the first lantern must extend at least to 0, so d >= (first lantern) / 2? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we can break the problem into segments:\n\n Let the sorted lanterns be in an array `a`.\n\n The street must be covered from 0 to l.\n\n 1. Check the left end: from 0 to a[0]. The light from the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. So d must be at least (a[0] - 0) / 2.\n\n But wait: if there are multiple lanterns, we can consider gaps between lanterns.\n\n However, note that the condition for covering the entire street is that the union of all intervals [x_i - d, x_i + d] must cover [0, l].\n\n We can think of it as:\n\n   Condition 1: The leftmost lantern must cover 0. So d >= (a[0] - 0) / 2? Actually, no: the light from the first lantern must extend to 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. So we require d >= a[0]/2.\n\n   Condition 2: Between lanterns, say between a[i] and a[i+1]: the gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The lights from both lanterns must meet in the middle. The maximum gap that can be covered by two adjacent lanterns is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2. Therefore, the required d must be at least half the gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n   Condition 3: The right end: from the last lantern to l. The last lantern must extend to l, so d >= (l - a[-1]) / 2.\n\n However, note that the above conditions are necessary, but we can combine them:\n\n We can compute the maximum of:\n   - (a[0] - 0) / 2\n   - (gaps between consecutive lanterns) / 2\n   - (l - a[-1]) / 2\n\n But wait, is that sufficient?\n\n Example: ['2 5\\n2 5'] -> n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n   Condition 1: (2-0)/2 = 1.0\n   Condition 2: (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n   Condition 3: (5-5)/2 = 0\n\n Then maximum is 1.5, but the sample output is 2.0.\n\n Why 2.0?\n\n Let's reexamine:\n\n In the example, the entire street is from 0 to 5.\n\n With d=2.0:\n   First lantern (at 2): covers [0,4] (from 2-2 to 2+2)\n   Second lantern (at 5): covers [3,7] (but since our street ends at 5, we only care up to 5). However, note that from 4 to 5 is not covered by the first lantern, but the second lantern starts at 3, so from 4 to 5 is covered by the second lantern? Actually, the first lantern covers up to 4, and the second lantern covers from 3 to 7. So from 4 to 5 is covered by the second lantern, but what about the part from 0 to 2? The first lantern covers 0 to 4, so the entire street is covered.\n\n Why did the sample say d=2 is needed? Actually, the sample input says \"2 5\\n2 5\" and output is 2.0.\n\n But note: the sample explanation says \"At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\"\n\n However, with d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4] and the second covers [3,7]. The entire street [0,5] is covered because [0,4] ∪ [3,5] = [0,5].\n\n But wait, what if we use d=1.5? \n   First lantern: [0.5, 3.5]\n   Second lantern: [3.5, 6.5]\n\n Now, the street from 0 to 0.5 is not covered, and from 3.5 to 5 is covered by the second lantern, but the first lantern only goes to 3.5. However, the first lantern doesn't cover the beginning (0) because 0.5 < 0? Actually, the first lantern's coverage is from 2-1.5=0.5 to 2+1.5=3.5. So the left part from 0 to 0.5 is missing.\n\n Therefore, the condition for the left end is not just the first lantern's requirement: we require that the leftmost lantern must cover from 0. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is 2, so we need d>=2 for the left end? But wait, then why is 2 the answer?\n\n Let me clarify:\n\n The entire street must be covered. We have two lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\n To cover the left end (0), the first lantern must cover from 0 to some point. The distance from 0 to 2 is 2, so d must be at least 2 to cover 0.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the gaps:\n\n   Left gap: from 0 to the first lantern (2) -> requires d >= (2 - 0)/2? That would be 1, but that's not enough because then the first lantern only covers to 1 (if d=1) which is [1,3], so 0 is not covered.\n\n Actually, the correct way is:\n\n   For the left end: we require that the first lantern must cover 0, so d >= (first lantern position - 0) / 1? But wait, the lantern at 2: the coverage is 2-d <= 0? No, the coverage is from (2-d) to (2+d). To cover 0, we require 2-d <= 0? Actually, that's backwards. The condition is that 0 must be <= 2+d, which is always true if d>=0 and 2+d>=0. But we also require that the light extends to the left to 0, so the left boundary of the first lantern's light is 2-d. We require 2-d <= 0? Actually, no: the light must cover 0, so 0 must be at least 2-d (so that 0 is in the interval). That means 0 >= 2-d -> d>=2.\n\n Similarly, for the right end: we require that the last lantern's light extends to l, so l <= a[-1]+d -> d>= l - a[-1].\n\n For the gaps between lanterns: between a[i] and a[i+1], the coverage from the left lantern must extend to a[i] + d, and the coverage from the right lantern must extend to a[i+1]-d. To cover the gap, we require that a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d -> d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n Therefore, the necessary conditions are:\n   d >= (first lantern position) / 2   [to cover from 0 to the first lantern] -> actually no, because the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least its own position. The condition for the left end is: d must be at least (first lantern position) because we need to reach from 0 to the first lantern? Wait, no: the first lantern is at a0, so to cover from a0 to 0, we need d >= a0 (because the light must extend a0 units to the left). But wait, if d is 2 and the lantern is at 2, then the leftmost point it covers is 0. If d=1, then the leftmost point is 1, so 0 is not covered.\n\n Actually, the condition for the left end is: d >= (a0 - 0) because the lantern at a0 must cover from 0 to a0. But wait, that's not the case. The lantern covers [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require 0 >= a0-d -> d >= a0. But if the first lantern is at 2, then d must be at least 2 to cover 0.\n\n However, consider if we have two lanterns: one at 2 and one at 5. The left end is 0. The first lantern must cover 0, so d>=2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3. The condition for the gap is that the light from the first lantern must extend to at least the next lantern's position minus d, but wait: the two lanterns together must cover the gap. The first lantern extends to 2+d and the second lantern extends from 5-d. We require 2+d >= 5-d -> d>= (5-2)/2 = 1.5. But we already have d>=2 from the left end.\n\n Now, the right end: the last lantern is at 5, so we require d>=5-5=0, which is satisfied.\n\n Therefore, the minimum d is 2.\n\n So the conditions are:\n\n   candidate1 = a[0] / 1   [wait, no: actually we require d >= a[0] to cover the left end? But wait, if the street starts at 0 and the first lantern is at a0, then the left edge of the first lantern's light is a0-d. We require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. However, note that if a0 is 0, then d>=0. \n\n But wait, let me reframe: the condition for the left end is that the entire segment [0, a0] must be covered. The light from the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The leftmost point is 0. The distance from a0 to 0 is a0. So the light must extend at least a0 to the left. Therefore, d must be at least a0.\n\n Similarly, for the right end: the last lantern must extend at least (l - a_last) to the right, so d must be at least (l - a_last).\n\n And for the gaps: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1], the gap between them is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The light from the left lantern must extend to the right lantern's coverage: so we require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d -> d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n However, note: we might not need to cover the entire gap by both sides. Actually, the entire gap must be covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The left lantern covers up to a[i]+d, and the right lantern covers from a[i+1]-d. We require that a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, so d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n But wait, what if the gap is large? Then we require d to be at least (gap/2). However, the left end condition might require a larger d.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the maximum among:\n\n   d1 = a[0]   (to cover from 0 to a0)\n   d2 = (l - a[-1])\n   d3 = (max_gap_between_consecutive_lanterns) / 2\n\n However, wait: is the left end condition really a[0]? Consider: if the first lantern is at 0, then d1=0. Then we consider the gaps.\n\n But wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the left end is covered. Similarly, the last lantern at l requires d>=0.\n\n However, the condition for the left end is not just the first lantern being at 0. Actually, the condition is: the light must cover from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern is at 0, so the left edge is 0-d, but we don't care beyond 0. The condition is that 0 is covered, and the first lantern's light extends from 0-d to 0+d. Since 0-d might be negative, but we only care from 0 to l. The condition for 0 is met if 0+d >= 0, which is always true. The left edge doesn't matter because we start at 0.\n\n Actually, the correct conditions are:\n\n   Condition 1: The first lantern must cover from 0 to the first lantern. The leftmost point is 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. Therefore, we require d >= a[0] (so that the left edge of the first lantern's light, a[0]-d, is <= 0). But note: the light must cover 0, so we require that 0 is in [a[0]-d, a[0]+d]. This is equivalent to d >= a[0] (since a[0]-d <= 0 => d>=a[0]). \n\n   Condition 2: Similarly, for the right end, we require d >= (l - a[-1]).\n\n   Condition 3: For each gap i (from 0 to n-2): the gap between a[i] and a[i+1] is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The two adjacent lanterns must cover the entire gap. The left lantern's light goes from a[i]-d to a[i]+d, and the right lantern's light goes from a[i+1]-d to a[i+1]+d. To cover the gap, we require that the two intervals overlap or meet. The condition is that a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d, which gives d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n But note: if we set d to be the maximum of these three values, then:\n\n   Example 1: ['2 5\\n2 5'] \n        d1 = 2\n        d2 = 0\n        d3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        Then maximum is 2.\n\n   Example 2: Input '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0'\n        Sorted: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n        d1 = 0\n        d2 = 15-15 = 0\n        d3 = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ) \n            = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5\n\n        Output: 2.5\n\n However, the sample output is 2.5.\n\n But wait, in the example \"7 15\", the entire street is from 0 to 15. With d=2.5:\n\n   The lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> from 0 to 2.5 (we are only concerned from 0 to 15, so [0,2.5] is covered).\n   Then the next lantern at 3: covers [0.5, 5.5] -> so from 2.5 to 5.5 is covered by the next lantern? Actually, the first lantern's coverage goes to 2.5, and the second lantern (at 3) starts at 3-2.5=0.5, so they overlap. Then the gap from 2.5 to 3 is covered by both.\n\n   But wait, the gap between 0 and 3 is 3. The condition for the gap was 3/2=1.5, which is less than 2.5, so that's okay.\n\n   Then the gap between 3 and 5: (5-3)=2 -> condition 1.0, which is okay.\n\n   Then 5 to 7: gap 2 -> condition 1.0, okay.\n\n   Then 7 to 9: gap 2 -> condition 1.0, okay.\n\n   Then 9 to 14: gap 5 -> condition 2.5, so we need at least 2.5. Then the lantern at 9 covers from 6.5 to 11.5, and the lantern at 14 covers from 11.5 to 16.5. So the gap from 11.5 to 14 is covered by the lantern at 14? Actually, the lantern at 14 must cover from 14-2.5=11.5 to 14+2.5=16.5. So from 9 to 14: the lantern at 9 covers up to 11.5, and the lantern at 14 starts at 11.5. So the entire street is covered.\n\n   And the right end: 15 is the end. The last lantern is at 15, so it covers from 12.5 to 17.5. Since the street ends at 15, we require that the light reaches 15: 15<=15+2.5 -> yes, and the left side of the last lantern must meet the previous one. The previous lantern is at 14, which covers up to 14+2.5=16.5, so the gap between 14 and 15 is covered by the last lantern's left side (which starts at 11.5) and the last lantern's right side (which goes beyond 15). But also, the condition for the right end is d>= (15-15)=0, so that's fine.\n\n However, note: the condition for the right end is not the same as the left end. For the right end, we require that the last lantern's light covers up to l. The last lantern is at a[-1]=15. The condition is that 15 must be covered by the last lantern: so 15 <= 15+d -> d>=0. But wait, what if the last lantern is not at l? Then we require d>= (l - a[-1]). In this example, the last lantern is at 15, so no problem.\n\n But wait, what if the last lantern is not at l? Then we require d>= (l - a[-1]). In the condition above, we considered d2 = (l - a[-1]), which in this example is 0.\n\n However, consider another example: \n   n=1, l=10, lantern at 5.\n   Then the left end: d>=5, the right end: d>=5, and there are no gaps. So d must be at least 5.\n\n   With d=5, the lantern covers [0,10] (from 5-5=0 to 5+5=10). Perfect.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n   Read n and l.\n   Read the list of n integers and sort it.\n\n   If n==0, then we have no lanterns. Then we must cover the entire street [0,l] with no lanterns. Then d must be at least (l/2) for the entire street? Actually, the entire street must be covered by one lantern? But wait, without any lantern, we cannot cover unless d is infinite? But the problem says there are n lanterns. The constraints say n>=1.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n     2. Initialize:\n          d_left = a[0]   # because we need to cover from 0 to a[0]: d must be at least a[0]\n          d_right = l - a[-1]   # because we need to cover from a[-1] to l: d must be at least (l - a[-1])\n          d_gap = 0.0\n\n     3. Iterate over the gaps between consecutive lanterns (from i=0 to i=n-2):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          gap_required = gap / 2.0\n          if gap_required > d_gap:\n              d_gap = gap_required\n\n     4. Then answer = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n   However, wait: what if the first lantern is at 0? Then d_left=0, which is okay. But what if there are multiple lanterns at the same location? The condition for gaps will account for the gaps correctly.\n\n   But wait, consider the left end condition: we require d>=a[0]. What if the first lantern is at 0? Then d>=0, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is not exactly d>=a[0]. Let me derive:\n\n        The first lantern is at position a0. To cover 0, we require that the light from the first lantern extends at least to 0. The leftmost point of the first lantern's light is a0-d. We require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0.\n\n   Similarly, the right end: the last lantern at a_{n-1} must cover l, so we require a_{n-1}+d >= l -> d>= l - a_{n-1}.\n\n   And for the gaps, the condition is d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   But wait, in the example with two lanterns at 2 and 5, the left end condition is d>=2, which is correct.\n\n   However, consider an example with the first lantern not at 0:\n\n        n=1, l=10, lantern at 8.\n\n        Then d_left = 8, d_right = 10-8=2, d_gap = 0 -> so answer=8.\n\n        Then the lantern at 8 must cover from 0 to 10. The coverage is [0, 16]. So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But is 8 the minimal? Actually, the minimal d must be at least 8 (to cover from 0 to 8) and at least 2 (to cover from 8 to 10). So the minimal d is 8.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the right end is d>=2, but the condition for the left end is d>=8, so we take the maximum.\n\n   Another example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 3 and 9.\n\n        d_left = 3\n        d_right = 10-9=1\n        d_gap = (9-3)/2 = 3\n\n        Then answer = max(3,1,3)=3.\n\n        Check: d=3, then:\n           first lantern: [0,6] (from 3-3=0 to 3+3=6)\n           second lantern: [6,12] (from 9-3=6 to 9+3=12)\n           Entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But wait, what if we use d=2?\n        first lantern: [1,5] -> does not cover 0, so fails.\n\n        d=3 is the minimum.\n\n   However, note the gap condition: the gap between 3 and 9 is 6, so we require d>=3. The left end requires d>=3. The right end requires d>=1.\n\n   So the algorithm is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the street has multiple lanterns, but the first lantern is not the only one? \n\n        Example: n=3, l=10, lanterns at [2,5,9]\n\n        d_left = 2\n        d_right = 1\n        gaps: (5-2)=3 -> gap_required=1.5, (9-5)=4 -> gap_required=2.0\n        Then answer = max(2,1,2)=2.\n\n        With d=2:\n           first lantern: [0,4] (covers 0 to 4)\n           second lantern: [3,7] (covers 3 to 7)\n           third lantern: [7,11] (covers 7 to 11, so from 7 to 10 is covered)\n\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But wait, the gap between 2 and 5: the first lantern covers up to 4, and the second lantern starts at 3. So the coverage from 0 to 7 is done. Then the third lantern covers from 7 to 11. The gap between 5 and 9 is 4, and the condition was 2.0, so d>=2 is required. And indeed, the second lantern covers up to 7 (5+2) and the third lantern starts at 7 (9-2). So the gap is covered.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the gap is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the entire gap. The gap is from 5 to 9, and the two lanterns are at 5 and 9. The left lantern (at 5) covers up to 5+2=7, and the right lantern (at 9) covers from 9-2=7. So the gap is closed at 7. The entire street from 0 to 10 is covered.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the left end: d>=2, which is satisfied.\n\n   However, note: what if we set d=1.9? Then the left end: 2-1.9=0.1, so the first lantern covers from 0.1 to 3.9. Then 0 is not covered.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d is 2.\n\n   But wait, the gap condition for the gap between 2 and 5: (5-2)=3, so we require d>=1.5. But the left end condition requires d>=2. So the maximum is 2.\n\n   However, the gap between 5 and 9 is 4, which requires d>=2.0.\n\n   So the answer is 2.\n\n   But wait, the gap condition for the gap between 2 and 5: (5-2)=3, so d>=1.5. But we are using d=2, which is greater than 1.5, so that's okay.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      # If there's only one lantern, then we have to check both ends.\n      # Conditions:\n      #   d >= a[0]   (to cover from 0 to a[0])\n      #   d >= l - a[0]   (if there's only one, then the same lantern must cover the entire street? Actually, the single lantern must cover from 0 to l.\n      #   But wait, if there's one lantern, then the condition for the left end is a[0] (distance from 0 to lantern) and for the right end is l - a[0]. So we require d >= max(a[0], l - a[0])\n\n      # However, in our algorithm above we split the conditions: left end condition is a[0] (the first element) and the right end condition is l - a[-1]. For a single lantern, a[0] == a[-1], so d >= max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\n      # But wait, if the lantern is at position x, then we require d >= x (for the left) and d >= l-x (for the right). So d must be at least max(x, l-x).\n\n      # Our current algorithm for the single lantern case:\n\n        d_left = x\n        d_right = l - x\n        d_gap = 0\n\n        Then answer = max(x, l-x, 0) = max(x, l-x)\n\n      This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street by themselves? Actually, the condition for the gaps is only when there are consecutive lanterns. For a single lantern, there are no gaps.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        d_left = a[0]   # because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]: d >= a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]   # because the last lantern must cover from a[-1] to l: d >= l - a[-1]\n        d_gap = 0.0\n\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2, because the two lanterns must meet in the middle.\n            if gap/2 > d_gap:\n                d_gap = gap/2\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n        Print ans with 4 decimal places.\n\n   But wait, what if there are duplicate lanterns? For example, two lanterns at the same position.\n\n        Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at [5,5]\n\n        Then sorted: [5,5]\n\n        d_left = 5\n        d_right = 5\n        d_gap = (5-5)/2 = 0\n\n        Then ans = 5.\n\n        With d=5, the first lantern covers [0,10] and the second lantern also covers [0,10]. So the entire street is covered.\n\n        However, the minimal d should be 5.\n\n        But wait, is there a smaller d? Suppose d=4. Then the first lantern covers [1,9] and the second lantern covers [1,9]. Then the points 0 and 10 are not covered.\n\n        Therefore, d=5 is the minimal.\n\n   However, consider: the condition for the left end: the first lantern must cover 0 -> d>=5. Similarly for the right end: d>=5. The gap condition is 0.\n\n   So the algorithm is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we have multiple lanterns that are not sorted? We sort them.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the same point, and we can have multiple at the same point.\n\n   One more corner: n=0, but the problem states n>=1.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        d_left = a[0]  # to cover the left end\n        d_right = l - a[-1]  # to cover the right end\n        d_gap = 0.0\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we skip the gap loop (n-1 times, so if n==1, then the loop runs 0 times)\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap > 2 * d_gap:  # We can avoid floating point comparison by storing d_gap as float, but we can also do:\n                d_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say n can be 1, so we must handle that.\n\n   But wait: what if the street is already fully covered by the lanterns? Then d=0 might be sufficient? However, the conditions:\n\n        d_left: if the first lantern is at 0, then d_left=0. d_right: if the last lantern is at l, then d_right=0. d_gap: if the lanterns are contiguous, then 0. Then ans=0.\n\n        Example: n=1, l=0, then a=[0]. Then d_left=0, d_right=0, d_gap=0 -> ans=0.\n\n        But the street is from 0 to 0, so one point. A lantern at 0 with d=0 covers [0,0] -> the point. So correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the street has length l (from 0 to l). So if l=0, then the street is a single point.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l)\". So if l=0, then all ai=0.\n\n   Therefore, the code above works.\n\n   However, wait: what if the lanterns are placed such that the left end is not the only constraint? \n\n        Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at [0,10]\n\n        Then d_left=0, d_right=0, d_gap=(10-0)/2=5. Then ans=5.\n\n        With d=5: \n            first lantern: [-5,5] -> covers [0,5] (since we only care [0,10])\n            second lantern: [5,15] -> covers [5,10]\n\n        So the entire street is covered.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the left end: d_left=0, meaning d>=0. The condition for the right end: d>=0. The gap condition: d>=5. So the answer is 5.\n\n   However, note: the left end is covered by the first lantern with d=0? Actually, the first lantern at 0 with d=0 covers [0,0]. Then the rest from 0 to 10 must be covered by the two lanterns. The gap condition requires d>=5.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, is 5 the minimal? What if d=4.9? Then the first lantern covers [-4.9,4.9] (so [0,4.9]), the second lantern covers [5.1,14.9]. Then the point 5 is not covered. So d must be at least 5.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n   However, there's a nuance: the condition for the left end is d>=a[0] (the first lantern's position). But in the example [0,10] the first lantern is at 0, so d>=0. But the gap condition requires d>=5. So we take the maximum.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the left end is not just the first lantern's position? Actually, we derived that the condition for the left end is d>=a[0] (the first lantern's position). However, consider if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition is d>=0. But if the first lantern is at 0, then the left end is already covered by the lantern's coverage (even if d=0) because the lantern at 0 with d=0 covers 0. But the entire street must be covered from 0 to 10. The gap condition forces d>=5.\n\n   So the condition for the left end is independent of the gap condition. The condition for the left end is: the first lantern must cover from 0 to itself. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0] (if a[0] is the first element). So the left edge of the first lantern's light is a[0]-d. We require a[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=a[0]. \n\n   In the example [0,10]: a[0]=0, so d>=0.\n\n   Now, consider if the first lantern is at 0, but the second lantern is very far away. The condition for the left end is 0, but the gap condition is (10-0)/2=5. Then the answer is 5.\n\n   However, what if the first lantern is at 0 and the second lantern is at 1? Then the gap condition is (1-0)/2=0.5, and the right end condition is l-1 (if l=1, then 0; if l>1, then l-1). But wait, the street length is l, so if l=1, then the entire street is [0,1]. The first lantern at 0 and the second at 1. Then d must be at least 0 (left end) and at least 0 (right end) and at least 0.5 (gap). Then d=0.5.\n\n        Check: d=0.5\n            first lantern: [-0.5,0.5] -> covers [0,0.5] (since we start at 0, we cover [0,0.5])\n            second lantern: [0.5,1.5] -> covers [0.5,1] (since the street ends at ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street from 0 to `l` are covered by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern lights up all points within a distance `d` from its position. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the smallest `d` that ensures every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light. The solution involves checking three main conditions:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (point 0). This requires `d` to be at least the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (point `l`). This requires `d` to be at least the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the combined light from both must cover the gap between them. This requires `d` to be at least half the distance between the two consecutive lanterns.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily access the first and last lanterns and to iterate through consecutive pairs.\n   - **Calculate Requirements**: Compute the required `d` for each of the three conditions (left end, right end, and gaps between lanterns) and take the maximum value among them. This maximum value will be the minimal `d` needed to cover the entire street.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent iteration to check gaps is O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    d_left = a[0]\n    d_right = l - a[-1]\n    d_gap = 0.0\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap / 2.0 > d_gap:\n                d_gap = gap / 2.0\n                \n    ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate processing the leftmost and rightmost lanterns first and then checking consecutive pairs.\n3. **Calculating Minimum `d`**:\n   - **Left End (`d_left`)**: The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0).\n   - **Right End (`d_right`)**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n   - **Gaps (`d_gap`)**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the required `d` to ensure their combined light covers the gap between them (half the distance between the two lanterns).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among `d_left`, `d_right`, and `d_gap` is the minimal `d` needed to light the entire street. This result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to ensure the entire street is covered by the minimal light radius, leveraging sorting and linear iteration for optimal performance.",
