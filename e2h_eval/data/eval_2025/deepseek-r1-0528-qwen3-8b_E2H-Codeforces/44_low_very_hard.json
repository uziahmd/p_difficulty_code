He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a.\n Conditions:\n   - We have to distribute the n problems into k contiguous segments (each day is a contiguous sequence from the start).\n   - We cannot skip any problem.\n\n The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty in the problems solved that day.\n The total profit is the sum of the profits over the k days.\n\n We wish to maximize the total profit.\n\n Observation:\n Since the problems are given in a fixed order (from left to right) and we must use contiguous segments, the segmentation is a partition of the array into k contiguous non-empty parts.\n\n However, note: the entire set of problems must be used, and each day at least one problem.\n\n We can think of the problem as: we need to choose k-1 split points (between the n problems). But note that the profit of a day is the maximum element in the segment.\n\n Let dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit we can get from the first i problems (i.e., a[0..i-1]) using j days.\n\n But note: n, k up to 2000 -> so we can do O(n^2 * k) if we are careful? Actually, let's consider:\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n Since the profit for a day is the maximum in the segment, and the segments are contiguous, we can precompute the next greater element (or use a stack) to know the contribution of each element.\n\n However, note: the total profit is the sum of the maxima of the segments. We want to maximize the sum.\n\n Consider: We are forced to use contiguous segments. We can also note that the last segment must end at the last problem.\n\n Another idea: greedy segmentation from left to right.\n\n But note: the example: [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2] with k=3: [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2] -> total 5+6+9=20.\n\n How can we break the array?\n\n Insight: The total profit is the sum of the maxima of the segments. We want to maximize this.\n\n Also note: the array is fixed and the segments are contiguous. Each element will be the maximum of its segment only if it is the maximum in the entire segment. Moreover, an element that is not the maximum of its segment does not contribute.\n\n So we can try to assign segments such that we use the largest numbers as much as possible. However, note that if we break too early after a large number, we might use that large number again as the maximum of a later segment? Actually, no: because the segments are contiguous and we cannot go back.\n\n Important: The same large number cannot appear in two different segments because the segments are disjoint and contiguous.\n\n However, note: the same large number might be included in a segment and then we take the maximum of the entire segment. But if we have two large numbers, they must be in different segments? Actually, they can be in the same segment, then the larger one will dominate. But if we break between them, then they become separate segment maxima.\n\n So the idea is: we want to use the largest numbers as the maxima for as few segments as possible? Or maybe we want to use the largest numbers as the maxima for many segments? Actually, we can only use a number as the maximum for one segment (the one that contains it) and if we break the array at certain points, we can make each occurrence of a large number (that is a local maximum) the maximum of its own segment.\n\n However, note: the array is fixed. The entire array must be partitioned.\n\n Alternate approach: dynamic programming.\n\n Let dp[j] = the maximum total profit we can achieve for the first j problems (using some days, but we need to know how many days). We can do:\n\n   dp[i][j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems using j days.\n\n Then, we consider the last segment (the j-th day) which covers from index x to i-1 (0-indexed, so the segment is from x to i-1). Then:\n\n   dp[i][j] = max_{x from j-1 to i-1} { dp[x][j-1] + (max value in the segment a[x..i-1]) }\n\n But note: the condition that the first j-1 days must cover exactly the first x problems (so we use x problems) and then the last segment uses i - x problems.\n\n However, the state has two dimensions: i from 0 to n, j from 0 to k. The state dp[i][j] depends on dp[x][j-1] for all x from j-1 to i-1, and then we need to compute the maximum value in the segment a[x..i-1].",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving all problems over exactly `k` days. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The key insight is to use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal segmentation of the problem list into `k` contiguous segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the first `i` problems and `j` represents the number of days used. The value `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum total profit achievable by segmenting the first `i` problems into `j` days.\n\n2. **Segmentation and Maximum Calculation**: For each state `dp[i][j]`, we consider all possible last segments (from day `j-1` to day `j`). The last segment ends at the `i-th` problem and starts at some position `x` (from `j-1` to `i-1`). The profit for this segment is the maximum difficulty in the subarray from `x` to `i-1`.\n\n3. **Efficiency Optimization**: To avoid recalculating the maximum for every segment, we precompute a helper array `next_max` where `next_max[i]` stores the next greater element to the right of `a[i]`. This helps in efficiently determining the maximum difficulty in any segment ending at `i`.\n\n4. **Backtracking for Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack to find the exact segmentation that achieves the maximum profit. Starting from `dp[n][k]`, we determine the split points by checking where the maximum value in the current segment changes, ensuring optimality.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    next_max = [0] * (n+1)\n    stack = []\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while stack and a[stack[-1]] <= a[i]:\n            stack.pop()\n        if stack:\n            next_max[i] = stack[-1]\n        else:\n            next_max[i] = n\n        stack.append(i)\n    \n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if j > i:\n                continue\n            best_val = 0\n            cur_max = 0\n            ptr = i-1\n            while ptr >= j-1:\n                if a[ptr] > cur_max:\n                    cur_max = a[ptr]\n                    best_val = cur_max\n                if ptr == next_max[ptr]:\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[ptr][j-1] + best_val)\n                else:\n                    prev_ptr = next_max[ptr]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[ptr][j-1] + best_val)\n                    ptr = prev_ptr - 1\n                ptr -= 1\n\n    result_days = []\n    total_problems = n\n    days_used = k\n    start_index = n\n    for day in range(days_used, 0, -1):\n        pos = next_max[start_index] - 1\n        count = start_index - pos\n        result_days.append(count)\n        start_index = pos\n\n    result_days.reverse()\n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result_days)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties.\n2. **Next Maximum Calculation**: The `next_max` array is computed using a stack to keep track of the next greater element for each position, which helps in efficiently determining segment maxima.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with zeros, and `dp[0][0]` is set to zero as the base case (no problems, no days).\n4. **Filling DP Table**: For each state `(i, j)`, the solution considers all possible segments ending at `i` and starting from `j-1` to `i-1`, updating the DP table with the maximum profit achievable.\n5. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, the solution backtracks from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact segmentation. The `next_max` array guides the backtracking to ensure optimality by identifying where to split the segments.\n6. **Output**: The maximum total profit and the segmentation details (number of problems per day) are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal segmentation using dynamic programming and backtracking, leveraging the next greater element for performance optimization.",
