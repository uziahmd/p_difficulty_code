            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (minimum 0) and we want to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, and we can draw up to n extra tiles (n>=0), then the total number of tiles will be 3+n.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require forming a complete hand (like in mahjong) but just having *at least one* mentsu (which is 3 tiles). But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily, and we can use the drawn ones arbitrarily. Importantly, we don't need to use all the tiles.\n\n So, we are trying to find the minimum number of draws such that there exists a set of 3 tiles (which may be from the original or drawn) that forms either a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". The hand after drawing will have 3+n tiles, and we only require one mentsu (so one set of 3 tiles that is either a triplet or a sequence) to be present.\n\n But note: the drawn tiles can be chosen arbitrarily. We can choose which ones to draw.\n\n We have two types of mentsu: koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the initial three tiles already form a mentsu, then answer 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we consider drawing 1, 2, ... until we can form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might form a mentsu by drawing more than one tile, but we are looking for the minimum.\n\n There are two possibilities: \n   a) We can form a koutsu. For a koutsu, we need three identical tiles. \n      Example: [x, x, x] (where x can be represented by a string like \"1m\")\n\n   b) We can form a shuntsu. For a shuntsu, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n But note: the hand has 3 tiles initially, and we can draw up to 2 more (or even more if needed? Actually, let's think about the possibilities).\n\n However, note that with 3 tiles we can already form a mentsu if we have a triplet or a sequence. But what if we have to draw more?\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 0: 0 draws (already a mentsu)\n\n Case 1: 1 draw\n   - With one extra tile, we can form a mentsu if:\n        Option A: We complete a triplet. For example, if we have two of the same tile, then adding one more of that tile gives a triplet.\n        Option B: We complete a sequence. For example, if we have two tiles that are part of a potential sequence. \n\n        For sequences: \n          Consider having two tiles that are adjacent or separated by one missing number.\n\n        Example: \n          [1m, 2m, ?] -> we can draw 3m to complete the sequence, but wait, we already have two? Actually, the hand is three tiles, so we have three. \n\n        Actually, the hand is three tiles. So if we have one draw, then we have four tiles. But note: we don't need to use all the tiles. We just need one mentsu (three tiles) from the four.\n\n        However, the problem is: we are allowed to draw one tile, and then we look at the entire hand (four tiles) and check if there is any mentsu (any three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu). But note: we can also form a mentsu without using the drawn tile.\n\n        But wait: if the original three do not form a mentsu, then we have to consider the possibility that by drawing one tile we might form a mentsu.\n\n        Possibilities for one draw:\n\n        Triplet:\n          - If there is a tile that appears at least twice, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet (if we have two, then we get three). But note: we can also have two different tiles that are the same? Actually, the representation is unique: same digit and same suit.\n\n          Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> we have two '1m'. Drawing a '1m' completes the triplet.\n\n        Sequence:\n          - We might have two tiles that are part of a sequence. For example, ['1m','2m','4m']: \n            We have two consecutive: [1m,2m] and then 4m is separate. But wait, we can draw a 3m to complete [1m,2m,3m]. Also, we can draw a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If there are duplicate tiles in the hand, drawing one more tile of the same kind will form a triplet (koutsu).\n3. **Sequence Check**: We look for potential sequences (shuntsu) by examining all possible triplets that could be formed by adding one or two tiles. For sequences, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. The missing tiles required to complete such a sequence are considered.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where no mentsu can be formed with fewer than three tiles by considering the possibility of drawing up to two additional tiles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing mentsu: either triplet or sequence\n    def is_triplet(tiles):\n        from collections import Counter\n        count = Counter(tiles)\n        for tile, cnt in count.items():\n            if cnt >= 3:\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    def is_sequence(tiles):\n        if len(set(tiles)) < 3:\n            return False\n        tiles_sorted = sorted(set(tiles), key=lambda x: (x[0], 'm','p','s'))\n        if len(tiles_sorted) != 3:\n            return False\n        num1, suit1 = tiles_sorted[0]\n        num2, suit2 = tiles_sorted[1]\n        num3, suit3 = tiles_sorted[2]\n        if suit1 == suit2 == suit3 and int(num1)+1 == int(num2) and int(num2)+1 == int(num3):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    if is_triplet(tiles) or is_sequence(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Count duplicates for triplet\n    from collections import Counter\n    count_tiles = Counter(tiles)\n    max_count = max(count_tiles.values())\n    if max_count == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one-draw sequence completion\n    suits = set(tile[1] for tile in tiles)\n    if len(suits) == 1:\n        nums = sorted(set(int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles))\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n == 2:\n            min_val = min(nums)\n            max_val = max(nums)\n            if max_val - min_val == 1:\n                print(1)\n                return\n        elif n == 3:\n            min_val = min(nums)\n            max_val = max(nums)\n            if max_val - min_val == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n                \n    # Check for two-draw sequence completion\n    if len(suits) == 1:\n        nums = sorted(set(int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles))\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n == 1:\n            print(2)\n            return\n        elif n == 2:\n            min_val = min(nums)\n            max_val = max(nums)\n            if max_val - min_val == 1:\n                print(2)\n                return\n            else:\n                print(2)\n                return\n        elif n == 3:\n            min_val = min(nums)\n            max_val = max(nums)\n            if max_val - min_val == 2:\n                print(2)\n                return\n            else:\n                print(2)\n                return\n                \n    # For mixed suits, we might need to draw more\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the initial three tiles form a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). If they do, it immediately returns 0.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If there are two identical tiles in the hand, drawing one more of the same tile forms a triplet, so the answer is 1.\n3. **Sequence Check**: For sequences, the code checks if the tiles can form a sequence by adding one or two tiles. It considers the suit and number values to determine the missing tiles required for a sequence.\n4. **Edge Handling**: If the tiles are of different suits or the numbers don't align for a sequence, the code defaults to requiring two draws to form a mentsu, as these cases typically need more tiles to create a valid sequence or triplet.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws needed, ensuring optimal performance even for edge cases.",
