On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is: We are given an array of 1s and 2s. We can reverse any contiguous interval (or not, if we choose [l, r] and reverse it). Then we want the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the resulting array.\n\nObservation:\nSince the sequence only contains 1s and 2s, the non-decreasing subsequence can be:\n  - All 1s (if there are k ones, then k is a candidate)\n  - All 2s (if there are m twos, then m is a candidate)\n  - A sequence that starts with some 1s and then some 2s (so the entire sequence is non-decreasing)\n\nBut note: the reversal operation can change the order of 1s and 2s. However, note that the reversal of a contiguous interval will only swap the positions of 1s and 2s within that interval.\n\nLet:\n  total_ones = total number of 1s in the entire array.\n  total_twos = total number of 2s.\n\nWithout any reversal, the entire array's LNDS is at least max(total_ones, total_twos). But also, we might have a longer one if we can arrange so that we have a transition from 1 to 2 without breaking the non-decreasing property.\n\nHowever, note: the reversal operation can help to bring together more 1s or more 2s? Actually, the reversal might help to make a longer non-decreasing subsequence by having a block of 1s and then a block of 2s.\n\nBut note: the reversal doesn't necessarily have to be entirely within the 1s and 2s. It can mix them. However, the entire array after reversal must be non-decreasing as much as possible.\n\nWe can think of two possibilities for the entire sequence:\n  1. The entire sequence might be split into three parts: \n        [left part] [reversed middle] [right part]\n     The reversed middle can be used to fix the ordering of 1s and 2s.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reverse any contiguous interval. So we can also consider reversing nothing (i.e., the original array) or reversing a part that might connect two segments.\n\nHowever, note that the problem asks for the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nLet me break down:\n\nCase 1: Without reversal, the entire array might have a non-decreasing subsequence that is the whole array if it is already non-decreasing? Or maybe not, because we have only 1 and 2. Actually, the entire array is non-decreasing if and only if all the 1s come first and then 2s. \n\nBut note: the problem allows reversal of any contiguous interval. Therefore, we can also consider reversing an interval that includes both 1s and 2s.\n\nAnother observation: After reversal, the entire array still has the same multiset of numbers. Therefore, the total ones and twos remain the same.\n\nBut note: the reversal might allow us to merge two separate groups of 1s and 2s. For example, if we have [1, 2, 1, 2], we can reverse [2,3] to get [1,1,2,2]. Then the entire array is non-decreasing, so the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.\n\nHow do we approach?\n\nLet n = len(a). The maximum possible non-decreasing subsequence we can have is n if the entire array becomes non-decreasing. Otherwise, the entire array isn't non-decreasing, but we can have a non-decreasing subsequence of length = (number of 1s) + (number of 2s) = n, but wait: actually, if we can arrange the entire array to be [all 1s][all 2s] then the entire array is non-decreasing and the length is n.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation can only reverse a contiguous part. How many reversals? Actually, we can only reverse one contiguous interval.\n\nSo the question becomes: what is the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence we can achieve by reversing one contiguous interval?\n\nNote: In the new sequence, the non-decreasing subsequence can be the entire array (if we reverse appropriately) or a part of it.\n\nBut note: the entire array being non-decreasing is a special case of a non-decreasing subsequence (with length n). So the goal is to see if we can achieve a non-decreasing sequence of length n, or if not, then the next best.\n\nHowever, note that the array only has 1s and 2s. The entire array is non-decreasing if and only if we have all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\nSo, can we reverse a contiguous interval to get all 1s then all 2s?\n\nExample: \n  Original: [1, 2, 1, 2]\n  Reverse [2,3]: [1, 1, 2, 2] -> which is non-decreasing.\n\nHow about: [1, 1, 2, 2]? Then we don't need to reverse? Actually, we can also reverse an empty interval (which is allowed by [l, r] with l<=r, and we can choose l=r, then no change).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is already [all ones then all twos]? Then the reversal does nothing, and the answer is n.\n\nWhat if we cannot get the entire array to be non-decreasing? Actually, with one reversal, we can only fix one contiguous segment. But note: the array has only two distinct values. So the entire array is non-decreasing if and only if there is no 2 appearing before a 1.\n\nIf there is a 2 before a 1, then we can reverse the segment that starts from the first occurrence of a 2 that is misplaced until the last occurrence of a 1 that is misplaced? Actually, we can fix the entire array by reversing the entire array? \n\nWait, let's try:\n  Example: [2, 1] -> reverse [1,2] becomes [1,2] -> non-decreasing. So we can fix two elements.\n\nBut what about more complex cases? \n\nActually, the condition for the entire array to be non-decreasing is that we have no inversion (no 2 comes before a 1). So we can reverse any contiguous segment that contains all the inversions? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider:\n\nLet the original array be A.\n\nWe can form an array B by reversing a contiguous interval [l, r].\n\nThen, we want to know: what is the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in B.\n\nBut note: the entire array B is still composed of the same number of 1s and 2s. The only thing that matters is the relative order of 1s and 2s.\n\nIn fact, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in B is the length of the longest contiguous block of 1s (if we don't have any 2s) or the entire array if we have the pattern 1s then 2s.\n\nBut note: even if the entire array is not non-decreasing, the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be the entire array of 1s and 2s if we have a single run of 1s and then 2s.\n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. Since the entire array has the same set of elements, the maximum possible non-decreasing subsequence we can have is n (if we can arrange the entire array to be non-decreasing) or less.\n\nHow to check if we can arrange the entire array to be non-decreasing (i.e., all 1s then all 2s) by reversing one contiguous interval?\n\nActually, note: the reversal operation is a single contiguous reversal. So we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\nWe can also note: the reversal operation can be used to move a 2 to the right and a 1 to the left? Actually, when we reverse a segment, we flip the order of that segment.\n\nLet me define:\n  Let x = the number of 1s that are originally to the left of the first 2 (in the original array) and then we have some 1s that are after 2s.\n\nThe entire array is non-decreasing if we have all 1s then all 2s. So we need to move every 1 that is after a 2 to the left, and move every 2 that is before a 1 to the right.\n\nBut note: we are allowed only one reversal.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n\nWhat is the minimum reversal operation (one contiguous reversal) that would allow us to have the entire array non-decreasing?\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire array to be non-decreasing, but the longest non-decreasing subsequence. However, the entire array being non-decreasing gives the maximum possible value (n). \n\nBut sometimes we cannot get the entire array to be non-decreasing. Then the longest non-decreasing subsequence might be less than n.\n\nHowever, note: since we have only 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is at least the maximum of the count of 1s and the count of 2s. And we can always get a non-decreasing subsequence that is the entire set of 1s (which is total_ones) and the entire set of 2s (which is total_twos). But wait, we can also combine them if they are arranged in increasing order.\n\nBut note: the entire array being non-decreasing is the best: we can take the entire array as a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nSo the maximum possible value is n if we can arrange the entire array to be non-decreasing by one reversal.\n\nBut sometimes we cannot. Then what is the next best?\n\nActually, note: the reversal operation might not be able to fix the entire array, but it might fix a large part. However, the entire array is non-decreasing if and only if we have no inversion (a 2 appears before a 1). \n\nBut wait: even if there are inversions, we can still have a non-decreasing subsequence that uses the entire array? No, because if there is an inversion (a 2 then a 1), then the entire array is not non-decreasing. However, we can skip the inversion? \n\nActually, the non-decreasing subsequence does not require consecutive elements. So even if there is an inversion, we can still have a subsequence that avoids the inversion? \n\nWait, but in the example [2,1] (two elements): \n  Without reversal: \n      [2,1] -> the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1 (either [2] or [1]).\n  With reversal: \n      Reverse [1,2] -> [1,2] -> longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2.\n\nSo we care about the entire array's arrangement for the possibility of having a long non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. The reversal might fix the inversion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWe can consider two strategies:\n\nStrategy 1: The entire array becomes non-decreasing (so the answer is n).\n\nStrategy 2: If we cannot make the entire array non-decreasing, then we look for the next best: \n\nBut note: even if the entire array is not non-decreasing, the longest non-decreasing subsequence might be n-1, n-2, etc.\n\nHowever, note: we can always get a non-decreasing subsequence of length = total_ones (if we take all the 1s) and similarly total_twos. Also, we can combine 1s and 2s if they appear in increasing order.\n\nBut wait: the entire array's non-decreasing subsequence is the entire array if and only if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the array into two parts: the 1s and the 2s. But note: the 1s and 2s might be interleaved arbitrarily.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation is limited to one contiguous interval.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nWe can note that the reversal operation can be seen as flipping a contiguous segment. The entire array's set of 1s and 2s is fixed.\n\nBut the key is: the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the resulting array is the length of the longest contiguous segment that is non-decreasing? Not exactly, because non-decreasing subsequence does not require contiguous elements.\n\nBut wait: in a sequence of 1s and 2s, a non-decreasing subsequence is just a sequence of 1s (any subset of them) and then a sequence of 2s (any subset of them) that are in increasing order. So the length is the number of 1s we can take (from the beginning up to the point where we switch to 2s) plus the number of 2s we can take (from the switch point onward). \n\nHowever, the reversal operation can change the positions of the 1s and 2s.\n\nBut note: we are allowed only one reversal. So we are allowed to reorder a contiguous segment arbitrarily (because reversal is the most extreme reordering for contiguous segments). \n\nBut note: the reversal operation is not arbitrary: we can only reverse a contiguous part.\n\nHowever, we can consider: \n\nWhat is the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence we can achieve?\n\nIt is the maximum of:\n  Option 1: The entire array is non-decreasing (then n).\n  Option 2: The entire array is not non-decreasing, but we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that is almost the entire array.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation might fix some inversions and leave others.\n\nActually, note: the reversal operation can fix multiple inversions. But we are constrained to one contiguous reversal.\n\nWe can also consider: \n\nLet B be the array after reversal. Then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the longest sequence of indices such that the values are non-decreasing.\n\nBut note: we can use dynamic programming to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a given array, but we cannot iterate over all possible reversals (n^2 possibilities) and then run an O(n^2) algorithm (like the standard LNDS for general sequences) because n can be up to 2000 and O(n^2) per reversal would be O(n^4) which is too slow.\n\nBut wait, the array only has 1s and 2s. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the maximum of the following:\n\n  - The length of the entire array if the array is non-decreasing.\n  - Otherwise, we can compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence by noting that it is the entire array if non-decreasing, else we can have:\n\nBut note: the standard way for 1s and 2s: \n\n  Let dp[i] = length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n\n  Then, for each i:\n      dp[i] = 1\n      if a[i] == 2:\n          for j from 0 to i-1:\n              if a[j] <= 2:   # which is always true because a[j] is either 1 or 2, and 1<=2, 2<=2\n                  dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n      if a[i] == 1:\n          # then we can extend any subsequence that ends with 1 or 2? Actually, no: because 2 is greater than 1, so we cannot extend a subsequence that ends with 2 with a 1? \n          # Actually, the condition is a_j <= a_i. For a_i=1, we require a_j <= 1, so a_j must be 1.\n\n          for j from 0 to i-1:\n              if a[j] == 1:\n                  dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n\n  Then the answer is the maximum value in dp.\n\nBut wait, this is the standard O(n^2) algorithm for longest non-decreasing subsequence, and n is up to 2000, so worst-case O(n^2)=4e6, which is acceptable for one array. However, we have to consider all possible contiguous intervals to reverse (n*(n+1)/2 possibilities) and for each we do an O(n^2) DP, which would be O(n^4) ~ 16e12, too slow.\n\nWe need a better approach.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nWe are allowed to reverse any contiguous interval. The entire array has fixed multiset. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nNote: In a binary sequence of 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire array if the array is non-decreasing (all 1s then 2s). Otherwise, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is at least the maximum between the total number of 1s and the total number of 2s.\n\nBut note: we can also have a non-decreasing subsequence that is the entire array except some broken parts. However, the reversal operation can fix some parts.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation can only reverse one contiguous part.\n\nLet me denote:\n  Let the original array be A.\n\nWe can consider: the reversal operation can be applied to an interval [l, r]. Then the new array B is:\n\n  B[0:l-1] = A[0:l-1] (unchanged)\n  B[l:r+1] = reversed(A[l:r+1])\n  B[r+1:] = A[r+1:] (unchanged)\n\nWe wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in B.\n\nBut note: the entire array B has the same multiset as A, so the total number of 1s and 2s is fixed.\n\nIn the new array B, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire array if and only if B is non-decreasing.\n\nBut we can also have a non-decreasing subsequence that is not the entire array. However, the entire array being non-decreasing is the best.\n\nSo the goal: can we reverse one contiguous interval to get an array that is non-decreasing (all 1s then all 2s)?\n\nBut note: the entire array must be non-decreasing, meaning that we cannot have a 2 followed by a 1 anywhere.\n\nSo, we can check: \n  Condition for the entire array to be non-decreasing: \n      There exists an index i (from 0 to n-2) such that A[i] > A[i+1] and A[i] is 2 and A[i+1] is 1. \n\nBut wait, if we reverse a contiguous interval, we can break these inversions.\n\nActually, we can also consider the positions of 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me define:\n  Let L = list of indices where the element is 1.\n  Let R = list of indices where the element is 2.\n\nThen, the entire array is non-decreasing if and only if the smallest index in R is greater than the largest index in L? \n\nBut note: we can have 1s and then 2s, so the condition is that all 1s must come before all 2s. That is, the maximum index of 1 must be less than the minimum index of 2.\n\nNow, if we reverse a contiguous interval, how does it affect the relative order of the 1s and 2s?\n\nActually, reversing a contiguous interval [l, r] will swap the positions of the 1s and 2s within [l, r]. So the set of 1s and 2s remains the same, but their positions change.\n\nWe can consider: the goal is to have all 1s (if any) appear before all 2s (if any). \n\nBut note: the entire array must have all 1s first and then 2s.\n\nSo, the condition for the entire array to be non-decreasing is that the last 1 (the maximum index of 1) is less than the first 2 (the minimum index of 2). \n\nAfter reversal, the positions of the 1s and 2s change. Specifically, the reversal of [l, r] maps an element at position i (within [l, r]) to position l+r-i.\n\nWe wish to know: can we choose [l, r] such that after reversal, the entire array is non-decreasing?\n\nBut note: we don't necessarily need the entire array to be non-decreasing. We just want the longest non-decreasing subsequence to be as long as possible.\n\nBut note: the entire array being non-decreasing gives the maximum (n). Otherwise, the longest non-decreasing subsequence might be n (if the entire array is non-decreasing) or less.\n\nHowever, note: even if the entire array is not non-decreasing, the longest non-decreasing subsequence might be n (if the array is non-decreasing) or if not, then we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that is the entire array of 1s and 2s if they are arranged in increasing order? Actually, no: the entire array must be non-decreasing for the entire array to be a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut wait, the non-decreasing subsequence does not have to be contiguous. However, in a sequence of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire array if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can still take all the 1s and then all the 2s, but they must appear in increasing order (i.e., the 1s must all be before the 2s). \n\nSo the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s (which is n) if and only if the entire array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we cannot take both a 1 and a 2 that are out of order? Actually, no: we can take a 1 and then a 2 if the 1 comes before the 2, even if there are 2s before 1s in the array? \n\nWait, no: the non-decreasing subsequence must have the indices increasing and the values non-decreasing. So if we have a 2 and then a 1, then we cannot include both in the same non-decreasing subsequence? Actually, we can skip the 2 if we want to take the 1 later? \n\nBut note: we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that goes through the 1s and then the 2s that are in the correct order. However, if there is a 2 that appears before a 1, then we cannot include that 2 and that 1 in the same non-decreasing subsequence? \n\nActually, we can. Because the non-decreasing subsequence is defined by indices. Consider: [2, 1] -> we can choose the subsequence [2] or [1] (each of length 1). But we cannot choose both 2 and 1 because 2>1 and the index of 2 is less than the index of 1, so the condition requires that the value at the earlier index is <= the value at the later index. Here, 2<=1 is false.\n\nBut if we have [1,2] then we can take both.\n\nNow, if we have an array that is not non-decreasing, say [2,1,2,1] and we reverse [1,2] (the middle two) to get [2,2,1,1] then the entire array is not non-decreasing, but we can take the two 2s at the beginning and then the two 1s at the end? Actually, we cannot mix 2 and 1 arbitrarily: the non-decreasing subsequence must be non-decreasing. So in [2,2,1,1], we can have a non-decreasing subsequence of length 4? \n\nNo: because we cannot take a 2 and then a 1 (since 2>1). So the longest non-decreasing subsequence in [2,2,1,1] is 2 (for example, the two 2s or the two 1s).\n\nBut wait, we can take the first two 2s and then we cannot take the 1s because 2>1. Similarly, we can take the last two 1s, but we cannot take a 2 and then a 1. \n\nBut note: the non-decreasing subsequence does not require contiguous elements, but the indices must be increasing. However, we can take the two 2s and then the two 1s separately? Actually, no: the entire subsequence must be non-decreasing. So we cannot have a 2 followed by a 1. Therefore, the entire array is broken into two parts: the 2s and the 1s. We can take a non-decreasing subsequence that is either entirely 1s or entirely 2s, or a mix only if we never go from 2 to 1.\n\nSo the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n  - the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence that is composed of 1s (which is the total number of 1s, because we can take all 1s since 1<=1)\n  - the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence that is composed of 2s (which is the total number of 2s)\n  - a sequence that starts with some 1s and then switches to 2s (but then we cannot have any 2 before a 1, and we cannot have any 1 after a 2)\n\nActually, the entire array's non-decreasing subsequence is built by taking a prefix of 1s and a suffix of 2s. But note: we are allowed to skip elements arbitrarily. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum k such that there is a contiguous block of 1s (possibly non-contiguous in the array) and then a contiguous block of 2s (again, non-contiguous in the array) and the entire block is taken in increasing order.\n\nBut note: the non-decreasing subsequence does not require contiguous elements, but the values must be non-decreasing. So we can take all the 1s and then all the 2s that appear after the last 1 we took? \n\nWait, no: we can interleave 1s and 2s as long as the 1s come before the 2s. Actually, we can take a 1, then a 2, then a 1 is not allowed because 2>1. So we can only take 1s and then 2s.\n\nTherefore, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the sum of the total number of 1s and the total number of 2s that appear AFTER the last 1 we took? \n\nActually, no: we can take any 1 and then any 2 that appears later (by index) in the array. But we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1.\n\nSo the idea: \n\n  Let the array be B. Then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is:\n      Let i be the last 1 we take, and j be the first 2 we take. Then we can take all the 1s that are at indices <= i and all the 2s that are at indices >= j, and we require that i < j.\n\nBut note: we can also take only 1s or only 2s.\n\nSo the length is: (# of 1s in the prefix [0, i]) + (# of 2s in the suffix [j, n-1])\n\nBut we are allowed to choose the reversal. \n\nThis seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, note: the entire array is fixed, and the reversal operation is one contiguous reversal. The reversal operation changes the positions of the 1s and 2s.\n\nWe can precompute:\n\n  total_ones = total number of 1s\n  total_twos = n - total_ones\n\nBut the reversal operation doesn't change the counts.\n\nThe best we can hope for is to have the entire array non-decreasing (then answer = n). \n\nBut if we cannot, then the best is to have as many 1s as possible at the beginning and as many 2s as possible at the end.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation can only reverse one contiguous interval. So we can try to move all the 1s to the front and all the 2s to the back by reversing one contiguous interval that covers the misplaced 1s and 2s.\n\nHow to check if we can make the entire array non-decreasing by reversing one contiguous interval?\n\nWe need to find an interval [l, r] such that after reversing [l, r], the entire array is non-decreasing.\n\nBut note: the entire array being non-decreasing means that we have all the 1s (if any) at the beginning and then all the 2s (if any) at the end.\n\nSo the condition for the entire array to be non-decreasing is that the last 1 (if any) must be at an index less than the first 2 (if any).\n\nNow, consider the original array. We can consider the set of indices where the array is not in the desired order (i.e., where there is a 2 followed by a 1). \n\nBut note: the reversal operation can fix several such inversions at once.\n\nActually, we can consider: \n\n  Let X be the set of indices i such that A[i] == 2 and i < j for some j with A[j]==1 (and j>i). \n\nBut after reversal, we can fix a contiguous block of these inversions.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the boundaries:\n\n  Let L = the maximum index of 1 in the entire array (the last 1) if there is at least one 1, otherwise -1.\n  Let R = the minimum index of 2 in the entire array (the first 2) if there is at least one 2, otherwise n.\n\nThen, the array is non-decreasing if and only if L < R.\n\nIf the array is already non-decreasing, then we are done (answer n).\n\nBut if not, we can try to reverse an interval that covers the inversion region.\n\nHow many inversions are there? \n\nBut note: the reversal operation might fix multiple inversions.\n\nWe can also consider: \n\n  We wish to have an array B such that the last 1 is at an index < the first 2.\n\nLet the original array have a block of 2s and then a block of 1s somewhere? \n\nActually, the inversion happens whenever a 2 appears before a 1.\n\nThe minimal reversal that fixes all inversions is to reverse the entire array? \n\nBut wait: reversing the entire array would give the reverse of the array. \n\nExample: [2,1] -> reverse entire array: [1,2] -> fixed.\n\nBut what if the array is [1,2,1]?\n  Already non-decreasing? Actually, no: because there is a 2 then a 1 at the end? Actually, the array [1,2,1] is not non-decreasing because of the last two elements: 2 and 1 form an inversion.\n\nBut wait, the entire array is not non-decreasing if there is any inversion. \n\nWe can fix [1,2,1] by reversing [1,2] (the first two) -> [2,1,1] -> not fixed.\nOr reversing [2,1] (last two) -> [1,1,2] -> fixed.\n\nSo we need to reverse an interval that covers the inversion.\n\nBut note: there can be multiple inversions. \n\nExample: [2,1,2,1] has two inversions: (2,1) at positions0-1, and (2,1) at positions2-3.\n\nWe can fix both by reversing the entire array? Reversing entire array: [1,2,1,2] -> still has an inversion (the first two: 1,2 is ok, then 1,2 is ok) -> wait, [1,2,1,2] is not non-decreasing because we have 2 then 1? Actually, no: the entire array [1,2,1,2] has an inversion at indices1-2: A[1]=2 and A[2]=1.\n\nSo reversing the entire array did not fix the inversion in the middle.\n\nBut we can fix [2,1,2,1] by reversing the middle part [2,1] (positions1-2) to get [2,1,2,1] -> same, or reversing [1,2] (positions0-3) -> [1,2,1,2] -> still has an inversion.\n\nWait, [2,1,2,1] reversed as a whole is [1,2,1,2] -> which has an inversion at index1-2 (2 then 1). \n\nBut we can also consider reversing [1,2,1] (positions0-2) -> [1,2,1,2] -> same as above.\n\nAlternatively, reverse [0:3] (the entire array) -> [1,2,1,2] -> same.\n\nActually, [2,1,2,1] has two disjoint inversions. One reversal cannot fix two disjoint inversions that are not overlapping? \n\nBut note: the reversal operation reverses a contiguous interval. The two inversions are at positions0-1 and positions2-3. These two intervals are disjoint. Reversing one interval can fix one inversion, but not both.\n\nBut wait, we can reverse an interval that covers both inversions? \n\nFor example, reverse [0:3] (the entire array) -> [1,2,1,2] -> still has an inversion at the middle.\n\nOr reverse [0:2] (first three) -> [2,1,2,1] becomes [2,1,2,1] -> wait, no: reversing [0:2] of [2,1,2,1] gives [2,1,2,1] becomes [1,2,2,1] -> now the array is [1,2,2,1]. This has an inversion at the last two: 2 and 1.\n\nBut note: the inversion condition is any 2 that comes before a 1. In [1,2,2,1], the last element is 1 and there are 2s before it, so it's not non-decreasing.\n\nSo it seems we cannot fix two disjoint inversions with one reversal.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire array to be non-decreasing. We only care about the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nIn [2,1,2,1] (original), without reversal: \n  The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (either two 1s or two 2s).\n\nAfter reversal of [0:3] (the entire array) to [1,2,1,2]:\n  The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (because we cannot have a 1 followed by a 2 that is not interrupted by a 1? Actually, wait: [1,2,1,2] -> we can take the first 1, then the second 2, then the third 1? -> no, because 2>1. Or we can take the first 1, then the second 2, then the fourth 2? -> that's valid: [1,2,2] -> length 3.\n\nWait, let me compute for [1,2,1,2]:\n\n  We can take the first 1, then the second 2, then the fourth 2 -> [1,2,2] (length 3).\n  Or the first 1, then the third 1? -> but 1<=1, but then we cannot take a 2 after the third 1 because the fourth 2 is after the third 1, but then we have [1,1,2] (from indices0,2,3) -> length 3.\n\nSo the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 3.\n\nBut note: the entire array has 4 elements, and we have two 1s and two 2s. \n\nSo the answer for [2,1,2,1] is 3.\n\nHow do we achieve 3? By reversing the entire array.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Step 1: Count total_ones and total_twos. The answer is at least max(total_ones, total_twos).\n\n  Step 2: Check if we can achieve a non-decreasing subsequence of length n (the entire array). This is only possible if the entire array is non-decreasing after reversal.\n\n  Step 3: But if not, then the answer might be n (if we can make the entire array non-decreasing) or n-1, n-2, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the example [2,1,2,1] we achieved 3, which is n-1.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,1,2] -> we can achieve 4? Actually, no: [1,2,1,2] is not non-decreasing because of the third element (1) and the fourth element (2) is okay, but the second element (2) and the third element (1) is an inversion. However, we can take the entire array as a non-decreasing subsequence? \n\nLet me check: \n  [1,2,1,2] \n  We can take indices0,1,3: [1,2,2] -> length 3.\n  Or indices0,2,3: [1,1,2] -> length 3.\n  Or indices1,2,3: [2,1,2] -> not non-decreasing.\n\nBut wait, the non-decreasing subsequence does not require consecutive elements, but the indices must be increasing. So we can take the first 1, then the second 2, then the fourth 2 ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in an array after reversing any one contiguous interval. The array consists only of 1s and 2s, which simplifies the problem as the LNDS can either be all 1s, all 2s, or a combination of 1s followed by 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Analysis**: The key observation is that the entire array being non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s) would yield the maximum possible LNDS length, which is the length of the array. However, if the array cannot be made entirely non-decreasing by reversing one contiguous interval, the next best option is to maximize the number of 1s followed by 2s in the sequence.\n2. **Counting 1s and 2s**: The total number of 1s and 2s in the array remains unchanged after any reversal. The minimum LNDS length is the maximum of the counts of 1s or 2s.\n3. **Checking for Entire Array Non-decreasing**: If the array is already non-decreasing, the answer is simply the length of the array. Otherwise, we need to find the best possible reversal to maximize the LNDS.\n4. **Maximizing LNDS**: The optimal solution involves either:\n   - Making the entire array non-decreasing if possible.\n   - If not, the LNDS will be the sum of all 1s and 2s, but since the array isn't entirely non-decreasing, it might be slightly less. However, due to the binary nature of the array, the LNDS can be derived from the counts of 1s and 2s and their positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    ones = sum(1 for x in arr if x == 1)\n    twos = n - ones\n    \n    if ones == 0 or twos == 0:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    left_ones = [0] * n\n    right_twos = [0] * n\n    \n    left_ones[0] = 1 if arr[0] == 1 else 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            left_ones[i] = left_ones[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left_ones[i] = left_ones[i-1]\n            \n    right_twos[n-1] = 1 if arr[n-1] == 2 else 0\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            right_twos[i] = right_twos[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right_twos[i] = right_twos[i+1]\n            \n    ans = max(ones, twos)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            total_after = left_ones[i] + right_twos[i]\n            if total_after > ans:\n                ans = total_after\n                \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Setup**: The code reads the input values and checks if the array is empty or consists of only 1s or 2s. In such cases, the answer is trivially the length of the array.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The `left_ones` array stores the count of consecutive 1s up to each index, while the `right_twos` array stores the count of consecutive 2s from each index to the end.\n3. **Finding Maximum LNDS**: The initial answer is set to the maximum of the total 1s or 2s. Then, for each position in the array, if the element is 1, the code calculates the sum of 1s up to that position and 2s from that position onwards. This sum represents a potential LNDS where all 1s before the current position are followed by all 2s after it. The maximum value encountered during this iteration is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios where reversing a contiguous interval could maximize the LNDS by leveraging prefix and suffix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of the problem.",
