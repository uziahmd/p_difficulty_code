Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row, the middle element is 's' but the diagonals are 'x'. The non-diagonal elements should be the same and different from the diagonal. In this case, the non-diagonal elements are not all the same (there's an 's' and many 'o').\n\n Steps:\n  Let the main diagonal be the set of positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n  The anti-diagonal is (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n  Condition 1: All characters on the main diagonal must be the same, say `d1`.\n  Condition 2: All characters on the anti-diagonal must be the same, say `d2`.\n  Condition 3: `d1` must equal `d2`.\n  Condition 4: For every cell not on either diagonal, the character must be the same (let it be `other`) and `other` must not equal `d1`.\n\n However, note: what if the two diagonals are the same letter, but there's a cell that is on both diagonals? \n  Actually, in a square with odd side, the center is at ((n-1)//2, (n-1)//2). This center is part of both diagonals. So condition 1 and 2 will require that the center is the same for both, which is okay. But then condition 3 requires d1 == d2, so that is consistent.\n\n But note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning the entire diagonals must be the same. And then the rest must be the same and different.\n\n Approach:\n  - Read n.\n  - Read the grid.\n\n  Let:\n    diagonal_letter = None\n    anti_diagonal_letter = None\n\n  For i in range(n):\n      j = i\n      if grid[i][j] != diagonal_letter: then set diagonal_letter to grid[i][j] (if we haven't set) or check if it matches?\n  But we can do: traverse the main diagonal and check that all are same.\n\n  Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n  Then, check that the two diagonals have the same letter.\n\n  Then, for the rest of the cells, we need to ensure:\n    There exists a letter 'other' such that:\n        For every cell (i, j) not on main diagonal and not on anti-diagonal: grid[i][j] == other\n        And other != diagonal_letter.\n\n  However, note: what if the grid has a cell that is not on the diagonal but has a letter that is the same as the diagonal? That would break condition 4.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Check main diagonal: \n        for i in range(n): \n            if grid[i][i] != expected_diagonal_char -> then fail, but we don't know expected until we check.\n\n  2. Check anti-diagonal: similarly.\n\n  3. Then check consistency between the two.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  Step 1: Traverse the main diagonal and record the letter (if all same).\n  Step 2: Traverse the anti-diagonal and record the letter (if all same).\n\n  Then, if the two recorded letters are different, output \"NO\".\n\n  Then, we need to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\n  But note: the center cell is included in both diagonals. So when checking non-diagonal, we skip both diagonals.\n\n  How to mark a cell as being on a diagonal?\n      cell (i, j) is on main diagonal if i == j.\n      cell (i, j) is on anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1.\n\n  Then, for each cell (i, j):\n      if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): skip (we already checked these)\n      else: check that grid[i][j] is the same and not equal to diagonal_letter.\n\n  But wait: what if the non-diagonal cells are not all the same? Then we should output \"NO\".\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require that the non-diagonal cells form a contiguous pattern? They just have to be the same letter and different from the diagonal.\n\n  So:\n\n  Let diag_char = the letter found in the main diagonal (should be the same for all)\n  Let anti_diag_char = the letter found in the anti-diagonal (same for all)\n\n  If diag_char != anti_diag_char: print \"NO\"\n\n  Then, let other_char = None\n  For i in range(n):\n      for j in range(n):\n          if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n              continue\n          else:\n              if other_char is None:\n                  other_char = grid[i][j]\n              elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                  print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n  Then, check that other_char != diag_char.\n\n  But wait: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? (n=1, but n>=3) so we don't have to worry about n=1.\n\n  However, note: the problem says n is odd and >=3.\n\n  But what if the grid is 3x3? Then the center is counted twice (in both diagonals) but that's okay because we skip it when checking non-diagonals.\n\n  Example 1: \n        Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n        Main diagonal: [w, s, w] -> not all same! Actually, wait: \n          Row0: 'w','s','w'\n          Row1: 's','w','s'\n          Row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n          [grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][2]='w'] -> same? Actually, wait: \n          The example input says: \n             3\n             wsw\n             sws\n             wsw\n\n        Actually, the example says output \"YES\".\n\n        Let me re-read: \n          Condition: on both diagonals all letters are the same; and the rest are the same and different.\n\n        In the example, the main diagonal is 'w','w','w' (from top-left to bottom-right). The anti-diagonal: \n          grid[0][2] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w' -> so also 'w'.\n\n        Then the non-diagonal cells: \n          (0,1): 's', (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's', (2,1): 's'\n\n        So non-diagonal cells are all 's', and 's' != 'w'. So it satisfies.\n\n        But wait, in my reading above I thought the main diagonal was [w, s, w] but actually the grid is:\n\n          Row0: ['w','s','w']\n          Row1: ['s','w','s']\n          Row2: ['w','s','w']\n\n        The main diagonal is (0,0): 'w', (1,1): 'w', (2,2): 'w'. \n        The anti-diagonal is (0,2): 'w', (1,1): 'w', (2,0): 'w'.\n\n        So both diagonals are 'w'. \n\n        Why did I think the main diagonal was [w, s, w]? I misread the example.\n\n        Actually, the example input is provided as:\n          ['3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', ...]\n\n        So the second line is \"sws\", which means row1 is ['s','w','s'].\n\n        Therefore, the main diagonal: \n          row0: index0 -> 'w'\n          row1: index1 -> 'w' (from \"sws\": the middle character is 'w')\n          row2: index2 -> 'w'\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n        Now, let's check the example that outputs \"NO\":\n\n        Example: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n        Main diagonal: \n          row0: 'x' at (0,0)\n          row1: 'o' at (1,1) -> wait, row1 is \"oxoxo\", so (1,1) is 'x'? Actually, let's index:\n\n          row0: \"xooox\" -> [0][0]='x', [0][1]='o', [0][2]='o', [0][3]='o', [0][4]='x'\n          row1: \"oxoxo\" -> [1][0]='o', [1][1]='x', [1][2]='o', [1][3]='x', [1][4]='o'\n          row2: \"soxoo\" -> [2][0]='s', [2][1]='o', [2][2]='x', [2][3]='o', [2][4]='o'\n\n        So main diagonal: \n          [0][0] = 'x'\n          [1][1] = 'x'\n          [2][2] = 'x'\n          [3][3] = 'x' (from row3: \"oxoxo\" -> [3][3] is the fourth character? Actually, row3: \"oxoxo\": \n                [3][0]='o', [3][1]='x', [3][2]='o', [3][3]='x', [3][4]='o' -> so [3][3]='x'\n          [4][4]='x'\n\n        So the main diagonal is all 'x'.\n\n        Anti-diagonal: \n          [0][4] = 'x'\n          [1][3] = 'x'\n          [2][2] = 'x' (already covered)\n          [3][1] = 'x'\n          [4][0] = 'x'\n\n        So anti-diagonal is also all 'x'. Then condition 1 and 2 hold.\n\n        Now, check non-diagonal cells: \n          We require that all non-diagonal cells are the same and not 'x'.\n\n        Let's look at the grid:\n\n          row0: \"xooox\" -> non-diagonal: [0][1]='o', [0][2]='o', [0][3]='o'\n          row1: \"oxoxo\" -> non-diagonal: [1][0]='o', [1][2]='o', [1][4]='o'\n          row2: \"soxoo\" -> non-diagonal: [2][0]='s', [2][1]='o', [2][3]='o', [2][4]='o'\n          row3: \"oxoxo\" -> non-diagonal: [3][0]='o', [3][2]='o', [3][4]='o'\n          row4: \"xooox\" -> non-diagonal: [4][1]='o', [4][2]='o', [4][3]='o'\n\n        The non-diagonal cells have two different letters: 'o' and 's'. \n        So condition 4 fails: not all non-diagonal cells are the same.\n\n        Therefore, we output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the example input says output \"NO\", so that matches.\n\n  However, note: the example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n      Input: \n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', \n         '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', \n         '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n      Output: \n        ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n  The third example:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n        Main diagonal: \n          [0][0]='x', [1][1]='p', [2][2]='e' -> not the same. So condition 1 fails.\n\n        Therefore, we output \"NO\".\n\n  So algorithm:\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      grid = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          grid.append(input().strip())\n\n      # Step 1: Check main diagonal and anti-diagonal for having the same letter throughout.\n      diag_char = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          char = grid[i][i]\n          if diag_char is None:\n              diag_char = char\n          elif char != diag_char:\n              diag_char = None   # set to None to indicate failure, but we'll break after?\n              break\n\n      # But wait, we want to know if they are all same. Alternatively, we can check without breaking the loop.\n\n      # Let me restructure: we want to know if the main diagonal is all the same. We can do:\n\n      diag_set = set()\n      for i in range(n):\n          diag_set.add(grid[i][i])\n\n      if len(diag_set) != 1:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      anti_diag_set = set()\n      for i in range(n):\n          j = n-1-i\n          anti_diag_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\n      if len(anti_diag_set) != 1:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Now check that the two sets have the same element.\n      if next(iter(diag_set)) != next(iter(anti_diag_set)):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Now, let d = the common diagonal letter (from diag_set, which has one element)\n      d = next(iter(diag_set))\n\n      # Now, check the non-diagonal cells.\n      other_char = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue\n              if other_char is None:\n                  other_char = grid[i][j]\n              elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  exit(0)\n\n      # Now, if we found an other_char, then we must check that it is not d.\n      if other_char is None:\n          # This means the grid has no non-diagonal cells. But since n>=3, the minimum non-diagonal cells is (9-2)/2? Actually, for n=3, non-diagonal cells count is 9 - 5 (because two diagonals share one cell) -> 4 non-diagonal cells. So other_char should not be None.\n          # But wait, if n==1, then no non-diagonal, but n>=3. So we don't expect other_char to be None for n>=3.\n          # However, if the grid is 3x3, we have non-diagonal cells. So we can assume other_char is set.\n          # But what if the grid is 3x3 and the entire grid is the diagonal letter? Then we would have no non-diagonal cell to set other_char. Then we break the condition: non-diagonal cells must be the same and different. So if there are no non-diagonal cells, then the condition is trivially true? \n          # Actually, the problem says: \"all other squares\" (meaning the ones not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the diagonal. If there are no other squares, then the condition holds vacuously. But note: the diagonals are defined and the same. However, the problem states: \"on both diagonals all letters are the same; and all other squares ...\". So if there are no other squares, then the second part is automatically satisfied.\n\n          # But wait: the problem says \"all other squares\" (plural) meaning there must be at least one? Actually, no: the condition is for every other square. If there are no other squares, then the condition holds.\n\n          # However, note: the grid has n*n cells. The diagonals together have 2*n-1 cells (because center is shared). For n=3: 3+3-1=5, so 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells. For n=5: 5+5-1=9, so 25-9=16 non-diagonal cells.\n\n          # So for n>=3, there are always non-diagonal cells? Actually, for n=3: 9-5=4, yes. For n=5: 25-9=16, yes.\n\n          # But wait: the center is counted once in the diagonal. The total diagonal cells: n (main) + n (anti) - 1 (center) = 2*n-1. Then non-diagonal cells = n*n - (2*n-1). For n=3: 9-5=4. For n=5: 25-9=16.\n\n          # So we will always have non-diagonal cells for n>=3.\n\n          # Therefore, we can assume other_char is set.\n\n          # Actually, no: our code sets other_char only if we find a non-diagonal cell. Since there is at least one non-diagonal cell, we should have set other_char.\n\n          # But wait, what if we break out of the loop because of an inconsistency in the non-diagonal cells? Then we would have printed \"NO\" already.\n\n          # So now, we have set other_char to the first non-diagonal cell. Then we check that all non-diagonal cells are that same letter.\n\n          # Now, we must check that other_char != d.\n\n      if other_char == d:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n  However, wait: the above code sets other_char and then checks that it is not d. But what if there are multiple non-diagonal letters? We already broke out if we found a difference.\n\n  But note: we set other_char to the first non-diagonal cell, then if we find any cell that is not that, we print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n  Then, if we complete the double loop, we check that other_char != d.\n\n  However, consider: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? (but n>=3, so we don't). But what if the grid is 1x1? Then n=1, but n>=3. So we are safe.\n\n  But wait, the problem says n>=3.\n\n  However, there's a catch: what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are all the same but that same letter happens to be the diagonal letter? Then we would have set other_char and then check that it is not d, and it is the same as d -> then output \"NO\". \n\n  Example: \n        3\n        aaa\n        aca\n        aaa\n\n        Main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> same.\n        Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> same.\n        Non-diagonal: all 'a'. Then we set other_char='a'. Then check: 'a' != 'a' -> false, so output \"NO\".\n\n  This is correct because the condition requires the non-diagonal letter to be different from the diagonal.\n\n  But wait, the example in the problem: \n        Input: \n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n        We already saw that the main diagonal is not all the same (has 'x','p','e') -> so we output \"NO\" at the anti-diagonal check? Actually, the main diagonal is not the same, so we break at the main diagonal check.\n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is the same, the anti-diagonal is the same, but the non-diagonal letter is the same as the diagonal? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n  Another example: \n        3\n        www\n        www\n        www\n\n        Main diagonal: 'w','w','w' -> same.\n        Anti-diagonal: 'w','w','w' -> same.\n        Non-diagonal: all 'w'. Then we set other_char='w'. Then check: 'w' != 'w' -> false -> \"NO\".\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But wait, what if the non-diagonal cells are not the same? Then we break in the double loop and output \"NO\".\n\n  So the code is:\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n      # Check main diagonal\n      diag_set = set(grid[i][i] for i in range(n))\n      if len(diag_set) != 1:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Check anti-diagonal\n      anti_diag_set = set(grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n))\n      if len(anti_diag_set) != 1:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Check that the two diagonals have the same letter\n      if next(iter(diag_set)) != next(iter(anti_diag_set)):\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      d = next(iter(diag_set))\n\n      # Check non-diagonal cells\n      other_char = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue\n              if other_char is None:\n                  other_char = grid[i][j]\n              elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  exit(0)\n\n      # Now, check that the non-diagonal letter is different from d\n      if other_char == d:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n      Main diagonal: set(['x']) -> size 1.\n      Anti-diagonal: set(['x']) -> size 1.\n      Then set d='x'\n\n      Then check non-diagonal: \n          First non-diagonal cell: (0,1) -> 'o' -> set other_char='o'\n          Then (0,2): 'o' -> ok.\n          Then (0,3): 'o' -> ok.\n          Then (1,0): 'o' -> ok.\n          Then (1,2): 'o' -> ok.\n          Then (1,4): 'o' -> ok.\n          Then (2,0): 's' -> fails because 's' != 'o' -> output \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Main diagonal: set(['w','w','w']) -> {'w'} -> size 1.\n      Anti-diagonal: set(['w','w','w']) -> {'w'} -> size 1.\n      d = 'w'\n\n      Non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 's' -> set other_char='s'\n          (1,0): 's' -> ok.\n          (1,2): 's' -> ok.\n          (2,1): 's' -> ok.\n\n      Then check: 's' != 'w' -> True -> output \"YES\".\n\n  Example 3:\n      Input:\n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n      Main diagonal: set(['x','p','e']) -> size 3 -> output \"NO\".\n\n  One more edge: what if the grid has only one distinct letter for the diagonals, but the non-diagonal is a mix of two letters? Then we break in the non-diagonal check.\n\n  Example:\n        3\n        xxx\n        xyy\n        xxx\n\n      Main diagonal: set(['x','x','x']) -> {'x'}\n      Anti-diagonal: set(['x','y','x']) -> {'x','y'} -> size 2 -> output \"NO\".\n\n  But wait, the anti-diagonal is:\n        (0,2) -> 'x'\n        (1,1) -> 'y'\n        (2,0) -> 'x'\n\n      So indeed, not all same.\n\n  However, what if the anti-diagonal is same but the main diagonal is same, but the non-diagonal has two different letters?\n\n        3\n        aaa\n        aab\n        aaa\n\n      Main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n      Anti-diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n      Then check non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 'a' -> set other_char='a'\n          (1,0): 'a' -> ok.\n          (1,2): 'b' -> not 'a' -> \"NO\"\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require the non-diagonal letter to be the same as the diagonal? It requires the non-diagonal letter to be the same and different from the diagonal. So we break if we find a different non-diagonal letter.\n\n  But wait, what if the non-diagonal letter is the same as the diagonal? Then we break at the end.\n\n  Example: \n        3\n        aaa\n        aea\n        aaa\n\n      Main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n      Anti-diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n      Non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 'a' -> set other_char='a'\n          (1,0): 'a' -> ok.\n          (1,2): 'a' -> ok.\n          (2,1): 'a' -> ok.\n\n      Then check: other_char 'a' == d 'a' -> output \"NO\".\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n  However, note: the problem says n is odd and >=3, so we don't have to handle even n.\n\n  Let me run through the code again for efficiency: n<300, so maximum 300x300 grid, which is 90000 cells. The set operations for diagonals are O(n) and the double loop is O(n^2). Since n<300, n^2 is 90000, which is acceptable.\n\n  Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal**: The main diagonal consists of cells where the row index equals the column index (i.e., positions (0,0), (1,1), ..., (n-1,n-1)). All characters in these cells must be identical.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal**: The anti-diagonal consists of cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals n-1 (i.e., positions (0,n-1), (1,n-2), ..., (n-1,0)). All characters in these cells must also be identical.\n3. **Compare Diagonals**: The characters on both diagonals must be the same.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: All cells not on either diagonal must contain the same character, and this character must differ from the diagonal character.\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, the grid forms an \"X\"; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    diag_set = set(grid[i][i] for i in range(n))\n    if len(diag_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    anti_diag_set = set(grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n))\n    if len(anti_diag_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if next(iter(diag_set)) != next(iter(anti_diag_set)):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    d = next(iter(diag_set))\n    other_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n                \n    if other_char == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: It checks if all characters on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same by storing them in a set. If the set size is not 1, the answer is \"NO\".\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, it checks the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) for uniform characters. If they are not uniform, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Diagonal Comparison**: The characters from both diagonals must be the same; otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For cells not on either diagonal, the code ensures all characters are identical and different from the diagonal character. If any cell violates this condition, the answer is \"NO\".\n6. **Final Decision**: If all conditions are met, the grid forms an \"X\", and the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all necessary conditions to determine if the grid represents the letter \"X\" as specified.",
