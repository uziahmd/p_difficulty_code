The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), Nikephoros uses the character at position (i mod len(A)) in A,\n and Polycarpus uses the character at position (i mod len(B)) in B.\n\n The rules: \n   Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n   If same, draw.\n\n But note: the loser gets one red spot. So if in a round:\n   If Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n   If Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n However, n can be up to 2e9 and the sequences A and B have at most 1000 characters, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem into:\n\n Let L = len(A), M = len(B). Then the entire game can be thought of as having a cycle of length LCM(L, M) for the pair (A[i], B[j])?\n\n But note: the rounds are independent, and the state for a round is determined by (i mod L, j mod M) and i+j = n.\n\n Actually, we can consider the entire game as a two-dimensional grid of states (i, j) where i from 0 to L-1 and j from 0 to M-1.\n\n However, the total number of distinct pairs is L*M (at most 1e6) which is acceptable if we can do it in O(L*M). But n can be 2e9, so we cannot iterate over all n rounds.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can compute the outcome for each distinct pair (x, y) where x in {0,...,L-1} and y in {0,...,M-1}. Then we can count how many full cycles (over the LCM(L,M)) we have and the remainder.\n\n But note: the rounds are sequential: round 0: (0,0); round 1: (1 mod L, 1 mod M); ... round n-1: (n-1 mod L, n-1 mod M).\n\n How many times does a particular state (i, j) occur? \n\n The state (i, j) occurs at rounds t such that:\n   t ≡ i (mod L)\n   t ≡ j (mod M)\n\n The set of t that satisfy these congruences is periodic with period LCM(L, M). And the first occurrence is the smallest nonnegative solution t0 (if exists) and then every LCM(L, M) after that.\n\n But we don't need to know the exact t, we just need to count the frequency of each state (i,j) in the first n rounds.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Let T = LCM(L, M). Then the sequence of rounds repeats every T rounds. In one T-round cycle, each state (i, j) appears exactly once? \n\n Actually, the state (i, j) corresponds to a round t where t mod L = i and t mod M = j. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that for each (i, j) there is a unique solution modulo T (if L and M are coprime then T is the product, but if not, we still have a unique solution modulo T because the conditions are independent). \n\n However, note: the system of congruences:\n   t ≡ i (mod L)\n   t ≡ j (mod M)\n\n has a solution if and only if i ≡ j (mod gcd(L, M))? Actually, no: the condition is that the system must have a solution for any i and j? Not necessarily. The necessary and sufficient condition is that (i - j) is divisible by gcd(L, M). But wait, we are matching two moduli. Actually, the system always has a solution if we let t run from 0 to T-1 (because T is the least common multiple). However, note that the set of solutions for t modulo T is either empty or a single residue class modulo T. But since we are considering t from 0 to n-1, we can count the number of t in [0, n-1] such that t ≡ i (mod L) and t ≡ j (mod M).\n\n However, we can also think: the entire sequence of rounds is determined by the two indices (i, j) and the round number t. And the state (i, j) appears at t = k * T + s, where s is the smallest nonnegative solution (if it exists) and then periodically every T.\n\n But note: the state (i, j) appears periodically with period T, but we must check that the solution exists. Actually, the state (i, j) will appear in the cycle if and only if the system of congruences has a solution. Since T is the LCM, we know that for each (i, j) there is a solution modulo T if and only if the system is consistent. However, we can use the following:\n\n Let g = gcd(L, M). The system has a solution if and only if (i % g) == (j % g). But wait, actually the condition is that (i - j) must be divisible by g? Actually, the standard condition for the system:\n   t ≡ i (mod L)\n   t ≡ j (mod M)\n\n is that (i - j) is divisible by g. However, note that we are free to choose t. The condition is that i ≡ j (mod g). But actually, the condition is that the residues i and j must be congruent modulo g. Why? Because if we write L = g * l, M = g * m, then the condition for the existence of a solution is that i ≡ j (mod g). \n\n But note: we are given i in [0, L-1] and j in [0, M-1]. The condition i ≡ j (mod g) might not hold for every (i,j). Therefore, some states (i, j) will never occur.\n\n However, in our problem, the rounds are consecutive. The state (i, j) occurs at round t if and only if t mod L = i and t mod M = j. This condition is equivalent to t being in the arithmetic progression defined by the solution to the system (if it exists). \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute T = LCM(L, M) = L * M // GCD(L, M)\n 2. For each state (i, j) (i from 0 to L-1, j from 0 to M-1):\n      Check if the system t ≡ i (mod L), t ≡ j (mod M) has a solution. The condition is that (i % g) == (j % g) where g = gcd(L, M). However, note: we can also compute the first occurrence t0 (if exists) by solving the system.\n\n But note: even if the system has no solution, then this state (i, j) never appears.\n\n 3. How many times does the state (i, j) appear in n rounds? \n\n   If the state (i, j) appears, then the first occurrence is t0 (the smallest nonnegative integer satisfying the congruences). Then the next occurrences are t0, t0+T, t0+2*T, ... until <= n-1.\n\n   The number of occurrences is floor((n-1 - t0) / T) + 1, provided t0 <= n-1.\n\n   But note: the rounds go from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). So we have to check if t0 < n.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula for the number of integers t in [0, n-1] such that t ≡ t0 (mod T). That is:\n\n        count = (t0 < n) ? ( (n - t0 + T - 1) // T ) : 0\n\n   But wait, the standard way is:\n\n        count = max(0, (n - t0 + T - 1) // T)   if t0 is the first occurrence and we require t0 <= n-1.\n\n   However, note: we are counting the number of t in [0, n-1] such that t >= t0 and t = t0 + k*T <= n-1.\n\n        count = (n - t0 + T - 1) // T   if t0 <= n-1, else 0.\n\n   But we can also write:\n\n        count = ( (n - 1 - t0) // T ) + 1   if t0 <= n-1, else 0.\n\n   However, note: the rounds are from 0 to n-1, so the last t we can use is n-1.\n\n 4. But how to compute t0? We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem for two moduli.\n\n   We have:\n        t = i + L * x\n        t = j + M * y\n\n   Then i + L*x = j + M*y  =>  L*x - M*y = j - i.\n\n   We can solve for x and y. But note: we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        t ≡ i (mod L)\n        t ≡ j (mod M)\n\n   Let g = gcd(L, M). Then the system has a solution if and only if (i - j) % g == 0.\n\n   Then, we can compute t0 by:\n\n        Let L1 = L // g, M1 = M // g, d = (i - j) // g. Then we need to solve:\n\n            L1 * x ≡ d (mod M1)\n\n        Then x0 is the solution for x in the range [0, M1-1]. Then t0 = i + L * x0.\n\n   But note: d must be an integer, and we have (i-j) divisible by g. Then we can use the modular inverse of L1 modulo M1.\n\n   Steps to compute t0:\n\n        g = gcd(L, M)\n        if (i - j) % g != 0:\n            then state (i,j) does not occur -> count = 0.\n\n        else:\n            # Solve for x in: L1 * x ≡ (i-j)//g (mod M1)\n            L1 = L // g\n            M1 = M // g\n            d_val = (i - j) // g   # This is an integer\n\n            # Now, we need to find x0 in [0, M1-1] such that (L1 * x0) % M1 = d_val % M1.\n            # Since gcd(L1, M1)=1, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of L1 modulo M1.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use pow(L1, -1, M1) in Python 3.8+.\n\n            inv = pow(L1, -1, M1)   # This gives the modular inverse of L1 modulo M1\n\n            x0 = (d_val * inv) % M1\n\n            t0 = i + L * x0\n\n            # But note: we must ensure that t0 is nonnegative and minimal. Since x0 is in [0, M1-1], then t0 is the smallest nonnegative solution?\n\n            # However, note: we are solving modulo M1, so the solution x0 is the smallest nonnegative solution for x modulo M1.\n\n            # Then t0 is the smallest solution? \n\n            # Actually, we have t0 = i + L * x0, and x0 is the smallest nonnegative solution modulo M1, so yes.\n\n 5. Then we can count the number of times (i,j) appears: \n\n        if (i-j) % g != 0: count_ij = 0\n        else: \n            t0 = i + L * x0\n            if t0 > n-1:\n                count_ij = 0\n            else:\n                # The last round index is n-1.\n                # The number of rounds from t0 to n-1 inclusive, stepping by T (the period) is:\n                #   count_ij = ((n-1 - t0) // T) + 1\n                count_ij = ((n-1 - t0) // T) + 1\n\n 6. Then, for each state (i, j) we can determine the outcome:\n\n        We have two moves: a = A[i], b = B[j]\n\n        According to the rules:\n            Rock ('R') beats Scissors ('S')\n            Scissors ('S') beats Paper ('P')\n            Paper ('P') beats Rock ('R')\n\n        So, we can define a function:\n\n            def outcome(a, b):\n                if a == b:\n                    return 0   # draw, no red spot\n                elif (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n                    return 2   # both players: if a wins, then b loses -> red spot for b (Polycarpus) is increased by 1, and if a loses then a gets one. Actually, wait:\n\n                But note: we have two players: \n                    If (a, b) is a winning pair for Nikephoros (i.e., a beats b), then Polycarpus (b) loses -> so one red spot for Polycarpus.\n                    If (a, b) is a winning pair for Polycarpus (i.e., b beats a), then Nikephoros (a) loses -> one red spot for Nikephoros.\n\n                So, we can map:\n\n                    outcome = 0   -> no red spot\n                    outcome = 1   -> if a wins, then assign red spot to Polycarpus (so we count for Polycarpus)\n                    outcome = 2   -> if b wins, then assign red spot to Nikephoros (so we count for Nikephoros)\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    if a == b: 0\n                    elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        return 1   # meaning: Polycarpus gets a red spot (since a wins, so b loses)\n                    else: \n                        return 2   # meaning: Nikephoros gets a red spot (since b wins, so a loses)\n\n        But wait, the example: \n            Input: \"7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\"\n\n            Round 0: R vs R -> draw -> outcome 0.\n            Round 1: P vs S -> P beats S? Actually, no: the rule is: Rock beats Scissors, so P (paper) beats R (rock) and S (scissors) beats P (paper)? \n            Wait, the rules: \n                Rock beats Scissors\n                Scissors beats Paper\n                Paper beats Rock\n\n            So, for (a, b) = (P, S): \n                P vs S: S is scissors, P is paper -> Paper beats Rock, but what about Paper vs Scissors? \n                Actually, the rule says: Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beats Paper. So Paper loses to Scissors? \n\n            Correction: \n                In the example: \n                    Round 1: P (Nikephoros) vs S (Polycarpus): \n                        P (paper) vs S (scissors): the rule says Scissors beats Paper -> so Polycarpus wins? \n                    Then, according to our mapping, if (a, b) is (P, S): \n                        We have to check: \n                            (a, b) = ('P','S'): \n                            Is ('P','S') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] for a win? \n                            Our list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] is the list of wins for a (Nikephoros). \n\n                So, in (P, S): \n                    a = P, b = S -> a wins? No, because the rule says S beats P. So a (P) loses. Therefore, we should mark this as a win for b (Polycarpus) only if a loses.\n\n                Alternatively, we can define:\n\n                    if a == b: 0\n                    elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: \n                        return 1   # meaning: Polycarpus (b) loses? Actually, no: in this case, a wins, so b loses -> so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots? \n                    else: \n                        return 2   # meaning: Nikephoros (a) loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n                But wait: the example says for round 1: P vs S -> Nikephoros loses. So that means we should add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots? \n\n                However, the example output: \n                    Nikephoros: 3, Polycarpus: 2.\n\n                In round 1: P vs S -> Nikephoros loses -> so he gets a red spot. So we want to count that for Nikephoros.\n\n                But according to our function above, we returned 2 for (P, S) meaning Nikephoros gets a red spot. Then that would be correct.\n\n                But wait: why did we return 2 when a loses? \n\n                Let me re-map:\n\n                We have two players: \n                    If a wins (over b): then b loses -> so we count one red spot for the loser (which is b, Polycarpus).\n                    If b wins (over a): then a loses -> so we count one red spot for the loser (which is a, Nikephoros).\n\n                So we can say:\n\n                    outcome = 0: no red spot\n                    outcome = 1: Polycarpus gets a red spot (because he lost)\n                    outcome = 2: Nikephoros gets a red spot (because he lost)\n\n                But wait, in the example round 1: \n                    a = P, b = S -> b wins (because S beats P) -> so a loses -> so we return 2 (meaning Nikephoros loses) -> correct.\n\n                Then for round 2: S vs P -> a = S, b = P -> \n                    S vs P: the rule says Scissors beats Paper -> so a wins. Then we return 1 (Polycarpus loses) -> correct.\n\n                Then the counts for the entire game:\n\n                    We will have two counters: \n                        red_spots_Nikephoros = 0\n                        red_spots_Polycarpus = 0\n\n                    For each state (i, j) that occurs, let c = count_ij (the number of times (i,j) occurs)\n                    Then, for each occurrence of (i,j):\n                        o = outcome(A[i], B[j])\n                        if o == 1: red_spots_Polycarpus += c\n                        if o == 2: red_spots_Nikephoros += c\n\n                Alternatively, we can store for each state (i,j) the outcome value and the count, and then aggregate.\n\n 7. However, note: the total number of distinct (i,j) is L*M (at most 1e6) and n is 2e9, so we can iterate over all (i,j) and for each one that satisfies the congruence condition, we compute the count and then update the answer.\n\n 8.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use predefined sequences of moves in a cyclic manner, and each round's outcome depends on the current move in their respective sequences. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for up to 2 billion rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome is determined by comparing the current moves from their sequences. The winner of a round gets a red spot on the loser. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `L * M / gcd(L, M)` rounds (the least common multiple of the sequence lengths), allowing us to compute results for all possible move pairs once and then determine their frequency over `n` rounds.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible pair of moves (one from each player's sequence), we can determine if the system of congruences (based on the sequences' positions) has a solution. If it does, we calculate how many times this pair occurs in `n` rounds using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This avoids the need for brute-force simulation of each round.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Used to solve the system of congruences for each move pair, determining the first occurrence of the pair in the sequence.\n   - **Modular Arithmetic**: To efficiently count the occurrences of each move pair in `n` rounds without iterating through each round.\n   - **Outcome Determination**: For each valid move pair, check the game rules to decide who loses (and thus gains a red spot).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each possible move pair (up to 1,000,000 pairs for sequences of length 1000 each). For each pair, it performs constant-time operations (using modular arithmetic and precomputed values), making the overall complexity O(L*M), which is feasible given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    L = len(A)\n    M = len(B)\n    g = math.gcd(L, M)\n    T_val = L * M // g\n    \n    red_spots_nike = 0\n    red_spots_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(L):\n        for j in range(M):\n            if (i - j) % g != 0:\n                continue\n                \n            d_val = (i - j) // g\n            L1 = L // g\n            M1 = M // g\n            \n            inv = pow(L1, -1, M1)\n            x0 = (d_val * inv) % M1\n            t0 = i + L * x0\n            \n            if t0 > n - 1:\n                continue\n                \n            count_ij = ((n - 1 - t0) // T_val) + 1\n            \n            a_char = A[i]\n            b_char = B[j]\n            \n            if a_char == b_char:\n                outcome_val = 0\n            else:\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n                    outcome_val = 1\n                else:\n                    outcome_val = 2\n                    \n            if outcome_val == 1:\n                red_spots_poly += count_ij\n            elif outcome_val == 2:\n                red_spots_nike += count_ij\n                \n    print(f\"{red_spots_nike} {red_spots_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the sequence lengths and their least common multiple (LCM).\n3. **Processing Move Pairs**: For each possible pair of moves (one from each sequence), check if the system of congruences (based on their positions in the sequences) has a solution. If it does, compute the first occurrence `t0` of this pair in the sequence.\n4. **Counting Occurrences**: Using `t0`, determine how many times this move pair occurs in `n` rounds. This is done by leveraging the periodicity derived from the LCM.\n5. **Outcome Handling**: For each valid move pair, decide the outcome based on game rules. If Nikephoros loses, increment his red spot count; if Polycarpus loses, increment his count.\n6. **Output**: Print the total red spots for both players after all rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging mathematical insights and modular arithmetic, avoiding the need for brute-force simulation.",
