The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10^4 test cases, each with an integer n (from 1 to 10^18).\n We need to determine if there exists an integer k > 1 such that a snowflake graph with n vertices exists.\n\n According to the problem, the snowflake is constructed in layers (steps). The initial step (step 0) has 1 vertex.\n Then, step 1: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices -> total vertices = 1 + k.\n Then, step 2: each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the k leaves from step 1) is connected to k new vertices. \n   So we add k * k vertices. Total vertices = 1 + k + k^2.\n Then step 3: each leaf from step 2 (which are k*k vertices) is connected to k new vertices -> add k^3. Total = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n This means the construction must have at least two steps (the first step is mandatory, and then at least one more step? Actually, reading carefully:\n\n - Step 0: 1 vertex.\n - Step 1: connect the initial to k new -> then we have 1+k vertices. Now, the initial vertex has degree k (so not a leaf), but the k new vertices each have degree 1 (leaves). Then the problem says \"This step [adding k new vertices to each leaf] should be done at least once\", meaning we must do step 2? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\" Then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the minimal snowflake (with one additional step beyond the initial) is:\n   Step0: 1\n   Step1: 1 + k\n   Step2: 1 + k + k^2\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we stop after exactly two steps. We can have more steps. But the problem asks: can we have a snowflake with n vertices?\n\n Therefore, n must be expressible as:\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   for some t >= 2 (at least two steps: step0, step1, and step2) and k>1.\n\n Alternatively, note that the process can be broken down as:\n   n = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... ))   [with at least two layers of expansion]\n\n But note: the first expansion (step1) adds k, then step2 adds k^2, then step3 adds k^3, etc.\n\n So n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   for some t>=1? Actually, the problem says step1 is the first expansion (mandatory) and then at least one more expansion (so t>=2). But wait, the example: the smallest for k=4 is shown. The smallest for k=4 is 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 1+4+16 = 21? Actually, the example input includes 13 and 15 and outputs YES for them.\n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: 13 -> output YES, 15 -> YES, 255 -> YES, 10101 -> YES, 1000000000000000000 -> YES, and 1,2,3,6,10101 (wait, the example input has 9 test cases).\n\n But wait, the example input: \n     ['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n And the output:\n     ['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\n So let's see:\n\n n=1: NO\n n=2: NO\n n=3: NO\n n=6: NO\n n=13: YES\n n=15: YES\n n=255: YES\n n=10101: YES\n n=1000000000000000000: NO\n\n What does this tell us?\n\n Note: the formula for the geometric series is: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with one vertex and expanding outward in each subsequent layer. The key observation is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be expressible as a sum of a geometric series with at least two layers (steps).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with 1 vertex (step 0). Each subsequent step adds \\( k \\) new vertices to each vertex that has only one connection. This results in the total vertices being \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\), where \\( t \\geq 2 \\) (since at least two expansions are required beyond the initial vertex).\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( n \\) to be valid, it must satisfy \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( t \\geq 2 \\). However, directly checking all possible \\( k \\) and \\( t \\) is infeasible for large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: The sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\) can be written as \\( \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). Thus, \\( n \\) must satisfy \\( n = \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) for some \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( t \\geq 2 \\).\n4. **Efficient Check**: Instead of iterating over all possible \\( k \\), we note that \\( t \\) must be at least 2. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be at least \\( 1 + k + k^2 \\). For each test case, we check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\) for some \\( t \\geq 2 \\). This can be rephrased as checking if \\( n-1 \\) can be expressed as \\( k \\cdot (k^{t} - 1) / (k - 1) \\), which simplifies to verifying if \\( n-1 \\) is divisible by some \\( k \\) (where \\( k > 1 \\)) and the quotient forms a geometric series.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    tests = [int(x) for x in data[1:1+t]]\n    \n    results = []\n    for n in tests:\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        max_exponent = 1\n        \n        # We know that n >= 7 (from n>=7) so we start from k=2.\n        # But note: we have to consider that the minimal expansion is two layers: 1 + k + k^2 <= n.\n        # Alternatively, we can factorize n-1 and look for divisors k>1 such that (k^2 + k + 1) divides (n-1) or more generally, the geometric series condition holds.\n        \n        # However, note: the equation is n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t, which implies n-1 = k*(k^t - 1)/(k-1).\n        # We can also think: n-1 must be divisible by k, and then (n-1)/k must be equal to (k^t - 1)/(k-1) for some t>=2.\n        # Since t>=2, then (k^t - 1)/(k-1) >= k^2 + k + 1? Actually, for t=2: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 + k + 1.\n        # So n-1 must be divisible by k, and (n-1)//k must be at least k^2 + k + 1? Not exactly, but we can try to find a k such that (n-1) % k == 0 and (n-1)//k = (k^t - 1)//(k-1) for some t>=2.\n        # But note: t can be more than 2, so we cannot limit to t=2.\n\n        # Alternate approach: Since n can be very large, we can iterate over possible exponents t (starting from 2) and solve for k. \n        # But note: k must be integer >1, and n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1). We can rearrange to k^(t+1) = (n-1)*(k-1) + 1. \n        # Instead, we can consider that for a fixed t (minimal t is 2), we can solve for k in the equation (k^(t+1) - 1) / (k-1) = n.\n\n        # However, t can be large. Instead, we can consider that the minimal representation is two layers: n = 1 + k + k^2. Then we can also consider three layers: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc.\n\n        # But note: the example includes n=13, which is 1 + 2 + 4 + 6? Wait, 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 (three layers with k=3). Let's check: \n        #   t=2: 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1+3+9=13. So k=3, t=2 (meaning two expansions after the initial vertex).\n\n        # How to find k for given n?\n        # We know that n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1). We can fix t (starting from 2) and solve for k. But k must be an integer >1.\n\n        # Alternatively, note that for a fixed t, k must satisfy k^(t+1) = (n-1)*(k-1) + 1. This is a polynomial equation in k of degree t+1, which is hard to solve for large t.\n\n        # Another idea: factorize n-1. Notice that if n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t, then n-1 is divisible by k (since k divides each term except the 1). Moreover, (n-1)/k must be equal to (k^t + k^{t-1} + ... + 1) = (k^{t+1}-1)/(k-1). \n\n        # We can iterate over possible k values, but n can be up to 10^18, so k would be at most around the t-th root of n, which is too large.\n\n        # Let's reverse the thinking: for a given n, what are the possible k? k must be a divisor of n-1 (since n-1 = k * (some integer)). Then we can check if (n-1) // k equals (k^t + k^{t-1} + ... + 1) for some t>=2.\n\n        # But note: the equation (k^{t+1}-1)/(k-1) = (n-1)//k. We can check for divisors k of n-1 (with k>1) and then check if (n-1)//k equals the geometric series sum for some t>=2.\n\n        # However, the number of divisors of n-1 could be large, but note that n can be up to 10^18, so factoring n-1 might be expensive. But we have up to 10^4 test cases, so we need a more efficient method.\n\n        # Insight: the minimal representation is two layers: n = 1 + k + k^2. Then we can also consider three layers: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc. But note that for large n, t will be small because k grows exponentially.\n\n        # Actually, we can bound t: since k>=2, then for t layers, n >= 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^t = 2^(t+1)-1. So t is at most about log2(n). For n=10^18, t is at most around 60.\n\n        # Therefore, we can iterate over possible t from 2 up to 60 (or until 2^(t+1)-1 exceeds n). For each t, we need to check if there exists an integer k>1 such that:\n        #   (k^(t+1)-1) / (k-1) = n.\n\n        # Rearranging, we get k^(t+1) - (n-1)*(k-1) = 1. But solving for k is non-trivial.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use binary search for k for each t. But note that k must be an integer greater than 1. The equation is:\n        #   (k^(t+1) - 1) / (k-1) = n\n        # We can compute the left-hand side for integer k until we find one that matches n.\n\n        # However, k might be large. For example, if t=2, then n = 1 + k + k^2 => k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0. We can solve this quadratic equation: k = (-1 + sqrt(1+4*(n-1)))/2. Then check if it is integer.\n\n        # Similarly, for t=3: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. This is a cubic equation, which is harder.\n\n        # But note: we don't need to check all t from 2 to 60 for every n because t is the number of layers, and for a given n, only small t will yield k around the t-th root of n.\n\n        # However, there is a better approach: we can consider that the minimal form (two layers) must hold: n = 1 + k + k^2. So if we can find any k>1 such that 1 + k + k^2 = n, then answer YES. Similarly, for three layers: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n        # But note: the problem does not require the minimal form; any number of layers is allowed. However, we can check for increasing t (from 2 upwards) until the minimal value for that t exceeds n.\n\n        # Steps:\n        # 1. If n < 7, output \"NO\" (since the smallest valid n is 1+2+4=7).\n        # 2. For t from 2 to 60 (or while the minimal n for t is <= the current bound):\n        #    a. Solve for k in the equation: n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1). \n        #       Note: This equation is equivalent to k^(t+1) - (n-1)*(k-1) - 1 = 0.\n        #    b. We can find k by solving the equation approximately: k ≈ (n)^(1/(t+1)) (since the leading term is k^t). Then check integers around this approximation.\n\n        # However, due to the high exponent, we can use binary search for k for each t. But note: t is at most 60, and for each t we do a binary search over k, which might be large but the exponentiation is expensive.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can iterate over possible k for each t? But k could be very large.\n\n        # Another insight: the equation n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) can be rewritten as k^(t+1) = (n-1)*(k-1) + 1. For fixed t, we can solve for k by taking the (t+1)-th root of n. But note: k must be an integer.\n\n        # We can set k_min = 2, k_max = int(round(n**(1/(t+1)))) + 10  (but careful: for t=2, n=13, then k should be 3, and 13^(1/3) is about 2.35, so k_max=3). \n\n        # Algorithm for fixed t:\n        #   Let low = 2, high = 10**6  (but note: n can be 10^18, so k might be as large as 10^18^(1/(t+1)), which for t=2 is 10^9, which is too large to iterate)\n\n        # Instead, we can use the fact that for fixed t, the function f(k) = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1. So we can do a binary search for k in the range [2, n] (but n is huge).\n\n        # But note: the minimal k is 2, and the maximal k is roughly n^(1/(t+1)). For example, when t=2, k is about sqrt(n-1) (approximately). For n=10^18, that's 10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        # We need a different approach.\n\n        # Let's go back to divisors: n-1 must be divisible by k, and then (n-1)/k must be equal to (k^t + k^(t-1) + ... + 1). But note, the divisor k must be such that k divides n-1. So we can factorize n-1 and for each divisor k (greater than 1), check if (n-1)//k equals the geometric series sum (k^t + k^(t-1) + ... + 1) for some t>=2.\n\n        # However, factoring n-1 (which can be up to 10^18) for each test case (up to 10^4 test cases) is computationally expensive.\n\n        # Another idea: the equation n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) can be rewritten as k^(t+1) - (n-1)*k + (n-1) = 0? Actually, no. But note: n-1 = k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t) / something? No.\n\n        # Let me try a different perspective: the problem examples include n=13, 15, 255, 10101.

Divisors: 2,7,14.\n        #   k=2: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15 -> yes (t=3: 1+2+4+8=15). So k=2, t=3.\n\n        # n=255: 255-1=254.

Divisors: many, but we need to check if there's a divisor k such that (k^t + k^(t-1)+...+1) = 10100/k. \n\n        # However, factoring 10100 is manageable, but for n=10^18, factoring n-1 is difficult.\n\n        # We need a smarter way. Note that for a fixed t, the equation is:\n        #   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n        #   => n-1 = k*(1 + k + ... + k^{t-1})\n        #   => (n-1)/k = 1 + k + ... + k^{t-1}\n\n        # The right-hand side is an integer, so k must divide n-1.

We need to find t such that the sum is exactly (n-1)//k.\n\n        # The sum of the geometric series is (k^t - 1)/(k-1). So we need:\n        #   (k^t - 1)/(k-1) = (n-1)//k\n\n        # Rearranged: k^t = (n-1)//k * (k-1) + 1.\n\n        # Now, t must be at least 2 (so the series has at least two terms: 1 + k). But note: the original series has t+1 terms (from exponent 0 to t). In our equation above, the series in the quotient is from exponent 0 to t-1, so t-1 must be at least 1 (i.e., t>=2).\n\n        # Steps for the algorithm:\n        # 1. If n < 7, return \"NO\".\n        # 2. Factorize n-1 (if n==1, then skip, but n>=1 and for n==1 we already handled as NO). But factorizing n-1 for each test case (up to 10^4 test cases) is too slow for n-1 up to 10^18.\n        # 3. Alternative: iterate over possible t from 2 up to about 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18). For each t, we can solve for k by approximating k as the (t)-th root of n. Specifically, k ≈ n^(1/t). Then we check the integers around this approximation (maybe floor and ceil) to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\n        # Why t from 2 to 60? Because for t=60, the minimal n is 2^61-1 (if k=2) which is about 2e18, but our n can be up to 1e18, so we might need t up to about 59 (since 2^60 is around 1e18, so 2^60-1 is 1e18). However, k doesn't have to be 2, so for k>2, t can be smaller.\n\n        # For each t from 2 to 60:\n        #   Let low_bound = 2\n        #   Let high_bound = int(round(n**(1/t))) + 10   (but careful: for t=2, n=13, then 13^(1/2)≈3.6, so high_bound=4, then check k=3 and 4)\n        #   Then, for k in [low_bound, high_bound] (but note: k must be integer) we check if (k^t - 1) // (k-1) == n-1 // k? Actually, the equation is: n = (k^(t+1)-1)//(k-1) for the entire series (including t+1 terms). But wait, we fixed t as the number of layers? Actually, in our earlier derivation, the entire series has t+1 terms (from exponent 0 to t). So the equation is n = (k^(t+1)-1)//(k-1). \n\n        # But note: the problem says the first expansion is step1 (k new vertices) and then at least one more expansion (step2). So the minimal t is 2 (meaning two expansions: step1 and step2, so three terms: 1 + k + k^2). Therefore, the total number of terms is t+1, and t (the exponent) is the number of expansions minus one? Actually, the number of expansions is t+1 (initial plus t expansions). But the problem requires at least two expansions (so t>=2).\n\n        # Let me clarify: \n        #   Step0: 1 vertex.\n        #   Step1: add k vertices -> total 1+k.\n        #   Step2: add k*k vertices -> total 1+k+k^2.\n        #   Step3: add k^3 vertices -> total 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n        # So the number of expansions (steps) is m = t+1, and the total vertices is n = (k^(m)-1)/(k-1) for m>=2 (since m=2: 1+k, but wait the problem says step2 must be done at least once, meaning m>=2? Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", referring to the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf. The first step (step1) is mandatory, and then step2 is mandatory at least once. So m>=2 (two expansions: step1 and step2). \n\n        # Therefore, the total vertices n = (k^(m)-1)/(k-1) with m>=2.\n\n        # Now, m is the number of expansions (steps) including the initial expansion. But the initial expansion is step1 (m=1) and then step2 (m=2) is mandatory. So the minimal m is 2. But note: the formula (k^(m)-1)/(k-1) for m=2 gives 1+k+k^2? No, for m=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. That's not matching.\n\n        # Let's redefine: \n        #   After m expansions, the total vertices is: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n        # And the problem requires at least two expansions (m>=2). For m=1: (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1, but the problem says the first expansion is step1 (m=1) and then at least one more (step2, m=2). So the minimal m is 1 (first expansion) and then at least one more, so total expansions m>=2 (meaning two expansions: step1 and step2). Then the total vertices is (k^(3)-1)/(k-1) for m=2? \n\n        # Actually, let's count:\n        #   After step1 (m=1): vertices = 1 + k.\n        #   After step2 (m=2): vertices = 1 + k + k^2.\n        #   After step3 (m=3): vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n        # So the formula is n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for m>=1 (number of expansions) but the problem requires at least two steps (m>=2). However, the example n=13 is achieved with m=2 (two expansions: step1 and step2) which gives n = (k^3-1)/(k-1). \n\n        # Therefore, we are looking for m>=2 (expansions) such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>1.\n\n        # But note: the problem statement says \"This step [adding k new vertices to each leaf] should be done at least once.\" The first step (step1) is the initial expansion (k>1). Then the second step (step2) is the mandatory additional expansion. So minimal m=2 (two expansions).\n\n        # So the equation is: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) with m>=2.\n\n        # Now, we can iterate m from 2 to about 60 (since k>=2, then n >= (2^(m+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(m+1)-1. For n=10^18, m+1 is about 60, so m up to 59).\n\n        # For each m, we can solve for k: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1). We can approximate k as n^(1/(m+1)). Then check the integers around this approximation.\n\n        # Steps for fixed m (number of expansions, m>=2):\n        #   Let exp = m+1 (total terms: 0 to m).\n        #   Compute k_approx = round(n**(1/exp))\n        #   Then check k_approx, k_approx-1, k_approx+1 (and maybe more if necessary) to see if (k^exp - 1) // (k-1) == n.\n\n        # But note: k must be integer and greater than 1.\n\n        # Example: n=13, m=2 (exp=3). Then k_approx = 13^(1/3) ≈ 2.35 -> round to 2. Then check k=2: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7 !=13. Then k=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1)=26/2=13 -> matches.\n\n        # Example: n=15, m=2: k_approx=15^(1/3)≈2.47 -> k=2: 7 !=15; k=3: 26/2=13 !=15. Then try m=3 (exp=4): k_approx=15^(1/4)≈1.96 -> k=2: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15 -> matches.\n\n        # So we need to iterate m from 2 to 60 (or until the minimal n for that m exceeds the given n).\n\n        # However, note that for a fixed n, there might be multiple m that work. We can break early if we find one.\n\n        # Implementation:\n        #   For a given n (>=7):\n        #       For m in range(2, 61):  # m is the number of expansions (steps), so exp = m+1\n        #           exp = m+1\n        #           low_k = 2\n        #           high_k = None\n        #           k_approx = n**(1/exp)\n        #           # We'll check k from floor(k_approx) down to 2 and ceil(k_approx) up to maybe floor(k_approx)+10, but note k must be integer and the function is increasing.\n        #           # But k_approx might be fractional. We can check k = floor(k_approx) and k = ceil(k_approx) and also k = floor(k_approx)-1, etc., but we must ensure k>=2.\n\n        #           # However, we can compute the exact k by solving the equation: n = (k^exp - 1) / (k-1)\n        #           # But note: k must be an integer. We can try k = floor(k_approx) and k = ceil(k_approx) and also k = floor(k_approx)-1, but we must avoid floating point inaccuracies.\n\n        #           # Alternatively, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] but n is huge. But note: k is approximately n^(1/exp), which for exp>=2 and n<=1e18, k is at most around 1e9 for exp=2, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        #           # We need to check only a few candidates around k_approx.\n\n        #           k_low = max(2, int(round(k_approx)) - 10)\n        #           k_high = int(round(k_approx)) + 10\n\n        #           But then we must check k from k_low to k_high? The range might be large if k_approx is large.\n\n        #           However, note that for large m (exp), k_approx is close to 1, but k>=2. Actually, for large m, even k=2 might be the solution. But we are iterating m from 2 to 60, so exp from 3 to 61.\n\n        #           We can compute k_min = 2 and k_max = int(round(n**(1/exp))) + 10, but n**(1/exp) for exp=60 and n=1e18 is 1e18^(1/60) ~ 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ~ 2, so k_max is about 12. So the range is small.\n\n        #           Actually, for a fixed m (exp = m+1), the base k must satisfy k^exp <= n*(k-1)+1. But k is at most around n^(1/exp). For n=1e18 and exp=60, n^(1/60) is about 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So k is small.\n\n        #           Therefore, for each m, we can set k_min = 2 and k_max = min(10**6, int(round(n**(1/exp)))+10) but note: for large exp, n**(1/exp) is small.\n\n        #           However, we can simply iterate k from 2 to an upper bound. What is the upper bound for k? From the equation: n >= 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. The dominant term is k^m, so k^m <= n. Hence k <= n^(1/m). But m = exp-1, and exp>=3, so m>=2. Then k <= n^(1/2) for m=2, which is 1e9 for n=1e18, which is too large to iterate.\n\n        #           We need a better way: instead of iterating over k, we can use the approximation k_approx and check a small range around it.\n\n        #           Since the function f(k) = (k^exp-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1, there can be at most one integer k satisfying the equation for fixed m.\n\n        #           Steps for fixed m (exp = m+1):\n        #               k0 = round(n**(1/exp))\n        #               Then check k0, k0-1, k0+1, k0-2, k0+2, ... until we find an integer k>=2 that satisfies (k^exp-1)/(k-1)==n. But note: we must use integer arithmetic to avoid floating point inaccuracies.\n\n        #           However, we must be cautious: the equation might not hold exactly due to rounding.\n\n        #           Alternatively, we can compute the expected value: \n        #               Let k_candidate = floor(k_approx) and k_candidate = ceil(k_approx) and also a few neighbors.\n\n        #           But note: k_approx = n**(1/exp) is the base for the geometric series? Actually, the equation is n = (k^exp-1)/(k-1). We can solve for k by binary search in the range [2, n] but the range is too large.\n\n        #           Given the complexity, we can try to use the following: for fixed m (exp), the equation is a polynomial of degree exp-1. We can use the rational root theorem? Not really.\n\n        #           Another idea: since m is at most 60, and for each m we only need to check a small range of k (around n**(1/exp)), we can do:\n\n        #           k_low = max(2, int(k_approx) - 10)\n        #           k_high = int(k_approx) + 10\n\n        #           But then we must ensure k_high is not too large. However, for large m, k_approx is small, so the range is small.\n\n        #           Example: n=1e18, m=60 (exp=61): k_approx = (1e18)**(1/61) ~ 10^(18/61) ~ 10^0.295 ~ 1.97, so k_low= max(2, 1.97-10) = 2, k_high=11. Then we check k from 2 to 11.\n\n        #           This is feasible because the range is small (at most 10 numbers).\n\n        #           Steps for fixed m and n:\n        #               exp = m+1\n        #               k_approx = n**(1/exp)\n        #               k_low = max(2, int(k_approx) - 10)\n        #               k_high = int(k_approx) + 10\n        #               For k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n        #                   if k-1 == 0: continue   (k>1, so k>=2)\n        #                   Compute s = (k**exp - 1) // (k-1)\n        #                   But note: k**exp might be too large for exponentiation if exp is large and k is even moderate? For exp=61 and k=10, 10**61 is a very large number (61 digits), but Python can handle integers, but it might be slow.\n\n        #           However, we are only doing at most 10*60 = 600 exponentiations per test case, and there are 10^4 test cases, so 600*10^4 = 6e6 exponentiations, each with exponents up to 61 and bases up to maybe 1e9 (for m=2, k_approx is about sqrt(n)=1e9, so k_high=1e9+10, which is too many to iterate over).\n\n        #           Correction: for m=2 (exp=3), k_approx = n**(1/3). For n=1e18, k_approx=1e6. Then k_low=1e6-10, k_high=1e6+10, which is 21 numbers. Then for each test case, we do 21*60=1260 exponentiations. For 10^4 test cases, that's 1260 * 10^4 = 12.6e6 exponentiations. Each exponentiation is a power with exponent up to 61, which is O(exp) multiplications, so 61 multiplications per exponentiation. Then total operations is 12.6e6 * 61 ~ 768.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if implemented carefully (in C++ it would be, but in Python might be borderline in speed).\n\n        #           However, note that for m=2, k_approx is about n**(1/3), and for n=1e18, that's 1e6, and raising 1e6 to the 3rd power is 1e18, which is the limit of Python integers but still doable. But for m=59 (exp=60) and n=1e18, k_approx is about 2, so k_low=2-10=-8 -> 2, k_high=12, and we do 11 exponentiations, each with exponent 60. Raising 12 to the 60th power is a very large number (12^60 ~ 1e64) but Python can handle it, though it might be slow.\n\n        #           But note: we are only doing a few hundred million exponentiations in total (12.6e6) and each exponentiation uses exponent up to 60, so 60 multiplications per exponentiation. 12.6e6 * 60 ~ 756e6 multiplications, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might take a few minutes.\n\n        #           However, we have up to 10^4 test cases, and we are doing 60 * (range size) per test case. The range size is at most 21 (from k_approx-10 to k_approx+10). So per test case, 60 * 21 = 1260 exponentiations. Then for 10^4 test cases, 12.6e6 exponentiations. Each exponentiation for base up to 1e6 and exponent 3 is fast (just a few multiplications). But for base 2 and exponent 60, it's still fast because 2^60 is about 1e18, which is a 19-digit number, and exponentiation by squaring is O(log exponent) multiplications.\n\n        #           Actually, the exponentiation a**b for integers in Python is optimized and uses exponentiation by squaring. The number of multiplications is O(log(b)).\n\n        #           But note: the exponent is fixed (exp = m+1, and m from 2 to 60, so exp from 3 to 61). The maximum exponent is 61, so log2(61) is about 6, so at most 6 multiplications per exponentiation.\n\n        #           Therefore, total operations: 12.6e6 * 6 = 75.6e6 multiplications, which is acceptable.\n\n        #   If we find any m and k such that (k**exp - 1) // (k-1) == n, then output \"YES\" and break.\n\n        # 4. If no m in [2,60] and no k in the candidate range works, output \"NO\".\n\n        # Special note: if n==1, then it's the initial vertex, but the problem requires at least two expansions (so n>=7).

This is integer division, but note: (k^(m+1)-1) is always divisible by (k-1) by the formula of geometric series.\n\n        #   Therefore, we can rely on the division.\n\n        #   Code implementation:\n\n        #   We must be cautious with large exponentiation: for m=60 and k=2, we are raising 2 to the 61st power, which is a big number but Python can handle it.\n\n        #   However, for m=2 and k=1e9, we are raising 1e9 to the 3rd power, which is 1e27, which is also manageable in Python (though it might take time).\n\n        #   But note: we have 10^4 test cases, and for each test case we iterate m from 2 to 60 and for each m we iterate up to 21 k values. The worst-case total iterations is 10^4 * 60 * 21 = 12.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        #   However, the exponentiation for large k and large m might be heavy. But note that m is at most 60, and k is at most around n**(1/m). For m=2, k is around sqrt(n) (which is 1e9 for n=1e18), and raising 1e9 to the 3rd power is 1e27, which is a big integer but Python can handle. But doing this 12.6e6 times might be slow.\n\n        #   We need to optimize: notice that for large m, k_approx is close to 1, so k is small. Only for small m (like 2,3,..., say 20) do we have large k. \n\n        #   Alternatively, we can break out early if the minimal sum for a given m and k_min is already greater than n.\n\n        #   But the minimal sum for a given m and k is when k=2, and that is (2^(m+1)-1)//(2-1)=2^(m+1)-1. If 2^(m+1)-1 > n, then we can skip this m.\n\n        #   However, we are iterating m from 2 to 60, and for each m we are checking k around k_approx. We can first compute the minimal sum for k=2: if 2^(m+1)-1 > n, then skip this m.\n\n        #   But note: the sum increases with k, so if the minimal sum (k=2) is already > n, then no k for this m works.\n\n        #   Similarly, if the maximal sum for k=k_high is < n, then no k for this m works.\n\n        #   We can precompute for each m:\n        #       s_min = (2**(m+1)-1) // 1  (since k=2, k-1=1)\n        #       s_max = (k_high**(m+1)-1)//(k_high-1)\n\n        #   But k_high is around n**(1/m), and for large m, k_high is small, so s_max is manageable.\n\n        #   However, we are already iterating k from k_low to k_high, so we can break early if we find a k such that the sum is greater than n? But we are checking each k individually.\n\n        #   Given the constraints (12.6e6 iterations) and that each iteration involves an exponentiation with exponent up to 61, it might be slow in Python. But 12.6e6 * 61 multiplications is 768.6e6 multiplications, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might take several seconds.\n\n        #   We'll implement and hope that the input n are such that k_approx is not too large (for large m, k_approx is small).\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   Steps for each test case:\n        #       if n < 7: \"NO\"\n        #       else:\n        #           found = False\n        #           for m in range(2, 61):\n        #               exp = m+1\n        #               # If the minimal sum for k=2 is greater than n, break because m is too large (since the sum increases with m and k=2)\n        #               if (2**exp - 1) > n:\n        #                   # Since the sum increases with m, we can break out of the loop because larger m will have even bigger minimal sum.\n        #                   break\n        #               # Compute k_approx = n**(1/m)\n        #               try:\n        #                   k_approx = n**(1/m)\n        #               except:\n        #                   k_approx = 2\n        #               k_low = max(2, int(k_approx) - 10)\n        #               k_high = int(k_approx) + 10\n        #               # But sometimes k_approx might be fractional, and we want to cover both sides.\n        #               # Also, k_low and k_high must be at least 2.\n        #               k_low = max(2, k_low)\n        #               k_high = max(k_low, k_high)\n        #               # We'll iterate k from k_low to k_high\n        #               for k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n        #                   try:\n        #                       # Compute s = (k**(m+1)-1)//(k-1)\n        #                       numerator = pow(k, m+1) - 1\n        #                       denominator = k-1\n        #                       if denominator == 0:\n        #                           continue\n        #                       s = numerator // denominator\n        #                       if s == n:\n        #                           found = True\n        #                           break\n        #                   except:\n        #                       continue\n        #               if found:\n        #                   break\n        #           if found:\n        #               results.append(\"YES\")\n        #           else:\n        #               results.append(\"NO\")\n\n        #   However, note: the above break condition for m (when 2**exp-1>n) is not entirely accurate because k might be larger than 2 and the sum might be even larger, but we are breaking out of the m-loop.

However, given the constraints (10^4 test cases, 60*21=1260 iterations per test case), the total iterations are 12.6e6, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might take a few minutes.\n\n        #   Considering the problem constraints (t up to 10^4), we need to ensure it runs within time limits. In Python, 12.6e6 iterations might be borderline in speed (each iteration involves an exponentiation with exponent up to 61, which is O(log(61)) multiplications). \n\n        #   We can try to use pow(k, exp) which is faster than the ** operator? Actually, pow with three arguments (base, exp, modulus) is faster, but here we don't need modulus. But pow is implemented in C and might be faster.\n\n        #   However, we are not using modulus, so we can use pow(k, exp) without modulus.\n\n        #   But note: the numbers are huge (up to 1e18), but the exponent is at most 61, so pow(k, exp) is efficient.\n\n        #   We'll use pow(k, exp) for the numerator.\n\n        #   Final code with pow:\n\n        #       s = (pow(k, exp) - 1) // (k-1)\n\n        #   Let's hope it's faster.\n\n        #   We'll submit this version.\n\n        #   Note: There's a possibility that the initial range (k_low to k_high) is not covering the solution for some n.

This should cover it.\n\n        #   We'll run the provided examples and hope it passes.\n\n        #   However, note: the example n=1000000000000000000 (1e18) is \"NO\", and our code should not find any m and k.\n\n        #   Let's hope.\n\n        #   We'll now write the code accordingly.\n\n        #   IMPORTANT: The above reasoning assumed that the entire series has m+1 terms (exponents 0 to m). But the problem states that the first expansion (step1) is mandatory (giving k vertices) and then at least one more expansion (step2) is mandatory. This corresponds to m>=2 (two expansions), and the total vertices is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, which is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n        #   We are good.\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   But note: the above algorithm might be too slow for the worst-case (large n) because of the exponentiation. We might need to further restrict the range of m. But m goes from 2 to 60, which is fixed.\n\n        #   We'll proceed.\n\n        #   However, there is an alternative: we can also consider that the number of layers (expansions) is at least 2, and the total vertices is a geometric series. We can also check if n-1 is a repunit in base k (all digits 1) for some k>1 and length at least 3. But that is essentially the same as the geometric series.\n\n        #   We'll stick to the above method.\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   Note: The above code may not be the most efficient, but given the constraints (n up to 10^18 and t up to 10^4), and the fact that m is only up to 60, it should work.\n\n        #   We'll now implement the code.\n\n        #   IMPORTANT: We must use integer exponentiation and be cautious with large numbers.\n\n        #   Code implementation details:\n        #       - Use pow(k, exp) for the numerator.\n        #       - Break out early if the minimal sum for k=2 exceeds n.\n        #       - Iterate k in a small range around n**(1/m).\n\n        #   Let's hope.\n\n        #   Due to the complexity of the problem and the potential for floating-point inaccuracies in calculating k_approx, we might face issues.

For example, n=31 can be represented as (2^5-1)//1=31 (m=4) or (5^2+5+1)=31 (m=2, k=5). But 31 = 1+2+4+8+16 (m=4) and 1+5+25 (m=2). So multiple representations are possible.

To optimize, we can break out of the outer loop early when the minimal sum for k=2 exceeds n, and for each m, we only check a small range of k values around the approximation n**(1/m). \n\nBut note: the provided solution in the example input and output is as follows:\n\nInput:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nOutput:\n['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\nWe'll implement the solution accordingly.\n\nLet's write the final code.\n\nNote: We must be cautious with the exponentiation and the range of k. The range is centered around n**(1/m) and spans ±10, which is sufficient because the solution k must be close to the theoretical value.\n\nHere is the code:\n",

We need to find t such that the sum is exactly (n-1)//k.\n\n        # The sum of the geometric series is (k^t - 1)/(k-1). So we need:\n        #   (k^t - 1)/(k-1) = (n-1)//k\n\n        # Rearranged: k^t = (n-1)//k * (k-1) + 1.\n\n        # Now, t must be at least 2 (so the series has at least two terms: 1 + k). But note: the original series has t+1 terms (from exponent 0 to t).

If n < 7, return \"NO\".\n        # 2. Factorize n-1 (if n==1, then skip, but n>=1 and for n==1 we already handled as NO). But factorizing n-1 for each test case (up to 10^4 test cases) is too slow for n-1 up to 10^18.\n        # 3. Alternative: iterate over possible t from 2 up to about 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18). For each t, we can solve for k by approximating k as the (t)-th root of n. Specifically, k ≈ n^(1/t). Then we check the integers around this approximation (maybe floor and ceil) to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\n        # Why t from 2 to 60? Because for t=60, the minimal n is 2^61-1 (if k=2) which is about 2e18, but our n can be up to 1e18, so we might need t up to about 59 (since 2^60 is around 1e18, so 2^60-1 is 1e18). However, k doesn't have to be 2, so for k>2, t can be smaller.\n\n        # For each t from 2 to 60:\n        #   Let low_bound = 2\n        #   Let high_bound = int(round(n**(1/t))) + 10   (but careful: for t=2, n=13, then 13^(1/2)≈3.6, so high_bound=4, then check k=3 and 4)\n        #   Then, for k in [low_bound, high_bound] (but note: k must be integer) we check if (k^t - 1) // (k-1) == n-1 // k? Actually, the equation is: n = (k^(t+1)-1)//(k-1) for the entire series (including t+1 terms). But wait, we fixed t as the number of layers? Actually, in our earlier derivation, the entire series has t+1 terms (from exponent 0 to t). So the equation is n = (k^(t+1)-1)//(k-1). \n\n        # But note: the problem says the first expansion is step1 (k new vertices) and then at least one more expansion (step2). So the minimal t is 2 (meaning two expansions: step1 and step2, so three terms: 1 + k + k^2). Therefore, the total number of terms is t+1, and t (the exponent) is the number of expansions minus one? Actually, the number of expansions is t+1 (initial plus t expansions). But the problem requires at least two expansions (so t>=2).\n\n        # Let me clarify: \n        #   Step0: 1 vertex.\n        #   Step1: add k vertices -> total 1+k.\n        #   Step2: add k*k vertices -> total 1+k+k^2.\n        #   Step3: add k^3 vertices -> total 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n        # So the number of expansions (steps) is m = t+1, and the total vertices is n = (k^(m)-1)/(k-1) for m>=2 (since m=2: 1+k, but wait the problem says step2 must be done at least once, meaning m>=2? Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", referring to the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf. The first step (step1) is mandatory, and then step2 is mandatory at least once. So m>=2 (two expansions: step1 and step2). \n\n        # Therefore, the total vertices n = (k^(m)-1)/(k-1) with m>=2.\n\n        # Now, m is the number of expansions (steps) including the initial expansion. But the initial expansion is step1 (m=1) and then step2 (m=2) is mandatory. So the minimal m is 2. But note: the formula (k^(m)-1)/(k-1) for m=2 gives 1+k+k^2? No, for m=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. That's not matching.\n\n        # Let's redefine: \n        #   After m expansions, the total vertices is: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n        # And the problem requires at least two expansions (m>=2). For m=1: (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1, but the problem says the first expansion is step1 (m=1) and then at least one more (step2, m=2). So the minimal m is 1 (first expansion) and then at least one more, so total expansions m>=2 (meaning two expansions: step1 and step2). Then the total vertices is (k^(3)-1)/(k-1) for m=2? \n\n        # Actually, let's count:\n        #   After step1 (m=1): vertices = 1 + k.\n        #   After step2 (m=2): vertices = 1 + k + k^2.\n        #   After step3 (m=3): vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n        # So the formula is n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for m>=1 (number of expansions) but the problem requires at least two steps (m>=2). However, the example n=13 is achieved with m=2 (two expansions: step1 and step2) which gives n = (k^3-1)/(k-1). \n\n        # Therefore, we are looking for m>=2 (expansions) such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>1.\n\n        # But note: the problem statement says \"This step [adding k new vertices to each leaf] should be done at least once.\" The first step (step1) is the initial expansion (k>1). Then the second step (step2) is the mandatory additional expansion. So minimal m=2 (two expansions).\n\n        # So the equation is: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) with m>=2.\n\n        # Now, we can iterate m from 2 to about 60 (since k>=2, then n >= (2^(m+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(m+1)-1. For n=10^18, m+1 is about 60, so m up to 59).\n\n        # For each m, we can solve for k: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1). We can approximate k as n^(1/(m+1)). Then check the integers around this approximation.\n\n        # Steps for fixed m (number of expansions, m>=2):\n        #   Let exp = m+1 (total terms: 0 to m).\n        #   Compute k_approx = round(n**(1/exp))\n        #   Then check k_approx, k_approx-1, k_approx+1 (and maybe more if necessary) to see if (k^exp - 1) // (k-1) == n.\n\n        # But note: k must be integer and greater than 1.\n\n        # Example: n=13, m=2 (exp=3). Then k_approx = 13^(1/3) ≈ 2.35 -> round to 2. Then check k=2: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7 !=13. Then k=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1)=26/2=13 -> matches.\n\n        # Example: n=15, m=2: k_approx=15^(1/3)≈2.47 -> k=2: 7 !=15; k=3: 26/2=13 !=15. Then try m=3 (exp=4): k_approx=15^(1/4)≈1.96 -> k=2: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15 -> matches.\n\n        # So we need to iterate m from 2 to 60 (or until the minimal n for that m exceeds the given n).\n\n        # However, note that for a fixed n, there might be multiple m that work. We can break early if we find one.\n\n        # Implementation:\n        #   For a given n (>=7):\n        #       For m in range(2, 61):  # m is the number of expansions (steps), so exp = m+1\n        #           exp = m+1\n        #           low_k = 2\n        #           high_k = None\n        #           k_approx = n**(1/exp)\n        #           # We'll check k from floor(k_approx) down to 2 and ceil(k_approx) up to maybe floor(k_approx)+10, but note k must be integer and the function is increasing.\n        #           # But k_approx might be fractional. We can check k = floor(k_approx) and k = ceil(k_approx) and also k = floor(k_approx)-1, etc., but we must ensure k>=2.\n\n        #           # However, we can compute the exact k by solving the equation: n = (k^exp - 1) / (k-1)\n        #           # But note: k must be an integer. We can try k = floor(k_approx) and k = ceil(k_approx) and also k = floor(k_approx)-1, but we must avoid floating point inaccuracies.\n\n        #           # Alternatively, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] but n is huge. But note: k is approximately n^(1/exp), which for exp>=2 and n<=1e18, k is at most around 1e9 for exp=2, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        #           # We need to check only a few candidates around k_approx.\n\n        #           k_low = max(2, int(round(k_approx)) - 10)\n        #           k_high = int(round(k_approx)) + 10\n\n        #           But then we must check k from k_low to k_high? The range might be large if k_approx is large.\n\n        #           However, note that for large m (exp), k_approx is close to 1, but k>=2. Actually, for large m, even k=2 might be the solution. But we are iterating m from 2 to 60, so exp from 3 to 61.\n\n        #           We can compute k_min = 2 and k_max = int(round(n**(1/exp))) + 10, but n**(1/exp) for exp=60 and n=1e18 is 1e18^(1/60) ~ 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ~ 2, so k_max is about 12. So the range is small.\n\n        #           Actually, for a fixed m (exp = m+1), the base k must satisfy k^exp <= n*(k-1)+1. But k is at most around n^(1/exp). For n=1e18 and exp=60, n^(1/60) is about 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So k is small.\n\n        #           Therefore, for each m, we can set k_min = 2 and k_max = min(10**6, int(round(n**(1/exp)))+10) but note: for large exp, n**(1/exp) is small.\n\n        #           However, we can simply iterate k from 2 to an upper bound. What is the upper bound for k? From the equation: n >= 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. The dominant term is k^m, so k^m <= n. Hence k <= n^(1/m). But m = exp-1, and exp>=3, so m>=2. Then k <= n^(1/2) for m=2, which is 1e9 for n=1e18, which is too large to iterate.\n\n        #           We need a better way: instead of iterating over k, we can use the approximation k_approx and check a small range around it.\n\n        #           Since the function f(k) = (k^exp-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1, there can be at most one integer k satisfying the equation for fixed m.\n\n        #           Steps for fixed m (exp = m+1):\n        #               k0 = round(n**(1/exp))\n        #               Then check k0, k0-1, k0+1, k0-2, k0+2, ... until we find an integer k>=2 that satisfies (k^exp-1)/(k-1)==n. But note: we must use integer arithmetic to avoid floating point inaccuracies.\n\n        #           However, we must be cautious: the equation might not hold exactly due to rounding.\n\n        #           Alternatively, we can compute the expected value: \n        #               Let k_candidate = floor(k_approx) and k_candidate = ceil(k_approx) and also a few neighbors.\n\n        #           But note: k_approx = n**(1/exp) is the base for the geometric series? Actually, the equation is n = (k^exp-1)/(k-1). We can solve for k by binary search in the range [2, n] but the range is too large.\n\n        #           Given the complexity, we can try to use the following: for fixed m (exp), the equation is a polynomial of degree exp-1. We can use the rational root theorem? Not really.\n\n        #           Another idea: since m is at most 60, and for each m we only need to check a small range of k (around n**(1/exp)), we can do:\n\n        #           k_low = max(2, int(k_approx) - 10)\n        #           k_high = int(k_approx) + 10\n\n        #           But then we must ensure k_high is not too large. However, for large m, k_approx is small, so the range is small.\n\n        #           Example: n=1e18, m=60 (exp=61): k_approx = (1e18)**(1/61) ~ 10^(18/61) ~ 10^0.295 ~ 1.97, so k_low= max(2, 1.97-10) = 2, k_high=11. Then we check k from 2 to 11.\n\n        #           This is feasible because the range is small (at most 10 numbers).\n\n        #           Steps for fixed m and n:\n        #               exp = m+1\n        #               k_approx = n**(1/exp)\n        #               k_low = max(2, int(k_approx) - 10)\n        #               k_high = int(k_approx) + 10\n        #               For k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n        #                   if k-1 == 0: continue   (k>1, so k>=2)\n        #                   Compute s = (k**exp - 1) // (k-1)\n        #                   But note: k**exp might be too large for exponentiation if exp is large and k is even moderate? For exp=61 and k=10, 10**61 is a very large number (61 digits), but Python can handle integers, but it might be slow.\n\n        #           However, we are only doing at most 10*60 = 600 exponentiations per test case, and there are 10^4 test cases, so 600*10^4 = 6e6 exponentiations, each with exponents up to 61 and bases up to maybe 1e9 (for m=2, k_approx is about sqrt(n)=1e9, so k_high=1e9+10, which is too many to iterate over).\n\n        #           Correction: for m=2 (exp=3), k_approx = n**(1/3). For n=1e18, k_approx=1e6. Then k_low=1e6-10, k_high=1e6+10, which is 21 numbers. Then for each test case, we do 21*60=1260 exponentiations. For 10^4 test cases, that's 1260 * 10^4 = 12.6e6 exponentiations. Each exponentiation is a power with exponent up to 61, which is O(exp) multiplications, so 61 multiplications per exponentiation. Then total operations is 12.6e6 * 61 ~ 768.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if implemented carefully (in C++ it would be, but in Python might be borderline in speed).\n\n        #           However, note that for m=2, k_approx is about n**(1/3), and for n=1e18, that's 1e6, and raising 1e6 to the 3rd power is 1e18, which is the limit of Python integers but still doable. But for m=59 (exp=60) and n=1e18, k_approx is about 2, so k_low=2-10=-8 -> 2, k_high=12, and we do 11 exponentiations, each with exponent 60. Raising 12 to the 60th power is a very large number (12^60 ~ 1e64) but Python can handle it, though it might be slow.\n\n        #           But note: we are only doing a few hundred million exponentiations in total (12.6e6) and each exponentiation uses exponent up to 60, so 60 multiplications per exponentiation. 12.6e6 * 60 ~ 756e6 multiplications, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might take a few minutes.\n\n        #           However, we have up to 10^4 test cases, and we are doing 60 * (range size) per test case. The range size is at most 21 (from k_approx-10 to k_approx+10). So per test case, 60 * 21 = 1260 exponentiations. Then for 10^4 test cases, 12.6e6 exponentiations. Each exponentiation for base up to 1e6 and exponent 3 is fast (just a few multiplications). But for base 2 and exponent 60, it's still fast because 2^60 is about 1e18, which is a 19-digit number, and exponentiation by squaring is O(log exponent) multiplications.\n\n        #           Actually, the exponentiation a**b for integers in Python is optimized and uses exponentiation by squaring. The number of multiplications is O(log(b)).\n\n        #           But note: the exponent is fixed (exp = m+1, and m from 2 to 60, so exp from 3 to 61). The maximum exponent is 61, so log2(61) is about 6, so at most 6 multiplications per exponentiation.\n\n        #           Therefore, total operations: 12.6e6 * 6 = 75.6e6 multiplications, which is acceptable.\n\n        #   If we find any m and k such that (k**exp - 1) // (k-1) == n, then output \"YES\" and break.\n\n        # 4. If no m in [2,60] and no k in the candidate range works, output \"NO\".\n\n        # Special note: if n==1, then it's the initial vertex, but the problem requires at least two expansions (so n>=7).

This is integer division, but note: (k^(m+1)-1) is always divisible by (k-1) by the formula of geometric series.\n\n        #   Therefore, we can rely on the division.\n\n        #   Code implementation:\n\n        #   We must be cautious with large exponentiation: for m=60 and k=2, we are raising 2 to the 61st power, which is a big number but Python can handle it.\n\n        #   However, for m=2 and k=1e9, we are raising 1e9 to the 3rd power, which is 1e27, which is also manageable in Python (though it might take time).\n\n        #   But note: we have 10^4 test cases, and for each test case we iterate m from 2 to 60 and for each m we iterate up to 21 k values. The worst-case total iterations is 10^4 * 60 * 21 = 12.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        #   However, the exponentiation for large k and large m might be heavy. But note that m is at most 60, and k is at most around n**(1/m). For m=2, k is around sqrt(n) (which is 1e9 for n=1e18), and raising 1e9 to the 3rd power is 1e27, which is a big integer but Python can handle. But doing this 12.6e6 times might be slow.\n\n        #   We need to optimize: notice that for large m, k_approx is close to 1, so k is small. Only for small m (like 2,3,..., say 20) do we have large k. \n\n        #   Alternatively, we can break out early if the minimal sum for a given m and k_min is already greater than n.\n\n        #   But the minimal sum for a given m and k is when k=2, and that is (2^(m+1)-1)//(2-1)=2^(m+1)-1. If 2^(m+1)-1 > n, then we can skip this m.\n\n        #   However, we are iterating m from 2 to 60, and for each m we are checking k around k_approx. We can first compute the minimal sum for k=2: if 2^(m+1)-1 > n, then skip this m.\n\n        #   But note: the sum increases with k, so if the minimal sum (k=2) is already > n, then no k for this m works.\n\n        #   Similarly, if the maximal sum for k=k_high is < n, then no k for this m works.\n\n        #   We can precompute for each m:\n        #       s_min = (2**(m+1)-1) // 1  (since k=2, k-1=1)\n        #       s_max = (k_high**(m+1)-1)//(k_high-1)\n\n        #   But k_high is around n**(1/m), and for large m, k_high is small, so s_max is manageable.\n\n        #   However, we are already iterating k from k_low to k_high, so we can break early if we find a k such that the sum is greater than n? But we are checking each k individually.\n\n        #   Given the constraints (12.6e6 iterations) and that each iteration involves an exponentiation with exponent up to 61, it might be slow in Python. But 12.6e6 * 61 multiplications is 768.6e6 multiplications, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might take several seconds.\n\n        #   We'll implement and hope that the input n are such that k_approx is not too large (for large m, k_approx is small).\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   Steps for each test case:\n        #       if n < 7: \"NO\"\n        #       else:\n        #           found = False\n        #           for m in range(2, 61):\n        #               exp = m+1\n        #               # If the minimal sum for k=2 is greater than n, break because m is too large (since the sum increases with m and k=2)\n        #               if (2**exp - 1) > n:\n        #                   # Since the sum increases with m, we can break out of the loop because larger m will have even bigger minimal sum.\n        #                   break\n        #               # Compute k_approx = n**(1/m)\n        #               try:\n        #                   k_approx = n**(1/m)\n        #               except:\n        #                   k_approx = 2\n        #               k_low = max(2, int(k_approx) - 10)\n        #               k_high = int(k_approx) + 10\n        #               # But sometimes k_approx might be fractional, and we want to cover both sides.\n        #               # Also, k_low and k_high must be at least 2.\n        #               k_low = max(2, k_low)\n        #               k_high = max(k_low, k_high)\n        #               # We'll iterate k from k_low to k_high\n        #               for k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n        #                   try:\n        #                       # Compute s = (k**(m+1)-1)//(k-1)\n        #                       numerator = pow(k, m+1) - 1\n        #                       denominator = k-1\n        #                       if denominator == 0:\n        #                           continue\n        #                       s = numerator // denominator\n        #                       if s == n:\n        #                           found = True\n        #                           break\n        #                   except:\n        #                       continue\n        #               if found:\n        #                   break\n        #           if found:\n        #               results.append(\"YES\")\n        #           else:\n        #               results.append(\"NO\")\n\n        #   However, note: the above break condition for m (when 2**exp-1>n) is not entirely accurate because k might be larger than 2 and the sum might be even larger, but we are breaking out of the m-loop.

However, given the constraints (10^4 test cases, 60*21=1260 iterations per test case), the total iterations are 12.6e6, which is acceptable in C/C++ but in Python might take a few minutes.\n\n        #   Considering the problem constraints (t up to 10^4), we need to ensure it runs within time limits. In Python, 12.6e6 iterations might be borderline in speed (each iteration involves an exponentiation with exponent up to 61, which is O(log(61)) multiplications). \n\n        #   We can try to use pow(k, exp) which is faster than the ** operator? Actually, pow with three arguments (base, exp, modulus) is faster, but here we don't need modulus. But pow is implemented in C and might be faster.\n\n        #   However, we are not using modulus, so we can use pow(k, exp) without modulus.\n\n        #   But note: the numbers are huge (up to 1e18), but the exponent is at most 61, so pow(k, exp) is efficient.\n\n        #   We'll use pow(k, exp) for the numerator.\n\n        #   Final code with pow:\n\n        #       s = (pow(k, exp) - 1) // (k-1)\n\n        #   Let's hope it's faster.\n\n        #   We'll submit this version.\n\n        #   Note: There's a possibility that the initial range (k_low to k_high) is not covering the solution for some n.

This should cover it.\n\n        #   We'll run the provided examples and hope it passes.\n\n        #   However, note: the example n=1000000000000000000 (1e18) is \"NO\", and our code should not find any m and k.\n\n        #   Let's hope.\n\n        #   We'll now write the code accordingly.\n\n        #   IMPORTANT: The above reasoning assumed that the entire series has m+1 terms (exponents 0 to m). But the problem states that the first expansion (step1) is mandatory (giving k vertices) and then at least one more expansion (step2) is mandatory. This corresponds to m>=2 (two expansions), and the total vertices is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, which is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n        #   We are good.\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   But note: the above algorithm might be too slow for the worst-case (large n) because of the exponentiation. We might need to further restrict the range of m. But m goes from 2 to 60, which is fixed.\n\n        #   We'll proceed.\n\n        #   However, there is an alternative: we can also consider that the number of layers (expansions) is at least 2, and the total vertices is a geometric series. We can also check if n-1 is a repunit in base k (all digits 1) for some k>1 and length at least 3. But that is essentially the same as the geometric series.\n\n        #   We'll stick to the above method.\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   Note: The above code may not be the most efficient, but given the constraints (n up to 10^18 and t up to 10^4), and the fact that m is only up to 60, it should work.\n\n        #   We'll now implement the code.\n\n        #   IMPORTANT: We must use integer exponentiation and be cautious with large numbers.\n\n        #   Code implementation details:\n        #       - Use pow(k, exp) for the numerator.\n        #       - Break out early if the minimal sum for k=2 exceeds n.\n        #       - Iterate k in a small range around n**(1/m).\n\n        #   Let's hope.\n\n        #   Due to the complexity of the problem and the potential for floating-point inaccuracies in calculating k_approx, we might face issues.

For example, n=31 can be represented as (2^5-1)//1=31 (m=4) or (5^2+5+1)=31 (m=2, k=5). But 31 = 1+2+4+8+16 (m=4) and 1+5+25 (m=2). So multiple representations are possible.

This is correct.\n\n        #   We'll now output the code.\n\n\nHowever, after careful consideration, we note that the above approach might be too slow for the worst-case scenario (many test cases with large n) due to the nested loops and exponentiation. To optimize, we can break out of the outer loop early when the minimal sum for k=2 exceeds n, and for each m, we only check a small range of k values around the approximation n**(1/m). \n\nBut note: the provided solution in the example input and output is as follows:\n\nInput:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nOutput:\n['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\nWe'll implement the solution accordingly.\n\nLet's write the final code.\n\nNote: We must be cautious with the exponentiation and the range of k. The range is centered around n**(1/m) and spans ±10, which is sufficient because the solution k must be close to the theoretical value.\n\nHere is the code:",
