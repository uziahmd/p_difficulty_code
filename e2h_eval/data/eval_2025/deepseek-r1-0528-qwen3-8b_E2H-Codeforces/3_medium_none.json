Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers for the lantern positions.\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The street must be from 0 to l.\n 3. We need to cover the entire street [0, l] with intervals centered at each lantern (each lantern lights [a_i - d, a_i + d]).\n 4. The idea is to find the minimum d such that there are no gaps between the intervals.\n\n Consider:\n   - The leftmost point is 0. The first lantern might not be at 0. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a0.\n        Then we require that the first lantern's light reaches 0: so d >= a0/2.\n   - Similarly, the last lantern must reach l: so d >= (l - last_lantern)/2.\n\n But note: there might be gaps in the middle. We need to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n Approach:\n   Let the sorted lantern positions be in list `a`.\n   We can consider three parts:\n     a) The left part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n     b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n     c) The right part: from the last lantern to l.\n\n However, note that the lanterns themselves can be at 0 or l.\n\n We can compute:\n   gap_left = a[0]  (if we don't have a lantern at 0, then we need to cover from 0 to a[0])\n   gap_right = l - a[-1]\n\n   For gaps between consecutive lanterns: for i from 0 to n-2, the gap between a[i] and a[i+1] is (a[i+1] - a[i])\n   In order to cover a gap between two lanterns, the two adjacent lanterns must have overlapping light. \n   Actually, the required d for a gap between two lanterns (say from x to y) is (y - x)/2, but wait:\n\n   Actually, if we have two lanterns at positions x and y, the coverage from x is [x-d, x+d] and from y is [y-d, y+d].\n   To cover the entire segment from x to y, we require that the two intervals meet or overlap. The condition is:\n        x + d >= y - d   =>  2*d >= y - x   => d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n   However, note that the entire street also includes the parts from 0 to the first lantern and from the last lantern to l.\n\n   So the candidate d must be at least:\n        candidate1 = a[0] / 2.0   [to cover the left end]\n        candidate2 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0 [to cover the right end]\n        candidate3 for each gap i: (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n\n   Then the answer is the maximum of these candidates? \n\n   But wait: what if the gap between two lanterns is larger than the left or right gap? Then we take the maximum.\n\n   However, note: the requirement for covering the entire street is that the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] must cover [0, l].\n\n   We can think of it as:\n\n   - The leftmost point 0 must be covered: so the first lantern (at a0) must satisfy a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0 (but wait, no: the condition is that the light from the first lantern must reach 0: so d must be at least a0 (if we think of the distance from a0 to 0) but actually the distance is a0, so d must be at least a0. However, wait: the light covers from a0-d to a0+d. We require that 0 is in [a0-d, a0+d]. That means d >= a0 (because a0-d <= 0 => d>=a0). But wait, that would be if we only use the first lantern? Actually, we have multiple lanterns. However, the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least a0-d, but we require that the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern is covered. Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0+d. Since we don't have any lantern to the left of a0, the leftmost part is from 0 to a0. We require that the first lantern's light extends from 0 to a0+d. So the left part requires d >= a0 (if we are to cover from 0 to a0) but wait, that is not correct: the lantern at a0 will cover from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. But wait, if the lantern is at a0, then the leftmost point it covers is a0-d. We need a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. However, note: if we have more than one lantern, we might not need d>=a0 because the second lantern might help? Actually, no: the left end (0) must be covered by at least one lantern. The first lantern is the only one that can cover 0 (since all others are to the right). So indeed d must be at least a0.\n\n   But wait, consider: if we have two lanterns: [0, 5] and l=5. Then we need to cover [0,5]. The first lantern is at 0, so it covers [-d, d] but we only care about [0,d] and then the second lantern at 5 must cover from 5-d to 5+d. The right end is 5, so we require 5-d <= 5 (which is always true) but to cover the entire street, we require that the interval from 0 to 5 is covered. The first lantern covers [0, d] and the second lantern covers [5-d,5]. The gap between d and 5-d must be covered. Actually, we require that d >= 5-d? No, because the first lantern's right end is d and the second lantern's left end is 5-d. We require d >= 5-d? Then d>=2.5. But also note the left end: the first lantern is at 0, so we require d>=0 (which is trivial). The right end: the second lantern must cover up to 5, so d>= (5-5)=0, but wait: the second lantern's left end is 5-d, and we require that 5-d <= 5 (which is true) but to connect the two lanterns, we require that the first lantern's right end (d) meets the second lantern's left end (5-d). So we require d >= 5-d -> d>=2.5.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider:\n\n        d must be at least max( a[0], (l - a[-1]), ... ) but wait, for the middle gaps we require (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   Actually, the condition for the left part is: the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0+d, and we require that a0+d >= 0 (which is always true) but we also require that the entire street is covered. However, note that the left part is covered by the first lantern: the condition is that the first lantern's left side must cover 0, which gives d>=a0. But wait, let me reexamine:\n\n        The condition for the left end: the first lantern at a0 must cover 0. The distance from a0 to 0 is a0. So we require d >= a0.\n\n        Similarly, the condition for the right end: the last lantern must cover l, so d >= l - a[-1].\n\n        For the gap between two consecutive lanterns at a[i] and a[i+1]: we require that the two intervals [a[i]-d, a[i]+d] and [a[i+1]-d, a[i+1]+d] must cover the entire segment from a[i] to a[i+1]. The gap between the two lanterns is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The two intervals must meet: so we require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, which simplifies to 2*d >= a[i+1]-a[i] -> d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n        a[0] (for the left end)\n        (l - a[-1]) (for the right end)\n        (gaps between consecutive lanterns)/2 (for the middle gaps)\n\n   However, wait: in the example above with two lanterns [0,5] and l=5, the conditions are:\n        left: a[0]=0 -> d>=0\n        right: l - a[-1]=0 -> d>=0\n        gap: (5-0)/2 = 2.5 -> d>=2.5\n\n   So the answer is 2.5, which matches.\n\n   But consider the sample input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n        n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n\n        left: 2 -> d>=2\n        right: 5-5 = 0 -> d>=0\n        gap: (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.\n\n        And the example output is 2.0.\n\n   However, wait: why in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", the answer is 2?\n\n   Let's check: \n        With d=2, the first lantern at 2 covers [0,4] and the second at 5 covers [3,7]. The entire street [0,5] is covered because [0,4] and [3,5] (since 5 is included in [3,7] and we only need to cover up to 5). So yes.\n\n   But wait, our condition for the left end: we said the first lantern must cover 0, so d>=2. Then the gap condition: (5-2)/2 = 1.5, so we take max(2,0,1.5)=2.\n\n   Now consider the first sample: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n        Sort the lanterns: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        left: 0 -> d>=0\n        right: 15-15=0 -> d>=0\n        gaps: \n          3-0=3 -> 1.5\n          5-3=2 -> 1.0\n          7-5=2 -> 1.0\n          9-7=2 -> 1.0\n          14-9=5 -> 2.5\n          15-14=1 -> 0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n        The example output is 2.5.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Sort the list of lantern positions.\n        Let d1 = a[0]  (left end)\n        Let d2 = l - a[-1] (right end)\n        Let d3 = 0\n        For i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            d3 = max(d3, gap/2.0)\n\n        Answer = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n   However, note: the left end condition is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0+d. But wait, is that the same as requiring d>=a0? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the left end is that the light from the first lantern must reach 0. The distance from the first lantern (at a0) to 0 is a0. So the light must extend at least a0 to the left. Hence, d must be at least a0.\n\n   Similarly, the condition for the right end is that the light from the last lantern must extend at least (l - a[-1]) to the right.\n\n   But wait, what if the lanterns are not at the ends? Then the left end condition is still the same: the first lantern is the only one that can cover the left part, so d must be at least a0 (to cover from 0 to a0). Similarly, the last lantern must cover from a[-1] to l, so d must be at least (l - a[-1]).\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is not exactly d>=a0. Consider: if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. But what if the next lantern is very far to the right? The condition for the left end is only that 0 is covered. So d>=a0 is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two lanterns: [1, 3] and l=3. Then the left end condition: d>=1. The gap condition: (3-1)/2 = 1.0. Then the answer is 1.0. \n        With d=1: \n            First lantern: [0,2] -> covers 0 to 2.\n            Second lantern: [2,4] -> covers from 2 to 3 (since l=3) but note the street ends at 3, so we require the entire [0,3] to be covered. \n            The point 3 is covered by the second lantern (since 3 is in [2,4]) and the point 0 is covered. The gap between the two lanterns: from 1 to 3. The first lantern covers up to 2, and the second lantern starts at 2. So the entire [0,3] is covered.\n\n   However, note that the gap condition: (3-1)/2 = 1.0, and the left condition is 1, so the maximum is 1.\n\n   But wait, what if we have lanterns at [1, 4] and l=4? \n        left condition: d>=1\n        gap condition: (4-1)/2 = 1.5\n        right condition: 4-4=0\n        Then d_min = 1.5.\n\n        With d=1.5: \n            First lantern: [1-1.5, 1+1.5] = [-0.5, 2.5] -> covers 0 to 2.5.\n            Second lantern: [4-1.5, 4+1.5] = [2.5,5.5] -> covers from 2.5 to 4.\n            The entire street [0,4] is covered.\n\n   So the conditions are correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is not just the first lantern. What if the first lantern is not the only one? Actually, the condition for the left end is that the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern must be covered. The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position. But since the first lantern is at a0, the leftmost point is 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0, so we require d>=a0.\n\n   Similarly, the last lantern must cover from its position to l, so d>= (l - a[-1]).\n\n   And for gaps between two lanterns at a_i and a_{i+1}, the entire segment between them must be covered. The two lanterns together must cover from a_i to a_{i+1}. The first lantern covers up to a_i+d, and the next lantern starts at a_{i+1}-d. We require that a_i+d >= a_{i+1}-d, i.e., d>= (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2.\n\n   Therefore, we compute:\n\n        d_left = a[0]   # because we require the first lantern to cover from 0 to a0 (so d must be at least a0)\n        d_right = l - a[-1]   # similarly\n        d_gap = 0.0\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidate = gap / 2.0\n            if candidate > d_gap:\n                d_gap = candidate\n\n        answer = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n   But wait: what if the street has no lanterns? n=0. Then we have no lanterns. Then the input n=0, l. Then we must cover [0,l] with no lanterns. Then d must be at least (l)/2? Actually, we need one lantern to cover the entire street, so the minimal d would be l/2. However, the problem states n>=1, so we don't have to handle n=0.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The next line contains n integers ai\", so n is at least 1.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> Output \"2.0\"\n\n        n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n        d_left = 2\n        d_right = 0\n        d_gap = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        Then answer = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> Output \"2.5\"\n\n        a sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        d_left = 0\n        d_right = 0\n        d_gap: \n            gaps: 3,2,2,2,5,1 -> maximum gap/2 is 5/2=2.5\n        Then answer = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the first lantern is already at 0? Then the left condition is 0, which is acceptable. Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then the right condition is 0.\n\n   However, consider a case where the first lantern is not at 0 and the gap condition is very large, but the left condition is small. Then the gap condition dominates.\n\n   Another test: n=1, l=10, lantern at [5]. Then:\n        d_left = 5 (because 0 must be covered: 5-d<=0 -> d>=5)\n        d_right = 5 (because 5+d>=10 -> d>=5)\n        d_gap = 0 (no consecutive gaps)\n        answer = 5.0\n\n        With d=5, the lantern covers [0,10] -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the left end: the first (and only) lantern must cover 0: d>=5. Condition for the right end: d>=5. So 5 is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0, which is 5 units away. So d must be at least 5. Similarly, the right end is 5 units away, so d must be at least 5.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the ends. So if we have a single lantern at 0, then d_left=0, and if the street length is 10, then d_right=10. Then d_min=10.\n\n   Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at [0]:\n        d_left = 0\n        d_right = 10\n        d_gap = 0\n        answer = 10.0\n\n   Correct: the lantern at 0 must cover the entire street of length 10, so d must be at least 10 (to cover from 0 to 10).\n\n   So the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        d_left = a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n        d_gap = 0.0\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap > d_gap*2:   # Actually, we are storing d_gap as the half gap, so we can do: candidate = gap/2.0 and compare.\n                d_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n        Print ans with 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, wait: in the gap condition, we are taking the maximum gap divided by 2. But note: the gap condition for each consecutive pair is independent. We must consider the worst gap. Our loop does that.\n\n   But note: the gap condition is that d must be at least (gap)/2 for each consecutive gap. So we must take the maximum of all (gap/2). The way we did (iteratively updating d_gap) is correct.\n\n   However, note: the gap condition for the entire street is that the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns must be covered, so the minimal d must be at least (max_gap)/2. But note: we are iterating and taking the maximum gap/2, which is the same as taking the maximum gap and then dividing by 2.\n\n   But wait: is it possible that the maximum gap is not the one that requires the largest d? Actually, no: because the condition for a gap of size g is d >= g/2. The larger the gap, the larger the required d.\n\n   Therefore, we can also do:\n\n        gaps = []\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gaps.append(a[i+1]-a[i])\n        if gaps:\n            d_gap = max(gaps) / 2.0\n        else:\n            d_gap = 0.0\n\n   But note: if there are no gaps (n==1), then we don't enter the loop. Then d_gap remains 0.0.\n\n   Then the answer is max(a[0], l-a[-1], d_gap). For n=1, we have d_gap=0, and then we take the maximum of a[0] and l-a[-1] (which is the two ends). So that is correct.\n\n   However, the above code uses an iterative update. We can use either.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we have to cover both sides.\n        # Conditions: d_left = a[0], d_right = l - a[-1] (which is l - a[0] since n=1)\n        # d_gap = 0.\n\n        d_left = a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n        d_gap = 0.0\n\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > d_gap * 2:   # Actually, we are comparing gap to d_gap*2, but we want to update d_gap to gap/2 if gap/2 is bigger?\n                    # Alternatively, we can compute candidate = gap / 2.0 and update d_gap to the maximum candidate.\n                    d_gap = gap / 2.0\n        else:\n            # But wait, if n==1, then we don't have gaps. Then we don't need to do anything for d_gap.\n            d_gap = 0.0\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n        # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   However, note: the condition for the gap is independent of the other conditions. We can combine without the if:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # Initialize d_gap to 0.0\n        d_gap = 0.0\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap / 2.0 > d_gap:\n                d_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n        d_left = a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   But note: the gap condition is that d must be at least (gap)/2. We are updating d_gap to the maximum of all gaps/2.\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # If there's only one lantern, then we don't have consecutive gaps, so we can compute d_gap from the gaps list only if there are gaps.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can consider the entire street as:\n\n        # 1. The leftmost uncovered point is max(0, ...) but we are given the lanterns.\n\n        # Another approach: \n        #   The entire street must be covered. We can break the problem into segments:\n        #   - The left segment: from 0 to a[0] -> requires d >= a[0] (if a[0] is positive)\n        #   - The middle segments: between a[i] and a[i+1] -> requires d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2\n        #   - The right segment: from a[-1] to l -> requires d >= (l - a[-1])\n\n        # Then the answer is the maximum of these.\n\n        # We'll do:\n\n        d_left = a[0]  # covers from 0 to a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]  # covers from a[-1] to l\n        d_mid = 0.0\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            mid_gap = (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n            if mid_gap > d_mid:\n                d_mid = mid_gap\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_mid)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   This is the same.\n\n   But wait: in the gap condition, the required d for the gap is (a[i+1]-a[i])/2. However, note that the two lanterns together must cover the gap. The condition is that the right end of the left lantern (a[i]+d) must meet the left end of the right lantern (a[i+1]-d). The entire gap is (a[i+1]-a[i]), and the total extension from the two lanterns on both sides is 2*d. Therefore, we require 2*d >= (a[i+1]-a[i]), i.e., d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        a = [2,5]\n        d_left = 2\n        d_right = 0\n        d_mid = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n        ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        a = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        d_left = 0\n        d_right = 0\n        d_mid = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ) \n               = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n   Example 3: \"1 10\\n5\"\n        a = [5]\n        d_left = 5\n        d_right = 5\n        d_mid = 0 (since no consecutive gaps)\n        ans = 5.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 4: \"1 10\\n0\"\n        a = [0]\n        d_left = 0\n        d_right = 10\n        d_mid = 0\n        ans = 10.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 5: \"1 10\\n10\"\n        a = [10]\n        d_left = 10\n        d_right = 0\n        d_mid = 0\n        ans = 10.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 6: \"3 10\\n2 5 8\"\n        a = [2,5,8]\n        d_left = 2\n        d_right = 2 (because 10-8=2)\n        gaps: (5-2)=3 -> 1.5; (8-5)=3 -> 1.5\n        d_mid = 1.5\n        ans = max(2,2,1.5)=2.0\n\n        Check: with d=2, \n            lantern at 2: [0,4]\n            lantern at 5: [3,7]\n            lantern at 8: [6,10]\n            The entire street [0,10] is covered? \n                [0,4] covers 0 to 4.\n                [3,7] covers 3 to 7 -> but 4 to 3 is okay, then 3 to 7, and [6,10] covers 6 to 10.\n                The gaps: from 4 to 3 is negative? Actually, the intervals are [0,4] and [3,7] so they overlap at [3,4]. Then [3,7] and [6,10] overlap at [6,7]. So the entire [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But wait, the gap condition was 1.5, but we used d=2. Why is that? Because the left condition (d_left=2) requires d>=2. So the minimal d is 2.\n\n        However, the gap condition only requires 1.5, but the left condition requires 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n        The condition for the left end: the first lantern at 2 must cover 0: so d>=2. Therefore, even though the gap condition only requires 1.5, we must have d>=2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If n==0, but the problem says n>=1, so skip.\n\n        d_left = a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n        d_mid = 0.0\n\n        # If there is more than one lantern, we look at the gaps.\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2.0\n            if gap/2.0 > d_mid:\n                d_mid = gap/2.0\n\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_mid)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   Let me submit this.\n\n   But wait, there is a possibility: what if the street is empty? The problem says n>=1, so we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left and right are independent. The gap condition is independent. The maximum of the three is the answer.\n\n   One more test: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n        a = [0,5,10]\n        d_left = 0\n        d_right = 0\n        gaps: 5-0=5 -> 2.5; 10-5=5 -> 2.5\n        ans = 2.5\n\n        Check: d=2.5\n            lantern at 0: [-2.5, 2.5] -> covers [0,2.5]\n            lantern at 5: [2.5,7.5] -> covers from 2.5 to 7.5\n            lantern at 10: [7.5,12.5] -> covers from 7.5 to 10.\n\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end: the first lantern at 0 requires d>=0. The condition for the right end: the last lantern at 10 requires d>=0. The gaps require d>=2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the lanterns are not in increasing order? We are sorting, so that's handled.\n\n   I think we are good.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples in the code.\n\n   Example 1: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> 2.0\n   Example 2: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> 2.5\n\n   However, the sample input is given as:\n\n        ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n   We are reading from stdin.\n\n   But the problem says: the first line contains n, l, the second line contains n integers.\n\n   We assume the input is given in one line for n and l, and the next line for the lanterns.\n\n   We are using:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   This should work.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement example input is:\n\n        Input: \n            7 15\n            15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n        Output: \n            2.5000000000\n\n   So we output with 10 decimal places.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        d_left = a[0]\n        d_right = l - a[-1]\n        d_mid = 0.0\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap/2.0 > d_mid:\n                d_mid = gap/2.0\n        ans = max(d_left, d_right, d_mid)\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> Output: 2.0000000000\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> Output: 2.5000000000\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings in the problem statement. In our script, we read from stdin.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the answer must be correct within 1e-9. Our calculation is exact.\n\n   We'll submit.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to light the entire street from point 0 to point `l`. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This allows us to efficiently check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lantern.\n2. **Calculate Key Distances**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The minimal `d` must be at least this distance to ensure the leftmost part of the street is covered.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). Similarly, `d` must be at least this distance to cover the rightmost part of the street.\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The minimal `d` must be at least half of the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns to ensure there are no uncovered segments between lanterns.\n3. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The solution involves taking the maximum value among the three calculated distances (left end, right end, and middle gaps). This ensures all parts of the street are adequately covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nd_left = a[0]\nd_right = l - a[-1]\nd_mid = 0.0\n\nif n > 1:\n    for i in range(len(a)-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if gap / 2.0 > d_mid:\n            d_mid = gap / 2.0\n\nans = max(d_left, d_right, d_mid)\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate gap analysis.\n3. **Distance Calculations**:\n   - `d_left` is the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. This ensures the leftmost part of the street is covered.\n   - `d_right` is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). This ensures the rightmost part of the street is covered.\n   - `d_mid` is computed by iterating through the sorted lantern positions. For each consecutive pair, the gap between them is divided by 2 (since both lanterns contribute equally to covering the gap). The largest such value is stored in `d_mid`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The solution is the maximum of `d_left`, `d_right`, and `d_mid`, ensuring all segments of the street are covered. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to ensure the entire street is lit by the minimal possible radius `d`, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to determine the critical distances.",
