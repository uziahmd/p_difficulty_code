    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n The border (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is a x b (with a>=3 and b>=3, because we have borders), then the border consists of:\n     top row: a cells\n     bottom row: a cells\n     left and right columns, but without the corners (already counted) so (b-2) for left and (b-2) for right, for the middle rows.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   total cells in the border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2a+2b]\n\n But wait, actually: \n   The border of a rectangle (without any inner parts) is: \n      top: a\n      bottom: a\n      left: b-2 (excluding the top and bottom of the left column)\n      right: b-2\n\n   So total = 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8. Let's check:\n\n   For the first ring (i=1):\n        w' = 3, h' = 3.\n        Then the border: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n        w' = 7, h' = 9.\n        Then the border: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 28. -> matches.\n\n   Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n        First ring: uses 28 as above.\n        Second ring: i=2, then inner rectangle: w'' = 7 - 4*(1) = 3, h''=9-4*(1)=5.\n        Then the border for the second ring: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total cells = 28 + 12 = 40. -> matches.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \n   \"k\" is the number of rings. And the condition on k: \n        k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4).\n\n But note: the condition is given as floor((min(n, m)+1)/4) but note the problem says: \n        k from 1 to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 )\n\n However, we must check: \n        For w=3, h=3: min(w,h)=3 -> (3+1)/4 = 1.0 -> floor is 1, so k=1 is allowed.\n\n But note: the inner rectangle for the next ring (if k=2) would require:\n        w_next = 3 - 4*(2-1) = 3-4 = negative? \n\n Actually, the problem states: k is such that the inner rectangle remains positive. The condition ensures that the last ring's inner rectangle has at least 3x3? \n\n Actually, the condition is: \n        k <= floor( (min(w, h)+1) / 4 )\n\n Why? Because the first ring reduces the dimensions by 4 (since we take two cells from each side: top, bottom, left, right). So after k rings, the inner rectangle is (w - 4*(k-1)) x (h - 4*(k-1)). \n\n We need w - 4*(k-1) >= 3 and h - 4*(k-1) >= 3? Actually, the ring is defined only if the inner rectangle exists. The condition given in the problem ensures that the reduction does not make the inner rectangle invalid (negative or too small). \n\n Since the problem states that k is in that range, we don't have to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the total gilded cells by summing the borders for i from 1 to k.\n\n Steps:\n   Read w, h, k from standard input.\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # But note: the ring i is the border of the inner rectangle of size w_i x h_i.\n        # However, if w_i < 3 or h_i < 3, then the ring wouldn't exist? But the condition on k ensures that for the k-th ring, we have at least 3x3?\n        # Actually, the condition is given as: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). Let's check with the example: \n        #   w=7, h=9: min=7 -> (7+1)/4=2 -> so k<=2 is allowed. \n        #   For k=2: w_i = 7-4=3, h_i=9-4=5 -> valid.\n\n        # But what if the condition is exactly satisfied? The inner rectangle must be at least 3x3. \n\n        # However, note: the border formula works for any rectangle that has at least 3x3? Actually, the formula is for the outer border. \n        # But what if one dimension is less than 3? Then the border might be computed differently? \n\n        # According to the problem, the i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w-4(i-1))x(h-4(i-1)), and the condition on k ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions and at least 3x3? \n\n        # Actually, the problem states: \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge and so on\", meaning we subtract 2 from each side, so we subtract 4 from the total width and height. \n\n        # We must ensure that the inner rectangle has at least 3x3? The condition is that k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) which is equivalent to: 4*k <= min(w, h)+1, so 4*(k-1) <= min(w, h)-3? Not exactly, but it ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has dimensions at least 3x3?\n\n        # Actually, for the k-th ring: \n        #   w_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= 3? \n        #   Condition: w - 4*(k-1) >= 3  => k-1 <= (w-3)/4  => k <= (w-3)/4 + 1\n        #   Similarly for h: k <= (h-3)/4 + 1\n        #   The condition given is k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) which is equivalent to k <= (min(w, h)+1)//4 (using integer division).\n\n        # Let's verify: \n        #   Condition: k <= (min(w, h)+1)//4\n        #   Then for the k-th ring: \n        #       min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*((min(w, h)+1)//4 - 1) \n        #   This is not straightforward, but note the problem says that k is in that range, so we assume the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is valid.\n\n        # However, we are given the condition, so we can safely use the formula for each ring.\n\n        # But note: if w_i or h_i becomes less than 3, then the border formula breaks (we cannot have a rectangle with negative dimensions or with one dimension less than 3). However, the condition on k ensures that for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has at least 3 in both dimensions.\n\n        # Therefore, we can compute the border for the i-th ring as: \n        #   If w_i <= 0 or h_i <= 0, then we break (but condition ensures we don't get there).\n        #   Otherwise, the border is 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4.\n\n        total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n   Print total.\n\n But wait: what if the inner rectangle has only one row or column? Then the formula still holds? \n   Consider: 1x1: then 2*1+2*1-4 = 0 -> which is correct because a 1x1 has no border (it's just one cell, but the problem defines a border for an inner rectangle that requires at least 3x3? Actually, the problem states that the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. And the condition on k ensures that we don't go below 3x3.\n\n However, note: the condition is that k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n Let's test with w=3, h=3, k=1: \n        i=1: w_i=3, h_i=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n Another test: w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> k=1 is maximum.\n        Then for k=1: 2*5+2*5-4 = 10+10-4 = 16.\n\n But let me draw a 5x5 grid and mark the border: \n        The border of 5x5: \n          top: 5, bottom:5, left:5-2=3, right:5-2=3 -> but wait, actually the left and right columns are 5 rows, but we subtracted the top and bottom already. Alternatively, the entire border is 5*4 - (inner 3x3) but that's not the way.\n\n        Actually, the border is the outer layer. In a 5x5, the border is 5*4 - 3*3? That would be 20-9=11, which is not 16.\n\n        Let me count: \n          Row1: 5 cells\n          Row2: 5 cells\n          Row3: 5 cells\n          Row4: 5 cells\n          Row5: 5 cells\n\n        But wait, that counts the entire outer ring. Actually, the border is the outer ring, but the problem says the ring has width 1. So we are only taking the outermost layer.\n\n        However, the problem says: the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. For the first ring, the inner rectangle is the original 5x5, and the border is the outer layer. \n\n        How many cells in the outer layer of 5x5? \n          Top row: 5\n          Bottom row: 5\n          Middle rows: two columns (left and right) each of length 3 (rows 2 to 4, excluding the top and bottom rows which we already did). \n          So: 5 (top) + 5 (bottom) + 3 (left) + 3 (right) = 16.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle for the first ring is the entire plate, and the border is the outer layer. \n\n But wait, the example picture for the third example (7x9 with two rings) matches.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read w, h, k\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(k):\n        # i from 0 to k-1: then the current ring index is i+1\n        w_i = w - 4*i\n        h_i = h - 4*i\n        # We must check that w_i and h_i are at least 3? Actually, the condition ensures that we don't go below 3 for the last ring, but we are iterating for each ring, so we can break if we get negative or too small? But the problem condition says k is chosen so that we don't go below 3. However, we can also just compute.\n\n        # But note: the problem says the ring is defined for the inner rectangle. The formula for the border is 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4, but if w_i or h_i is less than 3, then we might get negative or non-positive? \n\n        # Actually, the condition ensures that for the k-th ring, w_i and h_i are at least 3. However, we are iterating from 0 to k-1, and k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        # Let's compute for the last ring (i=k-1): \n        #   w_{last} = w - 4*(k-1) >= 3? \n        #   Condition: k <= (min(w, h)+1)//4  => 4*k <= min(w, h)+1  => 4*(k-1) <= min(w, h)+1 - 4 = min(w, h)-3\n        #   Then w_{last} = w - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - (min(w, h)-3) = 3.\n\n        # So the condition ensures that even the last ring's inner rectangle is at least 3x3.\n\n        # Therefore, we can compute the border for each ring without worrying about negative or zero.\n\n        total += 2 * w_i + 2 * h_i - 4\n\n   Print(total)\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 3 1\" works, but what if we have a different example, say w=5, h=5, k=1: \n        i=0: w_i=5, h_i=5 -> 2*5+2*5-4 = 16 -> correct.\n\n But wait, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. Our calculation for the first ring is the entire outer border. \n\n However, note: the problem says the plate is w x h, and the first ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size w x h. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \n        \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\"\n\n So our method is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\". And we are effectively removing two cells from each side (so the inner rectangle is reduced by 4 per ring). \n\n However, there is another way to think: the first ring uses the outer border, the second ring uses the next border, etc.\n\n But note: the example \"7 9 2\": \n        First ring: uses the border of 7x9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n        Second ring: uses the border of (7-4=3) x (9-4=5) -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12.\n        Total: 40.\n\n Another example: \"5 5 2\": \n        k=2: condition: floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed. Therefore, we don't need to consider k=2 for 5x5.\n\n So the condition in the input ensures that we only get k values that are valid.\n\n Let me test with w=7, h=9, k=1 and k=2.\n\n We are given that k is in the range [1, floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)].\n\n Code:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   w = int(data[0])\n   h = int(data[1])\n   k = int(data[2])\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(k):\n        w_i = w - 4*i\n        h_i = h - 4*i\n        # Since we know w_i and h_i are at least 3 (because the condition on k ensures the last ring is valid), we can compute the border.\n        total += 2 * w_i + 2 * h_i - 4\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, wait: the condition is floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). What if w and h are different? \n        Example: w=10, h=10, k= floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2.\n\n        Then for k=2: \n            First ring: 2*10+2*10-4 = 36\n            Second ring: w_i=10-4*1=6, h_i=10-4*1=6 -> 2*6+2*6-4 = 12+12-4=20\n            Total: 56.\n\n        Now, let's count for 10x10 with two rings:\n            First ring: outer border of 10x10: \n                top: 10, bottom:10, left:8 (from row2 to row9), right:8 -> total = 10+10+8+8 = 36 -> correct.\n            Second ring: the inner rectangle is 6x6, so the border of 6x6:\n                top:6, bottom:6, left:4, right:4 -> total = 6+6+4+4=20 -> correct.\n\n        Example: w=10, h=11, k= floor((min(10,11)+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2.\n            First ring: 2*10+2*11-4 = 20+22-4=38.\n            Second ring: w_i=10-4*1=6, h_i=11-4*1=7 -> 2*6+2*7-4=12+14-4=22.\n            Total: 38+22=60.\n\n        Check: \n            First ring (10x11): \n                top:10, bottom:10, left:9, right:9 -> 10+10+9+9=38 -> correct.\n            Second ring (6x7):\n                top:6, bottom:6, left:5, right:5 -> 6+6+5+5=22 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read the input, then iterate k times, subtracting 4*i from w and h each time, and add 2*(w_i+h_i)-4.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring is the outer one, and the second is 2 cells away, meaning we subtract 4 from each dimension (two from top/bottom and two from left/right). \n\n We are doing exactly that.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate by adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed such that the first ring borders the edge of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangular plate. The key observation is that each subsequent ring reduces the dimensions of the inner rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side). The number of cells in each ring is calculated as the perimeter of the inner rectangle minus the overlapping corners, which simplifies to \\(2 \\times (width + height) - 4\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the inner rectangle's dimensions are derived by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from both the original width and height, where \\(i\\) is the ring number. The number of cells in the ring is then computed using the formula for the perimeter of this inner rectangle.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each ring from 1 to \\(k\\), adjusting the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each iteration, and summing the cells in each ring. The loop runs exactly \\(k\\) times, once for each ring.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\(O(k)\\) time, where \\(k\\) is the number of rings. Since \\(k\\) is constrained by the input dimensions (ensuring it does not exceed a certain limit), the solution is efficient even for the upper constraint values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        current_w = w - 4 * i\n        current_h = h - 4 * i\n        total_cells += 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width \\(w\\), height \\(h\\), and number of rings \\(k\\).\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total_cells` is initialized to zero to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\(k\\):\n   - **Adjust Dimensions**: The current inner rectangle's dimensions are calculated by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from both \\(w\\) and \\(h\\), where \\(i\\) is the current ring index (0-based in the loop).\n   - **Calculate Cells in Ring**: The number of cells in the current ring is computed using the formula \\(2 \\times (width + height) - 4\\), which accounts for the perimeter of the inner rectangle.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging the geometric properties of the concentric rectangles formed by each ring, ensuring accuracy and optimal performance.",
