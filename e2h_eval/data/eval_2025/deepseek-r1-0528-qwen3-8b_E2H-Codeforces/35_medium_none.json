    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   a list of n integers a0, a1, ..., an-1\n   a string s of digits (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, unless m=0)\n\n Note: The binary representation string s has length n. But note that the problem states that m is given by the binary representation s0s1...sn-1, meaning:\n   m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + sn-1*2^0.\n\n However, note that in the example: \n   Input: \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n   Here, n=2, a=[3,8], and the binary representation is \"10\", so m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n   f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3, and then the maximum is 3.\n\n However, note that the function f(x) uses the bits of x to select indices from the array a. Specifically, if we consider the binary representation of x (which must have at most n bits, but note the problem says x from 0 to 2^n-1? Actually, the problem says: x from 0 to 2n-1? Wait, the problem says: \"x from 0 to m\", and m is given by the binary string of length n.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"an integer from 0 to 2n-1\" — wait, wait, let me read again:\n\n \"function f(x), taking an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\"\n\n But note: the example input for m is given as a binary string of length n. So the maximum x is m, which is less than or equal to (2^n - 1). However, the problem says the domain is [0, 2n-1] — wait, that doesn't match. Actually, the problem statement says: \"among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m\".\n\n And m is given by the binary string of length n, so m is at most (2^n - 1). But the problem says the function is defined for x in [0, 2n-1] — wait, that is a mistake. Actually, the problem says: \"taking an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\", but that would be if n were the exponent base 2 with exponent n. However, looking at the example: n=4, and x=11 (which is 1011 in binary, which is 11, and 2n-1=8-1=7? That doesn't fit). \n\n Let me re-read: \n   \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.\"\n\n And note: the array a has n elements, indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n How is the binary representation of x defined? We are considering the first n bits? Because the array a has n elements.\n\n Actually, the problem says: the binary representation of x (without specifying the number of bits). But note: the function f(x) uses the bits from 0 to n-1? Because the array a has n elements.\n\n However, the example: n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in binary). Then they break down: 11 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3. So they are using the bits from 0 to 3 (i.e., n bits). Therefore, the function f(x) considers the n least significant bits of x? Or the representation of x in exactly n bits?\n\n The problem says: \"the binary representation of number x\", but note that x can be up to m, and m is given by a binary string of length n. So x is represented in at least n bits? Actually, we can assume that we consider the bits from 0 to n-1 (the n least significant bits). Then, if x has more than n bits, we only consider the lower n bits? But wait, the problem says x is from 0 to m, and m is given by a binary string of length n, so x is at most (2^n - 1) (if the binary string is of length n and has n ones) or less.\n\n However, the problem states: x from 0 to 2n-1? That seems incorrect. Actually, the problem says: \"an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\", but wait: 2n-1 is not the same as 2^n-1. There's a confusion. \n\n Let me check the problem statement again: \n   \"function f(x), taking an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\"\n\n This is likely a typo. Because in the example, n=4, and x=11 is used, and 11 is less than 16 (which is 2^4). The intended domain is [0, 2^n - 1]. \n\n But the input gives m as a binary string of length n. So the constraint is 0<=x<=m, and m is at most (2^n-1). \n\n Therefore, we are to consider the lower n bits of x (since the array a has n elements). \n\n Approach:\n\n We want to maximize f(x) = sum_{i: the i-th bit is set in x} a_i.\n\n However, note: the example second sample: \n   Input: \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n   Here, n=5, a = [17,0,10,2,1], m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n   Then the maximum is 27, achieved at x=5 (binary 00101, but note: we consider 5 bits? Actually, the example says: f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27.\n\n   But wait: the array a has indices 0 to 4. The function f(x) uses the bits of x (in the lower n bits) to index the array. For x=5, the binary representation (with 5 bits) is 00101. Then the set bits are at positions 0 and 2 (counting from least significant bit as 0). So we take a0 and a2.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify the bit order. In the example, when they wrote x=11 (for n=4) as 2^0+2^1+2^3, so the least significant bit is the 0th index.\n\n Therefore, the i-th bit in the binary representation (from low to high) corresponds to a_i? Actually, no: the example uses the bit at position i (starting from 0 for the least significant) to include a_i.\n\n But wait, in the example: \n   x=11 (binary 1011) has bits set at positions 0,1,3. Then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n So the indexing: the j-th bit (from the right, starting at 0) corresponds to a_j.\n\n However, the input gives m as a binary string. How is that string ordered? \n\n Example: \"11010\" for m. This is the binary representation of m, and the problem says: \n   m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + sn-1*2^0.\n\n So the string is given from the most significant bit (at the beginning) to the least significant (at the end).\n\n Now, note: in the example, n=5, m is given as \"11010\". Then the bits of m are:\n\n   bit4 (most significant) = 1 -> 2^4\n   bit3 = 1 -> 2^3\n   bit2 = 0 -> 2^2\n   bit1 = 1 -> 2^1\n   bit0 (least significant) = 0 -> 2^0\n\n But in our function f(x), we use the bits of x (again, in the lower n bits) and the i-th bit (from least to most, i.e., the 0th bit is the least) corresponds to a_i.\n\n However, the problem also says that the array a is given as a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n\n So how do we relate the bit positions of x (from least significant to most) to the array a? \n\n Let me clarify with the example: \n   x=5, which is 00101 in 5 bits (so we write it as 5 bits: 00101). Then the bits are:\n\n   bit0 (LSB): 1 -> index0: a0 = 17\n   bit1: 0\n   bit2: 1 -> index2: a2 = 10\n   bit3: 0\n   bit4: 0\n\n So the total is 17+10=27.\n\n But note: the array a has 5 elements: [17,0,10,2,1]. \n\n Now, the problem: we are to choose an x in [0, m] (m is given by the binary string of length n) such that the sum of a_i for every bit i set in x is maximized.\n\n However, we cannot set a bit if the corresponding bit in m is 0 and we are going to exceed m? Actually, we are bounded by x<=m.\n\n This is similar to a digit dynamic programming (DP) problem, where we traverse the bits from the most significant to the least, and decide whether to set a bit or not, while respecting the constraint x<=m.\n\n But note: the function f(x) does not depend on the value of x beyond the bits (we are only using the lower n bits). However, m is given by a binary string of length n, so we are considering exactly n bits.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have an array a of n elements, and a binary string s (length n) representing m.\n\n 2. We want to consider numbers x in [0, m] (with n bits) and we want to maximize the sum of a_i for every bit i set.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require x to be represented in n bits? Actually, x is at most m, and m is given by n bits, so x is in the range [0, 2^n-1] (if m is all ones) or less.\n\n But note: the problem says the domain of x is from 0 to m, and m is given by the binary string of length n.\n\n We can think of x as having up to n bits (from bit0 to bit_{n-1}). \n\n How to solve?\n\n We can use a greedy approach from the most significant bit to the least, but we have to account for the constraint x<=m.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP with two states: tight (whether we are matching m so far) and then for each bit we decide to set or not. However, n can be up to 10^5, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Another idea: without the constraint x<=m, the maximum would be the sum of all a_i for which a_i is positive? But note: we are forced to consider the bits from 0 to n-1. However, if we set a bit, we get a_i. But we can set any subset of bits arbitrarily (without the constraint) then we would set all bits for which a_i is positive.\n\n However, the constraint is x<=m. So we might not be able to set all the bits that are positive.\n\n We can use a greedy method from the most significant bit (the leftmost) to the least significant (rightmost). But note: the bits in the function f(x) are independent? However, the constraint is that the entire number x must be <= m.\n\n Let me define:\n\n   Let b[0..n-1] be the bits of m, from most significant to least: b[0] is the most significant (value 2^(n-1)), b[n-1] is the least significant (value 2^0).\n\n   We are going to consider the bits from the most significant (index0) to the least (index n-1).\n\n   But note: in our function f(x), the i-th element of the array a (a_i) is associated with the bit (n-1-i) in the usual binary representation? \n\n   Actually, wait: \n\n      In the example: \n          n=5, m = 11010 (binary) -> m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0.\n\n      The function f(x) uses the bits of x (in the lower n bits) and the j-th bit (from the least to the most) corresponds to a_j.\n\n      However, the j-th bit in the usual binary representation (LSB is j=0) is the same as the (n-1-j)-th bit in the string s? \n\n      Let me map:\n\n          In the array a, index0 corresponds to the least significant bit (bit0) of x.\n          In m, the string s is given from most significant (bit n-1) to least significant (bit0).\n\n      So the j-th character in the string s (from left to right) is the (n-1-j)-th bit of the number m (in the usual binary representation).\n\n      Therefore, the array a is associated with the bits from LSB to MSB (in increasing index order).\n\n      But wait: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (where i is from 0 to n-1) and adds a_i. The i-th bit in x (from the least significant) is the (n-1-i)-th character in the string s? Actually, no.\n\n      Let me re-map:\n\n          Let the bits of x (in n-bit representation) be: x = b_{n-1} * 2^(n-1) + ... + b_0 * 2^0.\n\n          But the function f(x) is defined as: \n             f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [if the i-th bit (meaning 2^i) is set then a_i]\n\n          In standard binary representation, the i-th bit (meaning the bit that corresponds to 2^i) is the coefficient for 2^i. However, in the n-bit representation, the bit for 2^i is the (n-1-i)-th bit from the left in the string representation of m.\n\n          Example: n=5, then the bit for 2^0 (LSB) is the last character in the string s, and the bit for 2^4 (MSB) is the first character.\n\n      Therefore, we can define:\n\n          Let the binary representation of x (with n bits) be: c0, c1, ..., c_{n-1} (c0 is the most significant, c_{n-1} the least).\n\n          Then the function f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [ if c_i == '1' then a_{n-1-i} ].\n\n      Why? Because the most significant bit (c0) is the bit for 2^(n-1), and this bit corresponds to the array index n-1 (since the array a has a_{n-1} for the highest power). The next bit c1 (second most significant) is for 2^(n-2) and corresponds to a_{n-2}, and so on until the least significant bit (c_{n-1}) which is for 2^0 and corresponds to a_0.\n\n      Alternatively, we can reverse the array a so that the most significant bit of x corresponds to the last element of a? \n\n      However, note: the problem does not require the array a to be reversed. The array a is given as a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n\n      In the example: \n          n=5, a = [17,0,10,2,1]\n          Then, for the most significant bit (which is the first bit of m and x) we use a4 (because that's the highest power) and then a3 for the next, etc.\n\n      But wait, the example says: \n          x=5 (binary 00101 in 5 bits) -> the bits from MSB to LSB: 0,0,1,0,1.\n          Then we take the bits that are set: the third bit (from left) and the fifth bit (from left). \n          The third bit (index2) in the 5-bit representation (from left) is the bit for 2^(5-1-2)=2^2? \n\n      Actually, let's assign the bits of x (n bits) to powers:\n\n          Let the bits be: \n            bit0 (MSB) -> power 2^(n-1)\n            bit1 -> 2^(n-2)\n            ...\n            bit_{n-1} (LSB) -> 2^0\n\n      Then the function f(x) = \n          if bit0 is set, then add a_{n-1}\n          if bit1 is set, then add a_{n-2}\n          ...\n          if bit_{n-1} is set, then add a_0\n\n      So we can define an array b of length n (the same as a) but in reverse order: \n          b[i] = a[n-1-i]\n\n      Then, if we consider the standard binary representation of x (with n bits) as a string s_x (from MSB to LSB), then \n          f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [ if the i-th character of s_x is '1' then b[i] ]\n\n      Alternatively, we can work with the original array a and just consider that the j-th bit (from the left) in the n-bit representation of x corresponds to a_{n-1-j}.\n\n 3. Now, the problem reduces to: we have a constraint x<=m (given by the binary string s of length n) and we wish to maximize the sum of a_{n-1-i} for every bit i (from the left) that is set in x.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require us to output x, only the maximum f(x).\n\n 4. We can use a greedy method:\n\n    We traverse the bits from the most significant (left) to the least significant (right). We have two choices for each bit: set it or not, but we must ensure that the number we form is <= m.\n\n    However, because the function f(x) is linear, we can try to set as many high-indexed bits (in terms of the array a) as possible, but we have to be cautious because setting a bit might force the following bits to be limited.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider: what if we set all the bits for which the corresponding a value is positive, but without exceeding m? \n\n    But note: the constraint is on the entire number. We can use a DP that goes from the most significant bit to the least, and at each bit we decide to set or not, and keep track of whether we are still matching m (tight) or already below.\n\n    However, n can be up to 10^5, and we have two states (tight or not) and two choices per state, so 2*2 states per bit, which is acceptable (O(n)).\n\n    Steps for DP:\n\n        Let dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can achieve from the i-th bit (from left) to the end, given that we are in state 'tight' (meaning the prefix is equal to m's prefix, so we cannot set a bit to 1 if m's bit is 0) or not.\n\n        But note: the array a is associated with the bits: the i-th bit (from left) corresponds to a_{n-1-i}.\n\n        However, we can precompute:\n\n          Let m_bits = list(s)  # s is the input string of length n\n\n          Let A = [0]*(n)   # We'll create an array for the value for the i-th bit (from left) which is a_{n-1-i}\n\n          Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let b[i] = a[n-1-i] for i in range(n)\n\n          Then the value for setting the i-th bit (from left) is b[i].\n\n        Then the DP:\n\n          dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i to the end, given the tight condition.\n\n          At bit i (0-indexed from left):\n\n            If tight is True, then the current bit can be at most m_bits[i] (which is either '0' or '1').\n\n            We consider two possibilities:\n\n              Option 1: set the i-th bit to 0.\n                  Then the next state remains tight only if we set 0 and m_bits[i] is 0 (then we remain tight) or if we set 0 and m_bits[i] is 1 then we become not tight.\n\n              Option 2: set the i-th bit to 1, but only if m_bits[i]=='1' (if tight) or if not tight we can set 1 arbitrarily.\n\n            But wait, if tight is False, then we can set any bit (0 or 1) without worrying about m_bits.\n\n          However, note: the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m. So even if we are not tight, we can set 1 arbitrarily.\n\n          But the value for the i-th bit is b[i] (if we set it) or 0 (if we don't).\n\n          Then:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = max {\n                // Option: set bit i to 0\n                    0 + dp[i+1][new_tight0],\n\n                // Option: set bit i to 1, if allowed\n                    (if allowed) b[i] + dp[i+1][new_tight1]\n            }\n\n          How to determine new_tight?\n\n            If tight is True:\n                - If we set bit i to 0 and m_bits[i]=='0', then the next state is tight (because 0==0, so we must continue matching).\n                - If we set bit i to 0 and m_bits[i]=='1', then the next state is not tight (because we set 0 < 1, so we are below).\n                - If we set bit i to 1 and m_bits[i]=='0', then not allowed (because we would exceed m).\n                - If we set bit i to 1 and m_bits[i]=='1', then the next state is tight (because we set 1==1, so we must continue matching).\n\n            If tight is False:\n                - We can set 0 or 1 arbitrarily, and the next state remains not tight.\n\n          Base case: when i == n, return 0.\n\n        However, the state is O(n) and we have two states, so we can do iterative DP.\n\n        But note: n can be 10^5, and we are storing two states per index, so memory O(n) and time O(n). This is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the array a is given, and we defined b[i] = a[n-1-i]. \n\n        Then we do:\n\n          m_bits = list(s)   # This is a list of characters\n\n          Precompute b: \n            b = [0]*n\n            for i in range(n):\n                b[i] = a[n-1-i]\n\n          Then, dp[i][tight] for i from 0 to n.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the entire n bits to be considered? Actually, the number x must be represented in n bits? The problem says the array a has n elements, so we consider the n bits (from 0 to n-1). And m is given by a binary string of length n.\n\n        Therefore, we consider exactly n bits.\n\n        But note: what if m is given by a binary string of length n, but the number m might have leading zeros? Actually, the problem says the binary representation is s0s1...sn-1, so we consider n bits.\n\n        However, the number m is fixed, and we are considering numbers from 0 to m (with the same n-bit representation). \n\n        But note: the problem says x from 0 to m, and m is given by that binary string. So x can have fewer than n bits? Actually, no: we are representing x in n bits (with leading zeros). \n\n        Example: n=2, m=2 (binary \"10\"). Then x can be 0 (00), 1 (01), 2 (10). \n\n        So we consider n bits.\n\n 5. Implementation:\n\n        We'll use DP from i=0 to n.\n\n        dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i to the end, given the tight condition.\n\n        We can use two variables: dp_tight and dp_loose.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let i=0, tight=True.\n\n          We iterate from i=0 to n-1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use recursion with memoization, but iterative is better for large n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i to the end.\n\n          Then:\n\n            if tight:\n                low = 0\n                high = int(m_bits[i])\n            else:\n                low = 0\n                high = 1\n\n            Then, we consider setting the bit to 0 or 1 (if 1 is within [low, high]).\n\n          But wait, in the tight state, we are restricted to set the bit to at most high (which is m_bits[i]). In the non-tight state, we can set to 0 or 1.\n\n          Then:\n\n            Option0: set bit i to 0.\n                Then the next tight state: \n                    if tight was True and we set 0 and m_bits[i]=='0', then next_tight = True (because 0==0, and we are matching so far)\n                    if tight was True and we set 0 and m_bits[i]=='1', then next_tight = False (because 0<1, so we are below)\n                    if tight was False, then next_tight = False (remains below)\n\n            Option1: set bit i to 1, if allowed (if tight, then only if 1<=high, i.e., m_bits[i]=='1'; if not tight, then allowed)\n\n          Then:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = max( \n                0 + dp[i+1][next_tight0],\n                (if allowed) b[i] + dp[i+1][next_tight1]\n            )\n\n        However, we need to know the next state's tight condition.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          dp[i][tight] = -infinity (but we know the values are non-negative, so we can use -10**18)\n\n          But note: we are maximizing.\n\n        We can do iterative from the last bit backwards.\n\n        Let dp[i][tight] be the maximum sum from bit i to the end, given the tight condition.\n\n        Base: dp[n][tight] = 0 for both.\n\n        Then for i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n          for tight in [True, False]:\n            if tight:\n                high = int(m_bits[i])\n                # Option0: set bit i to 0\n                new_tight0 = (i == n-1 and 0 < high) ? No, actually:\n\n                Actually, the tight condition for the next state (i+1) is determined by:\n\n                  - If we set 0 and we are tight, then if 0 < high, then we break the tight condition (because we set a bit less than the maximum allowed by m) so next state is not tight.\n                  But wait: in the tight condition, we are matching m so far. Then for the next bit, if we set 0 and the current m_bit is 1, then we are now below (so next state is not tight). If we set 0 and the current m_bit is 0, then we are still matching (next state tight).\n\n                Similarly, if we set 1, then we are matching only if 1==high (and high is 1) then next state is tight; if we set 1 and high is 0, then we cannot set 1.\n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n\n                Option0 (set to 0):\n                    value0 = 0\n                    next_tight0 = tight and (0 == high)   [But note: if tight is True and we set 0, then if high was 0 then we are still tight, but if high was 1 then we are no longer tight? Actually, no: the tight condition is broken if we set a bit less than the corresponding m bit. So:\n\n                    next_tight0 = tight and (0 == high)   [This is not correct: because if tight is True and we set 0, then we are still tight only if the m_bit is 0? Actually, no: the tight condition is that the prefix is exactly m. If we set 0 and the m_bit is 0, then the prefix is still matching. If we set 0 and the m_bit is 1, then we are now below (so not tight). \n\n                    So: next_tight0 = tight and (0 == high)   [But note: if tight is True, then high = m_bits[i] (converted to int). Then if we set 0 and high==0, then next_tight0 = True. If we set 0 and high==1, then next_tight0 = False (because we set 0 < 1). If tight is False, then setting 0: next_tight0 = False.\n\n                Similarly, for setting 1 (if allowed):\n\n                    value1 = b[i]   (if allowed, else -inf)\n                    next_tight1 = tight and (1 == high)   [only if we are tight and we set 1 and high==1, then we remain tight; if tight and high==0, then we cannot set 1, so we skip this option]\n\n            Therefore:\n\n                if tight:\n                    high = int(m_bits[i])\n                    # Option0: set 0\n                    next_t0 = tight and (0 == high)   # but note: if tight is True, then next_t0 = (0==high) -> if high==0 then True, else False. But if tight is False, then next_t0 = False (because we start from False, and we set 0, but we were already below, so we remain below). Actually, we are storing two separate states.\n\n                We need to handle the two states separately.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                dp[i][tight] = -10**18\n\n                if tight:\n                    high = int(m_bits[i])\n                    # Option0: set 0\n                    next_t0 = (tight and (0 == high)) or (not tight)   # Actually, if not tight, then we are not tight after setting 0. But wait, if tight is True, then next_t0 is (0==high). If tight is False, then next_t0 is False (remains False).\n                    Actually, we can define:\n\n                      next_t0 = tight and (0 == high)   # But if tight is False, we don't use this condition.\n\n                Let me separate:\n\n                For tight state (True):\n\n                    Option0: set 0\n                        next_t0 = (0 == high)   # because if tight was True, then after setting 0, the next state is tight only if we matched (0==high). But if 0 < high (which is 1) then we break the tight condition (so next state is False). \n                        However, note: if tight is True, then the condition for the next state being tight is that the prefix (including this bit) is equal to m's prefix. Since we set 0, then the next state is tight only if the current bit of m is 0 (then 0==0) and then we continue. If the current bit of m is 1, then 0<1 so we break.\n\n                    Option1: set 1 (if 1<=high, i.e., high>=1 -> high==1)\n                        next_t1 = (1 == high)   # then the next state is tight, else we cannot set 1 (if high==0, then we skip)\n\n                For non-tight state (False):\n\n                    Option0: set 0 -> next state remains False.\n                    Option1: set 1 -> next state remains False.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                dp[i][tight] = max(\n                    0 + dp[i+1][next_t0],   # next_t0 is computed as above for Option0\n                    (if tight and high==1) then 1*b[i] + dp[i+1][True] else -10**18,\n                    (if not tight) then 1*b[i] + dp[i+1][False] else -10**18   # wait, no: for non-tight we can set 1 always.\n\n                Actually, we should separate:\n\n                if tight:\n                    high = int(m_bits[i])\n                    candidate0 = dp[i+1][ (tight and (0==high)) ]   # But wait: the next state's tight condition: if tight is True, then next_tight0 = (0==high); if tight is False, then next_tight0 = False (but we are in the tight state branch, so we don't use the non-tight branch here).\n\n                    candidate1 = -10**18\n                    if high >= 1:\n                        # Then we can set 1\n                        candidate1 = b[i] + dp[i+1][ (tight and (1==high)) ]\n\n                    dp[i][tight] = max(candidate0, candidate1)\n\n                else: # not tight\n                    candidate0 = 0 + dp[i+1][False]\n                    candidate1 = b[i] + dp[i+1][False]\n                    dp[i][tight] = max(candidate0, candidate1)\n\n            However, wait: for tight state, if we set 0, the next state's tight condition is (tight and (0==high))? Actually, no: the next state's tight condition is:\n\n                We are tight so far (the prefix is matching m). We set the current bit to 0. Then the next state is tight only if the current bit in m is 0 (because then 0==0) and we continue. If the current bit in m is 1, then we set 0 (which is less than 1) so we break the tight condition (next state is not tight).\n\n                But note: the next state's tight condition depends on the current state being tight and the current bit's comparison.\n\n            However, in the DP, we are storing the state for the next bit. The tight condition for the next bit is:\n\n                After setting the current bit, the prefix (including this bit) is equal to m's prefix? \n\n                For tight state (current tight is True):\n\n                    After setting the current bit to 0:\n\n                      If m_bits[i] == '0', then the prefix is still matching (so next state tight).\n                      If m_bits[i] == '1', then the prefix is not matching (because 0<1) so next state not tight.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                if tight:\n                    high = int(m_bits[i])\n                    # Option0: set 0\n                    next_t0 = (0 == high)   # This is the condition for the next state to be tight? Actually, no: the next state is tight only if we set the same as m, i.e., if high==0 then we set 0 and then the next state is tight (because we matched) and if high==1 then we set 0 and then the next state is not tight.\n\n                    But wait, the next state is tight only if the entire prefix (including the current bit) is matching. Since we set 0, then if m_bits[i] is 0, then we matched and the next state is tight. If m_bits[i] is 1, then we set 0 (so we are below) and the next state is not tight.\n\n                    However, the condition for the next state's tight is independent of the current tight state? Actually, the next state's tight condition is determined by:\n\n                      next_tight = (current_tight and (current_bit == high))\n\n                    But note: in the tight state, the current_tight is True, and we set the current bit to 0, so next_tight = (True and (0==high)). \n\n                    So we can define:\n\n                      next_t0 = (tight and (0 == high))\n\n                    However, wait: if tight is True, then next_t0 = (0==high). But if tight is False, then we don't use this branch.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                dp[i][tight] = \n                  if tight:\n                    high = int(m_bits[i])\n                    cand0 = dp[i+1][tight and (0==high)]   # next state tight condition: if tight and (0==high) then next_tight, else",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). The challenge is to efficiently compute this maximum value while respecting the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums elements from array \\( a \\) based on the bits set in \\( x \\). The array \\( a \\) has \\( n \\) elements, and \\( m \\) is given as a binary string of length \\( n \\). The key insight is that each bit in \\( x \\) (from least significant to most significant) corresponds to an element in \\( a \\), but the binary string for \\( m \\) is provided from most significant to least significant.\n\n2. **Intuition**: We can model this problem using dynamic programming (DP) where we process each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit, we decide whether to set it to 0 or 1, ensuring the resulting number does not exceed \\( m \\). The DP state keeps track of whether the current prefix of \\( x \\) is exactly matching the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\) (tight constraint) or if it's already less than \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a DP approach with two states:\n   - **Tight State**: The current prefix of \\( x \\) matches the prefix of \\( m \\). Here, setting a bit to 1 is only allowed if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1.\n   - **Loose State**: The current prefix of \\( x \\) is already less than the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\). Here, we can set any bit to 0 or 1 without restrictions.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\). The space complexity is also \\( O(n) \\) due to the storage required for the DP states.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    b = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        b[i] = a[n-1-i]\n    \n    dp_tight = [0] * (n+1)\n    dp_loose = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    dp_tight[n] = 0\n    dp_loose[n] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dp_loose[i] = max(dp_loose[i+1], b[i] + dp_loose[i+1])\n        \n        if s[i] == '1':\n            dp_tight[i] = max(dp_tight[i+1], b[i] + dp_tight[i+1])\n        else:\n            dp_tight[i] = dp_tight[i+1]\n    \n    result = dp_tight[0]\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Reversing Array \\( a \\)**: The array \\( a \\) is reversed so that the least significant bit corresponds to the first element, aligning with the bit positions in \\( x \\).\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Two arrays, `dp_tight` and `dp_loose`, are initialized to store the maximum sum achievable from each position onwards under tight and loose constraints, respectively.\n4. **Processing Bits**: Starting from the least significant bit (processed from right to left), the algorithm calculates the maximum sum by considering both setting the current bit to 0 or 1. In the tight state, setting a bit to 1 is only allowed if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1. In the loose state, any bit can be set.\n5. **Result Extraction**: The result is derived from the initial tight state (`dp_tight[0]`), which ensures the solution respects the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) by leveraging dynamic programming to explore all valid bit configurations while adhering to the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).",
