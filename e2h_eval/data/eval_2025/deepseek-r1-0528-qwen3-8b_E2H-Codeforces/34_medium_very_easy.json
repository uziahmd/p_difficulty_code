And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we compute the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of all sleep times for all weeks.\n\n Then the average is S / (number of weeks) = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: S is the sum of the sums of each contiguous subarray of length k.\n\n We can compute S by using a sliding window or prefix sums.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list of n integers.\n 2. Compute the prefix sum array for the list so that we can quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n    Let prefix[0] = 0, prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n    Then the sum of days from i to j (0-indexed, inclusive) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n 3. The first window (from index 0 to k-1) has sum = prefix[k] - prefix[0].\n 4. Then for the next window, we subtract the element at index 0 and add the element at index k, but note the window moves one step.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total sum S without building the entire list of window sums:\n\n   S = 0\n   For the first window: use prefix[k] - prefix[0]\n   Then for the next windows (from index 1 to n-k): \n        window_sum = window_sum_previous + a[i+k-1] - a[i-1]   [if we keep the last window's sum]\n\n But note: we can also use the prefix array to avoid keeping a running sum.\n\n However, let's do it with prefix array:\n\n   Let total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n   Then S = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n But wait, that's not correct. Actually, we have:\n\n   Window starting at i (0-indexed) goes from i to i+k-1, and its sum is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n\n   Then S = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]]\n\n   But note: prefix[i+k] - prefix[i] is the sum from index i to i+k-1.\n\n   Then we can write:\n\n        S = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n   However, observe the indices: \n        i runs from 0 to n-k (inclusive). So we have terms from prefix[k] to prefix[n] (which is the same as the last term being prefix[n] - prefix[n-k] when i = n-k).\n\n   But note: the prefix array has length n+1, so we can do:\n\n        S = 0\n        for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n            S += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n   However, we can simplify the summation:\n\n        S = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   But note: the second part uses the same indices as the first part? Actually, the first part uses the prefix from index k to n (inclusive) and the second part from index 0 to n-k (inclusive). \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the entire set of windows is (n-k+1) windows, and we can use:\n\n        S = (sum of prefix[i+k] for i from 0 to n-k) - (sum of prefix[i] for i from 0 to n-k)\n\n   But there's an easier way: we can precompute the prefix array and then the entire S can be computed by:\n\n        S = 0\n        for i in range(n - k + 1):\n            S += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   However, note that n can be up to 200,000, so we need to do this in O(n). The above loop is O(n) so acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the prefix array is already built, so we can do:\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        S = 0\n        # Alternatively, we can use the fact that we don't want to iterate if we can use a direct formula?\n\n   However, the problem is that the indices for the two parts are different. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simple for loop from i=0 to i=n-k:\n\n        for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n            S += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   But note: prefix[i+k] is defined for i from 0 to n-k, so i+k <= n (because i <= n-k => i+k <= n). So safe.\n\n   Then the average is S / total_weeks.\n\n 5. However, note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" has n=3, k=2, and the windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. \n        prefix = [0, 3, 7, 11]\n        For i=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n        For i=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 11 - 3 = 8\n        Then S = 7 + 8 = 15, and total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2, so average = 15/2 = 7.5 -> which is 7.5000000000.\n\n   But wait, the example output is '9.0000000000' for the first example? \n\n   Let me check the example: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n        Expected Output: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   Wait, what? The example says:\n\n        Input: ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n        Output: ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n   Why is the first example 9.0? \n\n   Let me recalc: \n        Two weeks: \n            Week1: [3,4] -> sum=7\n            Week2: [4,7] -> sum=11\n        Then the average over the two weeks is (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   So I made a mistake: the example input says \"3 2\" and then the list [3,4,7]. \n\n   In my calculation above, I used the prefix array built from [3,4,7] as [0,3,7,11]. Then:\n\n        Window starting at 0: prefix[2] - prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7.\n        Window starting at 1: prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 11 - 3 = 8.\n\n   But wait, the second window should be [4,7] which is 4+7=11. However, I got 8 because I did 11-3=8.\n\n   Why 8? Because the prefix array is [0,3,7,11]. The second window is from index1 to index2 (0-indexed, the second and third elements). \n        prefix[3] = 3+4+7 = 11\n        prefix[1] = 3\n        So 11-3 = 8, but 8 is not 11.\n\n   What's the issue? The window starting at index1 (which is the second day, value 4) and length 2: the days are a[1] and a[2]. \n        The prefix array: \n            prefix[0]=0\n            prefix[1]=a0=3\n            prefix[2]=a0+a1=3+4=7\n            prefix[3]=a0+a1+a2=3+4+7=11\n\n        Then the sum from index1 to index2 (both inclusive) is prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 11-3 = 8, but the actual sum is 4+7=11.\n\n   This is incorrect. \n\n   The correct way: \n        The sum from index i to index j (inclusive) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n        For the second window (starting at index1, so i=1, and we take k=2 days: from index1 to index2): \n            j = index1 + k - 1 = 1+2-1 = 2.\n            Then the sum = prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 11-3 = 8, but that is not 4+7.\n\n   Wait, let me break down the prefix array:\n\n        prefix[0] = 0\n        prefix[1] = a0 = 3\n        prefix[2] = a0+a1 = 3+4=7\n        prefix[3] = a0+a1+a2 = 3+4+7=11\n\n        Then the window from index1 to index2 (the second and third days) is a1+a2. \n        That should be: prefix[3] (which is the sum of first 3 days) minus the part before index1, i.e., prefix[1] (the sum of the first 1 day).\n\n        But then why is the result 8? And the expected sum is 11? \n\n   Let me see: the window from index1 to index2 is the two days: 4 and 7. \n        prefix[3] is the sum of the first 3 days (indices0,1,2) = 3+4+7=11.\n        prefix[1] is the sum of the first 1 day (index0) = 3.\n\n        Then 11-3=8, but that leaves out the second day? No, wait: \n        The prefix array definition: prefix[i] is the sum of the first i days.\n\n        Then the sum from index1 to index2 is the sum of the second day and the third day.\n\n        We can also compute it as: \n            prefix[3] (first 3 days) minus prefix[1] (first 1 day) gives the sum from day1 to day2 (if we consider the array 0-indexed: day0, day1, day2).\n\n        But wait, the array is 0-indexed. Our window starts at index1 (which is the second day) and goes to index2 (the third day). \n\n        The total sum of the window is a1+a2. \n\n        Using prefix: \n            a1+a2 = (prefix[3] - prefix[1])? \n            prefix[3] = 3+4+7\n            prefix[1] = 3\n            Then 3+4+7 - 3 = 4+7 = 11? \n\n        Wait, no: 11 - 3 = 8, but 4+7=11, not 8.\n\n   I see the mistake: the prefix array is defined for the entire array, but the window from index1 to index2 (inclusive) is the second and third day. \n\n   The standard way: \n        The sum from index i to j inclusive is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n        Here, i=1, j=2 -> prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 11 - 3 = 8.\n\n   But 8 is not the sum of a1 and a2 (which are 4 and 7). \n\n   Let me define the prefix array differently: \n        Let prefix[0] = 0\n        prefix[1] = a0\n        prefix[2] = a0+a1\n        prefix[3] = a0+a1+a2\n\n        Then the sum from i to j is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n        For i=0, j=0: a0 = prefix[1]-prefix[0] = 3-0=3 -> correct.\n        For i=0, j=1: a0+a1 = prefix[2]-prefix[0]=7-0=7 -> correct.\n        For i=0, j=2: 3+4+7=11 -> correct.\n\n        For i=1, j=2: a1+a2 = prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 11-3=8 -> but 4+7=11, not 8.\n\n   Why is this happening? \n\n        prefix[3] = 3+4+7 = 11\n        prefix[1] = 3\n        So 11-3 = 8, but we want the sum from index1 to index2, which is 4+7=11.\n\n   The issue is that the prefix array is built such that prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (from index0 to index i-1). \n\n   Therefore, to get the sum from index i to index j (inclusive), we should do:\n\n        sum = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]\n\n   But in our example, j=2 (last index we want) and i=1 (first index we want). \n\n        Then the sum from index1 to index2 is prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 11-3=8.\n\n   But 8 is the sum of the first 3 elements minus the first 1 element, which is the entire array without the first element. However, the entire array without the first element is 4+7=11? \n\n   Wait, no: \n        Entire array: [3,4,7] -> without the first element [3] we get [4,7] and the sum is 11.\n\n   But 11 is not 8.\n\n   I see the confusion: the prefix array is defined as:\n\n        prefix[0] = 0\n        prefix[1] = a0\n        prefix[2] = a0+a1\n        prefix[3] = a0+a1+a2\n\n   Then the sum from index1 to index2 is a1+a2. \n\n   How to express a1+a2? \n        a1+a2 = (a0+a1+a2) - a0 = prefix[3] - prefix[1] \n\n   But wait, prefix[1] is a0, so yes. Then 11-3=8, but 4+7 is 11, not 8.\n\n   There's a contradiction.\n\n   Let me recast the prefix array definition:\n\n        We usually define prefix[i] = sum of the first i elements, i.e., from index0 to index i-1.\n\n        Then the sum from index i to j (0-indexed) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n        Example: \n            i=0, j=0: prefix[1]-prefix[0] = 3-0=3 -> correct.\n            i=0, j=1: prefix[2]-prefix[0]=7-0=7 -> correct.\n            i=1, j=1: prefix[2]-prefix[1]=7-3=4 -> correct (a1=4)\n            i=1, j=2: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=11-3=8 -> but we want 4+7=11.\n\n   But wait, the indices: \n        We have three days: \n            Day0: 3\n            Day1: 4\n            Day2: 7\n\n        The window starting at index1 (day1) for two days: day1 and day2 -> that is indices1 to 2.\n\n        Then the sum should be 4+7=11.\n\n        How do we get 11 using prefix?\n            We need to get the sum from index1 to index2.\n\n            prefix[3] = 3+4+7 = 11\n            prefix[1] = 3\n\n            Then the sum from index0 to index2 is 11, and the sum from index0 to index0 is 3, so the sum from index1 to index2 is 11-3=8.\n\n        But 8 != 11.\n\n   Now I see: the standard way to get the sum from index i to j is prefix[j+1]-prefix[i]. \n\n        For i=1, j=2: \n            prefix[j+1] = prefix[3] = 11\n            prefix[i] = prefix[1] = 3\n            So 11-3=8.\n\n        But that is the same as the entire array without the first element? Yes, but the entire array without the first element is indeed 4+7=11? \n\n        Wait, 11 (the entire array) minus 3 (the first element) is 8, but the entire array is 3+4+7=11, and 11-3=8, but 8 is the sum of the remaining two? \n\n        Let me do the math: 3+4+7 = 11, then subtract the first element (3) leaves 8, but 4+7 is 11, so 11-3=8 is not 11.\n\n        Actually, 3+4+7=11, then 11-3=8, but 8 is the total of the rest? \n\n        The rest (without the first element) is 4+7=11? \n\n        Wait, 3+4+7=11, and if we remove 3, we get 4+7=8? \n\n        No! 4+7 is 11? \n\n        Wait, 4+7 is 11? No, 4+7 is 11? 4+7=11? \n\n        Oh! 4+7 is 11. \n\n        Then why is 11-3=8? \n\n        Let me calculate: 11-3=8, but 4+7=11, so 8 != 11.\n\n        But wait, 4+7 is 11, and 11-3 is 8, so 8 is not 11.\n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n   Let me write the numbers again:\n\n        Array: [3,4,7]\n\n        Sum from index1 to index2: 4+7 = 11.\n\n        Now, the entire array (index0 to index2) is 3+4+7=11.\n\n        Then the sum from index1 to index2 is 11 - 3 = 8? \n\n        But 11-3=8, and 8 is not 11.\n\n   Wait, wait! I think I made an arithmetic mistake: \n\n        3+4+7 is 3+4=7, then 7+7=14? \n\n        Or wait, no: 3+4=7, and then 7+7 is 14? \n\n        But wait, the array is [3,4,7] -> 3+4+7=14, not 11.\n\n        I wrote 11 earlier, but that was wrong.\n\n        Correction: \n            prefix[0]=0\n            prefix[1]=3\n            prefix[2]=3+4=7\n            prefix[3]=3+4+7=14\n\n        Then the window from index1 to index2: 4+7=11.\n\n        Using the formula: prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 14-3=11 -> correct.\n\n        So the mistake was in the initial calculation of the prefix array.\n\n        The example input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" has a sum of 14 for the entire array.\n\n        Then the two windows:\n            First window: [3,4] -> 7\n            Second window: [4,7] -> 11\n\n        Then total S = 7+11=18, and total_weeks=2, so average=18/2=9.\n\n        And the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n   So the method is correct if we build the prefix array correctly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        Build prefix array of length n+1:\n            prefix[0] = 0\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n\n        Then, total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        Then, we want to compute:\n            S = 0\n            for i in range(0, total_weeks):\n                start_index = i\n                end_index = i + k - 1\n                # The window is from i to i+k-1, so the sum is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n                S += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        Then average = S / total_weeks\n\n   However, note that the above loop runs total_weeks times, which is n-k+1, and n can be up to 200,000, so this is acceptable.\n\n   But we can also do:\n\n        S = 0\n        for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n            S += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the loop by:\n\n        S = (sum of prefix[i+k] for i in range(0, n-k+1)) - (sum of prefix[i] for i in range(0, n-k+1))\n\n   But that would require two loops and storing the prefix values, and we already have the prefix array.\n\n   Since n-k+1 can be up to 200,000, and the prefix array is of length n+1, we can do:\n\n        S = 0\n        # The terms we subtract are the prefix[0] to prefix[n-k] (total n-k+1 terms)\n        # The terms we add are the prefix[k] to prefix[n] (total n-k+1 terms)\n\n        So: S = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   But note: the indices for the first part: from k to n (inclusive) -> that's (n - k + 1) terms.\n        The second part: from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> that's (n-k+1) terms.\n\n   Then we can compute:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[i] for i in range(k, n+1))\n        part2 = sum(prefix[i] for i in range(0, n-k+1))\n        S = part1 - part2\n\n   But note: the prefix array is built from 0 to n, so we can do:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n        part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n   However, we must be cautious: \n        The prefix array is of length n+1, so:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k : n+1])   # because prefix has indices from 0 to n\n        part2 = sum(prefix[0 : n-k+1])   # because we want indices 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> that's n-k+1 elements.\n\n   But wait, in the original method, we were adding prefix[i+k] for i from 0 to n-k, which is the same as prefix[k] to prefix[n] (because when i=0, we use prefix[k]; when i=n-k, we use prefix[n-k+k]=prefix[n]).\n\n   And we were subtracting prefix[i] for i from 0 to n-k, which is prefix[0] to prefix[n-k].\n\n   So:\n\n        S = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   This is equivalent.\n\n   However, we can compute the two parts by slicing the prefix list and summing.\n\n   But note: the list prefix has length n+1, and k and n-k+1 are within bounds.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k:])   # from index k to the end (index n)\n        part2 = sum(prefix[:total_weeks])   # from index0 to index total_weeks-1, which is n-k (because total_weeks = n-k+1, so last index is n-k)\n\n        Then S = part1 - part2\n\n   However, note: \n        prefix[k:] is from index k to n (inclusive) -> that's n - k + 1 elements? \n            Number of elements from k to n (inclusive) is n - k + 1, which is total_weeks.\n\n        Similarly, prefix[:total_weeks] is from index0 to index total_weeks-1, which is from 0 to n-k (since total_weeks = n-k+1, then total_weeks-1 = n-k).\n\n   So this is correct.\n\n   But note: the two methods are equivalent, but the first method (using a loop) is more straightforward.\n\n   Considering performance: \n        Using two slices and two sums might be O(n) and we are already building the prefix array in O(n). \n        However, the slice operations and the sum() function will traverse the entire segment, so the total work is O(n) for each part.\n\n        But note: the two slices together are about 2*(n) operations, which is acceptable for n=200000.\n\n   But wait, we can also do without building the prefix array for the entire sum? \n\n   Actually, we built the prefix array in O(n). Then the two sums are:\n\n        part1: from k to n -> number of elements: n - k + 1, which is about 200000 - k + 1, worst-case k=1 -> 200000 elements.\n        part2: from 0 to n-k -> number of elements: n-k+1, which is about 200000-1+1=200000.\n\n        So worst-case we are doing two passes of about 200000 elements, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says n can be up to 200000, and 200000*2 is 400000, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But we can also do the first method (loop) which is one pass of 200000 elements.\n\n   I'll choose the direct loop for clarity and because we are already building the prefix array.\n\n   However, the problem states that the answer must be with absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n   We'll output the average as a float with formatting.\n\n   Example code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Build prefix array of length n+1\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        # If total_weeks is 0, then n < k, but the problem states k<=n, so we don't need to handle that.\n\n        S = 0\n        for i in range(total_weeks):\n            # Each window: from i to i+k-1, so the next index is i+k, so the sum is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n            S += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        average = S / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the average to have 10 decimal places as in the example.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   Let me test with the example \"3 2\\n3 4 7\":\n\n        n=3, k=2, arr=[3,4,7]\n        prefix = [0,3,7,14] (because 3, 3+4=7, 3+4+7=14)\n\n        total_weeks = 3-2+1=2\n\n        i=0: S += prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7-0=7\n        i=1: S += prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 14-3=11\n\n        S=7+11=18\n        average=18/2=9.0\n\n        Output: 9.0000000000\n\n   Another example: \"1 1\\n10\"\n\n        n=1, k=1, arr=[10]\n        prefix=[0,10]\n        total_weeks=1\n        i=0: S += prefix[1]-prefix[0]=10-0=10\n        average=10/1=10.0 -> 10.0000000000\n\n   Third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n        n=8, k=2, so total_weeks=7\n        We'll compute the prefix array and then the sum of 7 windows.\n\n        The windows are:\n          [1,2] -> 3\n          [2,4] -> 6\n          [4,100000] -> 100004\n          [100000,123] -> 100123\n          [123,456] -> 579\n          [456,789] -> 1245\n          [789,1] -> 790\n\n        Then S = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n          3+6=9\n          9+100004=100013\n          100013+100123=200136\n          200136+579=200715\n          200715+1245=201960\n          201960+790=202750\n\n        Then average=202750/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        The example output: 28964.2857142857\n\n        So we output: {:.10f} -> 28964.2857142857\n\n   However, let me check the example input: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n        Our method: \n            prefix[0]=0\n            prefix[1]=1\n            prefix[2]=1+2=3\n            prefix[3]=3+4=7\n            prefix[4]=7+100000=100007\n            prefix[5]=100007+123=100130\n            prefix[6]=100130+456=100586\n            prefix[7]=100586+789=101375\n            prefix[8]=101375+1=101376\n\n        Then for i=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 3-0=3\n        i=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=7-1=6\n        i=2: prefix[4]-prefix[2]=100007-3=100004\n        i=3: prefix[5]-prefix[3]=100130-7=100123\n        i=4: prefix[6]-prefix[4]=100586-100007=579\n        i=5: prefix[7]-prefix[5]=101375-100130=1245\n        i=6: prefix[8]-prefix[6]=101376-100586=790\n\n        Then S=3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 202750\n\n        average=202750/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        S = 0\n        for i in range(total_weeks):\n            S += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n        average = S / total_weeks\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   However, note: the above loop runs total_weeks (which is n-k+1) times, and each iteration does a constant-time operation.\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   But note: the problem says n can be up to 200000, and k from 1 to n. The worst-case total_weeks is n-k+1, which is at most 200000.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also use the two-sum method with slicing, which is:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n        part2 = sum(prefix[:total_weeks])\n        S = part1 - part2\n\n   But note: the two-sum method is exactly the same, and we can do:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n        part2 = sum(prefix[:total_weeks])\n        S = part1 - part2\n        average = S / total_weeks\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   This is also acceptable and perhaps more concise.\n\n   But note: the two-sum method uses two slices and two sum operations. The first slice is from k to the end, which is n-k+1 elements, and the second is from 0 to total_weeks-1 (which is n-k+1 elements). \n\n   The total number of elements summed is (n-k+1) + (n-k+1) = 2*(n-k+1). \n\n   In worst-case, k=1, then n-k+1 = n, so 2*n, which is acceptable for n=200000.\n\n   Both methods are O(n). We can choose either.\n\n   However, the direct loop method is more explicit and we are already iterating the windows. \n\n   But the two-sum method is also clear.\n\n   Since the problem constraints are up to 200000, both will run in acceptable time.\n\n   I'll choose the two-sum method for brevity.\n\n   However, note: the two-sum method requires building the entire prefix array and then two large slices. \n\n   The direct loop method does one pass to build the prefix array and then one pass (over the windows) to compute S.\n\n   The two-sum method does one pass to build the prefix array and then two separate passes (each of which is about half the array in the worst-case? Actually, the two slices together cover the entire array? \n\n        The prefix array has n+1 elements (0 to n).\n        The first slice: from k to n -> n - k + 1 elements.\n        The second slice: from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> n-k+1 elements.\n\n        The entire array is from ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible weeks in his sleep records. A week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks in the given `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous subarrays (weeks) of length `k` in an array of `n` integers. Each element in the array represents the sleep time on a particular day.\n2. **Intuition**: The key insight is to use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum array allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each window of size `k`, the sum can be derived from the prefix sum array by subtracting the prefix value at the start of the window from the prefix value at the end of the window plus one.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: Building the prefix sum array takes O(n) time. Calculating the sum for each window also takes O(n) time since there are `n - k + 1` windows. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n   - **Space Complexity**: The prefix sum array requires O(n) space, which is optimal for this problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n    part2 = sum(prefix[:total_weeks])\n    S = part1 - part2\n    average = S / total_weeks\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), followed by an array of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix sum array is built such that `prefix[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array. This allows efficient calculation of subarray sums.\n3. **Sum Calculation for All Weeks**: The total sum of sleep times for all weeks is computed by summing the relevant segments of the prefix array. Specifically, `part1` is the sum of the suffix starting from index `k`, and `part2` is the sum of the prefix up to index `n - k`. The difference between these parts gives the total sum of all weekly sleep times.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is obtained by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the prefix sum array to minimize repeated calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
