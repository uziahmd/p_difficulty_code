He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, note: we are given m and we want to find n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing. However, it doesn't increase by one each time. For example, at n=5, f(5)=1; at n=10, f(10)=2; but then from 25 to 29, the zeros jump from 6 to 6 (for 25: f(25)=6, f(26)=6, ... until 29, then at 30: f(30)=7).\n\n Therefore, for a fixed m, we are looking for an interval [a, b] such that for all n in [a, b], f(n) = m, and then output all n in that interval.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 1 -> Output: 5,6,7,8,9 (so 5 numbers)\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. But note: we want exactly m.\n    Actually, we need to find:\n        Let L(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m? Actually, we want the smallest n such that f(n) = m, and then the largest n such that f(n) = m.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can do:\n        Let x = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(x) == m? Not necessarily, because sometimes we might have skipped m.\n\n    Actually, we can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, we can also find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1, and then the numbers with exactly m zeros are from n0 to n1-1, where:\n        n0 = smallest n with f(n) >= m and then check if f(n0) is exactly m or not?\n    But note: it is possible that there is no n with f(n)=m? Then we output 0.\n\n 3. However, note the problem: the trailing zeros function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases in steps. So for a given m, there is an interval [L, R] such that for all n in [L, R], f(n) = m, and for n < L, f(n) < m, and for n > R, f(n) >= m+1 (if m+1 exists, but if m is the maximum we don't know).\n\n 4. How to compute the lower bound?\n        We want the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n        Then, we want the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n\n        Then, the numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros are the integers from L to R-1.\n\n    But wait: what if there is no n with f(n)=m? Then L would be the smallest n with f(n)>=m, which might have f(L)=m, but then R might be the next jump. However, note that the function f(n) is defined for all n and increases only at multiples of 5,25,etc. So if we set m=0, then n from 1 to 4 have 0 zeros. Then for m=0, we would get L=0? But note positive integers n, so n>=1.\n\n    Actually, we must consider that the problem states positive integers n.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low_bound.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high_bound.\n\n        Then, the numbers n that satisfy the condition are all n from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n        However, note: it is possible that there is no n with f(n)=m? Then we would have low_bound and then high_bound = low_bound? Actually, no: because if there is no n with f(n)=m, then the smallest n with f(n)>=m would be the same as the smallest n with f(n)>=m+1? That is not true because the function jumps from a value less than m to a value greater than or equal to m, but then the next jump might be at a higher value.\n\n        Example: m=0. Then the smallest n with f(n)>=0 is 0? But our n is positive. So we must consider n>=1.\n\n        Actually, let's define:\n\n            f(0)=0, but n positive so we start at 1.\n\n        We can define a function to calculate the trailing zeros for n.\n\n        How to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m?\n\n            We can use binary search. The upper bound for n: since f(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... <= n/4, so n >= 4*m. But to be safe, we can set an upper bound as 5*m (or 5*m + something) because sometimes the function grows slower.\n\n        However, note m can be up to 100000, so we cannot iterate from 1 to 5*m (which is 500000) for each test? But we are doing two binary searches, so we can set the high bound appropriately.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n        Then, we want to find the minimal n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n        Similarly for m+1.\n\n        Then, if the interval [low_bound, high_bound-1] is empty (i.e., low_bound >= high_bound), then there are no numbers.\n\n        But note: we must consider that the problem says \"exactly m\", so if the smallest n with f(n)>=m is such that f(low_bound) != m, then we must adjust? Actually, no: because the function is non-decreasing and integer-valued, if we define:\n\n            low_bound = smallest n with f(n) >= m\n            high_bound = smallest n with f(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then for any n in [low_bound, high_bound-1], we have f(n) >= m and f(n) < m+1, so f(n)=m.\n\n        But wait: what if there is a gap? Actually, the function f(n) increases by more than 1 at some points? \n\n        Example: n=25: f(25)=6, then n=26: still 6, ... until n=29: still 6, then n=30: f(30)=7.\n\n        So when m=6, then:\n            low_bound = 25 (because f(25)=6 >=6)\n            high_bound = smallest n with f(n)>=7 -> 30.\n\n        Then the numbers are from 25 to 29.\n\n        Example: m=5. What is the smallest n such that f(n)>=5?\n            We know:\n                n=20: trailing_zeros(20) = 4 (floor(20/5)=4, floor(20/25)=0)\n                n=21: 4\n                ...\n                n=24: 4\n                n=25: 6 -> so low_bound=25.\n\n            Then we look for smallest n with f(n)>=6? Actually, wait: we want the smallest n with f(n)>=6, which is 25, and then for m+1=6, so high_bound = smallest n with f(n)>=6? Then we already have 25.\n\n            Then the interval is [25, 25) -> empty. But wait, m=5: we want exactly 5 zeros. However, at n=25, we have 6 zeros. So actually, there is no n with exactly 5 zeros.\n\n            Therefore, we should output nothing for m=5.\n\n        So the method is correct: the interval [low_bound, high_bound-1] is the set of n with f(n)=m.\n\n        Now, how to compute low_bound and high_bound?\n\n            We can use binary search for the lower bound:\n\n            For a given m, we want to find the smallest n (n>=1) such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n            We set:\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * m   (since at most 5*m, because the number of zeros is roughly n/5+n/25+... which is less than n/4, so n needs to be at least 4*m, but to be safe, 5*m is enough? Actually, worst-case: when n is just below a power of 5, the zeros count might be less than n/5+n/25+... but we can set high to 5*m + 100, but note m can be 100000, so 5*m is 500000, which is acceptable for binary search? Actually, we are doing two binary searches, each about O(log(500000)) which is about 20 steps, and each step we compute trailing_zeros(n) which is O(log_5(n)) so about 7-8 iterations per n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set a higher bound: \n\n                We know that n must be at least 4*m (because the zeros count is about n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/4, so if n=4*m, then zeros < m? Actually, we need zeros>=m, so n must be at least around 4*m? Or maybe 5*m is safe.\n\n            However, consider: the worst-case is when we have a lot of factors of 5 (like n being a multiple of high powers of 5). But we can set the high bound to 5*m (and then if necessary, extend by a factor). \n\n            Actually, we can set high = 5 * (m + 1) * 5? No, let me think: the maximum n we might need is at most 5*(m+1) * something? Actually, the standard formula for the minimal n for which zeros >= m is known to be in the order of 5*m. \n\n            We can set:\n\n                low_bound_search for m: \n                    low = 0\n                    high = 5 * (m+1)   # because if m is large, say 100000, then 5*(m+1)=500005, which is acceptable.\n\n            Similarly for m+1.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                if n == 0:\n                    return 0\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n            def find_lower_bound(m):\n                if m == 0:\n                    return 0   # but note: positive integers, so we return 0 meaning n=0 is the smallest, but then we must consider positive so we might start from 1. However, our problem says positive integers, so for m=0, we want n from 1 to 4. But note: m>=1 in input, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * (m+1) * 5   # overestimating? Actually, we can set high = 5 * (m+1) * 5 is too high? Maybe we can set high = 5 * (m+1) * 2, but better to use a while loop to set high until trailing_zeros(high) >= m.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                low, high = 0, 5 * (m+1)   # 5*(m+1) is an upper bound: because if n=5*(m+1), then trailing_zeros(n) >= (5*(m+1))/5 + (5*(m+1))/25 + ... = (m+1) + (m+1)/5 + ... > m+1, so definitely >= m.\n\n                But wait, we want to find the smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n                So:\n\n                    while low < high:\n                        mid = (low+high)//2\n                        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                            low = mid+1\n                        else:\n                            high = mid\n\n                Then return low\n\n            Then, let low_bound = find_lower_bound(m)\n            Then, let high_bound = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n            Then, the numbers are from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            Then, we output:\n                k = (high_bound - low_bound)\n                Then, if k>0, we output the list of numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            But note: the problem requires to print first k, then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n            However, if k==0, then we just output 0 and nothing else.\n\n        Example: m=1\n\n            find_lower_bound(1): \n                We need smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n)>=1.\n\n                n=0:0, n=1:0, n=2:0, n=3:0, n=4:0, n=5:1 -> so returns 5.\n\n            find_lower_bound(2): smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n)>=2 -> n=10: trailing_zeros(10)=2 -> returns 10.\n\n            Then the interval is [5, 10) i.e., n=5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Output: \n                5\n                5 6 7 8 9\n\n        Example: m=5\n\n            find_lower_bound(5): smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=5.\n\n                We know that at n=20: trailing_zeros(20)=4 -> not enough.\n                n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so returns 25.\n\n            find_lower_bound(6): smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=6 -> n=25:6 -> returns 25.\n\n            Then the interval is [25,25) -> empty.\n\n            Output: \n                0\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that m>=1 and up to 100000. We must ensure that our binary search is efficient.\n\n        The function trailing_zeros(n) runs in O(log_5(n)), which is about 7-8 iterations for n up to 500000 (which is about 5*100000, so log5(500000) is about 7).\n\n        We do two binary searches, each with about log2(500000) ~ 19 steps, and each step does 7 operations, so total operations around 2 * 19 * 7 ~ 266, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the input m can be up to 100000, so we set high = 5*(m+1) which is 500005. Then the binary search will run about 19 steps (log2(500005) is about 19). So it's efficient.\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem input is from stdin, and the example input is provided as a string, but the problem says:\n\n            Input: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000)\n\n        So we read m.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read m.\n\n            If we found that there are no numbers (k=0), then we output \"0\".\n\n            Else, we output k and then the k numbers.\n\n        However, note: the numbers can be very many. The interval [low_bound, high_bound-1] can be large.\n\n        How large can the interval be?\n\n            The zeros function increases by more than one sometimes (like from 25 to 30, the zeros jump from 6 to 7, so the interval for m=6 is [25,29] which is 5 numbers). But what about m=0? Not applicable.\n\n            Actually, the maximum length of the interval for a given m is 4? Because the zeros only change at multiples of 5. And between two multiples of 5, the zeros remain constant. But actually, the zeros function only changes when n is a multiple of 5, but the jump is the number of factors of 5 in that n. \n\n            However, note: the zeros function only increases at multiples of 5, and the amount of increase is the number of times 5 divides that number. \n\n            Example: n=25: adds two factors (since 25=5^2) so the zeros increase by 2 (from 4 to 6). Therefore, the zeros function can jump by more than one.\n\n            But the interval for a fixed m might be short. In fact, the zeros function is constant between multiples of 5. So the length of the interval for a fixed m is at most 4 (since after a multiple of 5, the next multiple is at least 5 away, but the zeros may jump by more than one so the same m might appear in a consecutive block of 4 numbers? Actually, no: the zeros function increases only when n is a multiple of 5, and then the zeros value becomes a new value. Therefore, for a fixed m, the n's that yield m must lie between two consecutive multiples of 5 (the last multiple that pushed the zeros to m and the next multiple that pushes it beyond m). \n\n            Actually, the zeros function is constant on intervals that do not contain a multiple of 5. But the zeros function is defined for every n, and it increases only at multiples of 5. So the zeros value remains the same for 4 consecutive numbers (unless a multiple of 5 is reached). \n\n            Therefore, the interval for a fixed m is at most 4 numbers? But wait, in the example m=1: the interval is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Why? Because the zeros become 1 at n=5 and stay 1 until n=9, then at n=10 it becomes 2.\n\n            Why does it stay for 5 numbers? Because the next multiple of 5 is 10, and the zeros at 10 is 2, so from 5 to 9 (inclusive) we have 5 numbers.\n\n            The zeros function increases by the number of factors of 5 in n, so the zeros at n=5 is 1, then at n=10 is 2, so the zeros function jumps from 1 to 2 at n=10.\n\n            Therefore, the zeros function is constant for a block of 5 numbers? Actually, no: the zeros function is constant for a block of numbers until the next multiple of 5. But the zeros function is computed by counting the factors of 5 in the entire factorial, so adding a number that is not a multiple of 5 doesn't add any zeros. Only when you hit a multiple of 5, you add the number of factors of 5 in that number.\n\n            The zeros function is non-decreasing and increases only at multiples of 5.\n\n            Therefore, the interval for a fixed m can be long. For example, for m=0, the interval is [1,4] (4 numbers) but m>=1.\n\n            How long can the interval be? \n\n            The zeros function increases by 1 at each multiple of 5, unless the multiple of 5 has more than one factor of 5 (then it increases by more). So the zeros function stays at a particular value m for a while. The next time the zeros increase is when the next multiple of 5 is encountered, which is at most 5 numbers away. But note: the zeros function might increase by more than one at a single step (like 25, which increases by 2). Therefore, the length of the interval for m is the distance from the last multiple of 5 that caused the zeros to become m (or the one that pushed it to m) until the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase.\n\n            Actually, the zeros function at n is:\n\n                f(n) = f(n-1) + (number of factors of 5 in n)   if n is divisible by 5, otherwise f(n)=f(n-1)\n\n            So the zeros function is constant from a multiple of 5 until the next multiple of 5. Therefore, the interval for a fixed m is the set of n from the smallest multiple of 5 that gives zeros=m to the next multiple of 5 minus one.\n\n            But note: it is possible that the zeros function jumps over m? Then the interval is empty.\n\n            Example: m=5: the zeros function jumps from 4 (at n=24) to 6 (at n=25). So 5 is skipped.\n\n            Therefore, the length of the interval for m is either 0 or 5? Not necessarily 5: because the zeros function increases by the number of factors of 5 in n, so:\n\n                When n is divisible by 5 but not 25, the increase is 1 -> then the interval for m is 5 numbers (from n to n+4).\n                When n is divisible by 25 but not 125, the increase is 2 -> then the interval for m is 25,26,27,28,29 (5 numbers) but then the zeros jump from 6 to 7 at 30 (which is divisible by 5 once, so the next jump is by 1, so the zeros at 30 is 7, and the zeros at 25 is 6, so the interval for m=6 is 5 numbers.\n\n            Actually, the zeros function is constant from a multiple of 5 (say k*5) until the next multiple of 5 (k*5+5). So the interval is always 5 numbers? But wait, what if the zeros jump by more than one at a multiple of 5? Then the same m might appear in a block of 5 numbers, even if the jump was more than one? \n\n            Example: m=6: the zeros at n=25 is 6, then at n=26,27,28,29: still 6, then at 30: 7. So the zeros function at 25 is 6, and then remains 6 until 29, which is 5 numbers.\n\n            How about if m=0? Then the zeros are 0 from n=1 to 4 (4 numbers). But m>=1, so we don't care.\n\n            Therefore, the length of the interval is either 0 or 5? \n\n            But wait, consider m=1: the zeros become 1 at n=5 and remain 1 until n=9 (which is 5 numbers). Then at n=10, zeros become 2.\n\n            So the interval length is 5 for m=1.\n\n            Consider m=2: zeros become 2 at n=10 and remain 2 until n=14 (5 numbers). Then at n=15, zeros become 3 (because 15 is divisible by 5, and 15//5=3, but wait: trailing_zeros(15)= floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3.\n\n            So the interval for m=2 is [10,14] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Now, consider m=10. The zeros function increases by the factors of 5. The next multiple of 5 after the one that gives 10 zeros might be 100 (which is divisible by 2 factors of 5, so it would jump by 2). So the zeros at n=100 is 100/5+100/25+100/125=20+4+0=24, so that doesn't help.\n\n            Actually, we are not concerned with the length of the interval, we just know that the zeros function is constant from a multiple of 5 until the next multiple of 5 (which is 5 numbers later). \n\n            Therefore, the length of the interval for m is either 0 or 5? \n\n            But wait: what if the jump is more than one? Then the zeros function might skip m, but if m is in the middle of the jump, then the interval is empty. Otherwise, the interval is 5 numbers.\n\n            However, note: the zeros function is constant between multiples of 5. The zeros function at n is determined by the cumulative factors of 5 from 1 to n. The zeros function increases only at multiples of 5, and the increase is the number of factors of 5 in that multiple.\n\n            Therefore, the zeros function is constant for 5 consecutive numbers (from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5 minus one). \n\n            So the interval for a fixed m is either empty or 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n            But wait, what if m=3? \n\n                Let's compute:\n                    n=10: zeros=2\n                    n=11:2, n=12:2, n=13:2, n=14:2, n=15:3 (because 15 has one factor of 5) -> so the zeros jump from 2 to 3 at 15.\n\n                Then the zeros for n=15,16,17,18,19: 3. Then at 20: zeros=4.\n\n                So the interval for m=3 is [15,19] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Now, what if m=4?\n\n                n=20: zeros=4 (because 20//5=4, 20//25=0) -> then the zeros from 20 to 24: 4. Then at 25: zeros=6.\n\n                So the interval for m=4 is [20,24] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Therefore, the interval length is always 5, unless the zeros function jumps over m (so the interval is empty). \n\n            However, wait: what if the jump is more than one and we are at a multiple of 25? \n\n                Example: n=24: zeros=4, n=25: zeros=6. Then m=5: interval is empty.\n\n            So the interval length is 0 or 5.\n\n            But wait, what if the zeros function increases by more than one, but the previous value was m-1 and the next is m+1? Then m is skipped, so the interval is empty.\n\n            However, what if the zeros function increases by 2 and we are at m=1? \n\n                Example: n=25: zeros=6. Then the zeros at 25 is 6, so the previous value at 24 is 4. Then m=5 is skipped, but m=6 is not skipped? Actually, the zeros function at 25 becomes 6, so the interval for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers). \n\n            Therefore, the interval is always 5 consecutive numbers, unless m is skipped (then 0).\n\n            But wait: what if the jump is more than one and the target m is in the middle? Then the interval is empty.\n\n            How to compute the interval without knowing the length? We are using binary search to find the boundaries.\n\n            We have:\n\n                low_bound = smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n)>=m\n                high_bound = smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n)>=m+1\n\n            Then the numbers are from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            The length is (high_bound - low_bound). \n\n            Example: m=5 -> low_bound=25, high_bound=25 -> length=0.\n\n            Example: m=1 -> low_bound=5, high_bound=10 -> length=5.\n\n            Example: m=6 -> low_bound=25, high_bound=30 -> length=5.\n\n            Example: m=4 -> low_bound=20, high_bound=25 -> length=5.\n\n            Example: m=0 -> but m>=1, so skip.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply:\n\n                k = high_bound - low_bound\n\n                Then output k, and then the k numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            But note: k can be 0, then we output 0.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", and our low_bound and high_bound are computed from n=0 upward. But if m>=1, then the smallest n we consider is at least 5 (for m=1). \n\n        But wait: what if m is very large? Our binary search sets high=5*(m+1) which is 5*m+5, and then we compute trailing_zeros for numbers up to 5*(m+1). \n\n        The trailing_zeros function for n=5*(m+1) is:\n\n            trailing_zeros(5*(m+1)) = (5*(m+1))//5 + (5*(m+1))//25 + ... = (m+1) + (m+1)//5 + ... \n\n        This is at least m+1, so it satisfies the condition.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            Read m.\n\n            Define trailing_zeros(n) function.\n\n            Define find_lower_bound(m): returns the smallest n (nonnegative) with trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n            Then, low_bound = find_lower_bound(m)\n            high_bound = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n            Then, k = high_bound - low_bound\n\n            If k>0:\n                print(k)\n                Then, if k is large (like 5) we can output the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n            But note: the interval is contiguous and of length k, so we can output:\n\n                print(\" \".join(str(i) for i in range(low_bound, high_bound)))\n\n            However, k can be 0, then we just output 0.\n\n        One more edge: m=100000.\n\n            We are setting high_bound = 5*(m+1) = 500005, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let me test with m=1, m=5, m=0 (but m>=1 so we skip m=0).\n\n        But wait, what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to handle.\n\n        However, note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import sys\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                if n == 0:\n                    return 0\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n            def find_lower_bound(m):\n                # If m is 0, then we return 0. But m>=1, so we don't need to handle 0.\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * (m+1)   # This is an upper bound: n=5*(m+1) has trailing_zeros >= m+1 (actually much more, but we are safe)\n\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                        low = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid\n\n                return low\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            if not data:\n                exit(0)\n            m = int(data[0])\n\n            low_bound = find_lower_bound(m)\n            high_bound = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n            k = high_bound - low_bound\n            if k == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                print(k)\n                # Generate the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1\n                # Since k might be large, but note: the maximum k is 5 (as we saw the interval is at most 5 numbers) OR is it?\n\n                Wait, is the interval always 5 numbers? \n\n                Actually, no: consider m=0 (but m>=1) and m=1,..., but wait, the zeros function is constant for 5 numbers? \n\n                But note: the zeros function is constant for a block of 5 numbers? \n\n                Actually, the zeros function is constant from a multiple of 5 (say n0) until the next multiple of 5 (n0+5). So the length is 5.\n\n                But wait, what if the next multiple of 5 is more than 5 away? Actually, the next multiple of 5 is always 5 away (in terms of index). \n\n                However, what if we have a jump at a multiple of 5? The zeros function increases at multiples of 5, and then remains constant until the next multiple of 5.\n\n                Therefore, the interval for a fixed m (if exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n                But wait: what if the zeros function increases by more than one at a multiple of 5? Then the zeros value at that multiple of 5 is increased by more than one, but the zeros function is still constant for the next 4 numbers (until the next multiple of 5). So the interval for m is 5 numbers, unless the jump skips m.\n\n                Example: m=5 is skipped because the jump from 24->25 is from 4 to 6.\n\n                But the interval for m=6 is 5 numbers (25 to 29). \n\n                Therefore, the length is always 5 when the interval exists.\n\n                However, wait: what if m=0? Then the interval is from 1 to 4 (4 numbers). But m>=1, so we don't care.\n\n                For m>=1, the smallest n is at least 5, and then the interval is 5 numbers. \n\n                But wait, what if m is the maximum? \n\n                Example: m=100000. Then the zeros function at n=5*(m+1) is already more than 100000, so we set high_bound to some n in [0,500005] such that trailing_zeros(high_bound) >= 100001.\n\n                Then the interval [low_bound, high_bound-1] is the set of n with exactly 100000 zeros.\n\n                But note: the zeros function is constant for 5 numbers. So the length is 5.\n\n                However, wait: the zeros function increases by the number of factors of 5 in n. The next multiple of 5 after low_bound might be low_bound+5, and the zeros function at low_bound is m, and at low_bound+5 it becomes m + (number of factors of 5 in low_bound+5). \n\n                Therefore, the zeros function at low_bound is m, and at low_bound+1, low_bound+2, etc. until the next multiple of 5 (which is low_bound+5 if low_bound is a multiple of 5) is still m, and then at low_bound+5 it becomes m + (number of factors of 5 in low_bound+5).\n\n                So the interval is [low_bound, low_bound+4] (if low_bound is a multiple of 5) and the length is 5.\n\n                But what if low_bound is not a multiple of 5? \n\n                Example: m=1: low_bound=5 (which is a multiple of 5). \n\n                Example: m=2: low_bound=10 (multiple of 5).\n\n                Example: m=3: low_bound=15 (multiple of 5).\n\n                Example: m=4: low_bound=20 (multiple of 5).\n\n                Example: m=6: low_bound=25 (multiple of 5).\n\n                So the low_bound is always a multiple of 5? \n\n                Why? Because the zeros function is constant between multiples of 5, and the zeros function only increases at multiples of 5. Therefore, the smallest n achieving at least m zeros must be a multiple of 5? \n\n                Actually, no: consider m=1. The zeros function at n=5 is 1, so the smallest n is 5 (a multiple of 5). \n\n                Consider m=2: the zeros function at n=10 is 2, and before 10, the zeros were 1 (at n=9). So the smallest n with zeros>=2 is 10.\n\n                Similarly, for m=5: the zeros at n=24 is 4, and at n=25 is 6. So the smallest n with zeros>=5 is 25.\n\n                Therefore, yes, the low_bound is always a multiple of 5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as `low_bound`) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as `high_bound`) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie in the interval `[low_bound, high_bound - 1]`.\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Using binary search, we efficiently locate `low_bound` and `high_bound` without checking every number up to \\( n \\), which optimizes the solution especially for large \\( m \\) (up to 100,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    low_bound = find_lower_bound(m)\n    high_bound = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    \n    k = high_bound - low_bound\n    if k <= 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(k)\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(low_bound, high_bound)]\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n2. **find_lower_bound(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times (m + 1) \\), ensuring the upper bound is sufficiently large to cover the solution.\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes `low_bound` and `high_bound` using `find_lower_bound`, and then checks if there exists any \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) = m \\). If so, it prints the count of such \\( n \\) values followed by the values themselves in increasing order. If no such \\( n \\) exists, it simply prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, making it suitable for large values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000. The solution leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to avoid brute-force checks, ensuring optimal performance.",
