A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. Total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into 'd' slices. So total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. We have p grams of salt.\n\n For each toast, we need:\n   - nl milliliters of the drink (per toast) -> but note: each friend needs nl for a toast? \n     Actually, from the problem: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n     However, note that the toast is made per friend? Let's clarify:\n\n The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters ...\". But the toasts are being made by the group? And they all drink the same amount.\n\n Actually, the key is: each toast requires one set of ingredients that serves one friend? Or does one toast require the entire set for all friends?\n\n Let me read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n But then, if there are n friends, and they are making toasts together (each friend makes some toasts, but the same number for everyone), then for each toast that each friend makes, we need:\n\n   - drink: nl * n (because each of the n friends gets nl for that toast) ??? \n\n But wait, the example: \n   Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n   They say: Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters. Then they say it is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts.\n\n However, note: each toast requires for each friend: nl milliliters. Since there are 3 friends, one toast requires 3 * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 milliliters? \n\n But wait, the example calculation: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. That means they are considering that one toast requires only nl milliliters (which is 3) and not multiplied by n.\n\n Clarification from the example: \n   They have 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 ml (nl) for the entire group? or per friend?\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   n = 3 (number of friends)\n   k = 4, l = 5 -> total drink = 20 ml.\n   Each toast requires: \n        drink: nl = 3 ml (from the input) -> but note: the example input also includes nl and np. In the first sample, the last two numbers are 3 and 1.\n\n   Now, if one toast requires 3 ml for the entire group (meaning all friends together have one toast) then for 3 friends, one toast would require 3 ml * 1? That doesn't match because then we can do 20/3 which is about 6 toasts.\n\n   Alternatively, if one toast is defined as one serving for one friend (so each friend gets one toast at a time) then for one toast (for one friend) we need 3 ml. Then for the entire group to make one round of toasts (each friend having one toast) we would need 3 * n * 1 = 9 ml. Then with 20 ml, we could do 20 // 9 = 2 full rounds (each round being one toast per friend). Then each friend would have 2 toasts.\n\n   However, the example says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n   How did they get 6? 20 / 3 = 6.33... -> so 6 toasts (if we consider that one toast uses 3 ml in total?).\n\n   But wait: the problem states \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for a toast. So if one toast is for one friend, then one toast requires nl milliliters. Then the entire group of n friends making t toasts (each friend making t toasts) would require:\n\n        Drink: t * n * nl   ? \n\n   However, the example calculates the drink requirement as 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. This suggests that the toast count is calculated based on the entire drink supply relative to the requirement per toast (which is nl) and then divided by the number of friends? \n\n   Actually, let's think: \n\n   The goal is to have each friend make the same number of toasts. \n\n   Let x be the number of toasts each friend makes.\n\n   Then total drink needed = x * n * nl   (because each toast for a friend requires nl, and there are n friends each making x toasts, so total toasts is n*x, and each toast uses nl)\n\n   But wait, the example: n=3, nl=3, so total drink for x=2 toasts per friend: 3*2*3 = 18 ml, which is less than 20. Then why did they use 20/3?\n\n   Alternatively, if we think: the entire group is making toasts. Each toast (regardless of which friend) requires nl milliliters? Then the total toasts T that can be made is limited by the drink: T = (k*l) / (nl) [but wait, then we have to account for the fact that each friend must have the same number of toasts].\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. So if one toast is for one friend, then the drink consumption for one toast is nl. But if the group is making multiple toasts, then the total number of toasts (across all friends) is T = n * x, where x is the number of toasts per friend.\n\n   Then the constraint from drink: T * nl <= k*l   => n*x * nl <= k*l   => x <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\n   Similarly, for lime: each toast requires one slice. So total slices needed is T = n*x, and we have total slices = c*d. So x <= (c*d) / (n) [because each friend's toast requires one slice, so for n friends each having x toasts, we need n*x slices]?\n\n   Wait, no: each toast (one per friend) requires one slice. So for each friend, we need x slices. Therefore, the total slices required is n*x. And we have c*d slices. So condition: n*x <= c*d.\n\n   Similarly, for salt: each toast (each friend's toast) requires np grams. So total salt needed is n*x*np. Condition: n*x*np <= p.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum x (toasts per friend) is the minimum of:\n\n        x1 = (k * l) / (n * nl)   [from drink: since total toasts T = n*x, then drink used is n*x * nl, so x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)]\n        x2 = (c * d) / (n)         [from lime: total slices needed is n*x, so x <= (c*d) / n]\n        x3 = p / (n * np)           [from salt: total salt needed is n*x*np, so x <= p/(n*np)]\n\n   However, note: the example calculation was:\n\n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6.33 -> 6 toasts (total toasts) but then divided by n (3) to get 2 per friend.\n\n   But wait, in our formulation, the total toasts T must be an integer and must satisfy T <= (k*l)/nl, T <= (c*d) and T <= p/np.\n\n   And then x = T / n, but T must be divisible by n? Actually, we want the maximum integer x such that:\n\n        n*x <= (k*l) / nl   => x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n        n*x <= (c*d)        => x <= (c*d) / n\n        n*x <= p / np       => x <= p/(n*np)\n\n   But note: the conditions above are in terms of total toasts T = n*x.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        total_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl   # because each toast requires nl, so this gives the maximum total toasts from drink\n        total_lime_slices = c * d              # and each toast requires one slice, so total toasts cannot exceed total_lime_slices\n        total_salt_toasts = p // np            # because each toast requires np grams\n\n   Then the maximum total toasts T_max = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_slices, total_salt_toasts)\n\n   Then, since each friend must have the same number of toasts, and there are n friends, the total toasts must be divisible by n? Not necessarily, but we can only use whole toasts.\n\n   However, the problem does not require that the total toasts be divisible by n? Actually, we are to find the number of toasts each friend can make. This means we can have:\n\n        x = floor(T_max / n)   ?\n\n   But wait, that would be if we were just distributing the total toasts equally. However, we must have an integer number of toasts per friend and the total toasts must be exactly n*x.\n\n   Actually, we can use at most T_max toasts. But we cannot exceed T_max. And we want to maximize x (the number per friend) such that n*x <= T_max.\n\n   Therefore, x = floor(T_max / n)   [if we are to distribute equally]? \n\n   But note: we might have leftover toasts that are not enough for a full round? Actually, we can only use whole toasts.\n\n   However, consider: we have T_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   [Note: for drink and salt, we use integer division? But note: the drink condition: we can only use whole toasts. So the drink allows T_drink = (k*l) // nl? Actually, no: because we are using nl per toast, so we can have at most (k*l) // nl toasts (using integer division). Similarly for salt: p // np.\n\n   But wait, the example: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        T_drink = (4*5) // 3 = 20 // 3 = 6 (using integer division, but actually we can use real numbers and then take floor? Actually, we can use at most 6 toasts from drink because 7*3=21>20.\n\n        T_lime = 10*8 = 80 -> so we can have up to 80 toasts from lime.\n        T_salt = 100 // 1 = 100.\n\n        Then T_max = 6.\n\n        Then x = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n   However, what if T_max is not divisible by n? For example, if T_max=7 and n=3, then we can only have 2 toasts per friend (because 3*2=6<=7, but 3*3=9>7). So indeed we take floor(T_max/n).\n\n   But wait, is that correct? Because we are not forced to use all the toasts. We are constrained by the minimum resource. And then we distribute the total toasts (which must be a multiple of n) as evenly as possible.\n\n   Actually, the condition is: we can have at most T_max toasts. But we must assign the same number of toasts to each friend. So the maximum x (toasts per friend) is the maximum integer x such that n*x <= T_max.\n\n   So x = T_max // n   (using integer division) if we are only concerned with the total toasts? \n\n   However, note: the resources are consumed per toast. And the total toasts must be n*x. So we require:\n\n        n*x <= T_max   (where T_max = min( floor((k*l)/nl), c*d, floor(p/np) ) )\n\n   But wait, for drink and salt we are using integer division (floor) because we can't use fractions of a toast. However, the problem does not specify that the drink and salt must be used in integer toasts. It says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning we can only have integer numbers of toasts.\n\n   But note: the constraints say the numbers are positive integers and not exceeding 1000.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: \n\n        For drink: the total drink is k*l. Each toast requires nl. Then the maximum number of toasts from drink is floor(k*l / nl) if we are using integer arithmetic? But wait, we can use fractional toasts? No, because we cannot use a fraction of a toast.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning we are counting whole toasts.\n\n   So the steps:\n\n        total_toasts = min( (k * l) // nl, c * d, p // np )   ?\n\n   But wait: for lime, the condition is simply c*d (each toast requires one slice, so we can have at most c*d toasts). For drink and salt, we use integer division (floor) because we can't use a fraction of a toast.\n\n   However, note: the drink and salt might not be exact multiples. \n\n   Example: k*l = 20, nl=3 -> 20//3 = 6, but 6*3=18, so we have 2 ml left. That's okay.\n\n   Similarly, salt: p=100, np=3 -> 100//3 = 33, and 33*3=99, leaving 1 gram.\n\n   But wait, the example input for salt is np=1, so 100//1=100.\n\n   However, the example calculation for drink was 20/3=6.33..., and they took 6. So we use integer division (floor) for drink and salt.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so if we have 20 ml and nl=3, then we can only make 6 toasts (each toast requires 3 ml). \n\n   However, note: the condition for drink is: total toasts T must satisfy T * nl <= k*l. The maximum T is floor(k*l / nl) if we are only considering the drink? Actually, no: because if we have 20 ml and nl=3, then we can have 6 toasts (18 ml) and 2 ml left over. But if nl=3, then we cannot use the remaining 2 ml for a toast.\n\n   So the maximum toasts from drink is floor(k*l / nl) is not correct if we are using integer division? Actually, we can use:\n\n        T_drink = (k * l) // nl   [if we are doing integer division, then we are taking the floor]\n\n   But wait, in Python, when we do floor division for positive numbers, it's the same as math.floor.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the numbers are positive.\n\n   But here's an alternative: we can compute the maximum total toasts as:\n\n        T_drink = (k * l) // nl   (if nl divides k*l, then it's exact, otherwise we lose the remainder)\n\n   But wait, the condition is T_drink = floor((k*l) / nl) -> yes.\n\n   Similarly, for salt: T_salt = p // np\n\n   For lime: T_lime = c * d   (each toast requires one slice, so no division)\n\n   Then T_max = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n   Then the answer is T_max // n   (since we need n*x <= T_max, and we want the maximum integer x, which is floor(T_max/n))\n\n   However, wait: the example uses T_max=6, then 6//3=2.\n\n   But let me test with the second example:\n\n        Input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        T_drink = (100*10) // 4 = 1000 // 4 = 250\n        T_lime = 1 * 19 = 19\n        T_salt = 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        T_max = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n\n        Then x = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 5*3=15 <= 19, and 5*4=20>19)\n\n        Output: 3 -> matches.\n\n   Third example:\n\n        Input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n        T_drink = (1000*1000) // 50 = 1000000 // 50 = 20000\n        T_lime = 25*23 = 575\n        T_salt = 1 // 1 = 1\n\n        T_max = min(20000, 575, 1) = 1\n\n        x = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        Output: 0 -> matches.\n\n   But wait, let me check with another example: if T_max is 10 and n=3, then 10//3=3 (because 3*3=9<=10, but 3*4=12>10). That is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for each resource is:\n\n        Drink: T_drink = (k*l) // nl   (this is the maximum toasts from drink, because each toast uses nl and we can't use partial toasts)\n\n        Lime: T_lime = c*d   (each toast requires one slice, so maximum toasts is the total slices)\n\n        Salt: T_salt = p // np   (each toast requires np grams, so maximum toasts is p//np)\n\n   Then the total toasts we can make is T_max = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n   Then the number of toasts per friend is T_max // n   (since we are making T_max toasts in total and we have n friends, each friend gets T_max//n toasts, and we can't exceed that because we require the same number for everyone and we are using integer arithmetic).\n\n   However, note: the condition for drink and salt is that the total toasts must be T_max, and we are using integer division to compute the maximum toasts from those resources.\n\n   But wait: the drink condition: the total toasts cannot exceed T_drink, which is (k*l)//nl. Similarly for salt.\n\n   But note: the drink condition is: n*x * nl <= k*l   -> but wait, we have two ways:\n\n        Option 1: total toasts (T) must satisfy T <= T_drink, T <= T_lime, T <= T_salt.\n\n        Then x = T_total // n, but we are constrained by the minimum T_total (which is T_max). And then we can only have x = T_max // n.\n\n   However, there is a nuance: the drink condition in terms of per friend: the drink consumed per friend for x toasts is x * nl, and total for n friends is n*x*nl. So we require n*x*nl <= k*l.\n\n   Similarly, for lime: we require n*x <= c*d.\n\n   For salt: n*x*np <= p.\n\n   Then the constraints are:\n\n        x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)   [from drink]\n        x <= (c*d) / n        [from lime]\n        x <= p / (n*np)       [from salt]\n\n   Then x_max = min( (k*l) / (n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) )\n\n   Then we take the floor of x_max? But wait, x must be an integer.\n\n   However, note: the example calculation did:\n\n        Drink: 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> then floor(2.22)=2\n        Lime: (10*8)/3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor(26.66)=26\n        Salt: 100/(3*1)=100/3≈33.33 -> floor(33.33)=33\n\n        Then x_max = min(2,26,33)=2.\n\n   So both methods give the same result.\n\n   But which method is better?\n\n   In the first method (total toasts) we did:\n\n        T_drink = (k*l) // nl   -> 20//3=6\n        Then x = T_max // n = 6//3=2.\n\n   In the second method (per friend):\n\n        x1 = (k*l) / (n*nl) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor to 2\n        x2 = (c*d)/n = 80/3 ≈26.66 -> floor to 26\n        x3 = p/(n*np)=100/3≈33.33 -> floor to 33\n        Then x = min(2,26,33)=2.\n\n   However, note: the condition for drink in the second method is: n*x*nl <= k*l -> 3*2*3=18<=20 -> holds.\n\n   But the first method is simpler because we don't have to divide by n twice.\n\n   However, the problem is: if we use the first method, we are calculating the total toasts from the perspective of the entire group, and then dividing by n. But the total toasts must be an integer, and we are using the same integer division.\n\n   But note: the drink condition in the first method: T_drink = (k*l)//nl. Then we require n*x <= T_drink, so x <= T_drink // n.\n\n   However, is that equivalent to the condition n*x*nl <= k*l?\n\n        Condition 1: n*x <= (k*l)//nl   [using integer division]\n\n        But (k*l)//nl is the floor of (k*l)/nl.\n\n        Condition 2: n*x*nl <= k*l\n\n        These two conditions are not equivalent.\n\n        Example: k*l=20, nl=3, n=3, x=2.\n\n        Condition 1: 3*2 <= 20//3 -> 6 <= 6 -> true.\n\n        Condition 2: 3*2*3=18<=20 -> true.\n\n        Now, what if x=3? \n\n        Condition 1: 3*3=9 <= 20//3=6 -> false.\n\n        Condition 2: 3*3*3=27<=20 -> false.\n\n        Now, what if we have k*l=21, nl=3, n=3, and x=7? \n\n        Condition 1: n*x = 3*7=21 <= 21//3=7 -> 21<=7 -> false.\n\n        Condition 2: 3*7*3=63<=21 -> false.\n\n        Now, consider k*l=19, nl=3, n=3, x=2.\n\n        Condition 1: 3*2=6 <= 19//3=6 -> true.\n        Condition 2: 3*2*3=18<=19 -> true.\n\n        Now, x=3: \n        Condition 1: 3*3=9 <= 19//3=6 -> false.\n        Condition 2: 3*3*3=27<=19 -> false.\n\n        Now, consider k*l=18, nl=3, n=3, x=2 and x=3.\n\n        Condition 1: for x=2: 6<=18//3=6 -> true; x=3: 9<=6 -> false.\n        Condition 2: x=2: 18<=18 -> true; x=3: 27<=18 -> false.\n\n        Now, consider k*l=17, nl=3, n=3, x=2.\n\n        Condition 1: 3*2=6 <= 17//3=5 -> false.\n        Condition 2: 3*2*3=18<=17 -> false.\n\n        But wait, 17//3=5 (floor division). Then condition 1 says x<=5//3=1 (since 3*x<=5 -> x<=1). Then x=1.\n\n        Condition 2: n*x*nl = 3*1*3=9<=17 -> holds.\n\n        So condition 1 (first method) is more restrictive than condition 2 (second method) in this case.\n\n        Why?\n\n        Condition 1: n*x <= (k*l)//nl   -> 3*x <= 17//3=5 -> x<= floor(5/3)=1.\n\n        Condition 2: n*x*nl <= k*l -> 9*x<=17 -> x<=17/9≈1.88 -> so x<=1.\n\n        Actually, they are equivalent? \n\n        We have: n*x*nl <= k*l   <=>   x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n        Condition 1: n*x <= (k*l)//nl   -> x <= ((k*l)//nl) / n\n\n        But note: (k*l)//nl <= (k*l)/nl, so Condition 1 is a lower bound? Actually, no: Condition 1 is an upper bound that is tighter than Condition 2?\n\n        Let me compare:\n\n        Condition 1: x <= floor((k*l)/nl) / n   [but wait, no: condition 1 is n*x <= floor((k*l)/nl) -> x <= floor((k*l)/nl) / n, and then we take floor division? Actually, in code we do integer floor division for n*x.\n\n        Actually, in the first method we are doing:\n\n            T_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n            x = T_max // n\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            x = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n\n\n        But the condition from drink is: n*x <= (k*l)//nl   (because T_max from drink is (k*l)//nl, and we are requiring the total toasts (n*x) to be <= (k*l)//nl)\n\n        However, the actual drink requirement is: n*x*nl <= k*l.\n\n        We have two different conditions:\n\n            Condition A (first method): n*x <= (k*l)//nl   [which is equivalent to: n*x*nl <= (k*l)//nl * nl <= k*l?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the maximum number of toasts possible based on the constraints of drink, lime slices, and salt, then distribute these toasts equally among all friends.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made given the constraints of drink volume, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend. The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total milliliters of drink available (k * l).\n   - Calculating the total lime slices available (c * d).\n   - Calculating the total grams of salt available (p).\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The maximum number of toasts is constrained by the most limiting resource. For each resource, we compute the maximum number of toasts it can support:\n   - **Drink**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters, so the maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each toast requires one slice, so the maximum toasts is simply the total slices `c * d`.\n   - **Salt**: Each toast requires `np` grams, so the maximum toasts is `p // np`.\n\n3. **Distribute Toasts**: The total number of toasts is the minimum of the three values calculated above. Since each friend must make the same number of toasts, we divide the total toasts by the number of friends `n` (using integer division) to get the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    max_toasts_salt = total_salt // np\n    \n    total_max_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    \n    result = total_max_toasts // n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, salt, drink per toast, and salt per toast respectively.\n2. **Calculating Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles `k` by the milliliters per bottle `l`.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes `c` by the slices per lime `d`.\n   - **Total Salt**: Use the given `p` grams of salt.\n3. **Maximum Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Divide the total drink by the drink required per toast (`nl`), using integer division to ensure whole toasts.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Directly use the total slices since each toast requires one slice.\n   - **Salt**: Divide the total salt by the salt required per toast (`np`), again using integer division.\n4. **Determine Total Toasts**: The smallest value among the three maximum toasts determines the actual number of toasts that can be made.\n5. **Result Calculation**: Divide the total toasts by the number of friends `n` (using integer division) to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts. The result is printed as the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
