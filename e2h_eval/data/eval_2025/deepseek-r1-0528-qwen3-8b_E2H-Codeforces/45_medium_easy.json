There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament grid is arranged such that two players can only play if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's denote by f(n) the maximum number of games the winner can have in a tournament starting with n players.\n\n We can think of building the tournament in rounds. The key is to arrange the matches so that the winner can play as many games as possible.\n\n Consider:\n - In the first round, we can have as many games as possible (each game eliminates one player). But the constraint is that the winner must be able to play multiple games.\n\n How does the rule work?\n The rule says: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n This resembles a structure where players are grouped by the number of wins (or games played). \n\n However, note that the problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must win k consecutive games.\n\n The tournament must have at least k rounds? Not exactly, because the bracket might be arranged differently.\n\n But note: the entire tournament has n players. The winner must defeat k opponents, and each opponent might have come from a subtree.\n\n In fact, consider that after the winner's first game, he has 1 win and the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 wins (so the next game is allowed). Similarly, after two wins, the next opponent can have 0, 1, or 2 wins? Actually, the rule says the difference must be at most one.\n\n So, the winner's j-th game: the opponent must have between j-1 and j+1 games? Actually, when the winner is about to play his first game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1? But wait, initially everyone has 0. Then the first game: both have 0, so okay.\n\n After the first win, the winner has 1 game. Then the next opponent must have either 0 or 1? But if we want to maximize the number of games, we would set up the tournament so that the winner gets stronger opponents (with more wins) as long as the condition holds.\n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n Round 0: All players have 0 wins.\n Round 1: The winner plays one game (against someone with 0 wins). Now the winner has 1 win.\n\n Now, for the second game, the winner must face someone who has either 0 or 1 wins. But note: we can design the tournament so that the winner's next opponent comes from a side that has had one game? However, we have to eliminate as few players as possible to allow the winner to continue.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the tournament as having two types of brackets:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimum number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\n Conditions for k=0: 1 player (already the winner)\n k=1: The winner must defeat one player. But note that the tournament must have at least two players. So the minimal setup for k=1 is 2 players.\n\n For k=2: \n   - The winner must defeat two players. But note: the first opponent must have been defeated by the winner, and the second opponent must have been defeated by the winner. However, the second opponent must have either 0 or 1 win (because the winner has 1 win at the time of the second game). \n\n How do we set up the second opponent? The second opponent must have 0 or 1 win.\n\n We can set up the tournament as:\n\n   First round: two matches (if we have 4 players: A,B,C,D) but then the winner must meet the other winner. However, that gives two wins for the winner.\n\n But wait, the example: n=3 -> output is 2. So for 3 players, the winner can play 2 games.\n\n However, with 3 players: \n   One possibility: \n        Game1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins (now has 1 win)\n        Then Player1 must play against Player3. At this point, Player3 has 0 wins. The difference is 1 (which is <=1) so it's allowed.\n\n   So for 3 players, the winner (player1) plays 2 games.\n\n Now, what is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games?\n\n Let F(k) = minimum number of players required to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n Base cases:\n   F(0) = 1 (no game, the winner is already declared)\n   F(1) = 2\n\n How to get F(2)? \n   In the first round, we need to set up matches such that the winner (who will eventually play two games) gets one win and then faces an opponent that has at most one win.\n\n   Consider: \n        To have the winner play two games, we need at least one loss for the first opponent? Actually, no: the first opponent must have 0 wins (because the winner has 1 and the opponent must have between 0 and 1). Then the second opponent must have 0 or 1 wins.\n\n   But note: the second opponent must have been eliminated by someone else? Or maybe we have a structure:\n\n        We can have:\n          First round: the winner (player1) plays against one player (player2) -> player1 wins (now has 1 win). Then we need to have a second round: player1 must play against a second opponent (player3). But then we need to account for how player3 got to have 0 wins? Because if we only have three players, then in the first round we cannot have two separate matches (since 3 is odd). \n\n   Actually, we can arrange the tournament arbitrarily (the grid is not fixed). The rule only constrains the pairing by the number of wins.\n\n   We can use a recursive way:\n\n   To have the winner play k games, we can think that the tournament is built by:\n\n   - The winner must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must have been the winner of a subtree.\n\n   In the first game, the opponent must have 0 wins. How many players does that require? At least 1 (the opponent) and that's it.\n\n   In the second game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. If we give 0 wins, then that opponent must have just started and hasn't played any game. But then that opponent didn't come from anywhere? Actually, we are constructing a minimal tournament.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the following:\n\n   Let F(k) = the minimal number of players to have a tournament with k games for the winner.\n\n   The tournament for k games can be broken as:\n\n     - In the first game, the winner defeats an opponent that has won i games (where i can be 0 or 1, but we are trying to minimize the total players so we choose the smallest possible i).\n\n   Actually, the rule allows the next opponent to have up to one more win than the winner's current wins? But wait, at the moment of the second game, the winner has 1 win. The opponent must have either 0, 1, or 2? No, the rule says \"differ by no more than one\", so the opponent must have between 0 and 2? Actually, the rule is applied at the moment of the match: the number of games the opponent has already played (which is the same as the number of wins, since they haven't lost) must differ by at most one from the winner's current number of games (which is 1). So the opponent can have 0, 1, or 2 wins.\n\n   However, to minimize the total number of players, we want to use as few as possible. So we choose the opponent with the least number of wins.\n\n   But note: the opponent must have won all his games, and the number of wins is the number of games he has played.\n\n   Now, the entire tournament must have a structure. The winner's first opponent must have been the winner of a subtree that produced an opponent with 0 wins (so that opponent didn't play any game) OR with 1 win (then that subtree must have provided an opponent with 1 win) OR with 2 wins.\n\n   However, to minimize the total players, we choose the option that requires the fewest players.\n\n   Actually, we can define:\n\n     Let F(k) = minimal number of players to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n     Then, the winner must defeat k opponents. Each of these opponents must have been the winner of a tournament that produced a player with a certain number of wins (and the wins of the opponent must be within [current_winner_wins-1, current_winner_wins+1] at the moment of the match). But note: the matches are scheduled arbitrarily, so we can choose the order.\n\n   However, there is a known recurrence for similar problems (like minimizing the number of players to achieve k wins):\n\n     F(0) = 1\n     F(1) = 2\n     F(2) = 3   (but wait, with 3 players: we can have two games for the winner? Actually, the example says n=3 -> answer=2)\n\n   But wait: the problem is not asking for the minimal n for which the winner can have k games, but given n, what is the maximum k (number of games) the winner can have.\n\n   Alternate approach: let g(n) be the maximum number of games the winner can have.\n\n   We can also think: what is the maximum k such that F(k) <= n?\n\n   How to compute F(k)?\n\n   Consider: to have k games for the winner, we need:\n\n     - The winner must defeat k opponents.\n\n     - The i-th opponent (when the winner has i-1 wins) must have a number of wins w_i such that |w_i - (i-1)| <= 1.\n\n     But note: the opponent's wins are the result of a sub-tournament. And the minimal number of players required to produce an opponent with w wins is F(w).\n\n   However, we can also consider that the entire tournament can be built by combining subtrees.\n\n   Known similar problem: \"The minimum number of players to have a champion with k wins\" is often solved by:\n\n        F(0) = 1\n        F(1) = 2\n        F(2) = 3\n        F(3) = 5   (because the champion must beat an opponent with 0,1, or 2 wins. To minimize the total, we choose the opponent with 1 win, because then the opponent requires F(1)=2 players. Then the entire structure: the champion's first opponent (with 1 win) must have beaten one player, so we have 1 (champion) + 2 (opponent's subtree) + (the rest of the players that the champion didn't face) but wait, actually we need to account for the entire elimination.\n\n   Actually, we can build the tournament as:\n\n        The champion must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must be the winner of a subtree. The minimal structure for the champion to have k wins is:\n\n        We can use the following recurrence for F(k):\n\n        F(k) = 1 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} F(i)\n\n        Why? Because the champion must overcome k opponents, and each opponent must have come from a minimal tournament that produces a player with a specific win count (but we don't know which one). However, note that the minimal requirement is that the entire tournament (excluding the champion) must have enough players to produce k winners (each from a distinct part). But in a standard single elimination, the champion's path requires k wins, and the minimal number of players is 2^k, but that's for a balanced bracket.\n\n   But our constraint is different: the rule allows for a more flexible structure.\n\n   Actually, from the examples:\n\n        n=2 -> k=1\n        n=3 -> k=2\n        n=4 -> k=2\n        n=10 -> k=4\n\n   Let's try to find the pattern:\n\n        k=0: F(0)=1 (n>=1)\n        k=1: F(1)=2 (n>=2)\n        k=2: F(2)=3 (n>=3) OR is it 4? But the example n=3 gives k=2, meaning that with 3 players we can have 2 games for the winner.\n\n        Actually, the minimal n for k=2 is 3.\n\n        Then k=3: What is the minimal n for the winner to play 3 games?\n\n            The winner must defeat 3 opponents.\n\n            The first opponent must have 0 or 1 win. To minimize the total players, we choose 0 wins (so minimal F(0)=1). Then the second opponent must have 0,1, or 2 wins. Again, we choose 0 wins (so F(0)=1). Then the third opponent must have 0,1,2, or 3 wins? Actually, the rule: when the winner is about to play the third game, he has 2 wins. So the opponent must have between 1 and 3 wins. But to minimize, we choose 1 win (so we need F(1)=2).\n\n            Then the total players: \n                Champion: 1\n                First opponent: 1 (from F(0))\n                Second opponent: 1 (from F(0))\n                Third opponent: 2 (from F(1))\n\n            And then we must account for the entire structure: the first opponent's wins: that one player didn't play any game, so no further players. Similarly for the second. For the third opponent, the subtree must have 2 players (the opponent and one more). So total players = 1 (champion) + 1 (first) + 1 (second) + 2 (third) = 5.\n\n            However, wait: the champion's path is independent? Actually, the tournament must be a knockout and the matches must be arranged so that the champion meets the required opponents. The above counts the players that are used to create the opponents. But note: the champion is one, and the opponents are additional players. So total players = 1 (champion) + [players in the subtrees of the opponents]. \n\n            The subtree for the first opponent (0 wins) is 1 player (the opponent itself).\n            The subtree for the second opponent (0 wins) is 1 player.\n            The subtree for the third opponent (1 win) is 2 players (the opponent and the one he defeated).\n\n            So total players = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n\n            Therefore, F(3)=5.\n\n        Then k=4: \n            The champion must defeat 4 opponents.\n\n            The first: 0 wins -> F(0)=1\n            The second: 0 or 1 -> choose 0 (minimal) -> F(0)=1\n            The third: 1 win (because the winner now has 2 wins, so the opponent must have 1 or 3? Actually, the rule: at the third game, the winner has 2 wins, so the opponent must have 1 or 3 wins. But 3 wins would require F(3)=5, which is too big. So we choose 1 win -> F(1)=2.\n            The fourth: the winner now has 3 wins, so the opponent must have 2, 3, or 4 wins. We choose 2 wins (minimal) -> F(2)=3.\n\n            Then total players = 1 (champion) + 1 (first) + 1 (second) + 2 (third) + 3 (fourth) = 8.\n\n            But wait, is that the minimal? Actually, the recurrence might be:\n\n            F(k) = 1 + F(0) + F(1) + ... + F(k-1)\n\n            However, we are not forced to take the minimal F(i) for each opponent. We must satisfy the condition that the opponent's wins are within [k-2, k] (because the winner has k-1 wins at the time of the k-th game, so the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins? Actually, no: the rule is the absolute difference must be <=1, so when the winner has x wins, the opponent must have x-1, x, or x+1 wins.\n\n            So for the k-th game (so the winner has k-1 wins), the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins.\n\n            We want to minimize the total players, so we choose the smallest possible wins for the opponent (which is k-2, then k-3, etc.). But wait, we are building the entire tournament.\n\n            Actually, the minimal tournament for k games for the winner is:\n\n                F(0) = 1\n                For k>=1: F(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + F(k-2)   ??? \n\n            Let me check:\n\n                k=0: 1\n                k=1: 1 + F(0) + F(-1) -> not defined.\n\n            Alternatively, we can define:\n\n                F(0) = 1\n                F(1) = 2\n                F(2) = 1 + F(1) + F(0) = 1+2+1 = 4   -> but above we said for k=2 we only need 3.\n\n            So that doesn't match.\n\n            Let me reexamine the structure for k=2:\n\n                The winner must defeat two opponents.\n\n                The first opponent: can be from a tournament that requires F(0)=1 (so 1 player) OR F(1)=2 (so 2 players). But we choose F(0)=1.\n\n                The second opponent: must have between 0 and 2 wins (because the winner has 1 win). We choose 0 wins (F(0)=1) OR 1 win (F(1)=2) OR 2 wins (F(2)=3). But we choose 0 wins (minimal).\n\n                Then total players = 1 (champion) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) = 3.\n\n                However, the champion must have played two games, so the two opponents must be distinct and the entire tournament must eliminate all others.\n\n                Now, for k=3:\n\n                    First opponent: choose 0 wins -> F(0)=1\n                    Second opponent: choose 0 or 1 -> choose 0 -> F(0)=1\n                    Third opponent: must have 1 or 2 or 3 wins (winner has 2 wins). We choose 1 win -> F(1)=2.\n\n                    Total players = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n\n                For k=4:\n\n                    First: 0 -> 1\n                    Second: 0 -> 1\n                    Third: 1 -> 2\n                    Fourth: must have 2 or 3 or 4 wins (winner has 3 wins). We choose 2 wins -> F(2)=3 (from above, F(2)=3) OR wait, what is F(2)? We computed F(2)=3 (for k=2, minimal players is 3). But wait, we have two definitions: \n                        F(k) is the minimal number of players to have a tournament with k wins for the winner.\n\n                    So F(2)=3.\n\n                    Then total players for k=4: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8.\n\n                Now, the recurrence: \n                    F(0)=1\n                    F(1)=2\n                    F(2)=3\n                    F(3)=5\n                    F(4)=8\n\n                That looks familiar: Fibonacci numbers.\n\n                Indeed, F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, F(4)=8, F(5)=13, etc.\n\n                The recurrence is: \n                    F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n                But wait: \n                    F(2)= F(1)+F(0) = 2+1 = 3 -> correct.\n                    F(3)= F(2)+F(1)= 3+2 =5 -> correct.\n                    F(4)=5+3=8 -> correct.\n\n                However, note that the minimal tournament for k wins requires F(k) players.\n\n                Then the problem: given n, we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n                But wait, the example: n=10 -> k=4, because F(4)=8<=10, and F(5)=13>10.\n\n                Also, n=2: k=1 because F(1)=2<=2, F(2)=3>2 -> so k=1.\n                n=3: k=2 because F(2)=3<=3, F(3)=5>3 -> so k=2.\n                n=4: k=2 because F(2)=3<=4, but F(3)=5>4 -> so k=2.\n\n                However, the example input: \n                  Input: ['2','3','4','10'] \n                  Output: ['1','2','2','4']\n\n                This matches.\n\n                But wait, let me check n=5: \n                  k=0: F(0)=1<=5 -> yes.\n                  k=1: 2<=5 -> yes.\n                  k=2: 3<=5 -> yes.\n                  k=3: 5<=5 -> yes.\n                  k=4: 8>5 -> no.\n\n                So for n=5, k=3.\n\n                However, let me verify: \n                  With 5 players, can the winner play 3 games?\n\n                  The minimal tournament for 3 games requires 5 players. So yes.\n\n                Therefore, the solution:\n\n                  Precompute the Fibonacci-like sequence until the value exceeds n (which can be up to 10**18, so we need to be careful).\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Read n.\n\n                  We know:\n                    F0 = 1\n                    F1 = 2\n\n                  Then we generate the sequence: \n                    k0: F0 = 1\n                    k1: F1 = 2\n                    k2: F2 = F1 + F0 = 3\n                    k3: F3 = F2 + F1 = 5\n                    k4: F4 = F3 + F2 = 8\n                    ...\n\n                  Then we need to find the maximum k such that F_k <= n.\n\n                However, note: the example n=10 gives k=4, and F4=8<=10, and F5=13>10, so k=4.\n\n                But note: the problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n                This k is the number of wins (games) for the winner.\n\n                So we output k.\n\n                But note: our sequence index: \n                    k0 -> 0 games: but the problem starts from n>=2, and the winner must have at least one game.\n\n                However, we start the sequence from k=0 (0 games) and k=1 (1 game). \n\n                We are counting the games. The answer is the index (the k) for which F_k is the minimal number of players for a tournament with k games.\n\n                Algorithm:\n\n                  We'll generate the sequence until the Fibonacci number exceeds n.\n\n                  But note: n can be as large as 10**18. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially (about phi^k / sqrt(5)), so the number of terms is about O(log_phi(n)) which is around 100 for n=10**18.\n\n                Code:\n\n                  Let a0 = 1, a1 = 2.\n                  Let k = 0, current = 1, next = 2.\n\n                  Then we want the maximum k such that a_k <= n.\n\n                  But note: k=0 -> 0 games, k=1 -> 1 game, etc.\n\n                  However, the problem: \n                    n=2 -> k=1 (one game)\n\n                  But wait, our sequence: \n                    k0: 1 (0 games) -> valid for n>=1, but the problem states n>=2.\n                    k1: 2 (1 game) -> valid for n>=2.\n\n                  So the maximum k for which F_k <= n is the answer.\n\n                However, note: the example n=3: \n                    F0=1<=3 -> k=0 is valid, but we are looking for maximum k. Then k=2 (F2=3<=3) is the maximum.\n\n                Therefore, we should count the k (the index) from 0, and then output the k (the number of games) which is the index.\n\n                But wait: \n                    k0: 0 games -> index0\n                    k1: 1 game -> index1\n                    k2: 2 games -> index2\n\n                However, the problem asks for the number of games. So we output the index (which is the number of games).\n\n                But note: the example outputs: \n                  Input 2 -> output 1 (index1)\n                  Input 3 -> output 2 (index2)\n\n                So we are to output the index (which is the number of games).\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let a0 = 1 (for k0: 0 games)\n                  Let a1 = 2 (for k1: 1 game)\n\n                  Then we are going to iterate and count the number of terms (including the initial ones) until the Fibonacci number exceeds n.\n\n                  Then the answer is the index (the k) of the last term that was <= n.\n\n                However, note: the index k represents the number of games. \n\n                Example: \n                  n=2: \n                    k0: a0=1<=2 -> count k0 (0 games) but we want the maximum, so we go to k1: a1=2<=2 -> then k2: a2=3>2 -> stop. Then the maximum k is 1 (index1) -> output 1.\n\n                But wait, we are storing the Fibonacci numbers for k games (the number of games is k). So we want the maximum k such that F_k <= n.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a_prevprev = 1   # F0\n                  a_prev = 2       # F1\n\n                  Then we start from k=2 and go upwards.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a = 1\n                  while a <= n:\n                      k += 1\n                      # compute next a = a_prev + a_prevprev, but we need to update the two previous terms.\n\n                But note: we have two initial terms. We want to include them.\n\n                Alternatively, we can store the sequence and then the index (which is the number of games) is the k.\n\n                However, we don't need to store all the terms, just the last two and the current k.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let a0 = 1, a1 = 2.\n                  Let k0 = 0, k1 = 1.\n\n                  We want the maximum k such that a_k <= n.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a_k = 1\n                  while a_k <= n:\n                      k += 1\n                      if k == 1:\n                          a_k = 2\n                      else:\n                          a_k = a_prev + a_prevprev   # but we need to keep track of the two previous terms.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                  a0 = 1\n                  a1 = 2\n                  k = 0\n                  while True:\n                      if a0 <= n:\n                          k = 0   # but we want the maximum k, so we are increasing k until we exceed n.\n                      Actually, we want to iterate by k.\n\n                Better:\n\n                  Let k = 0, a = 1\n                  Then we consider k=0: a=1 <= n -> then we move to k=1: a=2\n                  Then k=1: a=2 <= n -> then we move to k=2: a = 1+2=3\n\n                Code:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a_prevprev = 1   # F0\n                  a_prev = 2       # F1\n\n                  # We are going to start from k=0, then k=1, then k=2, ... until we exceed n.\n\n                  But note: we want the maximum k (number of games) such that F_k <= n.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a = 1\n                  while a <= n:\n                      k += 1\n                      if k == 1:\n                          a = 2\n                      else:\n                          a = a_prev + a_prevprev   # but then we lose the previous two.\n\n                Let me restructure:\n\n                  We know the sequence: \n                    F0 = 1\n                    F1 = 2\n                    F2 = 3\n                    F3 = 5\n                    F4 = 8\n\n                  We can iterate by k from 0 to ... and compute F_k.\n\n                  We'll do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a = 1\n                  max_games = 0   # because k=0 is always valid for n>=1, but we want the maximum.\n\n                  Then we start:\n\n                  while a <= n:\n                      max_games = k   # because at this step, F_k = a <= n, so k is achievable.\n                      if k == 0:\n                          next_a = 2\n                      elif k == 1:\n                          next_a = 3   # but wait, F2 = F1+F0 = 2+1=3\n                      else:\n                          next_a = a + prev   # but we need to keep the last two.\n\n                Actually, we need to keep two previous values.\n\n                Revised:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a0 = 1\n                  a1 = 2\n                  max_k = 0   # because k0 is valid\n\n                  Then we check a0 <= n -> then set max_k=0, then compute a1 and set k=1.\n\n                  Then check a1 <= n -> set max_k=1, then compute a2 = a0+a1 = 3, then k=2.\n\n                  Then check a2 <= n -> set max_k=2, then compute a3 = a1+a2 = 5, then k=3.\n\n                  Then check a3 <= n -> set max_k=3, then compute a4 = a2+a3 = 8, then k=4.\n\n                  Then check a4 <= n -> set max_k=4, then compute a5 = a3+a4 = 13, then k=5.\n\n                  Then if 13>n, break.\n\n                But note: the problem: n=3 -> \n                  k0: a0=1<=3 -> max_k=0\n                  k1: a1=2<=3 -> max_k=1\n                  k2: a2=3<=3 -> max_k=2\n                  k3: a3=5>3 -> break, so answer=2.\n\n                This matches.\n\n                However, we are storing two variables and updating.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let a0 = 1\n                  Let a1 = 2\n                  k0 = 0, k1=1, then k2=2, etc.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                  n = int(input().strip())\n                  a0 = 1\n                  a1 = 2\n                  # Start with k=0, then k=1, then k=2, etc.\n\n                  k = 0\n                  max_games = 0\n                  # We have to consider that k=0 is always valid (if n>=1, which it is) but the problem n>=2.\n\n                  We can iterate:\n\n                  # First, consider k=0: \n                  #   a0 = 1 <= n -> then update max_games = 0, then set k=1 and set a_prev = a1 = 2.\n\n                  Then for k>=1:\n\n                  while True:\n                      # For the current k, the Fibonacci number is stored in a variable.

Actually, we break at the beginning of the loop.\n\n                  Let me simulate for n=2:\n\n                    Initially: k=0, a=1, b=2.\n                    Check a<=2 -> yes, so set max_games=0.\n                    Then, since k==0, set a=2, b=1+2=3, then k=1.\n\n                    Then check a=2<=2 -> yes, set max_games=1.\n                    Then, since k!=0, set a=3, b=2+3=5, then k=2.\n\n                    Then check a=3<=2 -> no, so break.\n\n                    Then output max_games=1.\n\n                  For n=3:\n\n                    k=0: a=1<=3 -> max_games=0; then a=2, b=3, k=1.\n                    k=1: a=2<=3 -> max_games=1; then a=3, b=5, k=2.\n                    k=2: a=3<=3 -> max_games=2; then a=5, b=8, k=3.\n                    k=3: a=5>3 -> break, output 2.\n\n                  For n=10:\n\n                    k0: a=1<=10 -> max_games=0; then a=2, b=3, k=1.\n                    k1: a=2<=10 -> max_games=1; then a=3, b=5, k=2.\n                    k2: a=3<=10 -> max_games=2; then a=5, b=8, k=3.\n                    k3: a=5<=10 -> max_games=3; then a=8, b=13, k=4.\n                    k4: a=8<=10 -> max_games=4; then a=13, b=21, k=5.\n                    k5: a=13>10 -> break, output 4.\n\n                  This matches the example.\n\n                However, note: the problem states that the input n can be as large as 10**18. The while loop runs about 100 times (logarithmic growth) so it's efficient.\n\n                Code:\n\n                  n = int(input().strip())\n                  # If n is 1, then the tournament has 1 player, but the problem states n>=2.\n\n                  a, b = 1, 2\n                  k = 0\n                  max_games = 0\n\n                  # We are going to iterate until the Fibonacci number for k games exceeds n.\n\n                  # Note: the first term (k=0) is 1, then k=1 is 2, then k=2 is 3, etc.\n\n                  while a <= n:\n                      max_games = k   # because k games is achievable with a players, and a<=n\n                      if k == 0:\n                          a, b = b, a+b\n                      else:\n                          a, b = b, a+b\n                      k += 1\n\n                  print(max_games)\n\n                Let me test with n=1: \n                  n=1: \n                    a=1<=1 -> max_games=0; then update: k=0 -> a,b = 2, 3, then k=1.\n                    Then check a=2<=1 -> false, so break, output 0.\n\n                But the problem says n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n                However, the problem says n>=2, so n=2 is the minimum.\n\n                But wait: the example input includes 2,3,4,10.\n\n                This code passes the examples.\n\n                But note: the Fibonacci sequence we are generating is:\n\n                  k:  0 -> 1\n                  k:  1 -> 2\n                  k:  2 -> 3\n                  k:  3 -> 5\n                  k:  4 -> 8\n                  k:  5 -> 13\n\n                However, note: the minimal number of players for k games is the k-th term (starting",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each term represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that two players can only compete if their previous game counts differ by at most one. The winner must win all their games, and we need to find the maximum number of games they can play under these constraints.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves generating a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term \\( F(k) \\) represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play \\( k \\) games. The sequence starts with \\( F(0) = 1 \\) (no games played) and \\( F(1) = 2 \\) (one game). Each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms: \\( F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through the sequence, checking if the current term \\( F(k) \\) is less than or equal to the given number of players \\( n \\). The largest \\( k \\) for which \\( F(k) \\leq n \\) is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The sequence grows exponentially, so the loop runs in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time, making it efficient even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 0\n    max_games = 0\n    \n    while a <= n:\n        max_games = k\n        if k == 0:\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        else:\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(max_games)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value \\( n \\), which represents the number of players.\n2. **Sequence Generation**: Variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the first two terms of the sequence. The variable `k` keeps track of the current term index (number of games), starting from 0.\n3. **Loop Through Sequence**: The loop continues as long as the current term `a` (which corresponds to \\( F(k) \\)) is less than or equal to \\( n \\). For each iteration, `max_games` is updated to the current `k` (number of games), and `a` and `b` are updated to the next terms in the sequence.\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, the value of `max_games` is printed, which is the maximum number of games the winner can play without exceeding the given number of players.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the solution in logarithmic time relative to the input size.",
