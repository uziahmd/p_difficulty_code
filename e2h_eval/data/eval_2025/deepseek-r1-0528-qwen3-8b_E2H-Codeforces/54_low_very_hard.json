Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (with 3<=n<=10^5, 1<=a<=180)\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Important: The angle in the polygon is defined by two edges from v2: one going to v1 and the other to v3.\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n How to compute the angle at vertex v2 for two points v1 and v3?\n\n Note: The problem does not require the angle to be strictly the interior angle of the polygon, but the angle formed by the two rays from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the polygon is convex and regular. The angle at vertex v2 can be thought of in two ways:\n\n 1. The angle between the two edges (v2->v1 and v2->v3). But note: the polygon has fixed vertex positions.\n\n Observation: The entire circle is 360 degrees. The polygon divides the circle into n equal arcs (each of 360/n).\n\n But note: the angle we are measuring is not the central angle, but the angle at the vertex.\n\n Actually, the interior angle of the polygon is fixed for a regular polygon, but here we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices (so we can form angles that are not necessarily the interior angle of the polygon).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the value |angle - a| should be minimized\".\n\n Let's consider: In a regular convex n-gon, the angle at vertex v2 formed by two other vertices v1 and v3 must be either the interior angle or an exterior angle? Actually, we are free to choose any two edges from v2 (but they must lie on the boundary of the polygon). Since the polygon is convex, the angle we form at v2 will be the smaller angle between the two edges (unless we take non-adjacent ones, then we might get a reflex angle? But note: the problem doesn't specify which angle, but typically we take the smaller one. However, the problem says \"three distinct vertices\" and the angle is defined by having v1 and v3 on its sides. In a convex polygon, the angle at v2 is the one inside the polygon if we take two adjacent edges, but if we take two edges that are not adjacent, then the angle we form might be the exterior one? \n\n Actually, note: the problem does not specify that the angle must be the interior one. It just says the angle with vertex at v2 and sides containing v1 and v3. In a convex polygon, the two rays from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 will form two angles: one less than or equal to 180 and the other greater than or equal to 180. We are to consider the one that is the angle in the figure (which is the one that lies in the polygon or the one that is the smaller one?).\n\n But note: the example input \"4 67\" -> output \"2 1 3\", meaning the angle 45 degrees (which is the angle of the square's diagonal?) or wait, let me check:\n\n Example: n=4 (square), a=67. The answer chosen is \"2 1 3\". What is the angle at vertex 2 (which is the second vertex) with points 1 and 3?\n\n In a square with vertices labeled 1,2,3,4 (clockwise):\n\n Vertex 1,2,3,4: \n   Vertex 1: (x0,y0)\n   Vertex 2: (x1,y1)\n   Vertex 3: (x2,y2)\n   Vertex 4: (x3,y3)\n\n Then, at vertex 2, the two points are 1 and 3. The vectors from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the angle by using the fact that the polygon is regular.\n\n Another way: In a regular polygon, the angle between two edges from a vertex can be computed by the number of sides between the two edges.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the angle to be the interior angle of the polygon. We are allowed to pick any two edges from the vertex (but the two edges must be to two other vertices). \n\n Steps:\n\n Let's denote the center of the polygon as O. Each vertex i has a central angle of i*(360/n) from a reference.\n\n The angle at vertex v2 (which is at central angle",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex by the other two vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking potential angles without resorting to brute-force methods, which would be computationally expensive for large `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Angle Calculation**: In a regular convex n-gon, the angle formed at any vertex by two other vertices can be derived from the number of sides between them. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle at a vertex between two other vertices can be calculated using the formula involving the number of steps (k) between the vertices. The angle is given by `angle = 180 - (360 * k) / n`, where `k` is the number of sides between the two vertices.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each vertex, the closest angles are typically those with `k` and `k+1` steps. Therefore, for each vertex, we only need to consider these two values of `k` to find the minimal difference from the target angle `a`.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Instead of checking all possible triplets, we recognize that the optimal solution will involve vertices that are either adjacent or nearly adjacent. This allows us to limit our search to a small set of candidate angles around the target angle `a`.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Special cases include when `n` is 3 (triangle) or when the target angle `a` is 180 degrees, which might require specific handling to ensure correctness.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    if a == 180:\n        print(f\"1 {n} 2\")\n        return\n        \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    for start in range(1, n+1):\n        for k in [1, 2]:\n            step = (start + k) % n\n            if step == start:\n                continue\n            angle_val = 180.0 - (360.0 * k / n)\n            diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n            \n            if diff < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff\n                v1 = start - k\n                if v1 <= 0:\n                    v1 += n\n                v2 = start\n                v3 = step\n                best_vertices = (v1, v2, v3)\n                \n        k_large = n // 2\n        if k_large > 0:\n            angle_val_large = 180.0 - (360.0 * k_large / n)\n            diff_large = abs(angle_val_large - a)\n            if diff_large < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff_large\n                v1 = start - k_large\n                if v1 <= 0:\n                    v1 += n\n                v2 = start\n                v3 = (start + k_large) % n\n                if v3 == start:\n                    v3 = (start + k_large + 1) % n\n                best_vertices = (v1, v2, v3)\n                \n    print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the polygon is a triangle (`n == 3`) or if the target angle is 180 degrees, providing immediate solutions in these edge cases.\n2. **Main Loop**: For each vertex, the code calculates potential angles using two steps (`k = 1` and `k = 2`). The angle is derived from the formula `180 - (360 * k / n)`.\n3. **Optimal Angle Selection**: The solution keeps track of the smallest difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`. If a smaller difference is found, it updates the best vertices accordingly.\n4. **Large Step Handling**: Additionally, the code considers larger steps (up to half the polygon's perimeter) to ensure no potentially closer angles are missed, especially for angles near 180 degrees.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the best triplet of vertices is printed, ensuring they form the closest possible angle to the target `a`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by focusing on geometrically relevant angles, making it suitable for large values of `n` up to 100,000.",
