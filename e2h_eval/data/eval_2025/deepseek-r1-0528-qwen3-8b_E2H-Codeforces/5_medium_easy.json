Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and two strings l and r of length n.\n We need to form as many pairs (one left and one right) as possible such that:\n   - The pair is compatible: \n        * If both are letters, they must be the same.\n        * If one or both are '?', then they are compatible (unless both are letters and different, but note: '?' is compatible with any).\n   - Each boot can be used at most once.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We cannot use a boot more than once, so we have to assign each boot at most one partner.\n\n Observation:\n Since the problem asks for maximum pairs and then to output the pairs, we can break it down:\n\n We have two types of boots: definite colors (letters) and indefinite ('?').\n\n However, note: the problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any. This means that a '?' in left can match with any right (including '?'), and vice versa.\n\n But note: we are also allowed to use definite boots. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n How to approach?\n We can consider:\n\n 1. First, we can try to match the definite boots (non '?') that are the same. But note: sometimes we might sacrifice a definite match to use a '?' to free up a letter that could be matched elsewhere? Actually, no: because a definite letter is only matched by the same definite letter or by a '?' (but if we have two same letters, we can match them without using the '?'). However, there's a catch: if we have a '?' we can use it to match two different definite letters? Actually, no: one '?' can only match one specific boot. But wait, the rule is: \n   - A '?' matches any. So if we have a left boot with '?' and a right boot with 'a', they match. Similarly, a left boot with 'a' and a right boot with '?' match.\n\n However, we have two separate lists: left and right. And we are to form pairs between the two.\n\n We can do:\n\n Step 1: Count the total '?' in left and right. Then, we can use the '?' to match the remaining definite boots that don't have their complementary definite boots.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to use all boots. We want maximum pairs.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's break the boots into two groups:\n\n   Left boots: \n        Group A: non '?' (say, we call these \"fixed\")\n        Group B: '?' \n\n   Right boots: \n        Group C: non '?'\n        Group D: '?'\n\n Then, we can first match the fixed boots:\n\n   For each color, we can match left fixed boots of that color with right fixed boots of the same color, but we have to be cautious: we can only use each boot once.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to mix. But the matching of fixed boots must be done by same letter.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can try to match as many fixed boots as possible (ignoring the question marks). But wait: sometimes using a '?' might allow two fixed boots that are the same to be matched separately? Actually, no. The fixed boots must match with same fixed boots. However, if we have a fixed left boot and a fixed right boot of the same letter, we can match them. But if we have a fixed left boot and a '?' on the right, we can also match, but that leaves the possibility that the '?' could be used for a different left boot that is also fixed? \n\n Actually, the goal is maximum pairs. We can use:\n\n   - First, use the fixed boots to match with fixed boots of the same color (this gives definite matches).\n\n   - Then, use the fixed boots that are left to match with the '?' in the opposite side.\n\n   - Then, use the '?' to match with each other (each '?' in left can match a '?' in right, and vice versa).\n\n But wait: the problem does not require that we use the same index for left and right. We are free to assign any left to any right as long as the compatibility holds.\n\n However, note: the input gives two strings and we must output the indices (from 1-indexed) of the left and right boots.\n\n Important: The problem does not require that we use the minimal set of '?' for matching fixed boots, but we want maximum pairs.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n Let's denote:\n   left_fixed: list of (color, index) for each left boot that is not '?'\n   left_question: list of indices for left boots that are '?'\n\n   right_fixed: list of (color, index) for each right boot that is not '?'\n   right_question: list of indices for right boots that are '?'\n\n Then, we can:\n\n Step 1: Match the fixed boots (left_fixed and right_fixed) by color.\n\n   We can create a dictionary for right_fixed: mapping from color to list of indices.\n\n   Then, for each color in left_fixed:\n        We look for right_fixed boots of that color. But note: we want maximum pairs, so we should use as many as we can.\n\n   However, we cannot simply use all because we have to consider that the same right boot cannot be used twice.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching:\n\n   We can count the frequency of each color in left_fixed and right_fixed, but note: we are going to use each boot at most once.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n     For each color c that appears in both left_fixed and right_fixed, the number of matches we can get for that color is min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c]).\n\n   But wait: we are also allowed to use '?' to match the fixed ones. However, the above matching of fixed boots must be independent of the '?'? Actually, we can use the '?' to cover the deficit.\n\n   However, the problem is: we are allowed to use the '?' to match any, so we can postpone the matching of fixed boots until we account for the '?' that can be used to cover unmatched fixed boots.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   Total pairs = (matches from fixed boots) + (matches from fixed boots that are covered by '?' in the opposite side) + (matches from '?' to '?' )\n\n   But note: the '?' in one side can also match fixed boots in the opposite side. \n\n   Actually, the maximum pairs we can form is limited by:\n\n        total_left = n, total_right = n.\n\n   However, we can use:\n\n        Let X = set of fixed boots (both sides) and Y = set of '?' boots (both sides).\n\n        We can form up to min(n, n) pairs, but we are constrained by the colors.\n\n   But note: the matching of fixed boots must be by same color, and the '?' can match anything.\n\n   We can use a two-step matching:\n\n   Step 1: Count the maximum fixed boots we can match without using '?'.\n\n        For each color c, let L = count of left_fixed with color c, R = count of right_fixed with color c.\n        Then, the maximum fixed matches for color c is min(L, R).\n\n        Total_fixed_matches = sum_{c} min(L, R)\n\n   Step 2: Now, after matching the fixed boots, we have:\n\n        Left_fixed_remaining: the fixed boots that were not matched (because we didn't have enough right_fixed of the same color)\n        Right_fixed_remaining: similarly.\n\n        Additionally, we have the '?' boots that haven't been considered yet.\n\n   But wait: we might be able to use the '?' to match the remaining fixed boots. How many?\n\n        We have left_question: q_l, right_question: q_r.\n\n        The remaining fixed boots (both sides) can be matched by the '?' in the opposite side.\n\n        However, note: we can also use the '?' to match each other.\n\n        Let:\n\n            Let A = total_fixed_matches (from Step 1)\n\n        Then, we have:\n\n            Remaining left boots: n - (number of left boots used in fixed matches) - (number of left boots that are fixed and not used) [but actually we already counted the fixed matches]\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            After Step 1, we have:\n\n                left_remaining: \n                    left_fixed_remaining: the fixed boots that were not matched (so we have L_total - matched for each color) and left_question.\n\n                Similarly for right.\n\n        Now, we can use the '?' to match the remaining fixed boots. How?\n\n            In the left_remaining, we have:\n                fixed_remaining (which are fixed boots that were not matched because opposite side had less) and the question marks.\n\n            Similarly for the right.\n\n            We can match a fixed_remaining on left with a '?' on right, or a '?' on left with a fixed_remaining on right.\n\n            But note: we can also use a '?' to match a fixed_remaining and then use the freed '?' to match another fixed_remaining? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Let U = number of unmatched fixed boots on left (from Step 1) and V = number of unmatched fixed boots on right.\n\n            Then, we can match up to min(U, q_r) from the left fixed_remaining to the right '?' (if we use the right '?' to cover the left fixed_remaining) and similarly, we can match up to min(V, q_l) from the right fixed_remaining to the left '?'.\n\n            However, we cannot use the same '?' twice.\n\n            Moreover, we can also use the '?' to match each other (if we don't use them to cover fixed boots).\n\n        The total pairs we can form is:\n\n            A + min(U, q_r) + min(V, q_l) + min(remaining_q_l, remaining_q_r)\n\n        But note: the total '?' available is q_l (left) and q_r (right). The ones used in covering fixed boots are min(U, q_r) from left fixed_remaining and min(V, q_l) from right fixed_remaining.\n\n        Then, the remaining '?' are:\n\n            left_question_remaining = q_l - min(U, q_r) - min(V, q_l)   [Wait: actually, the min(V, q_l) is the number of '?' used to cover the right fixed_remaining, so we subtract that from q_l]\n\n        Then, we can form min(left_question_remaining, right_question_remaining) pairs from '?' to '?'.\n\n        But note: the fixed boots that remain after Step 1 and after covering by '?' are:\n\n            Left_fixed_remaining_after_cover = U - min(U, q_r)   [the left fixed boots that couldn't be covered by right '?']\n            Right_fixed_remaining_after_cover = V - min(V, q_l)   [the right fixed boots that couldn't be covered by left '?']\n\n        Then, the total pairs would be:\n\n            A + min(U, q_r) + min(V, q_l) + min(q_l - min(U, q_r) - min(V, q_l), q_r - min(U, q_r) - min(V, q_l))\n\n        However, this is complex and we must also output the actual pairs.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a graph matching, but n can be up to 150000 so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Another idea:\n\n   We can use two phases:\n\n   Phase 1: Match the fixed boots (non '?') by their color.\n\n        We can use a dictionary for the right_fixed: for each color, list the indices (and we will remove as we match).\n\n        Then, for each color in the left_fixed (we can iterate over the colors that appear in left_fixed and right_fixed):\n\n            For each color c, we have:\n                left_list = sorted list of indices for left boots of color c (or we can just use the list and then remove as we match)\n                right_list = sorted list of indices for right boots of color c\n\n            Then, we can match one boot from left_list with one from right_list. But which ones to choose? We don't care about the index order for now, but we need to record which ones are used.\n\n        However, we can use a greedy matching: for each color, we match the smallest index in left_list with the smallest in right_list? But the problem does not require a particular matching, just any.\n\n        But note: we have to output the pairs by the index of the left boot and the index of the right boot.\n\n        We want to avoid conflicts because the same boot index cannot be reused.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Create an array for left_used and right_used, initially all False.\n\n            Then, for each color c:\n\n                We take all left boots of color c that are not used and all right boots of color c that are not used.\n\n                Then, we match as many as possible (min of the two counts). But we have to assign the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            For each color c, we have two lists: left_indices and right_indices (for fixed boots). Then, we can sort both and then match the smallest left index with the smallest right index? But note: we are allowed to output any matching.\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple colors? We have to mark the indices as used.\n\n        Alternatively, we can:\n\n            Create a list of all fixed boots and then use a bipartite matching? But n is 150000 and the alphabet is 26, but the fixed boots can be of any color (and we have up to 150000 distinct colors? no, because only 26 letters) but wait: the fixed boots are only the non '?'. So the colors are only letters. However, the same color can appear many times.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Use a dictionary for the right_fixed: key=color, value=sorted list of indices (or we can use a multiset). Then, for each left boot (fixed) we can match with a right boot of the same color, but we have to assign without conflict.\n\n        Steps for Phase 1:\n\n            Let left_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)  # color -> list of indices (for left fixed boots)\n            Let right_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)  # color -> list of indices (for right fixed boots)\n\n            Then, for each color in left_fixed_dict:\n\n                if color in right_fixed_dict:\n                    Let left_list = left_fixed_dict[color]\n                    Let right_list = right_fixed_dict[color]\n\n                    We want to match as many as possible. Since we don't care about the order, we can do:\n\n                    We'll take the smaller of the two counts, say m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n                    Then, we can choose the first m from left_list and the first m from right_list? But note: we must output the pairs in increasing index order? The problem does not specify, but the example outputs: the left index and the right index.\n\n                    However, the problem requires: the pairs are (a_j, b_j) where a_j is the index of the left boot and b_j the index of the right boot.\n\n                    But note: the example input:\n\n                        Input: \n                            10\n                            codeforces\n                            dodivthree\n\n                        Output:\n                            5\n                            7 8\n                            4 9\n                            2 2\n                            9 10\n                            3 1\n\n                    The indices here are 1-indexed and the left boots and right boots are given in two strings. The left boots are in the second line, the right boots in the third.\n\n                    However, wait: the example input is provided as:\n\n                        ['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n                    This seems to be a multi-line example. Let me check the example output:\n\n                    Example 1: \n                        Input: \n                            10\n                            codeforces\n                            dodivthree\n\n                        Output: \n                            5\n                            7 8\n                            4 9\n                            2 2\n                            9 10\n                            3 1\n\n                    But wait, the example input has two lines: the first line is 10, then the second line is \"codeforces\", then the third line is \"dodivthree\". Then the next example starts with 7, etc.\n\n                    Actually, the example input is provided in a list of strings. But the problem states:\n\n                        The first line contains n.\n                        The second line contains string l.\n                        The third line contains string r.\n\n                    So for the first example, we have:\n\n                        n = 10\n                        l = \"codeforces\"\n                        r = \"dodivthree\"\n\n                    Then, we form pairs.\n\n                    How do we assign the indices? The left boots are indexed 1 to n (the first character is index 1, second index 2, etc.). Similarly for the right.\n\n                    Therefore, we must output the index (position in the string) for the left boot and the index for the right boot.\n\n        However, the matching in Phase 1 (fixed boots) must be done without using the same boot twice.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            For each color, we have two sorted lists (by index). Then, we can match the smallest index in left_list with the smallest in right_list, then the next smallest, etc.\n\n        But note: the same index in left and right? The example: \"2 2\" meaning left boot at index 2 and right boot at index 2.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Sort the left_fixed_dict and right_fixed_dict by index.\n\n            Then, for each color, we take the sorted list of left indices and the sorted list of right indices, and then we take the first m (min(len(left_list), len(right_list))) from both.\n\n            But note: we are going to use these indices and mark them as used.\n\n        However, we cannot use the same index in left and right for different colors? No, because we are processing by color.\n\n        But wait: a left boot has one color and a right boot has one color. So we are safe.\n\n        But note: the same index in left and right might appear in different colors? Actually, the left and right strings are independent.\n\n        Phase 2: Use the '?' to cover the remaining fixed boots.\n\n        We have:\n\n            left_remaining_fixed: the fixed boots that were not matched in Phase 1 (because we didn't have enough right_fixed of the same color)\n            right_remaining_fixed: the fixed boots that were not matched in Phase 1.\n\n            Also, we have the '?' boots.\n\n        Now, we can use the '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots. But note: we can use a left '?' to match a right fixed boot (that was not matched) and vice versa.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: we have two sets of '?'.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let left_question_set = set(indices of left_question)\n            Let right_question_set = set(indices of right_question)\n\n            Now, we have:\n\n                left_remaining_fixed: set of indices for left boots that are fixed and not matched.\n                right_remaining_fixed: set of indices for right boots that are fixed and not matched.\n\n            Then, we can match:\n\n                From left_remaining_fixed to right_question_set: we can match each left_remaining_fixed with a right_question, but we have to choose distinct right_question.\n\n                Similarly, from right_remaining_fixed to left_question_set.\n\n            But note: we cannot use the same '?' twice.\n\n            We can use:\n\n                Let x = min(len(left_remaining_fixed), len(right_question_set))\n                Then, we can match x pairs: one from left_remaining_fixed and one from right_question_set.\n\n                Similarly, y = min(len(right_remaining_fixed), len(left_question_set))\n\n            However, we have to assign without overlapping the '?' boots.\n\n            Actually, the total '?' boots are fixed. We have:\n\n                total_left_question = len(left_question_set)\n                total_right_question = len(right_question_set)\n\n            Then, we use some of the '?' boots to cover the remaining fixed boots. The amount we can use from left_question_set to cover right_remaining_fixed is at most total_left_question, and from right_question_set to cover left_remaining_fixed is at most total_right_question.\n\n            But note: we cannot use the same '?' boot for two purposes.\n\n            So, we can do:\n\n                Step 2a: Match as many as possible from left_remaining_fixed to right_question_set: we can use up to min(len(left_remaining_fixed), len(right_question_set)) pairs.\n\n                Step 2b: Then, from right_remaining_fixed to left_question_set: we can use up to min(len(right_remaining_fixed), len(left_question_set) - (number used in Step 2a))\n\n            Then, the remaining '?' boots can be matched among themselves.\n\n            However, we must assign the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n        But wait: we are trying to maximize the total pairs. The total pairs from fixed boots is A (from Phase 1). Then, the pairs from Step 2a and 2b are additional, and then the pairs from the leftover '?'.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine the two steps:\n\n            We have a bipartite graph for the remaining fixed boots and the '?' boots. The remaining fixed boots (both sides) can be connected to every '?' boot on the opposite side.\n\n            And the '?' boots can be connected to each other.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require maximum matching in general (because the fixed boots and '?' are independent). We can do:\n\n            Let total_pairs = 0\n\n            Step 1: Match fixed boots (non '?') by color (Phase 1) -> k1 pairs.\n\n            Step 2: Now, we have:\n\n                Let L_fixed_rest = left_remaining_fixed (set of indices)\n                Let R_fixed_rest = right_remaining_fixed (set of indices)\n\n                Let L_q = left_question_set (set of indices)\n                Let R_q = right_question_set (set of indices)\n\n            Then, we can form:\n\n                pairs1: between L_fixed_rest and R_q (any match is valid) -> we can match at most min(|L_fixed_rest|, |R_q|)\n                pairs2: between R_fixed_rest and L_q (any match is valid) -> but note: we have already used some L_q for pairs1.\n\n                Actually, we should use the '?' boots optimally:\n\n                    We can use the '?' boots to cover the fixed boots. The maximum number of fixed boots we can cover is |L_fixed_rest| + |R_fixed_rest|, but limited by the total '?' boots.\n\n                    Specifically, we can use:\n\n                        total_matches_from_q = min(|L_fixed_rest| + |R_fixed_rest|, |L_q| + |R_q|)\n\n                    However, we must split the usage between the two sides.\n\n                    But note: the fixed boots on left must be matched by right-side '?' and vice versa.\n\n                    Actually, we can use:\n\n                        Let x = min(|L_fixed_rest|, |R_q|)\n                        Then, we use x '?' from the right side to cover x left fixed boots.\n\n                        Then, the remaining '?' on the right side: |R_q| - x\n\n                        Then, the remaining fixed boots on the right: |R_fixed_rest| - min(|R_fixed_rest|, |L_q|) ??? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can use a greedy:\n\n                        We can use a bipartite matching for:\n\n                            Left nodes: L_fixed_rest and L_q (but note: the left_q can be used for either covering R_fixed_rest or for matching with R_q)\n                            Right nodes: R_fixed_rest and R_q.\n\n                        The edges: \n                            - Every node in L_fixed_rest can connect to every node in R_q and to every node in R_fixed_rest? \n                                Actually, no: a left_fixed_rest (which is a fixed color) can only connect to a right boot that is '?' OR that is the same color? But wait: we are in the remaining fixed boots. The left_fixed_rest is a fixed color that wasn't matched because the opposite side didn't have enough fixed boots of the same color. However, we are allowed to match a fixed color with a '?' or with a fixed boot of the same color? But wait: the opposite side might have a fixed boot of the same color that wasn't matched because we ran out of left_fixed boots of that color? Actually, no: we did Phase 1 for every color.\n\n                        Let me clarify: in Phase 1, we matched all fixed boots of the same color. Then, the remaining fixed boots are those that, for their color, the opposite side had fewer. So there is no same-color fixed boot available on the opposite side to match with.\n\n                        Therefore, the remaining fixed boots cannot be matched by a fixed boot (because the opposite side doesn't have one). They can only be matched by '?'.\n\n                        So, the edges:\n\n                            - L_fixed_rest: can only connect to R_q (the '?' in right)\n                            - R_fixed_rest: can only connect to L_q (the '?' in left)\n\n                        Then, the '?' boots can connect to both sides (but note: we are forming pairs between left and right, so a left '?' can only connect to a right boot (either fixed_rest or '?')).\n\n                        However, we have:\n\n                            We have two sets: \n                                Left: \n                                    Type1: fixed_rest (with definite color, say c) -> they can only connect to right boots that are '?' (because the opposite side doesn't have the same fixed color) OR wait, can they connect to a fixed boot of the same color that is in the opposite side but not matched? \n\n                        Let me reexamine: \n\n                            In Phase 1, we matched by color. The remaining fixed boots are the ones that, for their color, the opposite side had fewer. So for a left boot with color c, we matched as many as the number of right_fixed boots of color c. The rest (if any) left_fixed boots of color c cannot be matched by any fixed boot (because we don't have enough right_fixed of color c). But note: we are allowed to use a right boot with '?' to match a left boot of color c. \n\n                        So the left_fixed_rest can be matched to any right boot (either fixed or '?')? But wait: the definition of fixed_rest is that they are fixed (non '?') and not matched. But they are fixed, so they can only be matched by a right boot that is either the same fixed color (but we don't have any left) or by a '?'.\n\n                        Similarly, the right_fixed_rest can only be matched by a '?' from the left.\n\n                        Therefore, the graph for the remaining part is bipartite:\n\n                            Left nodes: \n                                L_fixed_rest (definite color, but we don't care about the color for matching, they are wildcards only for the purpose of being matched by any right boot? Actually, no: they are fixed and require a specific color? But wait, the matching condition is: the left boot (which has a definite color) must match the right boot. The right boot can be either the same color or '?'. \n\n                        But note: the left_fixed_rest has a definite color, say 'a'. Then, the right boot must be either 'a' or '?'. However, we already used all the 'a' in the right_fixed (because we matched as many as we could). And the remaining right boots that are fixed are the ones that are not of color 'a' (and not matched because of other reasons). But wait: the remaining right_fixed_rest are fixed boots that are not matched, and they are of some color. They cannot be matched by a left boot of color 'a' unless the right boot is also 'a'? But we don't have any right_fixed 'a' left. \n\n                        Actually, the left_fixed_rest of color 'a' can only be matched by a right boot that is 'a' (which we don't have) or by a '?'. \n\n                        Similarly, the right_fixed_rest of color 'a' can only be matched by a left boot that is 'a' (which we don't have) or by a '?'.\n\n                        Therefore, the remaining fixed boots (both sides) can only be matched by the '?' boots.\n\n                        So the edges:\n\n                            - Left_fixed_rest (each node) can connect to any right boot that is either '?' or fixed_rest? Actually, no: because the right_fixed_rest are fixed boots (non '?') and they are of a color. The left_fixed_rest (say color c) can only match a right_fixed_rest if the right_fixed_rest is of color c? But wait, we already matched all the right_fixed_rest of color c in Phase 1? \n\n                        Let me correct: \n\n                            In Phase 1, we matched the fixed boots by color. So for color c, we matched min(L_c, R_c) left_fixed boots (of color c) with right_fixed boots (of color c). Then, the remaining left_fixed boots of color c (if any) cannot be matched by any right_fixed boot (because there are no more right_fixed boots of color c). Similarly, the remaining right_fixed boots of color c (if any) cannot be matched by any left_fixed boot (because we don't have enough left_fixed).\n\n                        Therefore, the remaining fixed boots (both sides) cannot be matched by fixed boots of the opposite side. They must be matched by '?'.\n\n                        So, the graph:\n\n                            Left nodes: \n                                L_fixed_rest (each node has degree = |R_q|) [because they can only be matched by right-side '?']\n                                L_q (each node has degree = |R_fixed_rest| + |R_q|) [but wait: a left '?' can be matched to a right boot that is fixed_rest (which is fixed and non '?') or to a right '?'.\n\n                        But note: the problem condition: \n                            An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\n                        So, a left '?' can be matched to any right boot (whether fixed or '?') and vice versa.\n\n                        Similarly, a right '?' can be matched to any left boot.\n\n                        Therefore, the graph for the remaining part is:\n\n                            Left nodes: \n                                L_fixed_rest: can be matched to any right boot (both R_fixed_rest and R_q) [because '?' is compatible with any, and R_fixed_rest is fixed (so if the left_fixed_rest is 'a', then the right_fixed_rest must be 'a' to match? But wait, no: the left_fixed_rest is 'a', so it can only be matched by a right boot of color 'a' or '?'. However, we don't have any right_fixed_rest of color 'a' (because we matched them all in Phase 1). So actually, the left_fixed_rest can only be matched by right boots that are '?'. \n\n                            Correction:\n\n                                The left_fixed_rest has a definite color, say 'a'. Then, the right boot must be 'a' or '?'. But we don't have any right boot (fixed or not) of color 'a' left (because we matched all the right_fixed boots of color 'a' and the right_fixed_rest are fixed boots of colors that are not 'a'). And the right_fixed_rest are fixed boots that are not 'a' (because if they were 'a', we would have matched them in Phase 1). So the left_fixed_rest of color 'a' can only be matched by a right boot of color '?'.\n\n                            Similarly, the right_fixed_rest of color 'a' can only be matched by a left boot of color '?' (because we don't have any left_fixed boots of color 'a' left).\n\n                        Therefore, the graph becomes:\n\n                            Left_fixed_rest: can only connect to R_q (the right-side '?')\n                            Right_fixed_rest: can only connect to L_q (the left-side '?')\n\n                            Left_q: can connect to R_fixed_rest and R_q\n                            Right_q: can connect to L_fixed_rest and L_q\n\n                        Now, we have a bipartite graph with two parts: left and right.\n\n                        Left: L_fixed_rest âˆª L_q\n                        Right: R_fixed_rest âˆª R_q\n\n                        And edges:\n\n                            - Each node in L_fixed_rest is connected to every node in R_q.\n                            - Each node in R_fixed_rest is connected to every node in L_q.\n                            - Each node in L_q is connected to every node in R_fixed_rest and R_q.\n                            - Each node in R_q is connected to every node in L_fixed_rest and L_q.\n\n                        But note: the entire graph is actually a complete bipartite graph between the two sets (if we ignore the fixed_rest constraints) but wait: the fixed_rest are fixed and cannot be matched by the same color? Actually, no: the left_fixed_rest can only be matched by right boots that are '?' (because the same color is not available). Similarly, the right_fixed_rest can only be matched by left boots that are '?'.\n\n                        However, the left_q and right_q can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n                        To maximize the number of pairs, we can use a matching algorithm. But note: we have two types of nodes on the left and two types on the right.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                            Step 2a: Match L_fixed_rest with R_q (as many as possible, but note: one right '?' can only be used once). The maximum is min(|L_fixed_rest|, |R_q|).\n\n                            Step 2b: Match R_fixed_rest with L_q (as many as possible). But note: some left '?' have been used in Step 2a? Actually, no: Step 2a used R_q, so L_q is untouched. Then, the maximum is min(|R_fixed_rest|, |L_q|).\n\n                            Step 2c: Then, the remaining graph is between L_q and R_q (the unused ones). We can match them arbitrarily: min(|L_q| - (used in Step 2b?), wait: no, we didn't use L_q in Step 2a. We used R_q in Step 2a, but L_q is still available for Step 2b and Step 2c.\n\n                        Actually, we have:\n\n                            Step 2a: \n                                Let x = min(|L_fixed_rest|, |R_q|)\n                                Then, we use x nodes from R_q.\n\n                            Step 2b:\n                                Now, we have |R_fixed_rest| and |L_q| (all L_q is available because we didn't use any L_q in Step 2a, since Step 2a only used R_q).\n                                Let y = min(|R_fixed_rest|, |L_q|)\n\n                            Step 2c:\n                                Then, we have |L_q| - y left_q and |R_q| - x right_q, so we can form z = min(|L_q| - y, |R_q| - x)\n\n                        Then, the total pairs from the second phase is x + y + z.\n\n        But wait, is that the maximum? \n\n            We have:\n\n                Left nodes: \n                    L_fixed_rest: x used (matched with R_q)\n                    L_q: y + z used (y for R_fixed_rest and z for R_q)\n\n                Right nodes:\n                    R_fixed_rest: y used (matched with L_q)\n                    R_q: x + z used (x for L_fixed_rest and z for L_q)\n\n            And indeed, no overlap.\n\n        However, note: the graph is bipartite and we are matching arbitrarily. But is there a better way? \n\n            Consider: maybe we can use some left_q to match with R_fixed_rest and then use some right_q to match with L_fixed_rest, and then the rest of the '?' match each other. This is exactly what we did.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute the fixed boots and the question marks.\n\n            Step 2: Match the fixed boots (non '?') by color.\n\n                For each color c in left_fixed_dict (if present in right_fixed_dict too):\n\n                    Let m = min(len(left_fixed_dict[c]), len(right_fixed_dict[c]))\n                    Then, we match the first m left boots (by index) of color c with the first m right boots (by index) of color c.\n\n                But note: we are going to output the pairs. We must record the pairs.\n\n                However, we want to maximize the total pairs, and we are doing the maximum for fixed boots.\n\n            Step 3: \n\n                Let L_fixed_rest = set(all indices of left_fixed boots) minus the ones we used in Step 2.\n                Let R_fixed_rest = set(all indices of right_fixed boots) minus the ones we used in Step 2.\n\n                Let L_q = set of indices of left_question\n                Let R_q = set of indices of right_question\n\n            Step 4: \n\n                x = min(len(L_fixed_rest), len(R_q))\n                Then, we choose x pairs: one from L_fixed_rest and one from R_q.\n\n                Then, y = min(len(R_fixed_rest), len(L_q))\n                Then, z = min(len(L_q) - y, len(R_q) - x)\n\n            Then, total pairs = (pairs from Step 2) + x + y + z.\n\n            But wait: Step 2: we matched the fixed boots, so the pairs from Step 2 is the sum over colors of m.\n\n            Then, we output the total pairs and the pairs from Step 2, Step 4a, Step 4b, Step 4c.\n\n        However, we must output the pairs in the order: first the pairs from Step 2 (the fixed boots), then the pairs from Step 4.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the order of the pairs, but the example output:\n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \n                    10\n                    codeforces\n                    dodivthree\n\n                Output: \n                    5\n                    7 8\n                    4 9\n                    2 2\n                    9 10\n                    3 1\n\n            How many pairs? 5.\n\n            Let me check:\n\n                Step 2: fixed boots.\n\n                The left string: \"codeforces\"\n                The right string: \"dodivthree\"\n\n                Convert to list (index from 0 to 9):\n\n                    left: ['c','o','d','e','f','o','r','c','e','s']  (indices 0 to 9)\n                    right: ['d','o','d','i','v','t','h','r','e','e']  (indices 0 to 9)\n\n                The fixed boots: no '?'.\n\n                Now, we match by color:\n\n                    color 'c': left has two, right has two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each boot can be used in at most one pair. The compatibility is defined such that a specific color must match exactly, while an indefinite color ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching left and right boots based on their colors. The key observation is that '?' can act as a wildcard, matching any color. The solution requires efficiently matching as many boots as possible without reusing any boot.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution can be broken down into two main phases:\n   - **Phase 1**: Match fixed boots (non '?') by their exact colors. For each color, match the minimum of the counts of left and right boots of that color.\n   - **Phase 2**: Use the remaining '?' boots to match the unmatched fixed boots and then match the remaining '?' boots among themselves.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Phase 1** uses a dictionary to count and match boots by their colors.\n   - **Phase 2** involves matching unmatched fixed boots with '?' boots and then pairing leftover '?' boots.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once during the initial matching and once during the wildcard matching, resulting in an O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n â‰¤ 150,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = []\n    left_question = []\n    right_fixed = []\n    right_question = []\n    \n    for i, (lc, rc) in enumerate(zip(l_str, r_str)):\n        if lc != '?' and rc != '?':\n            if lc == rc:\n                left_fixed.append(i+1)\n                right_fixed.append(i+1)\n        elif lc == '?':\n            left_question.append(i+1)\n        elif rc == '?':\n            right_question.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            if lc == rc:\n                left_fixed.append(i+1)\n                right_fixed.append(i+1)\n    \n    fixed_matches = 0\n    left_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    right_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for idx in left_fixed:\n        color = l_str[idx-1]\n        left_fixed_dict[color].append(idx)\n        \n    for idx in right_fixed:\n        color = r_str[idx-1]\n        right_fixed_dict[color].append(idx)\n        \n    for color in left_fixed_dict:\n        if color in right_fixed_dict:\n            left_list = sorted(left_fixed_dict[color])\n            right_list = sorted(right_fixed_dict[color])\n            m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            fixed_matches += m\n            \n    L_fixed_rest = set(left_fixed) - set(left_fixed_dict.keys() or [i for i in left_fixed_dict if ...]) \n    Actually, let's correct the approach for Phase 1:\n\n    Instead, we should not precompute left_fixed and right_fixed as lists of indices for all non '?' boots, but rather use the dictionaries built from the entire string.\n\n    Revised plan:\n\n    We'll build two dictionaries for fixed boots (both left and right) from the entire strings, including all non '?' boots.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Read input.\n    2. Separate the indices of left and right boots into fixed and question mark lists.\n    3. Build dictionaries for left and right fixed boots, mapping each color to a list of indices.\n    4. For each color present in both left and right fixed dictionaries, match the minimum of the two counts for that color.\n    5. The remaining fixed boots (those not matched) are those that couldn't find a matching fixed boot on the opposite side.\n    6. Use the '?' boots to match these remaining fixed boots first, then match the remaining '?' boots among themselves.\n\n    However, note: the initial separation of fixed and question mark boots was incorrect because we included some boots in both fixed and question mark lists. Let's fix that.\n\n    Corrected approach:\n\n    We'll go through each index and determine if it's a fixed boot (both left and right are letters) or a question mark. But note: a boot can be either fixed or '?'.\n\n    Actually, we should separate the indices into four groups:\n\n      left_fixed: indices where the left boot is a letter (not '?')\n      left_question: indices where the left boot is '?'\n      right_fixed: indices where the right boot is a letter (not '?')\n      right_question: indices where the right boot is '?'\n\n    Then, for matching fixed boots, we consider only the fixed boots (non '?') and match them by color.\n\n    Let's implement accordingly.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Read input.\n    2. Separate indices into four lists based on the characters in the strings.\n    3. Build dictionaries for left_fixed and right_fixed, mapping each color to a list of indices.\n    4. For each color in left_fixed_dict, if it exists in right_fixed_dict, match the minimum of the two counts.\n    5. The remaining fixed boots are those not matched in step 4.\n    6. Use the '?' boots to match these remaining fixed boots: first, match left_fixed_rest with right_question, then right_fixed_rest with left_question, and finally match the remaining '?' boots among themselves.\n\n    However, note: the matching of fixed boots in step 4 must be done carefully to record which indices are used.\n\n    Let's implement step 4 properly:\n\n        We'll use two dictionaries for left_fixed and right_fixed, and then for each color, we'll match the smallest indices first to avoid conflicts.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        left_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)\n        for idx in range(1, n+1):\n            if l_str[idx-1] != '?':\n                left_fixed_dict[l_str[idx-1]].append(idx)\n\n        Similarly for right_fixed_dict.\n\n        Then, for each color in left_fixed_dict:\n            if color in right_fixed_dict:\n                left_list = left_fixed_dict[color]\n                right_list = right_fixed_dict[color]\n                left_list.sort()\n                right_list.sort()\n                m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                fixed_matches += m\n\n        But how do we record the pairs? We need to output the pairs, so we should record each match.\n\n    Alternatively, we can:\n\n        For each color, take the sorted lists of indices and match the i-th element of left_list with the i-th element of right_list for i in range(m).\n\n    We'll store these pairs.\n\n    Then, for the remaining fixed boots (those not matched in the above step), we can calculate:\n\n        left_fixed_rest = set(all left_fixed indices) - set(indices used in fixed matches)\n        right_fixed_rest = set(all right_fixed indices) - set(indices used in fixed matches)\n\n    Then, we can match:\n\n        x = min(len(left_fixed_rest), len(right_question))\n        Then, choose any x pairs between left_fixed_rest and right_question.\n\n        y = min(len(right_fixed_rest), len(left_question))\n        Then, choose any y pairs between right_fixed_rest and left_question.\n\n        z = min(len(left_question) - y, len(right_question) - x)\n\n    Finally, output the total pairs (fixed_matches + x + y + z) and the pairs themselves.\n\n    However, the problem requires outputting the pairs in the order they are formed. We'll collect all pairs during the three phases.\n\n    Steps for output:\n\n        Phase 1: For each color, output the pairs (left_index, right_index) for the matched fixed boots.\n        Phase 2a: Output x pairs between left_fixed_rest and right_question (any matching is fine).\n        Phase 2b: Output y pairs between right_fixed_rest and left_question.\n        Phase 2c: Output z pairs between the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\n    We must ensure that the indices used in each phase are distinct.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    right_fixed_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    left_question = []\n    right_question = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        l_char = l_str[i]\n        r_char = r_str[i]\n        idx = i + 1\n        if l_char != '?' and r_char != '?':\n            if l_char == r_char:\n                left_fixed_dict[l_char].append(idx)\n                right_fixed_dict[r_char].append(idx)\n        elif l_char == '?':\n            left_question.append(idx)\n        elif r_char == '?':\n            right_question.append(idx)\n    \n    fixed_matches = 0\n    pairs_phase1 = []\n    \n    for color in left_fixed_dict:\n        if color in right_fixed_dict:\n            left_list = sorted(left_fixed_dict[color])\n            right_list = sorted(right_fixed_dict[color])\n            m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            fixed_matches += m\n            for j in range(m):\n                pairs_phase1.append((left_list[j], right_list[j]))\n                \n    left_fixed_rest = set()\n    for color in left_fixed_dict:\n        for idx in left_fixed_dict[color]:\n            if idx not in [pair[0] for pair in pairs_phase1]:\n                left_fixed_rest.add(idx)\n                \n    right_fixed_rest = set()\n    for color in right_fixed_dict:\n        for idx in right_fixed_dict[color]:\n            if idx not in [pair[1] for pair in pairs_phase1]:\n                right_fixed_rest.add(idx)\n                \n    pairs_phase2a = []\n    x = min(len(left_fixed_rest), len(right_question))\n    left_rest_sorted = sorted(left_fixed_rest)\n    right_q_sorted = sorted(right_question)\n    for j in range(x):\n        pairs_phase2a.append((left_rest_sorted[j], right_q_sorted[j]))\n        \n    pairs_phase2b = []\n    y = min(len(right_fixed_rest), len(left_question))\n    left_q_sorted = sorted(left_question)\n    right_rest_sorted = sorted(right_fixed_rest)\n    for j in range(y):\n        pairs_phase2b.append((left_q_sorted[j], right_rest_sorted[j]))\n        \n    z = min(len(left_q_sorted) - j, len(right_q_sorted) - j) doesn't work like that.\n\n    Actually, after using y pairs from left_question, we have:\n        remaining_left_question = len(left_question) - y\n        remaining_right_question = len(right_question) - x\n        \n    Then, z = min(remaining_left_question, remaining_right_question)\n    pairs_phase2c = []\n    for j in range(z):\n        pairs_phase2c.append((left_q_sorted[y+j], right_q_sorted[x+j]))\n        \n    total_pairs = fixed_matches + x + y + z\n    print(total_pairs)\n    \n    for pair in pairs_phase1:\n        print(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\")\n        \n    for pair in pairs_phase2a:\n        print(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\")\n        \n    for pair in pairs_phase2b:\n        print(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\")\n        \n    for pair in pairs_phase2c:\n        print(f\"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots `n`, followed by two strings representing left and right boots.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize dictionaries to keep track of fixed boots (non '?') and lists for question mark boots.\n3. **Processing Boots**: For each boot, we categorize them into fixed or question mark based on their color.\n4. **Phase 1 Matching**: We match fixed boots by their color.
