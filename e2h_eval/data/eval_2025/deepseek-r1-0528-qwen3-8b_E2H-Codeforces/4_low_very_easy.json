The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), Nikephoros uses the character at position (i mod len(A)) in A,\n and Polycarpus uses the character at position (i mod len(B)) in B.\n\n Then, according to the rules:\n   - If they choose the same, then no red spot.\n   - Otherwise, one loses and gets a red spot.\n\n However, simulating n rounds when n can be up to 2e9 is impossible by direct simulation.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem into cycles. Note that the entire game has a cycle of length L = lcm(len(A), len(B))? \n But note: the two sequences cycle independently. The combined cycle would be the least common multiple of m and k, but actually we can consider:\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B). Then the state of a round is determined by two indices: (i mod m, j mod k). \n But note: the round index i goes from 0 to n-1. The pair (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T = lcm(m, k) rounds? Actually, the pair (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds where T is the least common multiple of m and k.\n\n However, we don't necessarily need to use the LCM. We can precompute for one full cycle (of length T) the number of rounds that result in a win for Nikephoros (i.e., when he loses) and for Polycarpus (when he loses). Then, the total number of red spots for Nikephoros is the number of rounds in which he lost, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let m = len(A), k = len(B).\n 2. We are going to consider the first T = lcm(m, k) rounds. But note: T might be very large if m and k are large? Actually, m,k <= 1000, so T <= 1000*1000 / gcd(1000,1000) which is at most 1000000, which is acceptable because we can iterate over the cycle if we know how many full cycles and then the remainder.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the two cycles repeat independently. We can think of the round i (0-indexed) as having:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n And we can precompute for each residue class modulo m and modulo k? Actually, we can iterate over a grid of (m x k) states, but note: the state at round i is (i mod m, i mod k). However, the same (i mod m, i mod k) will occur periodically.\n\n But note: we have two independent cycles, so the state (x,y) (where x from 0 to m-1, y from 0 to k-1) occurs every T = lcm(m,k) rounds, and the number of times each state occurs in the first T rounds is 1.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all T rounds if T is 10^6 (which is the worst-case when m=1000, k=1000, then T=1000000) and n=2e9, but 10^6 is acceptable because 2e9/10^6 is about 2000, so we can do:\n\n   total_red_Nike = 0\n   total_red_Poly = 0\n\n   Let T = lcm(m, k). Then the number of full cycles is full_cycles = n // T\n   Then we can compute the total red spots from full_cycles * (total losses for Nike in one cycle) + ... and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\n However, we must calculate the wins in one cycle. But note: the entire sequence of T rounds is fixed.\n\n Alternative plan:\n\n   Since T = lcm(m,k) might be large (up to 10^6) but n is 2e9, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the outcome for each round from 0 to T-1 (if T is the lcm, then T is the period) and then multiply by full_cycles and then add the remainder.\n\n   But wait: the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds, so the outcomes for the same (a_i, b_i) will be the same for the same (i mod m, i mod k). However, note that the outcome depends on the two characters",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The challenge lies in efficiently simulating the game without iterating through each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of rock, paper, or scissors. Each round's outcome depends on the current elements of their sequences. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `lcm(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. This periodicity allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for multiple cycles.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, the outcome is determined by comparing the current elements from both sequences. If the elements are the same, no red spot is added. Otherwise, one player loses and gets a red spot based on the game rules. By analyzing one full cycle (the least common multiple of `m` and `k`), we can count how many times each player loses within that cycle. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate the length of the cycle `T` as the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences.\n   - **Full Cycles Handling**: For the number of full cycles (`full_cycles = n // T`), multiply the losses per cycle by `full_cycles`.\n   - **Remaining Rounds**: Handle the remaining rounds (`remaining = n % T`) by simulating each round individually.\n   - **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the problem to processing at most `T` rounds (where `T` is up to 1,000,000) plus the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    T = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    total_red_Nike = 0\n    total_red_Poly = 0\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        idxA = i % m\n        idxB = i % k\n        a_char = A[idxA]\n        b_char = B[idxB]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_red_Nike += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'S'):\n            total_red_Poly += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R') or \\\n             (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'P'):\n            total_red_Poly += 1\n            \n    total_red_Nike *= full_cycles\n    total_red_Poly *= full_cycles\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idxA = i % m\n        idxB = i % k\n        a_char = A[idxA]\n        b_char = B[idxB]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_red_Nike += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'S'):\n            total_red_Poly += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R') or \\\n             (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'P'):\n            total_red_Poly += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{total_red_Nike} {total_red_Poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The cycle length `T` is computed as the LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B`. This determines the number of full cycles in `n` rounds.\n3. **Full Cycles Processing**: For each full cycle, the number of losses for each player is calculated once and multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n4. **Remaining Rounds Processing**: The remaining rounds after processing full cycles are handled individually to account for any partial cycles.\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed, combining results from full cycles and remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
