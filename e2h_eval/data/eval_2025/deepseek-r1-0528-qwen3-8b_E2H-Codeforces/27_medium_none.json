On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of integers that are either 1 or 2, and we can reverse any contiguous subarray (or not, if reversing doesn't help). We want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: Since the array only contains 1 and 2, the entire sequence is made of two numbers. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such an array is just the consecutive grouping of 1's and then 2's.\n\n Observation:\n In a sequence of 1s and 2s, a non-decreasing subsequence can be thought of as:\n   - A sequence of zeros or more 1's, then a sequence of zeros or more 2's.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse a contiguous part. So we can change the order of some 1s and 2s.\n\n Without any reversal, the LNDS is simply the total count of 1s and 2s? But wait, actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we have all 1s followed by all 2s. However, we can also have a mixture.\n\n Actually, without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n   Option 1: All the 1s (if they are not consecutive, then we can take all 1s because 1<=1, and then we can attach as many 2s as possible that come after the last 1 we took? But wait, we can only take increasing indices. However, note that we can skip elements.\n\n But note: in a sequence of 1 and 2, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if we arrange all 1s first and then 2s. However, our operation allows reversing a contiguous segment.\n\n Let total_ones = total number of 1s, total_twos = total number of 2s.\n\n Without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is at least min(total_ones + total_twos, ...) but actually, we can take all ones and then all twos? But wait, the original sequence might have some 2s before 1s, so we cannot necessarily take all ones and then all twos as consecutive in the sequence? \n\n Actually, note: the problem does not require contiguous subsequence. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in an array of 1s and 2s is the entire array if it is non-decreasing, but if not, then we can always take all the 1s and then all the 2s (because 1<=2). However, wait: what if the array is [2,1]? Then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1 (either the 2 or the 1). But note: we can also have a non-contiguous one: from [2,1] we can take [2] or [1] (each of length 1). But wait, in [2,1] the entire array is not non-decreasing, but we can take the first element (2) or the second (1). Also, note that we can take two elements if they are non-decreasing? There is no two elements that are non-decreasing because 2>1. So the answer for [2,1] is 1.\n\n However, consider [1,2]: we can take both, so the LNDS is 2.\n\n Therefore, the maximum LNDS we can get without reversal is the maximum k such that we can pick k elements that form a non-decreasing sequence. Since the sequence is only 1 and 2, the non-decreasing condition requires that if we pick a 2, then we cannot pick a 1 after it? Actually, we can have a sequence that is all 1s and then some 2s, but the 1s must appear first (by index) and then the 2s.\n\n However, note: the subsequence does not have to be contiguous. So in the original array, we can choose:\n\n   Option 1: Take all the 1s and then all the 2s that occur after the last chosen 1.\n\n But wait, we don't require consecutive. Actually, the entire set of 1s and 2s is available, but we must preserve the original order. So the idea is: we can take a set of 1s and 2s such that all 1s come before all 2s in the chosen set, and the indices of the chosen 1s are increasing and the indices of the chosen 2s are increasing.\n\n How to compute the LNDS in a general sequence of 1s and 2s? \n   We can do DP, but note that n<=2000, but the values are only 1 and 2.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire sequence can be partitioned by the positions of 1 and 2. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum over:\n   - The longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at each position.\n\n However, note the constraint: only two numbers. We can think:\n\n   Let dp[i][0] be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i that ends with 1.\n   Let dp[i][1] be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i that ends with 2.\n\n Then:\n   For each i:\n     If a[i] == 1:\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n        dp[i][1] = 0   (cannot end with 2 at this point)\n\n     If a[i] == 2:\n        dp[i][0] = 0\n        dp[i][1] = 1\n\n     Then, we can also extend previous sequences that ended with the same or smaller number.\n\n     Specifically, for a[i] == 1:\n        We can extend any sequence ending with 1 (because 1<=1) or even a sequence ending with 2? No, because 1 is less than 2, but we cannot use a 2 and then a 1 (that would be decreasing). So we can only extend sequences ending with 1.\n\n        Actually, we can also start a new sequence at i.\n\n        Similarly, for a[i] == 2:\n        We can extend sequences ending with 1 (because 1<=2) or sequences ending with 2 (because 2<=2).\n\n        Therefore:\n          If a[i]==1:\n            dp[i][0] = max(1, 1 + dp[j][0] for j < i)   but wait, we can only extend from 1s? Actually, we cannot extend from a 2 to a 1. So for a[i]==1, we can only extend from previous 1s.\n\n          If a[i]==2:\n            dp[i][1] = max(1, 1 + max( dp[j][0], dp[j][1] ) for j < i)   but note: we require that the previous element is at an index j < i.\n\n However, we can also consider that we are allowed to reverse a contiguous part. So we need to consider the effect of reversing a contiguous segment.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since the array has only 1 and 2, the entire sequence is composed of these two. The best scenario is having as many 1s as possible at the beginning and then as many 2s as possible.\n\n But note: we can reverse a contiguous part. What effect does reversing have?\n\n Example: \n   Original: [1, 2, 1, 2] -> reverse [2,3] (the middle two) to get [1,1,2,2]. Now the entire sequence is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is 4.\n\n How do we approach?\n\n We can consider that the reversal operation can be used to bring 1s to the front and 2s to the back. However, note that there are already some 1s and 2s.\n\n Let:\n   Let total_ones = total number of 1s\n   Let total_twos = total number of 2s\n\n Without reversal, the LNDS is at most total_ones+total_twos, but we cannot necessarily achieve that if the sequence is not arranged properly.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse any contiguous part. We can use reversal to fix the order of 1s and 2s arbitrarily? Not exactly arbitrarily, because the reversal flips the segment.\n\n But note: we can reverse multiple segments? The problem says we can reverse one contiguous interval.\n\n So we are allowed one reversal.\n\n Idea: we can consider that the reversal will change the order of a contiguous segment. We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n After reversal, the entire sequence will have all the 1s and then all the 2s? Not necessarily, but we can hope to have a long run of 1s and then 2s.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation doesn't necessarily merge all 1s to the front and 2s to the back. It reverses a contiguous part. But we can choose any contiguous part.\n\n Another observation: the reversal operation can be used to \"fix\" the boundaries between 1s and 2s. Specifically, the sequence is divided into runs of 1s and 2s. Reversing a segment might change the relative order of 1s and 2s.\n\n But note: the entire sequence is only 1s and 2s, and the goal is to have as many 1s as possible at the beginning and then 2s. The maximum LNDS we can get is the entire sequence if we can arrange it to be non-decreasing? Or if we cannot, then we might break the sequence into two parts: the 1s and the 2s.\n\n Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the entire sequence (after reversal) is the entire sequence if and only if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can have:\n\n   Option 1: The entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but the entire sequence is composed of 1s and 2s. Then the entire sequence is a non-decreasing subsequence if and only if all the 1s come first and then 2s.\n\n But note: we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that is not the entire sequence. However, the entire sequence is the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence if we can arrange the sequence to be non-decreasing.\n\n So the goal is to choose a reversal that maximizes the possibility of having a non-decreasing sequence.\n\n Alternatively, note that the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array (with values 1 and 2) is the total number of elements if the sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise, it is the entire sequence (because we can take every element) if the sequence is non-decreasing? Actually, no: the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but we can still take the entire sequence as a non-decreasing subsequence? \n\n Wait, no: the entire sequence is non-decreasing only if it is all 1s followed by all 2s. Otherwise, if there is a 2 followed by a 1, then we cannot take that entire sequence as a non-decreasing subsequence? Actually, we can take a subsequence that skips some elements.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. So we can fix the inversion caused by a single contiguous segment.\n\n Let me reframe:\n\n Let the original array be A.\n\n We are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Since the array is only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if and only if the entire sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., no 2 is followed by a 1). Otherwise, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is at most the entire sequence.\n\n But note: even if the entire sequence is not non-decreasing, we might be able to get a long non-decreasing subsequence by skipping some elements.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence is not necessarily the maximum. Consider [1,2,1,2] (original). Without reversal, the entire sequence is [1,2,1,2]. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (for example, the two 1s and then the two 2s, but we can take the first 1, the second 2 -> [1,2] (length2), or the two 1s (if we take the first and third) and then we cannot add a 2 because the next 2 comes after the third and we can take the fourth 2, so [1,2] (from first and fourth) or [1,2] (from third and fourth) but wait: the entire sequence has two 1s and two 2s, and we can take the two 1s and the two 2s as separate subsequences? Actually, we can combine them if the indices are increasing.\n\n Actually, the entire sequence is not non-decreasing, but we can take the entire sequence? Let's check:\n\n   [1,2,1,2]: \n     indices: 0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2.\n\n     We cannot take the entire sequence because 2 (at index1) is followed by 1 (at index2). But we can take a subsequence: [1,2,2] (from indices0,1,3) which is non-decreasing. That is length 3.\n\n     Alternatively, [1,1,2] (from indices0,2,3) is non-decreasing and length 3.\n\n     Or [1,2,2] (from indices0,1,3) is 3.\n\n     Or [1,2,2] (from indices0,3,3) but wait, we can't take the same element twice.\n\n     Actually, the entire sequence is not non-decreasing, but we can get a non-decreasing subsequence of length 3.\n\n     However, note: we can reverse the middle part [2,1] to get [1,1,2,2] which is non-decreasing and then the entire sequence is a non-decreasing subsequence of length 4.\n\n Therefore, the reversal can sometimes make the entire sequence non-decreasing.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Approach 1: brute force over all possible contiguous intervals to reverse, and then compute the LNDS for the resulting sequence. But n=2000, and reversing an interval and then computing the LNDS (which is O(n^2) with a standard DP) would be O(n^3) which is too slow.\n\n Approach 2: We need a smarter way.\n\n Observation: since the array is binary (only 1 and 2), the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a sequence is the maximum k such that we can find an increasing sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk with a[p1] <= a[p2] <= ... <= a[pk].\n\n In a binary array, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n   - The total number of 1s (if we take all the 1s, that's a non-decreasing subsequence)\n   - The total number of 2s (but note: we can mix 1s and 2s if they appear in increasing order)\n\n Actually, we can also consider: the entire sequence is broken by the transitions from 1 to 2 and then 2 to 1. The reversal operation can fix some of these.\n\n But note: the reversal operation is one contiguous reversal. We can think of the following:\n\n   Without reversal, the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the sequence into two parts: the left part (all 1s) and the right part (all 2s) and then the middle part where we have 2s and then 1s. But wait, the reversal might fix a single inversion segment.\n\n However, note that we can reverse any contiguous segment. The reversal might fix a block of inversions.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n   Let's define:\n     Let L = the entire sequence.\n\n   The goal is to have the entire sequence as non-decreasing, then the LNDS is n.\n\n   But if we cannot achieve the entire sequence being non-decreasing, then we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n   How to compute the LNDS for a given sequence? We can use DP:\n\n     Let dp[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n\n     Then:\n        dp[i] = 1\n        for j from 0 to i-1:\n            if a[j] <= a[i]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n\n     Then the answer is the maximum dp[i] for i in range(n).\n\n   But note: the array is only 1 and 2, so we can optimize:\n\n        dp[i] = 1\n        if a[i] == 2:\n            then we can extend by any sequence that ends with 1 or 2 (so we can take the maximum dp[j] for all j < i)\n        else (a[i]==1):\n            then we can only extend sequences that end with 1 (so we take the maximum dp[j] for j < i with a[j]==1)\n\n   However, even with this, the DP is O(n^2) and we have to do it for every possible reversal (O(n^2) possibilities) -> O(n^4) which is too slow for n=2000.\n\n We need a better approach.\n\n Observation: the reversal operation is contiguous and we are only allowed one reversal. Therefore, we can consider the effect of reversing a contiguous segment [l, r] on the entire sequence.\n\n Let the original sequence be A[0..n-1].\n\n After reversing [l, r], the new sequence B is:\n   B[i] = A[i] for i < l and i > r.\n   B[l:r+1] = reversed(A[l:r+1])\n\n We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in B.\n\n Note: The reversal operation might fix some inversions, but also introduce new ones.\n\n However, note that the reversal of a contiguous segment in a binary array only swaps the order of 1s and 2s within that segment. \n\n What is the effect on the entire sequence?\n\n   The entire sequence is fixed except for the segment [l, r]. The rest of the sequence remains the same.\n\n   The non-decreasing condition is global. The reversal might help if we have a block of 2s followed by 1s (which is bad) and we reverse that block to get 1s followed by 2s.\n\n   But note: the reversal might also break up existing good parts.\n\n   We need to consider that the reversal can be anywhere.\n\n Another idea: we know that the entire sequence's LNDS is at least the total number of 1s (because we can always take all the 1s) and similarly the total number of 2s. And we can also have a mixed one.\n\n But note: the reversal operation can be used to merge two parts: the left part (before the reversal) and the right part (after the reversal). However, the reversal changes the internal order.\n\n We can try to consider the entire sequence and the positions of 1s and 2s.\n\n Let:\n   Let pos1 = sorted list of indices where the element is 1.\n   Let pos2 = sorted list of indices where the element is 2.\n\n Without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can take:\n\n   Option 1: All the 1s and then all the 2s (but we must ensure that the 1s we take are the earliest ones and the 2s we take are the latest ones? Actually, the standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array is:\n\n        We can use two arrays: \n          Let dp1[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with a 1 and starting at or after index i (but that might be complicated).\n\n Alternatively, note: the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise, we can break the sequence into two parts: the leftmost occurrence of 2 and the rightmost occurrence of 1? \n\n But wait, we can also use the fact that the entire sequence is only 1 and 2. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n\n   Option A: The entire sequence (if non-decreasing).\n   Option B: Or, we can take all the 1s and then all the 2s, but we must take the 1s in increasing order of indices and the 2s in increasing order of indices, and the last 1 must occur before the first 2.\n\n However, note: we can also interleave 1s and 2s arbitrarily as long as the indices are increasing and the values are non-decreasing. But since 1<2, the only requirement is that we don't have a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array (1 and 2) is the length of the longest subsequence that does not contain a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n This is equivalent to: we can break the sequence into segments separated by the pattern [2,1]. The reversal operation can remove one such inversion.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. So we can remove all inversions (2 followed by 1) that lie entirely within the reversed segment? \n\n But wait, an inversion (2 followed by 1) that spans two parts (one outside and one inside) might not be fixed.\n\n How about we consider: the entire sequence is an array of 1s and 2s. The inversion count is the number of pairs (i, j) with i<j, a[i]=2, a[j]=1.\n\n The reversal operation can fix some inversions. Specifically, if we reverse a segment [l, r], then the inversions that are entirely within [l, r] will be fixed (because we reverse the segment, so the 1s and 2s in the segment become reversed, turning [2,1] into [1,2] which is non-decreasing). However, inversions that cross the boundary of the segment (or are outside) remain.\n\n But note: the reversal might also introduce new inversions? Actually, no: because the reversal of a segment of 1s and 2s will turn a [2,1] into [1,2] and vice versa. So the net effect is that the inversion count inside the segment is reduced by the number of [2,1] pairs and increased by the number of [1,2] pairs? Actually, the inversion count in the segment after reversal is the number of [1,2] pairs originally in the segment becomes [2,1] and vice versa.\n\n However, we are not counting inversions per se, but the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Another idea: the entire sequence's LNDS is the maximum length of a subsequence that avoids the pattern [2,1]. \n\n But note: the entire sequence's LNDS is the total length minus the minimum number of elements we have to remove to eliminate all inversions (like in the classic problem of making the sequence increasing)? \n\n However, we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n We need to consider: what is the best reversal?\n\n We can use dynamic programming that considers the entire sequence and the reversal operation, but n=2000.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the reversal operation is limited to one contiguous segment, and we are only dealing with two numbers. The reversal operation will change the order of a contiguous set of 1s and 2s.\n\n Let me consider the entire sequence and the positions of 1s and 2s. The reversal operation can be characterized by:\n\n   Let the segment [l, r] be reversed.\n\n   The effect is that the 1s and 2s in [l, r] are swapped in order, but the multiset of 1s and 2s remains the same.\n\n   The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n   The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if and only if there is no inversion (2 followed by 1) anywhere. \n\n   But if there is an inversion, we can fix some by reversing a segment that contains all the inversions? Actually, no: because an inversion might be outside the segment or span two parts.\n\n   Actually, the reversal operation can fix inversions that are entirely within the segment. However, if an inversion crosses the boundary (one element in the segment and one outside) then reversing the segment might not fix it.\n\n   Example: \n        [1,2,1,2] and we reverse [1,2] (the first two): becomes [2,1,1,2] -> now the inversion [2,1] is fixed by the reversal, but then we have a new inversion [2,1] at the boundary? Actually, the first two become [2,1] and then the next two are [1,2]. Then the entire sequence has an inversion [2,1] at the beginning and [1,2] at the end. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (from the [1,2] at the end) or 3? Let's check: \n          [2,1,1,2]: \n            We can take the two 1s (at indices1 and2) and then the last 2 -> [1,1,2] (length3).\n\n        Alternatively, if we reverse the middle two: [1,1,2,2] -> entire sequence is non-decreasing, so LNDS=4.\n\n   So the choice of reversal matters.\n\n   How to choose the reversal optimally?\n\n   We can try to consider the entire sequence and the positions of 1s and 2s.\n\n   Let's define:\n\n        Let prefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in [0, i-1]\n        Let prefix_twos[i] = number of 2s in [0, i-1]\n\n   But that doesn't capture the ordering.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the entire sequence's inversion count, and then consider reversing a segment and update the inversion count? \n\n   However, note: the inversion count is not directly related to the LNDS. \n\n   Let me recall: the LNDS is the entire sequence without the inversions? Actually, the LNDS is the entire sequence if there are no inversions. Otherwise, we can remove the minimal set of elements to eliminate all inversions, but that is the minimum deletions to make the sequence increasing, which is equivalent to the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n   But wait, for a binary sequence, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can compute it by:\n\n        Let x = the entire sequence.\n        The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum k such that we can find k elements that are non-decreasing.\n\n   In a binary sequence, we can also note:\n\n        The entire sequence is composed of 1s and 2s, so the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the length of the longest run of 1s and then 2s, but the 1s and 2s can be taken from anywhere as long as their indices are increasing.\n\n   Actually, the entire sequence's LNDS is:\n\n        Let S1 = all the 1s (each 1 is taken) and then as many 2s as possible that appear after the last 1 taken? \n\n        But note: we can interleave 1s and 2s as long as we don't have a 2 then a 1. \n\n        We can also consider: \n            Let f(i) = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n            Then, for each i, if a[i]==1, then f(i) = 1 + (number of 1s before i that can be extended) -> actually, we can extend any non-decreasing subsequence ending with 1 that ends before i, but also we can extend non-decreasing subsequences ending with 2? No, because 2>1.\n\n            Actually, for a[i]==1, we can only extend sequences ending with 1.\n\n            For a[i]==2, we can extend sequences ending with 1 or 2.\n\n        But note: the subsequences do not require consecutive elements.\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            Let dp1[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with 1 at position i.\n            Let dp2[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with 2 at position i.\n\n        Then:\n\n            dp1[i] = 1 + (max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp1[j] if exists, otherwise 0) \n            dp2[i] = 1 + (max_{j < i} ( max(dp1[j], dp2[j]) ))   # because 1<=2 and 2<=2\n\n        However, wait: if we are at a 2, we can extend any subsequence ending with 1 or 2, regardless of the value.\n\n        But note: the subsequence must be non-decreasing, so we can append 2 to any subsequence that ends with 1 or 2.\n\n        But also, we can start a new subsequence at i.\n\n        Then, the overall LNDS is the maximum of all dp1[i] and dp2[i] for i in [0, n-1].\n\n        However, this DP is O(n^2) for one sequence. And we have to do it for every possible reversal, which is O(n^2) reversals, so O(n^4) worst-case.\n\n        We need to avoid that.\n\n   Let's try to think differently.\n\n   We are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. What happens to the sequence?\n\n   The sequence is divided into three parts:\n\n        [0, l-1], [l, r], [r+1, n-1]\n\n   In the reversed part, the order of 1s and 2s is flipped.\n\n   The non-decreasing condition is global. The reversal might:\n\n        - Fix inversions within [l, r].\n        - Break inversions that were at the boundaries (if any) might change.\n\n   But note: the reversal operation doesn't change the multiset of the segment, so the total number of 1s and 2s remains the same.\n\n   The entire sequence's LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\n        Option 1: The entire sequence if there is no inversion (then LNDS = n).\n        Otherwise, the longest non-decreasing subsequence might be the entire sequence minus the inversions that cannot be resolved.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to choose any contiguous segment. So we can choose to reverse a segment that removes as many inversions as possible.\n\n   But note: an inversion is defined by a pair (i, j) with i<j, a[i]=2, a[j]=1.\n\n   How many inversions are there initially? Let inversion_count = total inversions.\n\n   After reversing a segment [l, r], the inversion count within [l, r] becomes (number of [1,2] pairs) in the original segment? Actually, no: the inversion count within the segment [l, r] in the original sequence is the number of pairs (i, j) in [l, r] with a[i]=2 and a[j]=1 and i<j.\n\n   After reversal, the segment becomes reversed, so the inversion count within the segment becomes the number of pairs (i, j) in the original segment with a[i]=1 and a[j]=2 and i<j (because when reversed, the positions are swapped). But note: the segment is contiguous, and the reversal maps the index l+i to r-i. \n\n   The inversion count within the segment after reversal is the complement of the non-inversion count in the original segment? Actually, the segment has a certain number of 1s and 2s. Let the segment have x 1s and y 2s. Then the inversion count within the segment originally is the number of (2,1) pairs. After reversal, the inversion count within the segment is the number of (1,2) pairs originally, which is (x * y) - (number of (1,2) pairs originally) ?\n\n   Actually, the total number of pairs in the segment is x+y choose 2. And the sum of inversion count and the non-inversion count (non-decreasing pairs) is the total pairs. But note: the pairs in the segment can be classified as:\n\n        (1,1): non-inversion\n        (1,2): non-inversion\n        (2,1): inversion\n        (2,2): non-inversion\n\n   After reversal, the segment's order is flipped, so the (1,2) becomes (2,1) and (2,1) becomes (1,2). \n\n   So the inversion count in the segment after reversal = (number of (1,2) pairs originally) + (number of (2,2) pairs remain non-inversion, (1,1) remain non-inversion, and (2,1) becomes non-inversion and (1,2) becomes inversion? \n\n   Actually, let me map:\n\n        Original: [a, b, c] -> reversed becomes [c, b, a].\n\n        The inversions in the original segment are the pairs (i,j) with a[i]=2, a[j]=1 and i<j.\n\n        In the reversed segment, the inversion count is the pairs (i',j') with a[i']=2, a[j']=1 and i'<j'. \n\n        But note: in the reversed segment, the element at position i' (which was originally at position r-i'+l) is a[r-i'+l]. \n\n        However, there is a simpler way: the inversion count in the segment after reversal is the inversion count of the reversed segment. And the inversion count of the reversed segment is the same as the inversion count of the original segment if we swap the roles of 1 and 2? \n\n        Example: [2,1] -> inversion count=1. Reversed is [1,2] -> inversion count=0.\n\n        Example: [1,2] -> inversion count=0. Reversed is [2,1] -> inversion count=1.\n\n        Example: [2,1,2] -> \n            original: \n                [2,1,2]: inversions: (0,1): (2,1) -> 1 inversion.\n            reversed: [2,1,2] -> becomes [2,1,2] reversed -> [2,1,2] -> same? Wait, no: reversing [2,1,2] gives [2,1,2] reversed -> [2,1,2] is symmetric? Actually, no: reversing [2,1,2] gives [2,1,2] -> no, wait, the reversal of [2,1,2] is [2,1,2] because the first and last are 2. \n\n        Actually, the inversion count in the reversed segment is not simply the inversion count of the original segment with 1 and 2 swapped.\n\n   Let me define for a segment S:\n\n        Let x = count of 1s, y = count of 2s.\n\n        In the segment, the number of inversions is the number of (2,1) pairs.\n\n        After reversal, the segment becomes S_rev.\n\n        In S_rev, the number of inversions is the number of (2,1) pairs in S_rev.\n\n        But note: the total number of (2,1) pairs in S is the same as the number of (1,2) pairs in S_rev? \n\n        Actually, no: in S_rev, a (2,1) pair appears if and only if originally in S, the corresponding elements (which are now swapped) were (1,2) in the forward order? \n\n        More precisely: \n            Let S = [a0, a1, ..., a_{k-1}] (k = r-l+1)\n            S_rev = [a_{k-1}, a_{k-2}, ..., a0}\n\n            Consider a pair (i, j) in S with i<j. In S_rev, the positions are mapped: the element originally at i goes to position k-1-i.\n\n            The inversion condition in S_rev: we require a_{k-1-j} = 2 and a_{k-1-i} = 1 and k-1-j < k-1-i, i.e., j>i.\n\n            But note: the condition for an inversion in S_rev is that the element at the lower index is 2 and the element at the higher index is 1.\n\n            In terms of the original S, the element at position i is a_i, and the element at position j is a_j.\n\n            In S_rev, the element at position k-1-i is a_i, and at position k-1-j is a_j.\n\n            The inversion condition in S_rev is: a_j (which is at position k-1-j) is 2, and a_i (which is at position k-1-i) is 1, and k-1-j < k-1-i -> j>i (which is true).\n\n            So the inversion condition for the pair (i,j) in S_rev is: a_j=2 and a_i=1.\n\n            But wait, this is the opposite of the original segment! In the original segment, the inversion condition was a_i=2 and a_j=1.\n\n            Therefore, the inversion count in S_rev is the number of pairs (i,j) with i<j and a_i=1 and a_j=2.\n\n        So the inversion count in the segment after reversal is the number of (1,2) pairs in the original segment.\n\n        And the original segment had inversion count = number of (2,1) pairs.\n\n        Also, the total number of pairs is C(k,2), and the sum of (2,1) pairs and (1,2) pairs is C(k,2) minus the pairs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s, where all 1s should appear before all 2s for the entire sequence to be non-decreasing. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists of only 1s and 2s. The LNDS is maximized when the sequence is transformed into a non-decreasing sequence, i.e., all 1s followed by all 2s. If the original sequence is already non-decreasing, the LNDS is simply the length of the sequence. Otherwise, we need to find the optimal contiguous subarray to reverse such that the resulting sequence has the highest possible LNDS.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Reversing a contiguous subarray can potentially turn a block of 2s followed by 1s into a block of 1s followed by 2s, thereby increasing the LNDS. The optimal reversal will maximize the number of 1s at the beginning of the sequence and 2s at the end.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Initial Check**: First, check if the sequence is already non-decreasing. If yes, the answer is the length of the sequence.\n   - **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: For sequences that are not non-decreasing, compute prefix arrays to count the number of 1s and 2s up to each position, and suffix arrays to count the number of 1s and 2s from each position onwards.\n   - **Optimal Reversal Calculation**: The optimal reversal will be a subarray that starts with a 2 and ends with a 1. The goal is to maximize the number of 1s moved to the left and 2s moved to the right by reversing such a subarray.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating through the sequence multiple times to compute prefix and suffix arrays, which takes O(n) time each. The main loop runs in O(n^2) time in the worst case, but optimizations reduce the average case complexity. The overall complexity is O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraint n ≤ 2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if all(a == 1 or a == 2 for a in arr):\n        if all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1)):\n            print(n)\n            return\n\n    prefix_ones = [0] * n\n    prefix_twos = [0] * n\n    \n    prefix_ones[0] = 1 if arr[0] == 1 else 0\n    prefix_twos[0] = 1 if arr[0] == 2 else 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_twos[i] = prefix_twos[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    total_ones = prefix_ones[-1]\n    total_twos = prefix_twos[-1]\n    \n    suffix_ones = [0] * n\n    suffix_twos = [0] * n\n    suffix_ones[-1] = 1 if arr[-1] == 1 else 0\n    suffix_twos[-1] = 1 if arr[-1] == 2 else 0\n    \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_ones[i] = suffix_ones[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    best = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] != 2:\n            continue\n        j = i\n        while j < n and arr[j] == 2:\n            j += 1\n        if j >= n:\n            break\n            \n        start_index = i\n        end_index = j - 1\n        ones_in_seg = (prefix_ones[end_index] - (prefix_ones[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0))\n        twos_in_seg = (end_index - i + 1) - ones_in_seg\n        \n        left_ones = (i - 1 >= 0) and (prefix_ones[i-1]) or 0\n        left_twos = (i - 1 >= 0) and (prefix_twos[i-1]) or 0\n        \n        right_ones = (n - 1 >= end_index+1) and (suffix_ones[end_index+1]) or 0\n        right_twos = (n - 1 >= end_index+1) and (suffix_twos[end_index+1]) or 0\n        \n        total_after_reversal = left_ones + left_twos + right_ones + right_twos\n        ones_after_reversal = left_ones + ones_in_seg + right_ones\n        twos_after_reversal = left_twos + twos_in_seg + right_twos\n        \n        candidate = ones_after_reversal + twos_after_reversal\n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] != 1:\n            continue\n        j = i\n        while j < n and arr[j] == 1:\n            j += 1\n        if j >= n:\n            break\n            \n        start_index = i\n        end_index = j - 1\n        ones_in_seg = (prefix_ones[end_index] - (prefix_ones[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0))\n        twos_in_seg = (end_index - i + 1) - ones_in_seg\n        \n        left_ones = (i - 1 >= 0) and (prefix_ones[i-1]) or 0\n        left_twos = (i - 1 >= 0) and (prefix_twos[i-1]) or 0\n        \n        right_ones = (n - 1 >= end_index+1) and (suffix_ones[end_index+1]) or 0\n        right_twos = (n - 1 >= end_index+1) and (suffix_twos[end_index+1]) or 0\n        \n        total_after_reversal = left_ones + left_twos + right_ones + right_twos\n        ones_after_reversal = left_ones + ones_in_seg + right_ones\n        twos_after_reversal = left_twos + twos_in_seg + right_twos\n        \n        candidate = ones_after_reversal + twos_after_reversal\n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n    if best == 0:\n        best = total_ones + total_twos\n        \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the sequence is already non-decreasing. If it is, the answer is simply the length of the sequence.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The code computes prefix arrays (`prefix_ones` and `prefix_twos`) to count the cumulative number of 1s and 2s up to each position. Similarly, suffix arrays (`suffix_ones` and `suffix_twos`) count the cumulative number of 1s and 2s from each position to the end.\n3. **Finding Optimal Reversal**: The code searches for the best contiguous subarray to reverse. For each 2 in the sequence, it calculates the potential increase in the LNDS by reversing the segment starting at that 2 and ending at the next 1. The same is done for segments starting with 1.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum possible LNDS after reversing any contiguous subarray is computed by considering the total number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing order. If no reversal improves the sequence, the answer defaults to the total number of elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking specific segments and leverages prefix and suffix sums to quickly compute the necessary values, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
