The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the condition is: a chest i can be opened by a key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n So, we can categorize the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chests with even numbers: E_c\n   Chests with odd numbers: O_c\n\n   Keys with even numbers: E_k\n   Keys with odd numbers: O_k\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd), and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n   - Even chests require odd keys.\n   - Odd chests require even keys.\n\n But note: we cannot use the same key twice, and we cannot open the same chest twice.\n\n However, we are allowed to use each key at most once and each chest at most once.\n\n We want to maximize the total number of chests opened.\n\n This is equivalent to: we can open at most min(|E_c|, |O_k|) even-chest openings and min(|O_c|, |E_k|) odd-chest openings.\n\n But wait, is that really the maximum? Actually, we are constrained by the counts of keys and chests. However, note that the two sets of constraints are independent because:\n   - The even chests are matched with odd keys, and the odd chests are matched with even keys.\n\n And the entire matching does not mix the two. So the total chests we can open is the sum of the two independent matchings.\n\n However, we must ensure that we don't overuse the keys. But note: the even keys are only used for odd chests, and odd keys are only used for even chests. So the two sets of keys are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n   total = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait: let me check with the example.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4\n          Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n            even: 14,6,2 -> 3 even\n            odd: 9,11 -> 2 odd\n          Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n            even: 8,4,20 -> 3 even\n            odd: 7 -> 1 odd\n\n   Then: \n        even_chests = 3, odd_keys = 1 -> min(3,1)=1\n        odd_chests = 2, even_keys = 3 -> min(2,3)=2\n        total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1\n          Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n          Keys: [5] -> odd -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n        total = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1+0 = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4\n          Chests: [10] -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=0\n          Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> odd_keys=0, even_keys=4\n        total = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0+0 = 0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: the example input is given as:\n     ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n And the outputs are ['3','1','0'].\n\n But note: in the third example, the chest is 10 (even) and keys are all even (so no key is odd). So we cannot open the chest.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n However, let's consider a potential pitfall: what if we have more than one way to assign? The above reasoning holds because the two types of pairs are independent.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Read n, m.\n  2. Read the list of chests (n integers)\n  3. Read the list of keys (m integers)\n\n  4. Count:\n        even_chests = count of a_i such that a_i % 2 == 0\n        odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other must be odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys**: Separate the chests and keys into two categories based on their parity (even or odd).\n2. **Independent Matching**: \n   - Even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can only be opened by even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openings**: The maximum number of even-numbered chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even-numbered chests and odd-numbered keys. Similarly, the maximum number of odd-numbered chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd-numbered chests and even-numbered keys. The total number of chests opened is the sum of these two minima.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    ans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even-numbered. The remaining chests (total minus even chests) are considered odd-numbered.\n3. **Matching Calculation**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of these two matchings.\n4. **Output**: The total number of chests that can be opened is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity-based constraints to maximize the number of chests opened without any complex computations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
