The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), Nikephoros uses the character at position (i mod len(A)) in A,\n and Polycarpus uses the character at position (i mod len(B)) in B.\n\n Then, according to the rules:\n   - If they choose the same, then no red spot.\n   - Otherwise, one loses and gets a red spot.\n\n However, simulating n rounds when n can be up to 2e9 is impossible by direct simulation.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem into cycles. Note that the entire game has a cycle of length L = lcm(len(A), len(B))? \n But note: the two sequences cycle independently. The state for a round i is determined by:\n   indexA = i % m, indexB = i % k.\n\n But note: the condition for a round depends on (indexA, indexB). Since m and k are at most 1000, the total distinct pairs (indexA, indexB) is m*k <= 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all 2e9 rounds. Instead, we can:\n\n Let L = the least common multiple of m and k? Actually, we don't need to use LCM in the traditional way. We can consider the pattern of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds, where T is the least common multiple of m and k? Actually, the pair (a, b) will repeat with period T = lcm(m, k). But note: the sequence of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i=0,1,...,T-1 is complete and then repeats.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total number of rounds in one cycle T = lcm(m, k). But note: we have n rounds. We can compute how many full cycles there are and then the remaining rounds.\n\n However, note: the round index i goes from 0 to n-1.\n\n 2. We can precompute an array for one full cycle (of length T) that records for each round i (from 0 to T-1) whether it's a loss for Nikephoros, Polycarpus, or draw.\n\n But T can be as large as 10^6 (since m,k<=1000, so T <= 1000*1000, which is 1e6). Then, if we do 2e9 / T, we might have 2e9/1e6 = 2000 cycles. Then we can:\n\n   - Precompute for one cycle (T rounds) the total losses for Nikephoros and for Polycarpus.\n\n   - Then, the total red spots for Nikephoros would be: (full_cycles * count_Nikes_loss_per_cycle) + (remaining_rounds_after_cycles: the losses in the first r rounds of the next cycle, for Nikephoros)\n\n Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But wait: we have two players. In each round, either one of them loses or none.\n\n How to determine the outcome for a round?\n\n   Let x = A[i % m] and y = B[i % k].\n\n   Outcome rules:\n      Rock (R): beats Scissors (S)\n      Scissors (S): beats Paper (P)\n      Paper (P): beats Rock (R)\n\n   So:\n      If x == y: draw -> no red spot.\n      Else:\n          if (x, y) is one of: \n            ('R','S') -> then x wins, so Polycarpus loses -> add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n            ('S','P') -> then x wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n            ('P','R') -> then x wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n\n          Or if (y, x) is one of:\n            ('R','S') -> then y wins, so Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n            ('S','P') -> then y wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n            ('P','R') -> then y wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define a function that, given two characters, returns which player loses (if any). \n\n   Let's define:\n        def outcome(x, y):\n            if x == y:\n                return None   # draw\n            elif (x, y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                return 'Nikephoros'   # because x beats y, so the loser is Polycarpus? Wait, let me check.\n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"the loser gets pinched\". And the rules are: \n        Rock beats scissors -> if Nikephoros plays R and Polycarpus plays S, then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses.\n\n   So the outcome function:\n\n        if (x, y) is (R, S): then Polycarpus loses -> so add to Polycarpus's red spots? Actually, we need to assign the loss to the loser.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: the winner gives the loser a pinch. So the loser is the one who did not win.\n\n   Alternatively, we can say:\n\n        if (x, y) is (R, S): then Polycarpus loses -> add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n        if (x, y) is (S, P): then Polycarpus loses -> add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n        if (x, y) is (P, R): then Polycarpus loses -> add 1 to Polycarpus red spots.\n\n        Similarly, if (x, y) is (S, R): then Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n        if (x, y) is (P, S): then Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n        if (x, y) is (R, P): then Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note:\n\n        The losing conditions for Nikephoros are when:\n            (x, y) is (S, P), (R, S) is not his loss? Actually:\n\n        Let me write:\n\n        For a round, we have two moves: x (Nikephoros) and y (Polycarpus).\n\n        The rule: \n          R vs S -> R wins -> so S (Polycarpus) loses.\n          R vs P -> R loses (because P beats R) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n          R vs R -> draw.\n\n        Similarly, \n          S vs R -> S loses (because R beats S) -> Nikephoros loses.\n          S vs P -> S wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n          S vs S -> draw.\n\n        And \n          P vs R -> P wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n          P vs S -> P loses -> Nikephoros loses.\n          P vs P -> draw.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        outcomes = {\n            ('R', 'S'): 1,   # Polycarpus loses (so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots)\n            ('R', 'P'): -1,   # Nikephoros loses (so we add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots)\n            ('S', 'R'): -1,   # Nikephoros loses\n            ('S', 'P'): 1,    # Polycarpus loses\n            ('P', 'R'): 1,    # Polycarpus loses\n            ('P', 'S'): -1    # Nikephoros loses\n        }\n\n   But wait, actually we don't want to mix the two players. We want to count separately.\n\n   Alternatively, we can have two counters:\n\n        For a round, if the outcome is that Nikephoros loses, then we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots? Actually, no:\n\n        The problem: \"the loser gets pinched\", so if Nikephoros loses, then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n        So we want to count:\n            If the round results in Nikephoros losing, then we add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n            If the round results in Polycarpus losing, then we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n        Therefore, we can define:\n\n            Let f(x, y) = \n                if x == y: 0\n                else:\n                    if (x, y) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: then the first player (Nikephoros) wins, so the second (Polycarpus) loses -> then we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots? \n                    But wait, the rule: if the round is (R, S): then Polycarpus loses -> so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n        Actually, we need to know who loses.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if x == y:\n                (0,0)\n            else:\n                if x beats y: then (0, 1)   [meaning: Polycarpus loses, so he gets one red spot, and Nikephoros doesn't]\n                else: (1, 0)   [Nikephoros loses]\n\n        How to check if x beats y?\n            The rules: \n                R beats S\n                S beats P\n                P beats R\n\n        So if (x, y) is (R, S): then x beats y -> so (0, 1) [Polycarpus gets one].\n        Similarly, (S, P): x beats y -> (0,1)\n        (P, R): x beats y -> (0,1)\n\n        Then the other cases: (S, R): y beats x -> (1,0)\n                            (P, S): y beats x -> (1,0)\n                            (R, P): y beats x -> (1,0)\n\n        So we can define:\n\n            if (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                outcome = (0, 1)   # (Nikephoros_red_spots_in_this_round, Polycarpus_red_spots_in_this_round) -> but wait: (0,1) means no red spot for Nikephoros and one for Polycarpus.\n            else:\n                outcome = (1, 0)\n\n        However, note: the else case includes (R,P), (P,R) is already handled above, and (S,R) etc. Actually, the else case is when (x,y) is not in the above list, meaning y beats x.\n\n        But wait: what about (R, R)? That's drawn and we already checked x==y, so we don't get here.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if x == y:\n                (0,0)\n            elif (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                (0,1)\n            else:\n                (1,0)\n\n 3. Now, the plan:\n\n    Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n    We need to consider the rounds from 0 to n-1.\n\n    The state of the round i is (i mod m, i mod k). The entire sequence of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) is periodic with period T = lcm(m, k). \n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute T = lcm(m, k). Since m,k <= 1000, we can compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n        Step 2: Precompute an array for one cycle of T rounds: \n            Let cycle_nike = 0   # total red spots for Nikephoros in one cycle\n            Let cycle_poly = 0   # total red spots for Polycarpus in one cycle\n\n        But note: T can be up to 10^6, and n can be 2e9. Then the number of full cycles is n // T, and the remainder is n % T.\n\n        We can precompute for all i in [0, T-1] the outcome for the round i (which uses A[i%m] and B[i%k]).\n\n        However, we don't want to store T elements (which is up to 1e6) and then multiply by the number of cycles (which could be up to 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000) but we don't need to multiply the entire array by 2000, we just need to sum the counts.\n\n        So:\n\n            full_cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            Then, we can precompute an array for one cycle (length T) of the outcomes (for both players) for each round.\n\n            Let counts_per_round = [0, 0] for each round? Actually, we need to store two numbers per round: (nike_red, poly_red) for the round.\n\n            But we don't need to store the entire history, just the total for the cycle.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                total_nike_cycle = 0\n                total_poly_cycle = 0\n\n            Then, for i in range(T):\n                x = A[i % m]\n                y = B[i % k]\n                if x == y:\n                    continue\n                elif (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    total_poly_cycle += 1\n                else:\n                    total_nike_cycle += 1\n\n            Then, the total for the game:\n\n                nike_red = full_cycles * total_nike_cycle + (additional red spots in the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle)\n                poly_red = full_cycles * total_poly_cycle + (additional red spots in the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle for Polycarpus)\n\n            Now, we need to compute the additional part for the remaining 'rem' rounds.\n\n            We can precompute two arrays:\n\n                nike_add[i] for i in [0, T-1] = 1 if in round i the outcome was (1,0) (i.e., Nikephoros loses) else 0\n                poly_add[i] for i in [0, T-1] = 1 if in round i the outcome was (0,1) (i.e., Polycarpus loses) else 0\n\n            Then, for the remaining 'rem' rounds (from round 0 to rem-1 in the cycle), we can compute:\n\n                additional_nike = sum(nike_add[0:rem])\n                additional_poly = sum(poly_add[0:rem])\n\n            But note: we can also compute without storing the entire array for the cycle, by iterating over the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n            However, T is at most 1e6, and rem is less than T, so we can iterate over the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n        Alternative: Precompute the entire cycle (T rounds) once, and then use prefix sums for the cycle to quickly get the sum for the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n        But T is at most 1e6, and we are going to do two passes (for the full cycle and then for the prefix) which is acceptable.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            T = lcm(m, k)\n            full_cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            # Precompute the outcomes for the entire cycle (T rounds)\n            outcomes = []   # list of tuples (nike_add, poly_add) for each round in the cycle, or simply two lists for the cycle: one for Nikephoros losses and one for Polycarpus losses per round.\n\n            We can create two arrays of length T:\n\n            nike_losses = [0]*T   # 1 if in round i, Nikephoros loses, else 0\n            poly_losses = [0]*T   # 1 if in round i, Polycarpus loses, else 0\n\n            for i in range(T):\n                idxA = i % m\n                idxB = i % k\n                x = A[idxA]\n                y = B[idxB]\n                if x == y:\n                    pass\n                elif (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    poly_losses[i] = 1\n                else:\n                    nike_losses[i] = 1\n\n            Then, the total for the full cycles:\n\n                total_nike = full_cycles * sum(nike_losses)\n                total_poly = full_cycles * sum(poly_losses)\n\n            Now, for the remaining rounds (from 0 to rem-1):\n\n                additional_nike = sum(nike_losses[0:rem])\n                additional_poly = sum(poly_losses[0:rem])\n\n            Then, the answers:\n\n                nike_red = total_nike + additional_nike\n                poly_red = total_poly + additional_poly\n\n        However, note: the cycle we built is for T rounds, and the rounds are from i=0 to T-1.\n\n        But our game goes from round 0 to n-1. The first n % T rounds are the first (n % T) rounds of the cycle.\n\n        This matches.\n\n 4. But wait: the example input:\n\n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Here, n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4, T = lcm(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem = 7.\n\n        Then we need to simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\n        Round0: (A[0]='R', B[0]='R') -> draw -> (0,0)\n        Round1: (A[1]='P', B[1]='S') -> (P,S): this is in [('P','R'), ('R','S'), ('S','P')] ? Actually, we check: \n            (P,S): is it in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, so Polycarpus loses -> (0,1)\n        Round2: (A[2]='S', B[2]='P') -> (S,P): in the list -> Polycarpus loses -> (0,1)\n        Round3: (A[0]='R', B[3]='P') -> (R,P): not in the list -> so else: (1,0)\n        Round4: (A[1]='P', B[0]='R') -> (P,R): in the list -> Polycarpus loses -> (0,1)\n        Round5: (A[2]='S', B[1]='S') -> (S,S): draw -> (0,0)\n        Round6: (A[0]='R', B[2]='P') -> (R,P): else -> (1,0)\n\n        So total for Nikephoros: rounds 3 and 6 -> 2 red spots? But the example output is 3 for Nikephoros and 2 for Polycarpus.\n\n        Wait, let me recount the example:\n\n        The example says:\n\n          Round1: R - R -> draw.\n          Round2: P - S -> Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gets one)\n          Round3: S - P -> Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros gets one)\n          Round4: R - P -> Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gets one)\n          Round5: P - R -> Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros gets one)\n          Round6: S - S -> draw.\n          Round7: R - P -> Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus gets one)\n\n        So actually, the example rounds are 7, and the indexing in the example starts from 1, but our code uses 0-indexed.\n\n        Our rounds:\n\n          Round0: R-R -> draw\n          Round1: P-S -> Polycarpus loses (so we count one for Polycarpus) -> correct\n          Round2: S-P -> Polycarpus loses (so one more for Polycarpus) -> now 2 for Polycarpus, and one for Nikephoros from round3?\n          Round3: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (so one for Nikephoros) -> then round4: P-R -> Polycarpus loses (so one more for Polycarpus) -> now 3 for Polycarpus? \n          Round4: P-R -> Polycarpus loses -> so Polycarpus has 3? But the example says 2 for Polycarpus.\n\n        Wait, I think I miscounted the example.\n\n        The example:\n\n          R - R. Draw.\n          P - S. Nikephoros loses.   -> so Polycarpus gets one.\n          S - P. Polycarpus loses.    -> so Nikephoros gets one.\n          R - P. Nikephoros loses.    -> Polycarpus gets two.\n          P - R. Polycarpus loses.    -> Nikephoros gets two.\n          S - S. Draw.\n          R - P. Nikephoros loses.    -> Polycarpus gets three.\n\n        But the example output is \"3 2\", meaning Nikephoros has 3 red spots and Polycarpus has 2.\n\n        Let me check the example again:\n\n          Round1: R - R -> draw.\n          Round2: P - S -> Polycarpus loses (because P beats S? No: wait, the rule: \n            Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.\n\n          P (paper) vs S (scissors): paper beats rock, but what about paper vs scissors? \n          According to the rules: paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, and rock beats scissors.\n\n          So in round2: P (Nikephoros) vs S (Polycarpus): \n            P vs S -> P does not beat S, actually S is beaten by rock, and P is beaten by scissors? \n          Wait, no: the rules: \n            Rock beats scissors -> R > S\n            Scissors beats paper -> S > P\n            Paper beats rock -> P > R\n\n          So in round2: P vs S -> S is beaten by R, but P is beaten by S? No, wait: the rule says S beats P. So if Nikephoros shows P and Polycarpus shows S, then Polycarpus wins because S beats P. Therefore, Nikephoros loses.\n\n          Correction: \n\n            In round2: (P, S) -> according to the rule: S beats P -> so Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n          Then our code:\n\n            Condition for (x,y) = ('P','S'): \n                Check: is ('P','S') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]?\n                ('P','S') is not in that list. So we go to the else, which sets (1,0) for Nikephoros loses.\n\n          But wait, the example says: \n                P - S: Nikephoros loses.\n\n          So our code correctly marks (1,0) for round2? Actually, no: we mark (1,0) meaning Nikephoros loses, which is correct.\n\n          Then why did the example say \"Nikephoros loses\" and then in the next round \"Polycarpus loses\"?\n\n          Now, round3: S vs P -> (S, P): \n                Check: ('S','P') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, so Polycarpus loses.\n\n          So:\n\n            Round0: (0,0)\n            Round1: (1,0)   [because (P,S) is not in the winning list for Nikephoros, so else -> (1,0)]\n            Round2: (0,1)   [because (S,P) is in the list -> (0,1)]\n            Round3: (1,0)   [because (R,P) is not in the list -> (1,0)]\n            Round4: (0,1)   [because (P,R) is in the list -> (0,1)]\n            Round5: (0,0)   [draw]\n            Round6: (1,0)   [because (R,P) is not in the list -> (1,0)]\n\n          Total for Nikephoros: 1 (round1) + 1 (round3) + 1 (round6) = 3\n          Total for Polycarpus: 1 (round2) + 1 (round4) = 2\n\n          This matches the example.\n\n        So the code must use:\n\n            if x == y: (0,0)\n            elif (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                (0,1)   # Polycarpus loses\n            else:\n                (1,0)   # Nikephoros loses\n\n        But note: the example round2 was (P,S) and we marked (1,0) (correctly) and round3 (S,P) we marked (0,1) (correctly).\n\n        However, wait: in the example, round2: (P,S) -> which is (x,y) = ('P','S') and our condition for the list is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n        ('P','S') is not in the list, so we went to else and marked (1,0). Correct.\n\n        Round3: (S,P) -> ('S','P') is in the list -> (0,1). Correct.\n\n        So the code logic is correct.\n\n 5. Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then string A, then string B.\n\n        Step 2: m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n        Step 3: Compute T = lcm(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n        Step 4: full_cycles = n // T\n                rem = n % T\n\n        Step 5: Precompute two arrays for the cycle of length T (if T==0, but m,k>=1 so T>=1) \n\n        However, note: if m==0 or k==0? The problem says m,k>=1.\n\n        Step 6: Create two arrays: \n                nike_losses_cycle = [0]*T   # 1 if in round i (0-indexed in the cycle) Nikephoros loses, else 0.\n                poly_losses_cycle = [0]*T   # 1 if in round i (0-indexed in the cycle) Polycarpus loses, else 0.\n\n        But we can also use one array of tuples, but two separate arrays for efficiency.\n\n        Step 7: For i in range(T):\n                j = i % m\n                k_index = i % k\n                x = A[j]\n                y = B[k_index]\n\n                if x == y:\n                    # nothing\n                    continue\n                elif (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    poly_losses_cycle[i] = 1\n                else:\n                    nike_losses_cycle[i] = 1\n\n        Step 8: total_nike_cycle = sum(nike_losses_cycle)\n                total_poly_cycle = sum(poly_losses_cycle)\n\n        Step 9: Then, for the full cycles, add full_cycles * total_nike_cycle and full_cycles * total_poly_cycle.\n\n        Step 10: Now, for the remaining 'rem' rounds, we need to consider the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle.\n\n                We can create two arrays for the entire cycle (already computed) and then take the prefix sums.\n\n                Alternatively, we can just iterate from i=0 to rem-1 and count.\n\n        Since T is at most 1000*1000 = 1e6, and rem is less than T (so at most 1e6), we can do:\n\n                additional_nike = 0\n                additional_poly = 0\n                for i in range(rem):\n                    j = i % m\n                    k_index = i % k\n                    x = A[j]\n                    y = B[k_index]\n                    if x == y:\n                        continue\n                    elif (x,y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        additional_poly += 1\n                    else:\n                        additional_nike += 1\n\n        But wait, we already have the arrays for the cycle. Why recalc? We can use the precomputed arrays for indices 0 to rem-1.\n\n        So:\n\n                additional_nike = sum(nike_losses_cycle[0:rem])\n                additional_poly = sum(poly_losses_cycle[0:rem])\n\n        However, note: the array we built for the cycle is for the entire cycle (index 0 to T-1). And the rounds in the cycle are exactly the rounds i=0,1,...,T-1.\n\n        But note: the cycle we built is for T rounds, and we used i from 0 to T-1. And the game rounds are the same as these indices for the cycle.\n\n        But wait: our cycle building uses i (from 0 to T-1) and for each i we set the outcome for the round i (which is the i-th round in the entire game, modulo the cycle).\n\n        And the first 'rem' rounds are the rounds 0 to rem-1, which are the same as the first 'rem' rounds in the cycle.\n\n        So we can use the precomputed arrays.\n\n        However, note: the cycle building used i from 0 to T-1, and the outcome for round i depends on A[i%m] and B[i%k]. This is correct.\n\n        But note: the cycle T is the least common multiple of m and k, so the pairs (i%m, i%k) for i=0 to T-1 cover all possible combinations? Not necessarily, but the cycle of the pair (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T, so we are capturing the entire pattern.\n\n        Step 11: Print: str(full_cycles * total_nike_cycle + additional_nike) + ' ' + str(full_cycles * total_poly_cycle + additional_poly)\n\n 6.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use predefined sequences of moves that cycle repeatedly. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a direct simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to compute the result efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using a cyclic sequence of moves (Rock, Scissors, Paper). The outcome of each round depends on the current moves of both players. The goal is to count the total number of losses (red spots) for each player over `n` rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences of moves repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the remaining rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate `T` as the LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one full cycle (0 to T-1), determine the outcome (who loses or if it's a draw) based on the current moves from sequences A and B.\n   - **Efficient Calculation**: Use the outcomes from one cycle to compute the total losses for all full cycles and the remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves processing up to `T` rounds, where `T` is at most 1,000,000 (since the sequences' lengths are up to 1000). This is feasible because 1,000,000 operations are manageable even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    win_conditions = [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n    \n    nike_losses_cycle = [0] * T\n    poly_losses_cycle = [0] * T\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        idxA = i % m\n        idxB = i % k\n        x = A[idxA]\n        y = B[idxB]\n        \n        if x == y:\n            continue\n        elif (x, y) in win_conditions:\n            poly_losses_cycle[i] = 1\n        else:\n            nike_losses_cycle[i] = 1\n            \n    total_nike_cycle = sum(nike_losses_cycle)\n    total_poly_cycle = sum(poly_losses_cycle)\n    \n    total_nike = full_cycles * total_nike_cycle\n    total_poly = full_cycles * total_poly_cycle\n    \n    additional_nike = sum(nike_losses_cycle[:rem])\n    additional_poly = sum(poly_losses_cycle[:rem])\n    \n    total_nike += additional_nike\n    total_poly += additional_poly\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences of moves for the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths determines the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each position in the cycle, the code checks the current move from both sequences. If the moves are different, it checks if one move beats the other based on Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.\n4. **Loss Counting**: The code counts how many times each player loses in one full cycle.\n5. **Result Calculation**: Using the counts from one cycle, it calculates the total losses for all full cycles and the remaining rounds separately, then combines them to produce the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, avoiding the need for brute-force simulation.",
