His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n, x\n   list a of n integers (first tour points)\n   list b of n integers (second tour points)\n\n We know that Vasya is one participant and his total points must be at least x (so there exists a pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >= x).\n\n However, the problem states that the results have only points (no names). So we have two sets of numbers: \n   first tour: a1, a2, ..., an\n   second tour: b1, b2, ..., bn\n\n But note: each participant has one score in the first tour and one in the second. The catch: we don't know which participant is which.\n\n We are to find the best and worst place Vasya could have.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that Vasya's two scores must come from the same index? Actually, no: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x\". But note: each participant is defined by one element from the first list and one from the second. However, the input does not tell us which element from the first corresponds to which in the second.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\" for both tours. And \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\".\n\n This means that the entire set of participants is represented by the two lists, but without knowing the pairing.\n\n However, note: the input gives two lists of n integers each. Each participant has one first-tour score and one second-tour score. But the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n So, we can consider that we have two multisets: A and B.\n\n For Vasya, we need to assign one score from A and one score from B (with replacement? Actually, no: because each score in A is used for one participant and each in B for one participant, and they are independent, but the same participant uses one from A and one from B.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the same index must correspond to the same participant. In fact, the problem says the results are given in arbitrary order.\n\n Therefore, we can assume that we can pair any a_i with any b_j for Vasya? But wait, the other participants are fixed: the entire set of participants is the multiset A and the multiset B. However, the problem does not require that we know which participant is which. \n\n What we need to do:\n\n We are to determine the best and worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n How?\n\n Let's define:\n   Let S be the set of all participants, each participant is defined by a pair (a, b). But we don't know the pairing.\n\n However, note: the problem says the teacher has the results of the first and second tour. So the set of first tour scores is A, and the set of second tour scores is B. And there are exactly n participants.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so we have n participants, each having one first tour score and one second tour score. The pairing is arbitrary.\n\n Therefore, the entire set of participants is the Cartesian product? No, because we have exactly n participants. Actually, the problem doesn't say that the two lists are the same set of participants. It just says we have two lists of n integers.\n\n Clarification: The input provides two lists of n integers. So we have n first tour scores and n second tour scores. And there are n participants. Each participant has one first tour score and one second tour score, but we don't know the matching.\n\n So, we are allowed to assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour scores? Then we can form any pairing we want.\n\n However, note: the problem states that Vasya is one of the participants. We know that Vasya's total is at least x. But how do we know which two numbers are Vasya's? Actually, we are told that there exists a pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we can assign arbitrarily: the rest of the participants must be assigned the remaining numbers.\n\n Actually, the problem is: we have two sets of n scores. We are to assign the second set of scores arbitrarily to the first set of scores (so each first score gets one second score, and vice versa). Then, for Vasya, we are told that he must have at least x (so his two scores must add up to at least x). But note: the condition is that there exists one such pair (which is true by the guarantee). \n\n However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we can choose which participant is Vasy",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on the given points from two tours. The key insight is that Vasya's total points must be at least `x`, and we need to find how his rank can vary depending on the pairing of first and second tour scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists of integers representing points from the first and second tours.\n   - Each participant has one score from each list, but the pairing is arbitrary.\n   - Vasya's total points (sum of his first and second tour scores) must be at least `x`.\n   - The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank Vasya could achieve when participants are ranked by their total points, with ties broken arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we should pair his highest possible score with the highest available score from the other tour, ensuring his total is at least `x`. The best rank is determined by counting how many other participants can have a higher total than Vasya's best possible total.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we should pair his lowest possible score with the lowest available score from the other tour, ensuring his total is at least `x`. The worst rank is determined by counting how many participants must have a higher total than Vasya's worst possible total, plus those with the same total who could be ranked higher due to tie-breaking.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient counting of pairs that meet or exceed `x`.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to count valid pairs for Vasya's best and worst scenarios efficiently.\n   - **Binary Search**: Utilized to quickly find the number of participants who can outperform Vasya in both scenarios.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - Counting valid pairs using two-pointer or binary search is O(n) per scenario.\n   - Overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    m = n\n    \n    def count_greater_or_equal(target):\n        count = 0\n        j = m - 1\n        for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] >= target:\n                count += 1\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        return count\n        \n    def count_less_than(target):\n        count = 0\n        j = -1\n        for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n            while j < m-1 and a_list[i] + b_list[j+1] < target:\n                j += 1\n            if j < i:\n                continue\n            else:\n                count += (i - j)\n        return count\n\n    best_total = a_list[-1] + b_list[-1]\n    if best_total < x:\n        best_place = n\n    else:\n        count_higher = count_greater_or_equal(best_total + 1)\n        best_place = count_higher + 1\n        \n    worst_total = a_list[0] + b_list[0]\n    if worst_total < x:\n        worst_place = 1\n    else:\n        count_less = count_less_than(worst_total)\n        worst_place = count_less + 1\n        \n    print(str(best_place) + \" \" + str(worst_place))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total points `x`, and the two lists of scores for the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient counting of valid pairs.\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**:\n   - **`count_greater_or_equal`**: Counts how many participants can have a total score greater than or equal to a target value. This is done using a two-pointer technique.\n   - **`count_less_than`**: Counts how many participants have a total score less than a target value, also using a two-pointer approach.\n4. **Determining Best and Worst Ranks**:\n   - **Best Rank**: The highest possible total is used to count how many participants can outperform Vasya. The best rank is one more than this count.\n   - **Worst Rank**: The lowest possible total is used to count how many participants must have a higher total. The worst rank is the sum of these participants and those with the same total who could be ranked higher.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed as two space-separated integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging sorting and linear scans to determine Vasya's possible ranks.",
