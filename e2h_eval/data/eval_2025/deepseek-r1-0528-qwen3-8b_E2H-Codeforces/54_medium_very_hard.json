Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (with 3<=n<=10^5, 1<=a<=180)\n\n The problem is to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at vertex v2 (formed by points v1, v2, v3) is as close as possible to a.\n\n Important: The polygon is regular convex with n sides, and vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n Observation:\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Let the vertices be labeled from 1 to n. Without loss of generality, we can fix the vertex v2 (the middle of the angle) and then consider two other vertices v1 and v3.\n\n However, note that the angle formed by three vertices in a convex polygon is not necessarily one of the interior angles of the polygon. \n\n Actually, the angle we are forming is an angle at a vertex (v2) that lies on the polygon. The sides of the polygon are straight, but we are allowed to choose any two chords from v2 to other vertices (which must lie on the two sides of the angle). But note: the problem says the polygon is convex, so the angle at v2 must be measured inside the polygon? Actually, the problem states: \"the value |angle - a| should be minimum\".\n\n How to compute the angle?\n\n Consider the circle circumscribing the polygon. The angle at vertex v2 (the inscribed angle) subtended by the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is half the measure of the central angle of the opposite arc.\n\n Actually, let's define:\n   Let the center of the polygon be O.\n   The central angle for an arc between two vertices separated by k steps (i.e., k edges) is (360/n)*k.\n\n Then the angle at vertex v2 (an inscribed angle) for the arc from v1 to v3 (the minor arc) is (central_angle)/2.\n\n However, note: the angle we are measuring is at the vertex v2, and the two sides of the angle are going to two other vertices. There are two possibilities: the angle could be the smaller one or the larger one? But since the polygon is convex, we are only concerned with the interior angle? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the examples:\n\n Example 1: Input \"3 15\" -> Output \"1 2 3\". In a triangle, the interior angle is 60 degrees, but we can form an angle of 60 degrees. Also note, in the square example: Input \"4 67\" -> Output \"2 1 3\", which gives an angle of 45 degrees? Why?\n\n Let me clarify with the square (n=4):\n\n The square has vertices 1,2,3,4. The central angle for two adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. The central angle for two vertices separated by one edge (so two adjacent ones) is 90, but for two opposite? 180.\n\n Now, if we take vertex 2 as the vertex of the angle, and we take v1 = 1 and v3 = 3: \n   This forms the diagonal, so the central angle for the arc from 1 to 3 (via the two edges) is 180 degrees, so the inscribed angle (at vertex 2) would be 180/2 = 90 degrees.\n\n Alternatively, if we take v1 = 1 and v3 = 4: \n   The arc from 1 to 4 (without going through 2) is the minor arc? Actually, in the square, from 1 to 4, there are two arcs: one of 90 degrees (if we go directly from 1 to 4) and the other 270. But the inscribed angle theorem uses the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined by the minor arc unless specified otherwise.\n\n However, note: in the example, they chose an angle of 45 degrees. How do we get 45?\n\n Consider: at vertex 2, we want to form an angle with two adjacent vertices? Actually, wait: the problem says \"three distinct vertices\". In the square, we have:\n\n Possibilities at vertex 2 (which is vertex 2):\n   Adjacent vertices: 1 and 3 (then the angle is 90 degrees)\n   Or we can take non-adjacent: but the next non-adjacent is the opposite vertex (vertex 4) and then the angle would be 90 degrees again? Actually, wait:\n\n Alternatively, we can take two vertices that are not both adjacent. For example, from vertex 2, we can take vertex 1 and vertex 4. Then the angle at 2 is formed by the two sides: from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4. In the square, these two sides are adjacent (since 2 is connected to 1 and 3, but 4 is adjacent to 1 and 3). So from vertex 2, the side to 4 is actually the same as the side to 1 and then the next one? \n\n Let me draw the square:\n\n   1 ---- 2\n   |      |\n   4 ---- 3\n\n If we take vertex 2, then we can have:\n   Option 1: v1=1, v2=2, v3=3 -> this forms the interior angle 90 degrees.\n   Option 2: v1=1, v2=2, v3=4 -> then the angle is formed by the two sides: from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4. The direction from 2 to 1 is left, and from 2 to 4 is down. The angle between these two vectors is 90 degrees? But wait, in the square, the angle at vertex 2 for the sides going to 1 and 4 is actually the exterior angle? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify whether the angle is interior or exterior. But note: the polygon is convex, and the angle must be measured in the plane. The angle we are forming can be either the interior or the exterior? However, the example output for the second sample is \"2 1 3\", which gives an angle of 45 degrees? \n\n Wait, the example input is \"4 67\", and output is \"2 1 3\". But wait, the example says: \"Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only.\" \n\n How do we get 45 degrees?\n\n Consider: in the square, if we take vertex 1, then we want to form an angle at vertex 1? Actually, the output is \"2 1 3\", meaning the vertex is 1, and the two other points are 2 and 3. \n\n So the angle is at vertex 1. Then the two sides are from 1 to 2 and from 1 to 3. \n\n In the square, the two sides from vertex 1 are: one edge (to 2) and the other edge (to 4). But wait, 3 is not adjacent to 1. Actually, in the square, the edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. So from vertex 1, the adjacent vertices are 2 and 4. Therefore, the angle at vertex 1 for the two sides 1-2 and 1-4 is 90 degrees. But why is the example output 45?\n\n Let me read the example again: \"In second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|.\"\n\n How do we get 45 degrees? \n\n The key: the angle is not necessarily the interior angle of the polygon, but the angle formed by three distinct vertices. In the square, we can also form angles that are not the interior angles of the polygon.\n\n Specifically, if we choose three vertices that are consecutive, then the angle at the middle vertex (like 1,2,3) is the interior angle of the polygon (90). But if we choose three consecutive vertices, the angle at the first vertex (vertex1) is not the interior angle of the polygon but the angle between the two sides (vertex1 to vertex2 and vertex1 to vertex4). Similarly, we can form an angle at a vertex that is the angle between two sides that are not both edges of the polygon.\n\n Actually, the problem allows any three distinct vertices. So the two sides of the angle can be chords, not necessarily edges.\n\n Now, how to compute the angle between two chords from a vertex?\n\n Consider: the circle circumscribing the square. The central angles are multiples of 90. The inscribed angle at a vertex for two chords is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.\n\n But wait, there's another way: we can use the dot product in coordinate geometry. However, note the constraints (n up to 10^5) so we cannot iterate over all triples.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the polygon is regular, the vertices lie on a circle. The angle at vertex v2 (with points v1 and v3) is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 (the one not containing v2). The measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n However, note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (the one not containing v2) has a central angle of (number of edges from v1 to v3 along the minor arc) * (360/n). But note: we are allowed to take any two chords from v2, so the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2.\n\n Actually, the inscribed angle formula: \n   angle = (arc_length) / 2\n\n But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (the intercepted arc) can be the minor or major? The standard inscribed angle is defined by the minor arc. However, in our case, the angle at v2 must be the one that is facing the arc from v1 to v3. But in the convex polygon, we are considering the arc that does not contain the vertex v2.\n\n However, note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc (the one that the angle \"sees\") is the one opposite to the vertex v2. The central angle of that arc is, say, x. Then the inscribed angle is x/2.\n\n But note: the arc from v1 to v3 can be the minor arc or the major arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (if the minor arc is less than 180). But sometimes, we can also consider the reflex angle (the major arc). However, the problem says the polygon is convex and we are taking three distinct vertices, so the angle we are measuring is the smaller one (because the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 will be less than 180).\n\n Actually, the inscribed angle formula for the minor arc gives an angle <= 90 (if the minor arc is <= 180, then the angle is <=90). But wait, the minor arc is <=180, so the inscribed angle is <=90.\n\n However, in the example of the square: \n   If we take three consecutive vertices: say 1,2,3. Then the angle at vertex 2 is 90 degrees. But wait, the intercepted arc for the angle at 2 (for the chords from 2 to 1 and 2 to 3) is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2? That arc is the minor arc of 180 degrees? Then the inscribed angle would be 180/2 = 90. Correct.\n\n Now, how do we get 45 degrees in the square?\n\n Consider: take three vertices that are not consecutive. For example, in the square, we can take vertices 1,2,4. Then the angle at vertex 2: \n   The two chords are from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4.\n\n The intercepted arc for the angle at 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 (which does not contain 2). In the square, the arc from 1 to 4 (minor arc) is 90 degrees. Then the inscribed angle would be 90/2 = 45 degrees.\n\n But wait: the angle at vertex 2 for the two chords 2-1 and 2-4: \n   The central angle for the arc from 1 to 4 is 90, so the inscribed angle is 45. \n\n However, note: the problem says the polygon is convex. The angle we are measuring is the angle in the polygon? Actually, the angle at vertex 2 for the two sides 2-1 and 2-4 is 45 degrees? But wait, in the square, the actual geometric angle at vertex 2 for the two sides 2-1 and 2-4 is 90 degrees because the two sides are perpendicular? \n\n Let me check with coordinates:\n\n Place the square with center at origin, and vertices:\n   1: (1,1), 2: (1,-1), 3: (-1,-1), 4: (-1,1) [but wait, that would be a square rotated. Actually, standard square with center at origin and sides parallel to axes:\n\n   Let me define: \n     1: (1,1)   -> but then the center is (0,0). Then the angle at vertex 2 (which is (1,-1)) for the two sides: from 2 to 1: (0,2) and from 2 to 4: (0,0) [wait, no: 4 is (-1,1)].\n\n Actually, better to use unit circle for a square? \n\n Standard: \n   vertex1: (1,0) \n   vertex2: (0,1)\n   vertex3: (-1,0)\n   vertex4: (0,-1)\n\n But that's a diamond. Then the angle at vertex2 (0,1): \n   Vector from 2 to 1: (1-0, 0-1) = (1,-1)\n   Vector from 2 to 4: (0-0, -1-1) = (0,-2)\n\n Then the angle between (1,-1) and (0,-2) is calculated by the dot product:\n\n   (1)(0) + (-1)(-2) = 2\n   Magnitude of (1,-1): sqrt(2)\n   Magnitude of (0,-2): 2\n\n   cos(theta) = 2/(sqrt(2)*2) = 2/(2*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2) -> theta = 45 degrees.\n\n So indeed, the angle is 45 degrees.\n\n Therefore, the angle can be either the minor arc's half (if the intercepted arc is the minor one) or the major arc's half? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the intercepted arc (the one opposite the angle). In the convex polygon, the intercepted arc (the one we are measuring) is the one that is opposite to the vertex, and it can be either the minor or major. However, the inscribed angle for the major arc would be (360 - minor_arc)/2, and that is greater than 90 (if minor_arc < 180, then (360-minor_arc)/2 > 90). But note: the problem says the polygon is convex, and we are to form an angle. The angle we are measuring is the one that is facing the arc. However, the problem does not specify which side, but in the example they are considering the minor arc? Actually, in the example, they got 45 and 90, which are both <=90.\n\n But wait: the problem says the angle is measured at the vertex, and the two sides are the chords. There are two angles: the one facing the minor arc and the one facing the major arc. However, the problem doesn't specify which one to take. But note: the angle must be one of the two. And the problem says \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\" and the angle is defined by the two sides (v1 and v3). \n\n However, the example outputs include both 45 and 90. So we are allowed to choose the one that minimizes |angle - a|. \n\n But note: the angle formed by two chords from a vertex can be either the acute or obtuse angle? Actually, the two angles at the vertex are supplementary (they add to 360). However, the angle we are measuring is the one that is the smaller one? Or the one that is formed by the two chords? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify. But note: the example input \"4 68\" outputs \"4 1 2\", which is the 90 degree angle (since 90 is closer to 68 than 45). \n\n However, the example input \"4 67\" outputs the 45 degree angle. \n\n So the algorithm:\n\n We need to consider all possible angles that can be formed by three distinct vertices. But note: the polygon is cyclic and symmetric.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Understand that the angle at vertex v2 (with two other vertices v1 and v3) is determined by the intercepted arc (the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2). The measure of the angle is (arc_length)/2, where arc_length is the central angle (in degrees) of the intercepted arc.\n\n 2. But note: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. The central angle for the intercepted arc is (k * (360/n)), where k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc (from v1 to v3, without passing through v2). However, we can also consider the other arc (the one containing v2) which is (n-k) * (360/n). Then the angle we are measuring is the inscribed angle for the intercepted arc (the minor one) OR the reflex angle? \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the intercepted arc (the one that the angle \"sees\"). In our case, the angle at v2 is the one that is facing the intercepted arc (the one without v2). But note: the angle at v2 is the smaller one? Or the one that is less than 180? Because if the intercepted arc is the minor arc, then the angle is minor; if the intercepted arc is the major arc (>=180), then the angle would be >=90, but wait: the inscribed angle for a major arc (if the major arc is used) is actually the reflex angle? \n\n Let me clarify: the inscribed angle is always taken as the smaller one (<=180). However, the formula for the inscribed angle is (arc)/2, but if the arc is greater than 180, then the inscribed angle is still (arc)/2, but that would be more than 90, which is acceptable. But wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle for an arc greater than 180 is actually the same as the reflex angle? \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (<=180) and the angle is (arc)/2. However, if we consider the major arc, we can also define an inscribed angle as (360 - minor_arc)/2, but that is the supplementary angle (and then the total with the minor arc angle is 180). \n\n But note: the angle at the vertex (the one we are measuring) is the one that is facing the arc. In a convex polygon, the vertex is part of the boundary, and the angle we are measuring is the one that is inside the polygon? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the examples show both 45 and 90.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\" and the angle is formed by the two sides (v1 and v3). The two sides are chords, and the angle is the one that is at v2. In the plane, the angle at v2 has two possibilities: the one facing the interior of the polygon and the one facing the exterior. But the problem does not specify which one to choose. However, the examples show that we are allowed to choose any angle (either one) that minimizes the absolute difference.\n\n Therefore, for each vertex v2, and for each pair (v1, v3) (with v1 and v3 on the two sides of the polygon relative to v2), we can consider two arcs: the minor arc and the major arc. Then the angle would be either (minor_arc)/2 or (major_arc)/2? But note: the major_arc is 360 - minor_arc, so the angle for the major arc would be (360 - minor_arc)/2, which is the reflex angle (greater than 180) but wait: the angle at a vertex in the plane is taken as the smaller one (<=180). \n\n Actually, the angle at the vertex is the smaller one (<=180) because we are measuring the angle between two rays. The two rays from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 divide the plane into two angles: the smaller one (<=180) and the larger one (>=180). The problem likely considers the smaller one.\n\n But wait: in the example of the square, when we took vertices 1,2,4, we got 45 degrees (which is the smaller one). When we took 1,2,3, we got 90 (which is the smaller one). \n\n However, note: the intercepted arc for the 45 degree angle was 90 degrees (minor arc) and the angle is 90/2=45. The intercepted arc for the 90 degree angle was 180 (which is the major arc? Actually, no: the arc from 1 to 3 in the square (without going through 2) is 180, so that is the major arc? Actually, in the square, the two arcs from 1 to 3: one is 180 (going through 4) and the other is 180 (going through 2)? Actually, no: the square has two arcs from 1 to 3: one of length 180 (passing through 2) and one of length 180 (passing through 4). So they are equal. \n\n Actually, the arc from 1 to 3 can be defined in two ways. But note: the intercepted arc for the angle at 2 is the one that does not contain 2. So from 1 to 3, the arc that does not contain 2 is the one that goes from 1 to 4 to 3, which is 180 degrees. Then the angle at 2 is 180/2 = 90.\n\n Similarly, for the angle at 2 for the points 1 and 4: the intercepted arc is the one from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. In the square, from 1 to 4, the two arcs: one is 90 (directly from 1 to 4, which is the edge) and the other is 270. The one that does not contain 2 is the 90 degree arc (because the other arc from 1 to 4 (the long way) goes through 3, which does not include 2? Actually, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2: we have two possibilities. The problem must specify which arc is the intercepted one.\n\n However, note: the angle at vertex 2 for the two chords to 1 and 4 is the same as the angle between the two vectors. And in the circle, the two chords from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4: the intercepted arc (the one that the angle \"subtends\") is the one that is opposite to the vertex 2, which is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. Since the entire circle is 360, and the arc from 1 to 4 that contains 2 is 270, then the intercepted arc is 360-270=90. So the angle is 90/2=45.\n\n So the formula: \n   Let the central angle for the intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) be x (in degrees). Then the angle at v2 is x/2.\n\n And note: x is the central angle for the intercepted arc, which is the arc from v1 to v3 (without passing through v2). \n\n How to compute x? \n\n We can label the vertices 0 to n-1 (for simplicity, then map back to 1-indexed). The central angle between two vertices i and j is min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|) * (360/n). But wait, that gives the minor arc between i and j. However, we need the arc from i to j that does not contain k (v2). \n\n Alternatively, we can think: the entire circle is 360. The arc from i to j (without passing through k) is the one that avoids k. \n\n But note: the problem is symmetric. We can fix the vertex v2. Then the other two vertices v1 and v3 must lie on two different sides of v2 (in the cyclic order). \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the central angles for all possible arcs? But n can be up to 10^5, and we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n 2. We note that the angle we are forming is determined by the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. The central angle for that arc is (d * (360/n)), where d is the number of edges in the intercepted arc (i.e., the arc length in terms of edges). However, the arc length in terms of edges from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) can be from 1 to n-1.\n\n 3. The angle is (d * (360/n))/2 = (d * 180)/n.\n\n But wait, is that true? \n\n Example: square (n=4). \n   For the 45 degree angle: d=1 (edge) -> (1 * 180)/4 = 45. Correct.\n   For the 90 degree angle: d=2 (two edges) -> (2 * 180)/4 = 90. Correct.\n\n But wait, what about the other possibility? For example, in the square, we can also get an angle of 45 degrees by taking d=1, and 90 by d=2. Also, what if we take d=3? Then the angle would be (3*180)/4 = 135. But 135 is the supplementary angle? Actually, no: the intercepted arc of 3 edges (from v1 to v3) in a square: 3 edges is the same as 1 edge (because 3 mod 4) but wait, the arc of 3 edges is 3*(360/4)=270, then the angle is 270/2=135. But note: the angle at the vertex is the smaller one (<=180) so 135 is acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says: the angle is as close as possible to a. So we must consider all d from 1 to n-1 (modulo the symmetry of the circle). But note: the same angle can be achieved by multiple d. Also, the arc length d must be the minimal arc? Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so it can be any arc that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2. In a circle, there are two arcs from v1 to v3: one clockwise and one counterclockwise. The one we use is the one that does not contain v2.\n\n But note: the two arcs from v1 to v3 are complementary (their sum is 360). The intercepted arc (the one we use) is the one that does not contain v2, so it must be the arc that is opposite to v2.\n\n However, we can also note: the angle is (intercepted_arc_central_angle)/2, and the intercepted_arc_central_angle = (k * (360/n)), where k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc (from v1 to v3) and k must be at least 1 and at most n-1.\n\n But note: the same angle can be achieved by two different k: because (k * 180/n) and (k' * 180/n) might be the same modulo 180? Actually, no: the angle is (k * 180/n) and k is from 1 to n-1, but note: the angle must be <= 180. Since k can be from 1 to n-1, then the angle is from (180/n) to (180*(n-1)/n). \n\n But wait, if k is greater than n/2, then the angle is greater than 90. And if k is greater than n, we don't consider because we are taking the minimal representation? Actually, we are taking the arc that does not contain v2, so k is fixed by the positions.\n\n However, note: the same angle can be achieved by two different k? Actually, no: the angle is determined by k. But note: the circle is symmetric, and k and n-k yield angles (k*180/n) and ((n-k)*180/n) and these are different unless k = n/2.\n\n But wait, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. So k is the number of edges in the arc from v1 to v3 (without v2). How do we relate k to the positions?\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the polygon is regular, the set of angles that can be formed is { (k * 180/n) for k in [1, n-1] }.\n\n However, note: the same angle can be achieved by two different k? Actually, the angle is (k * 180/n) and k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc. But the same angle might appear twice? \n\n But note: the angle is determined by k. However, k runs from 1 to n-1, so we get n-1 distinct angles? Not exactly: because (k * 180/n) might repeat if n is even and k = n/2? Actually, no: each k gives a distinct value until k = n/2, then k and n-k give angles (k*180/n) and ( (n-k)*180/n ) which are different.\n\n However, note: the angle (k*180/n) and ( (n-k)*180/n ) are different. \n\n But wait: the angle must be the same as ( (n-k)*180/n )? No, they are different.\n\n However, we must note: the angle is (intercepted_arc_central_angle)/2, and the intercepted_arc_central_angle is k*(360/n). Then the angle is (k * 180)/n.\n\n Now, the problem: we are to minimize |angle - a|, where angle = (k * 180) / n.\n\n But note: the same angle can be achieved by different k? Actually, no: each k gives a distinct angle because 180/n is fixed, and k runs from 1 to n-1. \n\n However, wait: the intercepted arc is defined by the two vertices v1 and v3, and the vertex v2. The same angle can be achieved by different triplets (v1,v2,v3). But the value of k is determined by the positions.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to list all angles, but to output three vertices.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let A = (k * 180) / n, for k in [1, n-1]\n\n   Then we want to find k such that |A - a| is minimized.\n\n   Then, we need to find a triplet (v1, v2, v3) that produces an intercepted arc of k edges (or k edges? Actually, k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc, but note: the arc from v1 to v3 (without v2) has k edges, so the central angle is k*(360/n) and the angle is (k*(360/n))/2 = k*(180/n).\n\n   However, we must also account for the fact that the same angle might be achieved by two different k? Actually, no: because k is the number of edges, and the angle is determined by k.\n\n   But note: the angle is k*(180/n). And k can be any integer from 1 to n-1.\n\n   Then, we can precompute the best k (the one that minimizes |k*(180/n) - a|) and then output the corresponding triplet.\n\n   However, we must map k to a triplet.\n\n   How to map k to a triplet?\n\n   Let's fix the vertex v2. Then the intercepted arc (of k edges) is the arc from v1 to v3 (without v2). \n\n   But note: the polygon has rotational symmetry, so we can fix v2 at a particular vertex (say 0) and then the two endpoints of the intercepted arc (v1 and v3) are separated by k edges (along the circle, avoiding v2). \n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc of k edges (from v1 to v3) must not contain v2. \n\n   We can arrange the vertices in a circle. Fix v2 at position 0. Then the other vertices are 1,2,...,n-1.\n\n   The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (avoiding 0) can be:\n\n        Case 1: v1 is at position i and v3 is at position j, and the arc from i to j (without passing through 0) is the arc that goes in the positive direction (clockwise) from i to j, and i and j are both in [1, n-1]. The condition is that the arc from i to j (without 0) is the same as the arc from i to j in the positive direction, and it must not include 0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: the entire circle is broken at v2 (vertex0). Then the two arcs from i to j (without 0) must be entirely in the set {1,2,...,n-1}. \n\n   Actually, we can split the circle at v2. Then the vertices are arranged in two arcs from v2: one clockwise and one counterclockwise.\n\n   The intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) is the arc that is entirely in one side of v2. \n\n   How many edges is that arc? \n\n        Suppose we have two vertices: one at position i (clockwise distance from v2 is i, but in terms of edges: the clockwise distance from v2 to i is i (if we label from 0 to n-1, then the clockwise edge count from 0 to i is i, and the counterclockwise is n-i).\n\n        Then the intercepted arc from i to j (without v2) must be the arc that goes from i to j without passing through 0. The length of that arc is the clockwise distance from i to j (if j>i) or the counterclockwise distance from i to j (if j<i). \n\n        Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that is the entire segment from i to j that does not include 0.\n\n   But note: we can also consider the other arc (the one that goes the long way around) but that one would contain 0? \n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc is defined as the one that does not contain v2 (0). So the arc from i to j (without 0) is the shorter arc? Or the one that does not contain 0? \n\n   Since the polygon is convex, the arc that does not contain 0 is the one that is entirely in the remaining n-1 vertices. The length of that arc is the minimum of the two arcs from i to j that avoid 0? Actually, no: there are two arcs from i to j: one that goes through the positive direction and one through the negative. The one that avoids 0 must be the one that is contained in the set {1,...,n-1} and is the entire arc from i to j in one direction (without wrapping around 0).\n\n   Actually, we can consider: the circle is broken at 0. Then the vertices are arranged in two halves: [1, n-1] is split into two parts: the positive direction from 0 (which is [1, n-1]) and the negative direction (which is also [n-1, 1] but in reverse). \n\n   But wait, we fixed v2 at 0. Then the other vertices are 1,2,...,n-1. The arc from i to j (without 0) is the set of vertices from i to j in the circular order that does not include 0. \n\n   Since 0 is removed, the circle becomes a line. Actually, we can break the circle at 0 and then the vertices are arranged",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficient computation to handle large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the angle formed by three vertices in a regular convex polygon can be derived from the central angles of the intercepted arcs between the vertices. The angle at the middle vertex is half the measure of the intercepted arc (in degrees). The intercepted arc is the arc between the two outer vertices that does not contain the middle vertex.\n\n2. **Geometric Insight**: For a regular `n`-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle formed at any vertex by two other vertices is `(k * 180) / n` degrees, where `k` is the number of edges in the intercepted arc. This angle must be minimized in absolute difference from the given angle `a`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Precompute Angles**: Calculate all possible angles (from 1 to `n-1` edges) that can be formed by any three vertices. \n   - **Binary Search**: Use binary search to efficiently find the angle closest to `a` from the precomputed list.\n   - **Vertex Mapping**: Once the optimal number of edges `k` is found, map it back to three distinct vertices in the polygon. The vertices are chosen such that the intercepted arc between the outer vertices does not include the middle vertex.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time due to the binary search over the precomputed angles. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the angles and their corresponding vertex mappings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    angles = []\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0) / n\n        angles.append((angle_val, k))\n    \n    angles.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    best_angle = None\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = len(angles) - 1\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        current_angle = angles[mid][0]\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_angle = current_angle\n            best_k = angles[mid][1]\n        elif diff == best_diff:\n            pass\n        else:\n            pass\n        \n        if current_angle < a:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    k_val = best_k\n    if n % 2 == 0 and k_val == n // 2:\n        k_val += 1\n        \n    start_vertex = 1\n    if k_val == n - 1:\n        v1 = n\n        v2 = 1\n        v3 = 2\n    else:\n        total_edges = k_val\n        side_length = n // 2\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            side_length = (n + 1) // 2\n            \n        if total_edges < side_length:\n            side = 'left'\n            v2 = start_vertex\n            v1 = start_vertex - total_edges\n            if v1 < 1:\n                v1 += n\n            v3 = start_vertex + 1\n        else:\n            side = 'right'\n            v2 = start_vertex\n            v1 = start_vertex - 1\n            v3 = start_vertex + (total_edges - side_length + 1)\n        \n        if v1 < 1:\n            v1 += n\n        if v3 > n:\n            v3 -= n\n            \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For each possible number of edges `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), compute the corresponding angle as `(k * 180) / n`.\n3. **Binary Search**: The computed angles are sorted, and binary search is used to find the angle closest to `a`.\n4. **Vertex Mapping**: The optimal angle corresponds to a specific number of edges `k`.
