Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cancel per card is x.\n\n 5. We can think greedily:\n\n   Let target = -S (the amount we need to add)\n\n   Case 1: If target is 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n   Case 2: Otherwise, we need to cover the absolute value of the target by adding cards, but note that we can use both positive and negative.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to just positive or negative. But observe:\n\n     We can use multiple cards. Each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). But note: the sign matters.\n\n   Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n     We have an additive set of integers from -x to x. We wish to represent the integer 'target' as a linear combination (with nonnegative integer coefficients) of numbers in the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x} (but note: we can use each available card arbitrarily many times? Actually, the problem says: initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x.\n\n   So we can use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily many times.\n\n   Then the problem reduces to: what is the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) needed such that their sum is 'target'?\n\n   Note: we can also consider that the problem is symmetric for positive and negative.\n\n   Let k be the minimum number of cards.\n\n   Constraints: \n        -k*x <= target <= k*x   (because each card can be at most x in absolute value)\n\n   But wait: we can mix positive and negative. However, note that if we use k cards, then the maximum positive sum we can get is k*x, and the maximum negative is -k*x.\n\n   So necessary condition: |target| <= k*x.\n\n   However, is this condition sufficient? Not exactly. Because we cannot necessarily get every integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] (unless k>= ceil(|target|/x) and we can form the target by using the right combination). \n\n   But note: we are allowed to use any integers in [-x,x]. This set is contiguous, so we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] provided that k is sufficiently large? \n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   We want to know the minimum k such that there exists a sequence of k integers (each in [-x, x]) that sum to target.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n      Let T = target.\n\n      We can use k cards. The maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x, but the set of achievable sums is all integers from -k*x to k*x that have the same parity as k*x? Actually, no, because we can use any integers, not just steps of 1, but wait: the set of integers from -x to x includes all integers in between. Therefore, the set of achievable sums is all integers between -k*x and k*x, because:\n\n        For example, with k=1: we can get any integer from -x to x.\n        For k=2: we can get from -2*x to 2*x, but note: we can get every integer in between because we can adjust by 1 (since we have consecutive numbers).\n\n      However, let me check: \n        With k=2 and x=1: we have cards {-1,0,1}. Then the possible sums are: \n          -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. -> yes, every integer in between.\n\n      Similarly, with k=2 and x=2: we have {-2,-1,0,1,2}. Then the possible sums are from -4 to 4. And we can get every integer? \n        How to get 3? 2+1 -> yes. 4: 2+2. -3: -2-1. etc.\n\n      Actually, the set of integers from -k*x to k*x is contiguous because we can use the entire set of integers from -x to x. So we can form any integer in that interval.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: we need the smallest k such that k*x >= |T| and k>= ceil(|T|/x)? \n\n   But note: we can use negative numbers too, so actually we require that k*x >= |T|, and then we can form T.\n\n   However, wait: what if T is negative? Then we need to form T (a negative number). Since we can use negative numbers, the condition is the same: the absolute value must be <= k*x.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x) if we were only using positive or negative? But wait, we can use both. Actually, we can use a combination. The key is: the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x, but we can also use negative to subtract. \n\n   However, note that we can use negative and positive together. The requirement is that the sum of the k cards must be T.\n\n   Consider: \n        We can represent any integer between -k*x and k*x. So we require k*x >= |T|.\n\n   Then the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   But wait: is that correct? \n\n        Example 1: T = 5, x=2. Then k_min = ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. Then 3*2=6>=5 -> k=3.\n\n        Example 2: T = 4, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(4/2)=2, which is correct.\n\n        Example 3: T = 3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2, and 2*2=4>=3 -> k=2.\n\n        Example 4: T = 1, x=2 -> ceil(1/2)=1, and 1*2=2>=1 -> k=1.\n\n        Example 5: T = 0 -> k=0.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to use negative cards as well. So the above reasoning holds.\n\n   But wait: what if T is negative? Then |T| is positive, and the same condition applies.\n\n   However, there's a catch: what if T is zero? Then k=0.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\", so if we already have sum 0, then 0.\n\n   However, let's read the problem again: the second line contains the found cards. And we can assume that the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value.\n\n   But note: the example input: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> current sum = (-1+1+2)=2, so target=-2, then k_min = ceil(|-2|/2)=ceil(2/2)=1.\n\n        Another: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> current sum = -4, target=4. Then k_min = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n        Step 2: Compute the current sum, say S.\n        Step 3: Let T = -S.\n\n        Step 4: If T == 0, then output 0.\n\n        Step 5: Otherwise, we need to find the smallest integer k>=1 such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n                k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n        But note: k_min must be an integer, so we can compute:\n\n                k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   [if abs(T) is positive, then ceiling division]\n\n        However, if abs(T) is divisible by x, then (abs(T) // x) is an integer, else we add one.\n\n        Alternatively: k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n        But note: if |T|==0, then k_min=0, but we already handled T==0.\n\n   However, wait: is that really the minimum? \n\n        Example: T=5, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(5/2)=3, which is correct.\n\n        Example: T=4, x=2 -> ceil(4/2)=2, correct.\n\n        Example: T=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2, correct.\n\n        Example: T=1, x=2 -> ceil(1/2)=1, correct.\n\n        Example: T=6, x=3 -> ceil(6/3)=2, correct.\n\n        Example: T=7, x=3 -> ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3, and 3*3=9>=7 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, is it always that we can form T with k_min cards?\n\n        We argued that with k_min cards, the set of achievable sums is [-k_min*x, k_min*x] (all integers). Since |T| <= k_min*x, then yes.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that we use only positive or negative, so we can mix.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is k_min.\n\n   BUT WAIT: the example input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" has T=4, and x=3, so k_min = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n   However, the sample output is 2.\n\n   Another example: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> T=-2, |T|=2, ceil(2/2)=1 -> output 1.\n\n   But consider: what if the current sum is already 0? Then T=0, we output 0.\n\n   However, there's a catch: what if the current sum is not zero, but we can achieve the target with fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards because we might have negative and positive? \n\n   Let me reexamine: the condition is that the absolute value of the target must be at most k*x. And we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x]. So k_min is indeed the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\n   But wait: consider T=2, x=3 -> k_min = ceil(2/3)=1. Then 1*3>=2 -> yes, so we can use one card with 2 (which is in [-3,3]). Correct.\n\n   However, consider T=3, x=3 -> ceil(3/3)=1. Then one card with 3 is allowed -> correct.\n\n   Consider T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=2. Then two cards: each at most 3. We can use two cards: 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed because 1 is in [-3,3]. So correct.\n\n   So the solution is:\n\n        Read n, x\n        Read the list of n integers\n\n        S = sum(list)\n        T = -S\n\n        if T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # We need the smallest k such that k*x >= abs(T)\n            # k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n            k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n            # But wait: what if |T| is 0? We handled that above.\n\n            print(k_min)\n\n   However, wait: there is a possibility that we can use the existing cards to form a sum that is closer to zero by adding more than just the minimal required? \n\n   Let me clarify: the problem is asking the minimum number of cards to add so that the total sum is zero. We are allowed to pick any cards arbitrarily from the set [-x, x]. \n\n   The above reasoning gives the minimal k such that the absolute value of the deficit (which is |T|) can be covered by k cards (each contributing up to x in absolute value). \n\n   But note: the deficit is fixed: we need to change the total sum by T (so that the new total is 0). \n\n   However, there's an alternative approach: sometimes we might use negative and positive cards to cancel out the existing sum, but our reasoning is that we can use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily, so the minimal number of cards is determined by the magnitude of T.\n\n   BUT WAIT: what if the current sum is 0? Then we don't need any.\n\n   However, consider: the problem does not require that the additional cards must be distinct. We are allowed to use duplicates.\n\n   But there's a twist: the problem statement says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use duplicates.\n\n   So the above solution should work.\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, numbers=[-1,1,2] -> S = 2, T=-2, |T|=2, k_min = ceil(2/2)=1 -> output 1. Matches.\n\n        Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, numbers=[-2,-2] -> S = -4, T=4, |T|=4, k_min = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> output 2. Matches.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a current sum that is negative? Then T is positive. And vice versa. But the absolute value is taken, so that doesn't matter.\n\n   However, consider a different scenario: \n\n        Suppose we have current sum S=5, and x=3. Then T=-5. We need to add cards that sum to -5. The minimal k: ceil(|-5|/3)=ceil(5/3)=2. But wait, can we form -5 with two cards? Each card is in [-3,3]. The maximum negative we can get with two cards is -6 (two -3's). So -5 is in the range. And indeed, we can use two cards: for example, -3 and -2. So that's two cards.\n\n        Now, what if S=5 and x=2? Then T=-5, |T|=5, ceil(5/2)=3. Then we need three cards. Maximum negative with three cards is -6, so -5 is achievable (for example, -2, -2, -1). Correct.\n\n   However, wait: is there a possibility that we can use fewer cards if we consider that the existing cards are already present and we can choose any cards arbitrarily? \n\n        The problem states: we can choose any cards (from the infinite set) arbitrarily. So the above reasoning holds.\n\n   BUT WAIT: There is a catch! \n\n        The problem does not require that the additional cards must be chosen independently. It is possible that the current set of cards might have some numbers that we can use to our advantage? \n\n        Actually, no. Because the problem says: we are to find the minimum number of cards to add so that the total sum is zero. We are allowed to choose any cards (from the set [-x,x]) arbitrarily. The existing cards are fixed and we are not removing any.\n\n        However, note: the existing cards are given and we are not allowed to remove them. We are only adding.\n\n        So the deficit is fixed: we must add a set of numbers that sum to -S.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of cards is determined solely by the absolute value of the deficit and the maximum card value.\n\n   However, let me consider an alternative: \n\n        What if the deficit is very small but we can use negative cards to cancel a positive deficit and positive cards to cancel a negative deficit? \n\n        Actually, we are already accounting for the absolute value. The sign doesn't matter because we can use negative and positive cards arbitrarily.\n\n   But wait: consider the following example:\n\n        Current sum S = 0? Then we don't need any.\n\n        But what if S=1 and x=1? Then we need to add a card with -1. That's one card.\n\n        Our formula: |T|=1, ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        Another: S=2, x=1 -> we need to add two cards: one -1 and one -1? Or maybe we can use two cards: two -1's. But wait, we can also use one card? No, because the maximum absolute value of one card is 1, so one card can only change the sum by at most 1 (so from 2 to 1, 0, or 3, but we need to get to 0). Actually, one card: we can choose -2? But wait, x=1, so the card must be in [-1,1]. Then one card can only subtract 1, so we get 2-1=1, not 0. So we need two cards: two -1's.\n\n        Our formula: T = -2, |T|=2, ceil(2/1)=2 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have S=0 and x=1? Then T=0, so we output 0. Correct.\n\n   One more: S=0, x=2 -> 0.\n\n   Now, consider: S=3, x=2. Then T=-3, |T|=3, ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then two cards: maximum negative we can get is -4 (two -2's). We can get -3? Yes, for example, -2 and -1. So two cards.\n\n   But wait, can we use one card? One card must be in [-2,2]. The closest negative is -2, then 3-2=1, not 0. Or if we use -1, 3-1=2, not 0. So one card is not enough. Hence two is minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? Example: S=-3, then T=3, |T|=3, ceil(3/2)=2. Then two cards: maximum positive we can get is 4 (two 2's). We can form 3: for example, 2 and 1. Correct.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_sum = sum(arr)\n        target = -total_sum\n\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Compute the minimal k: smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs(target)\n            # Using ceiling division: (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   BUT WAIT: let me test with a negative deficit and positive x.\n\n        Example: S = -4, x=3 -> target=4, abs=4, (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is not an integer? But target is an integer because the found cards are integers and x is integer, so total_sum is integer and target is integer.\n\n   But note: the problem says the numbers on the cards are integers.\n\n   However, wait: the example input may have negative and positive, but the sum is integer.\n\n   Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n   But wait: consider the example where the deficit is 0, we handled that. \n\n   However, what if the deficit is very large? The formula still holds.\n\n   But wait: what if the deficit is negative and very large? Then we take absolute value and it becomes positive.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints: n from 1 to 1000, x from 1 to 1000, and the numbers on the cards are integers not exceeding x in absolute value.\n\n   The maximum absolute value of the deficit: \n        The maximum absolute value of one card is x, and there are n cards. So the maximum absolute value of the total_sum is at most 1000 * 1000 = 1000000 (if n=1000 and x=1000, then worst-case sum is 1000000 or -1000000). Then abs(target) is at most 1000000.\n\n   Then k = ceil(1000000/x) and x is at least 1, so k is at most 1000000. But note: the problem constraints say x>=1 and n<=1000, but the deficit can be as large as 10^6. \n\n   However, the problem says the cards found are n (at most 1000) and each card's absolute value <= x (at most 1000). So the maximum deficit (absolute value) is at most 1000*1000 = 1000000, and x is at least 1, so k_min is at most 1000000. \n\n   But 1000000 is acceptable in Python for integer arithmetic.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says x>=1 and n<=1000, so the deficit is at most 1000*x (actually, the maximum absolute value of the deficit is the sum of the absolute values of the cards, but note: we have n cards, each at most x in absolute value, so the maximum absolute value of the deficit is n*x, which is 1000*1000=1000000). \n\n   Therefore, we can compute k_min = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x.\n\n   But wait: what if abs(target) is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 if x>0. But we already handled the case when target==0 (then abs(target)==0) and printed 0. So we don't need to worry.\n\n   However, we have two cases: when target==0 we output 0, else we compute k_min.\n\n   But note: if target is negative, we use absolute value. So the code is safe.\n\n   But wait: what if the deficit is positive or negative? We use absolute value, so that's correct.\n\n   However, let me check with the example: \n        Input: \"1 1000\\n1\" -> n=1, x=1000, card=[1]\n        total_sum=1, target=-1, abs(target)=1, k_min = (1+1000-1)//1000 = 1000//1000=1 -> output 1.\n\n        Input: \"1 1000\\n-1\" -> total_sum=-1, target=1, abs=1, same.\n\n   But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n   However, note: there's a possibility that the deficit is 0, but the formula for k_min would also work for 0: \n        (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 (integer floor division). But we already handled the case when target==0, so we don't use that formula for 0.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   However, wait: I just thought of something else.\n\n        Consider: maybe we can use the existing cards to help us by adding negative cards that cancel out part of the deficit, but note: we are only adding. The deficit is fixed.\n\n        But wait: the deficit is the amount we need to add. The existing cards are fixed and we are not changing them.\n\n   Therefore, the above code should be correct.\n\n   But wait: let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs(t)=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (using integer floor division, 3//2=1) -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs(t)=4 -> (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is 5 and x=3? Then (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (floor division: 7//3=2). But we need 3 cards because 2*3=6>=5 -> but wait, 2 cards can give a sum from -6 to 6, so 5 is in that range. So 2 cards are enough.\n\n   So the formula is correct: we are doing ceiling division by representing it as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n   But wait, the ceiling of a/b is (a+b-1)//b only when a and b are positive.\n\n        Here, a = abs(t) (positive) and b = x (positive), so yes.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the cards can be any integer from -x to x. So the minimal k is the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\n   But note: the above formula is the ceiling division.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Calculate ceiling of |t| / x\n            # If t is negative, we use absolute value, so we can use abs(t)\n            k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   Let me run through the examples again to be sure.\n\n   Example: T=5, x=2 -> (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2=3 -> correct.\n\n   Example: T=4, x=2 -> (4+2-1)//2=5//2=2 (since 5//2 in integer floor is 2) -> correct.\n\n   Example: T=3, x=2 -> (3+2-1)//2=4//2=2 -> correct.\n\n   Example: T=1, x=2 -> (1+2-1)//2=2//2=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: T=6, x=3 -> (6+3-1)//3=8//3=2 (floor division: 8//3=2) -> but wait, 6/3=2, so ceiling is 2. But (6+3-1)=8, 8//3=2 (which is the ceiling). Correct.\n\n   Example: T=7, x=3 -> (7+3-1)=9, 9//3=3 -> correct.\n\n   Example: T=0 -> handled separately.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? Example: T=-5, then abs(T)=5, same as above.\n\n   So the code works for negative as well.\n\n   But wait: what if the deficit is a positive number and x is larger than the deficit? \n\n        Example: T=2, x=3 -> (2+3-1)//3=4//3=1 -> correct, because one card of 2 is allowed.\n\n   Therefore, we submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: there is a known issue in competitive programming problems: sometimes the problem might have more constraints or edge cases.\n\n   Consider: when the deficit is 0, we output 0.\n\n   But what if the deficit is 0 but we are forced to use at least one card? The problem does not say that. The problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and 0 is the minimum.\n\n   Another edge: n=0? But the problem says n>=1.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x.\" and \"the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in their absolute value.\"\n\n   The above code meets the requirements.\n\n   However, wait: the sample input format is given as two lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        n = int(data[0])\n        x = int(data[1])\n        # The next n integers\n        arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n   But the problem says: first line two integers, second line n space-separated integers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but n>=1, so probably not empty\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            n = int(data[0])\n            x = int(data[1])\n            arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n   However, the problem says the first line has two integers and the second line has n integers.\n\n   But note: the example input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> tokens: ['3','2','-1','1','2'].\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   But wait: the input() function reads one line. The first line is two integers, the second line is the n integers.\n\n   However, what if the input has more than two lines? The problem says the first line and second line.\n\n   Since n is given, we can read the next n integers from the next line.\n\n   But the second line has exactly n integers.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   But wait: what if the second line has more than n integers? The problem says \"n space-separated integers\", so we assume exactly n.\n\n   Since the problem states the input format, we assume:\n\n        First line: n and x\n        Second line: n integers\n\n   So the code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        Output: 1\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        Output: 2\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, wait: I just thought of a different approach.\n\n        What if we can use a card that cancels a part of the deficit without having to cover the entire deficit by the maximum step? \n\n        But note: the problem allows any integer from -x to x. The minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that the total absolute change we can make (by choosing the appropriate signs) is at least |T|. \n\n        And the maximum absolute change per card is x, so we need k*x >= |T|.\n\n        This is the same condition.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -total\n        if deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Ceiling division for positive numbers\n            k = (abs(deficit) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   But wait: what if deficit is negative? We use absolute value, so that's fine.\n\n   Let me test with deficit=-5, then abs(-5)=5, same as deficit=5.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, wait: there is a potential issue with the ceiling division formula for positive integers.\n\n        The formula (a + b - 1) // b is standard for ceiling division of positive integers a and b.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem statement example outputs are:\n\n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> Output: 1\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> Output: 2\n\n   Our code produces these outputs.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n   But what if the deficit is not 0, but the minimal k is 0? That cannot happen because if deficit !=0 then |deficit|>=1 and x>=1, so (|deficit|+x-1)//x >= 1.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: there is an alternative method: \n\n        We can use math.ceil, but the problem says x>=1, and deficit is integer, so:\n\n        k = ceil(|deficit| / x) = (|deficit| + x - 1) // x   (for positive integers)\n\n   We are using integer arithmetic, which is efficient.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? We use absolute value, so that's positive.\n\n   The code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -total\n        if deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs(deficit) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   But wait: what if the deficit is positive and large? \n\n        Example: deficit=1000000, x=1 -> k=1000000, which is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n<=1000 and x<=1000, so the maximum deficit is 1000*1000=1000000, and x>=1, so k_min is at most 1000000.\n\n   However, 1000000 is acceptable for integer arithmetic in Python.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, wait: I just saw the problem statement again and the example input format: \n\n        The first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. \n        The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards.\n\n   And the example inputs are given as strings.\n\n   We are reading from stdin, so we are good.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -total\n        if deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs(deficit) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   But wait: there is a possibility that the deficit is negative and very large? \n\n        Example: deficit = -1000000, then abs(deficit)=1000000, then k = (1000000 + x - 1) // x.\n\n        Since x is at least 1, then (1000000+x-1) is about 1000000, and divided by x (at most 1000) gives at least 1000, which is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we submit.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, but we are not using that constraint for the deficit. \n\n        The deficit is the negative of the sum of the found cards. The found cards are n integers, each between -x and x. Therefore, the deficit is between -n*x and n*x.\n\n        But note: we are computing k_min = ceil(|deficit|/x). Since |deficit| <= n*x, then k_min <= n (because |deficit| <= n*x, so k_min <= n). \n\n        However, wait: \n            k_min = ceil(|deficit|/x)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the numbers on the found cards must be zero after adding the minimum number of cards. The deficit (the amount needed to make the sum zero) is calculated as the negative of the current sum of the found cards. \n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required to cover this deficit is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the deficit divided by the maximum absolute value of a single card (x). This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards reducing the deficit.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the deficit, checking if it is zero (in which case no cards are needed), and otherwise computing the ceiling of the absolute deficit divided by x using integer arithmetic for efficiency.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves summing the list of found cards (O(n)) and performing simple arithmetic operations (O(1)), making the overall complexity O(n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    deficit = -total_sum\n    \n    if deficit == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = (abs(deficit) + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value of any card (x). The subsequent values are the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Calculating Deficit**: The deficit is computed as the negative of the sum of the found cards. If the deficit is zero, it means the sum is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Ceiling Division**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimal number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute deficit divided by x. This is efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic: `(abs(deficit) + x - 1) // x`.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is either zero or the computed minimal number of cards.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal number of cards needed by leveraging simple arithmetic and direct computation, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.",
