In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, s).\n We have to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu (which can be a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that initially there are 3 tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (and they can be any tile) arbitrarily.\n\n 2. We consider two types of mentsu: koutsu (triplet) and shuntsu (sequence).\n\n 3. Since we can draw any tiles, we can think about forming a triplet or a sequence with the existing tiles and possibly drawing more.\n\n 4. We are allowed to draw extra tiles. We want the minimum number.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 0: Already has a mentsu? Then answer is 0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least one mentsu\". So if she already has a mentsu, then 0.\n\n However, note that the hand might have multiple tiles but we only need one mentsu. The hand size is 3 initially, and then we can add.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"she has three tiles\" and then after drawing, the hand has 3 + k (k being the number of draws). But note: the mentsu requires three tiles. So we are allowed to use the drawn tiles to complete the mentsu.\n\n However, the existing three tiles might form a mentsu by themselves, or we might need to draw one or two tiles to complete a mentsu.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Option 1: Already a koutsu (three identical) -> 0.\n\n Option 2: Already a shuntsu (three consecutive in the same suit) -> 0.\n\n Option 3: We don't have a mentsu yet, but we can form one by drawing one or two tiles.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote:\n   - The initial hand: [t1, t2, t3]\n\n We can consider:\n\n 1. Check if the hand already has a koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n 2. If not, then we consider drawing one tile (so total 4 tiles) and check if we can form a mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) with some of these 4 tiles.\n\n 3. If not, then consider drawing two tiles (total 5 tiles) and check if we can form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: we don't necessarily need to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu (three tiles) in the hand.\n\n But wait: the problem does not require to use all tiles. So we are only concerned with having at least one set of three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n However, note that the definition of koutsu requires three identical tiles. So for koutsu, we can have:\n\n   Example: [1m, 1m, 1m] -> koutsu.\n\n For shuntsu: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n But note: the hand might have duplicate tiles. So we need to consider frequencies and counts.\n\n However, we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose which ones to draw.\n\n Since the goal is to minimize the number of draws, we try:\n\n Step 1: Check for existing mentsu in the three-tile hand.\n\n Step 2: If none, check for possibility of forming a mentsu by drawing 1 tile.\n\n Step 3: If still not, check for drawing 2 tiles.\n\n Step 4: If still not, then drawing 3 tiles? But note: we can also form two mentsus? Actually, no: the problem only requires one mentsu.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to draw tiles arbitrarily, and we can use the drawn tiles to form one mentsu. We don't care about the rest.\n\n But note: the hand after drawing may have more than four or five tiles, but we only need one mentsu (any three tiles).\n\n However, we are minimizing the number of draws.\n\n Let's think about the possibilities:\n\n 0 draws: check if the three tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n 1 draw: We have four tiles. We can choose one tile arbitrarily. Then, we need to see if there exists a set of three tiles (from the four) that form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n 2 draws: We have five tiles. Similarly.\n\n But note: we can also consider that we might form a mentsu by drawing two tiles, but maybe we can form two different mentsus? Actually, we only need one.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose which tiles to draw. So we are free to choose any tiles.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can consider:\n\n  - To form a koutsu: We need three copies of a particular tile. So we can look at each distinct tile in the hand and see how many we have. Let the count of a tile 'x' be c. Then, to form a koutsu for x, we need 3 - c copies (if c < 3). But note: we can also use drawn tiles to complete a triplet.\n\n  - To form a shuntsu: We need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. The consecutive numbers are from 1 to 9. For example, for suit m, the possible sequences are [1,2,3], [2,3,4], ... [7,8,9]. \n\n However, the hand might have duplicates. For example, [1m, 1m, 2m, 3m] can form [1m,2m,3m] even though there are two 1m's.\n\n But note: the definition does not say that the tiles must be distinct. It says three sequential numbered tiles. However, in mahjong, a sequence requires distinct tiles. But the problem says: \"a shuntsu is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit\", and the example [5s,7s,6s] is valid. However, note that the example [5p, 4p, 6p] is given as a valid shuntsu. This implies that the order doesn't matter, and the three tiles must be distinct. Also, the example [9m,1m,2m] is invalid because it's not consecutive (since 9,1,2 is not consecutive). \n\n So for a shuntsu, we require three distinct tiles of the same suit and three consecutive numbers (when sorted, they should be n, n+1, n+2 for some n from 1 to 7).\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the tiles must be distinct. But the examples and the rule of mahjong usually require distinct tiles. And the example [5s,7s,6s] is given, which is [5,6,7] (so distinct). Therefore, we assume that the three tiles in a shuntsu must be distinct.\n\n Now, what are the cases?\n\n Case 0: 0 draws.\n\n   Check for koutsu: \n        Count the frequency of each tile (considering both digit and suit). \n        If any tile appears three times, then we have a koutsu.\n\n   Check for shuntsu:\n        Group by suit. For each suit, look at the digits (convert to int) that are present.\n        Then, check for any consecutive triplet in that suit (i.e., n, n+1, n+2 for n from 1 to 7).\n\n Case 1: 1 draw.\n\n   We can draw one tile. Then, we can form a mentsu in two ways:\n\n   Way 1: Complete a triplet (koutsu) by drawing two copies of an existing tile that has two copies, or one copy of a tile that has one copy (but then we need two more of that tile, so that doesn't work). Actually, to form a triplet we need three copies of the same tile.\n\n        Suppose we have two copies of tile X. Then we can draw one more X to get a koutsu.\n\n        Suppose we have one copy of tile X. Then we cannot form a triplet for X by drawing one tile (we need two more).\n\n        But note: we can also form a triplet for a tile that is not present? No, we need to base on existing tiles. Actually, we can draw a new tile arbitrarily. However, we can also form a triplet for a tile that is not in the hand? That would require drawing three of the same, but we are only drawing one. So no.\n\n        Therefore, for koutsu: if we have two of the same tile, then drawing one more gives a triplet.\n\n   Way 2: Complete a sequence (shuntsu) by drawing one tile that completes a sequence.\n\n        Consider: we have two tiles that are part of a potential sequence. For example, we have [1m, 2m] and we can draw 3m to complete [1m,2m,3m].\n\n        Or we have [1m, 3m] and we can draw 2m to complete [1m,2m,3m].\n\n        Or we have [2m, 3m] and we can draw 1m to complete [1m,2m,3m] (note: the sequence can be completed by a lower number). But wait: the example [9m,1m,2m] is invalid. However, the sequence must be consecutive and the numbers are taken modulo 10? No, the example says [9m,1m,2m] is invalid. So the sequence must be strictly increasing by one. Therefore, we cannot wrap around.\n\n        Also, note: the hand might have multiple possibilities.\n\n        We can consider for each suit separately.\n\n        For a given suit, let the set of distinct numbers present be S.\n\n        Then, for each number x in S, we can consider the sequences that include x:\n\n          Sequence starting at x-2: [x-2, x-1, x] -> then we need x-2 and x-1 (if x>=3)\n          Sequence starting at x-1: [x-1, x, x+1] -> then we need x-1 and x+1 (if x<=8)\n          Sequence starting at x:   [x, x+1, x+2] -> then we need x+1 and x+2 (if x<=7)\n\n        But note: we cannot use the same tile twice. So if we have two of the same tile, that doesn't help for forming two different sequences.\n\n        However, we are allowed to draw only one tile. So we can complete at most one missing tile in a sequence.\n\n        Condition: In a given sequence (for example, [x, x+1, x+2]), if we have two of the three, then we can draw the missing one.\n\n        But note: we can also form a sequence that uses a tile that is not currently in the hand? Actually, no: the sequence must be formed from the hand plus the drawn tile. So the drawn tile must be the missing one.\n\n        However, we can also consider that we might have two different sequences that can be completed by the same drawn tile? But we are only drawing one tile, so we can complete at most one sequence.\n\n        Example: hand [1m, 2m, 3m] -> already a sequence, so 0 draws.\n\n        Example: hand [1m, 1m, 2m] -> we have two 1m and one 2m. We can form the sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m. But note: we have two 1m's, but we only need one 1m for the sequence.\n\n        So for the sequence [1m,2m,3m]: we have two 1m and one 2m. We can use one 1m and the 2m, and then draw 3m. However, we can also form a triplet by drawing two more 1m's (but that requires two draws, so we are considering one draw).\n\n        Therefore, for shuntsu: we need to check for each suit and for each possible consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) whether we have two of the three.\n\n        However, we must account for duplicates: we can use at most one copy of each tile.\n\n        So for a sequence [n, n+1, n+2] in suit S, we need to check:\n\n          Let A = set of distinct numbers we have in suit S (ignoring duplicates for the purpose of forming the sequence? Actually, no: we can use one copy. But if we have two of the same, we can still use one for the sequence.)\n\n        Actually, we can use at most one copy per tile. So for the sequence, we require the presence of the three distinct numbers (each at least once). But if we are missing one, then we can complete by drawing that one.\n\n        However, wait: if we have two copies of one of the numbers, that doesn't help if we are missing another. We are limited by the requirement that we can only use one copy per tile for the sequence.\n\n        But note: the hand might have more than one copy of a tile, but we can only use one copy per tile in the sequence.\n\n        So for the sequence [n, n+1, n+2] (same suit), we need:\n\n          n, n+1, n+2 must be present (at least one copy of each). \n\n        However, we might not have one of them. Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n        But we are allowed to draw one tile. So if we are missing exactly one of the three, then we can complete the sequence by drawing that one.\n\n        However, what if we are missing two? Then we need two draws, so that is not considered in 1-draw.\n\n        So for 1-draw: for shuntsu, we can complete a sequence if there exists a consecutive triplet (in the same suit) such that we are missing exactly one tile in that triplet.\n\n        But note: the hand might have more than three tiles? No, initially we have three tiles. After drawing one, we have four. But we are forming a sequence from three of the four. However, the sequence must be three consecutive numbers. And we can use the existing tiles and the drawn tile.\n\n        However, the hand has three tiles. After drawing one, we have four. We can form a sequence from three of them.\n\n        But the condition for the sequence is that the three must be consecutive and same suit.\n\n        So for a given suit, we can consider the distinct numbers we have (ignoring duplicates). Then, we look for a consecutive triplet that is contained in the set of distinct numbers we have, but we are allowed to add one more number (by drawing) to complete a consecutive triplet.\n\n        Actually, we can also form a sequence that uses the drawn tile and two existing ones, or two drawn tiles? No, we are only drawing one.\n\n        So we need to check: for each consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) in a suit, we check if at least two of the three numbers are present in the hand (in that suit). Then, we can draw the missing one.\n\n        However, note: the hand might have more than one copy of a tile. But for the sequence, we only need one copy.\n\n        Example: hand [1m, 1m, 2m] in suit m: \n            We have two 1m and one 2m. The consecutive triplet [1,2,3] is missing 3. But we have two of the first two. So we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3m.\n\n        But wait, we have two 1m. We can use one 1m and the 2m to form the sequence [1,2,3] by drawing 3m.\n\n        However, what if the hand is [1m, 2m, 4m]? Then, we don't have a consecutive triplet. But we can form two separate sequences? No, we are only concerned with one mentsu.\n\n        For the sequence [2,3,4]: we have 2 and 4, but not 3. So we can draw 3m to complete [2,3,4]. But note: we have two tiles: 2m and 4m, and we draw 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m] and we can form [2,3,4] (using the 2m, the drawn 3m, and the 4m). So that works.\n\n        However, we must also consider that the drawn tile must be available (any tile, including duplicates). So we can draw 3m even if we don't have it.\n\n        Therefore, for 1-draw shuntsu: for a given suit, for each consecutive triplet (n from 1 to 7), check if at least two of the three numbers (n, n+1, n+2) are present in the hand (for that suit). Then, we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n        But note: the hand might have three tiles, but they might be distributed in multiple suits.\n\n        We must check for each suit separately.\n\n        Example: hand [1m, 1m, 2p] (so two in manzu, one in pinzu). Then, for manzu: we have [1,1] -> distinct {1}. For the consecutive triplets in manzu: \n            [1,2,3]: missing 2 and 3 -> not two present.\n            [0,1,2] -> not valid because 0 doesn't exist.\n            etc.\n\n        So we only consider n from 1 to 7.\n\n        Also, we must consider that the hand might have tiles from multiple suits. We are grouping by suit.\n\n        So algorithm for 1-draw:\n\n          Check for koutsu: if there is any tile that appears at least two times, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one more (so 1-draw).\n\n          Check for shuntsu: for each suit, let S be the set of distinct numbers in that suit. Then, for each n from 1 to 7, check if the set {n, n+1, n+2} has at least two elements in common with S. Then, we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n        However, note: what if the hand has two different suits and we draw a tile that completes a sequence in one suit? Then we don't care about the other.\n\n        But wait: the hand has three tiles. What if we have two tiles in one suit and one in another? Then the set S for the suit with two tiles has two distinct numbers? Not necessarily: the two tiles could be the same.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 2p] -> for manzu: set S_m = {1}, for pinzu: set S_p = {2}. Then, for manzu: no consecutive triplet can be completed (because we only have one distinct number). For pinzu: we have {2}. Then, the consecutive triplets that include 2: [0,1,2] (invalid because 0 and 1 are not in pinzu and 0 doesn't exist), [1,2,3] -> we have 2, but not 1 and 3. [2,3,4] -> we have 2, then we need 3 and 4. So we don't have two in any consecutive triplet for pinzu.\n\n        But wait, we have only one tile in pinzu. So we cannot form a sequence by drawing one tile because we need three consecutive. With one tile, we can only get two more to complete a triplet? No, for a sequence we need three consecutive. We have one tile (say 2p). We can draw 1p and 3p to complete the sequence [1p,2p,3p] but that requires two draws. \n\n        However, we are checking for one draw: so we can only complete a sequence if we are missing exactly one tile from a consecutive triplet.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for shuntsu with one draw is: there exists a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) in a suit, and the hand (in that suit) contains at least two of the three numbers.\n\n        But note: the hand might have two tiles in the same suit, but they might be the same number? Then the set S for that suit has only one element. Then, we cannot form a sequence because we need three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n        So the condition for shuntsu in a suit is: the suit has at least two distinct numbers (so that we have two different numbers) and one of the consecutive triplets (n, n+1, n+2) has at least two numbers in the set of distinct numbers of that suit.\n\n        However, we can also have the same number duplicated and then a different number. Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> distinct numbers {1,2}. Then, the consecutive triplet [1,2,3] has two numbers (1 and 2) present. So we can complete by drawing 3m.\n\n        But note: we might have [1m,1m,1m] -> then we already have a koutsu, so we don't consider this for shuntsu.\n\n        However, we are checking for 1-draw, so we are assuming no mentsu in the initial three.\n\n        So steps:\n\n          Step 0: Check the three tiles for koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n          Step 1: If found, output 0.\n\n          Step 2: Else, check if we can form a koutsu or a shuntsu by drawing one tile.\n\n          Step 3: If yes, output 1.\n\n          Step 4: Else, check if we can form a koutsu or a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n          Step 5: If yes, output 2.\n\n          Step 6: Else, we need to draw three tiles? Actually, wait: we can always form a triplet by drawing three copies of a tile that we have one of. So the maximum is 2 draws? \n\n          But wait: consider if we have three distinct tiles, none of which are duplicates and not forming a sequence. Then:\n\n            Drawing two tiles: we can form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles (if we have one copy, then two draws to get three). \n\n            Alternatively, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles. For example, if we have [1m, 4m, 7m] (all same suit) then we can draw 2m,3m to form [1,2,3] or [4,5,6] or [7,8,9]? Actually, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles if we have two tiles that are two apart? \n\n            Example: [1m, 1m, 4m] -> we have two 1m and one 4m. We can form a triplet by drawing one more 1m (so 1 draw). But if we have [1m, 4m, 7m] (each distinct) then:\n\n                Koutsu: we don't have duplicates, so we can complete a triplet by drawing two more of any one (minimum two draws).\n\n                Shuntsu: we have one tile per number. We can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles: for example, for [1,2,3] we need 2m and 3m. Or for [4,5,6] we need 5m and 6m. Or for [7,8,9] we need 8m and 9m.\n\n            So we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n            But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing two tiles: for example, if we have one tile, we can draw two more of that tile to get a triplet. So if we have [1m,4m,7m] and we draw two 1m's, then we have [1m,1m,1m,4m,7m] and we have a triplet.\n\n            Therefore, the minimum number of draws for [1m,4m,7m] is 2 (either by forming a triplet or a sequence).\n\n          However, is there a possibility that we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles in a way that we complete two different sets? But we only need one.\n\n          Therefore, the answer can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n          Why not 3? Actually, we can always form a triplet by drawing two more of any one of the existing tiles (if we have at least one). But wait: if we have three distinct tiles, then we have three different tiles. We can choose one of them and draw two copies. Then we have a triplet. So the worst-case is 2 draws.\n\n          However, wait: what if we have three tiles from different suits? Then we can form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of them.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is at most 2.\n\n          But wait: what if we have two tiles of the same suit and one of another? Then we might complete a sequence by drawing one tile (if we have two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive or one apart). \n\n          Example: [1m,2m,3p] -> \n            Already: no koutsu (all distinct). For shuntsu: in manzu we have [1,2] and then we can draw 3m to complete [1,2,3]m. So one draw.\n\n          Another example: [1m,2m,4p] -> \n            Already: no mentsu.\n            One draw: \n              Koutsu: we have two distinct in manzu, so no two same. So no koutsu by drawing one.\n              Shuntsu: in manzu we have [1,2] -> so we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3m. So one draw.\n\n          Example: [1m,1m,1m] -> already a koutsu, so 0.\n\n          Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> already no mentsu? Actually, no: we have two 1m and one 2m. \n            Is there a koutsu? Not until we have three 1m. \n            Is there a shuntsu? [1,2,3] is missing 3. But we don't have a triplet. However, we have two 1m and one 2m: we can form a sequence [1,2,3] by drawing 3m. But we can also form a triplet by drawing one more 1m. So we have two possibilities: one draw (either for koutsu or for shuntsu). Therefore, the minimum is 1.\n\n          So we must check for koutsu and shuntsu independently for one draw.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n            Step 0: Represent the tiles as (suit, number) and convert number to int.\n\n            Step 1: Check for koutsu in the three tiles.\n\n                Count the frequency of each tile (both by suit and number). If any tile appears three times, then return 0.\n\n            Step 2: Check for shuntsu in the three tiles.\n\n                Group by suit. For each suit, extract the distinct numbers (if we have duplicates, we only need one copy for the sequence, but note: we might use duplicates for two different sequences? Actually, we are only forming one mentsu. However, the initial check for shuntsu: we need three consecutive distinct numbers in the same suit.\n\n                For a given suit, let S be the set of distinct numbers. Then, for n in range(1,8):\n                    if {n, n+1, n+2} <= S: then we have a shuntsu.\n\n                If found, return 0.\n\n            Step 3: Check for 1-draw.\n\n                Part A: Koutsu by drawing one tile.\n\n                    For each distinct tile type (suit and number) in the hand, let count = frequency. Then, if count >= 2, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one more of that tile.\n\n                    However, note: if we have two of the same tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives three.\n\n                Part B: Shuntsu by drawing one tile.\n\n                    For each suit, let S be the set of distinct numbers in that suit.\n\n                    For each n in range(1,8):\n                        Let T = {n, n+1, n+2}\n                        If T is a subset of S, then we already have the sequence (so 0, but we already checked so skip).\n                        Else, if T has at least two elements in common with S, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n                    But note: we might have multiple suits. We only need one.\n\n                However, wait: we have three tiles. The set S for a suit might be built from the distinct numbers. But if the hand has two tiles in the same suit, then S for that suit has at most two distinct numbers (if the two tiles are different) or one (if same).\n\n                Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> S_m = {1,2}. Then for T = {1,2,3}: two in common (1 and 2). So we can complete.\n\n                Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> already a shuntsu, so we would have caught it in step 2.\n\n            Step 4: Check for 2-draw.\n\n                Part A: Koutsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                    For any tile type (suit and number) that appears at least once, we can draw two more to complete a triplet. So if we have at least one copy of a tile, then we can complete a triplet by drawing two.\n\n                    However, note: we might already have two copies? Then we would have caught it in step 3 (because we require at least two to complete with one draw). So if we have only one copy, then two draws.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have three distinct tiles? Then we have one copy per tile. Then for each tile, we can complete a triplet by drawing two. So the minimum for koutsu is two draws.\n\n                Part B: Shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                    We need to complete a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) in a suit. We can do that by drawing two tiles if we are missing two of the three.\n\n                    Conditions:\n\n                      In a suit, we have a set S (distinct numbers). Then, for a consecutive triplet T = {n, n+1, n+3} (wait, no: we need three consecutive). Actually, we need to complete the entire set T.\n\n                    We can complete a consecutive triplet T (which has three numbers) by drawing the two missing numbers (if we have one of the three). \n\n                    However, we might have two numbers of a triplet, then we only need one draw (already considered). So for two draws, we are looking for a consecutive triplet T for which we have exactly one of the three numbers.\n\n                    Then, we can draw the other two.\n\n                    But note: we might have two different consecutive triplets that can be completed by two draws? We only need one.\n\n                    Example: [1m, 4m, 7m] (three distinct, same suit). Then, for T1 = {1,2,3}: we have 1, missing 2,3 -> two draws needed.\n                            T2 = {4,5,6}: we have 4, missing 5,6 -> two draws.\n                            T3 = {7,8,9}: we have 7, missing 8,9 -> two draws.\n\n                    So we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                    But note: we might have two tiles that are part of two different triplets? \n\n                    Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] (same suit). Then, \n                      T1 = {1,2,3}: we have 1 and 2, so we can complete by drawing 3 (one draw, already considered in step 3).\n                      T2 = {2,3,4}: we have 2 and 4, so we can complete by drawing 3 (one draw, already considered).\n                      T3 = {1,2,3} and {2,3,4} are overlapping.\n\n                    Example: [1m, 3m, 5m] (same suit). Then, \n                      T1 = {1,2,3}: we have 1,3 -> two in common, so one draw (by drawing 2m) -> already considered.\n                      T2 = {2,3,4}: we have 3, so one in common -> we can complete by drawing 2 and 4 (two draws).\n                      T3 = {3,4,5}: we have 3 and 5, so one draw (by drawing 4) -> already considered.\n\n                    So in this example, we have two possibilities: one draw (for T1 and T3) and two draws (for T2). But we already catch the one-draw case.\n\n            Therefore, we can always achieve a mentsu by at most two draws.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            if (initial hand has mentsu): print(0)\n            else if (can complete a koutsu with one draw OR can complete a shuntsu with one draw): print(1)\n            else: print(2)\n\n            But wait: is there a case where we cannot complete a mentsu by two draws? \n\n            Consider: we have three tiles from three different suits. Example: [1m,1p,1s] (three ones from different suits). \n\n            Step 0: no koutsu (each tile is distinct) and no shuntsu (different suits).\n\n            Step 1: one-draw: \n                Koutsu: we have three distinct tiles, so no two same. So no koutsu by one draw.\n                Shuntsu: for each suit, we have only one distinct number. So for manzu: {1}; for pinzu: {1}; for souzu: {1}. None of the consecutive triplets (n from 1 to 7) has at least two numbers in any suit. So no.\n\n            Then, two-draw: \n                Koutsu: we can draw two more 1m (then we have three 1m) -> so we can form a triplet. So two draws.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n            Another example: [1m, 2p, 3s] (three distinct, different suits). \n                Step 0: no.\n                Step 1: \n                  Koutsu: no duplicates -> no.\n                  Shuntsu: each suit has one tile -> no consecutive triplet (needs three distinct in the same suit) -> no.\n                Step 2: two-draw: \n                  Koutsu: we can draw two more of any one. So 2.\n\n            But wait: can we form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles? We need three consecutive in the same suit. We have one tile per suit. We can draw two tiles in one suit? \n\n            Example: in manzu, we have [1m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1,2,3] in manzu. So two draws.\n\n            So the two-draw condition is always satisfied (either by koutsu or shuntsu) because:\n\n              - For koutsu: choose any tile (at least one exists) and draw two copies.\n\n              - For shuntsu: choose any suit (there are three suits, but we have at least one tile in a suit) and then choose a consecutive triplet that includes the number we have and then draw the two missing ones (if we have one number, then two draws).\n\n            However, note: what if the hand has two tiles from the same suit? Then we might be able to complete a shuntsu by one draw, so we don't need to go to two draws.\n\n            Therefore, the worst-case is two draws.\n\n            But wait: is two draws always sufficient? \n\n            Yes: because we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles. So the answer is at most 2.\n\n            Therefore, the answer can only be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n            Now, we just need to code accordingly.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Let tiles = input().split()\n\n            We'll represent each tile as (suit, number) where number is int(tile[0]), suit is tile[1]\n\n            Step 1: Check for 0 draws.\n\n            Check_koutsu_0 = any tile repeated three times? \n                Count = {}\n                for tile in tiles:\n                    key = (tile[1], int(tile[0]))\n                    Count[key] = Count.get(key,0)+1\n                if any count>=3: return 0\n\n            Check_shuntsu_0 = \n                Group by suit: \n                groups = {}\n                for tile in tiles:\n                    s = tile[1]\n                    num = int(tile[0])\n                    groups.setdefault(s, set()).add(num)\n\n                for s, nums in groups.items():\n                    # sort the set of numbers and check for consecutive triplet\n                    lst = sorted(nums)\n                    # We are looking for a consecutive triplet in the sorted list\n                    # But we don't need to sort the entire set?

Drawing the missing number completes a sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two-Draw Mentsu**:\n   - If no existing or one-draw mentsu is found, the answer is 2 because:\n     - **Koutsu**: Drawing two more of any existing tile forms a triplet.\n     - **Shuntsu**: Drawing two missing numbers of any sequence forms a valid sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for t in data:\n        num_char = t[0]\n        suit_char = t[1]\n        tiles.append((int(num_char), suit_char))\n    \n    count_dict = {}\n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        key = (suit, num)\n        count_dict[key] = count_dict.get(key, 0) + 1\n        \n    # Check for koutsu (triplet) in the initial three tiles\n    if any(count >= 3 for count in count_dict.values()):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    groups = {}\n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        if suit not in groups:\n            groups[suit] = set()\n        groups[suit].add(num)\n        \n    # Check for shuntsu (sequence) in the initial three tiles\n    for suit, nums_set in groups.items():\n        nums_list = sorted(nums_set)\n        n = len(nums_list)\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if nums_list[i+1] == nums_list[i] + 1 and nums_list[i+2] == nums_list[i] + 2:\n                print(0)\n                return\n                \n    # Check for one-draw possibility\n    # Koutsu: any tile with two copies can be completed by one draw\n    for key, cnt in count_dict.items():\n        if cnt == 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Shuntsu: for each suit, check if two numbers of a consecutive triplet are present\n    for suit, nums_set in groups.items():\n        nums_list = sorted(nums_set)\n        n = len(nums_list)\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            triplet = {start, start+1, start+2}\n            common = triplet & nums_set\n            if len(common) == 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n                \n    # If none of the above, then two draws are needed\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check for Existing Mentsu**: The code first checks if any tile appears three times (koutsu) or if there's a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit (shuntsu).
