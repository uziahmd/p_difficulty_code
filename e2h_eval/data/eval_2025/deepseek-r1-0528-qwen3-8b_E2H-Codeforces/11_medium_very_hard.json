A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\nWe are given one line of input containing 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nWhere:\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes\n- d: number of slices per lime\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But wait, let me read carefully.)\n\nActually, the problem says: \n  \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nBut then, they want to make as many toasts as they can, with all friends drinking the same amount.\n\nImportant: Each toast requires:\n  - For each friend: nl milliliters of the drink, 1 slice of lime, and np grams of salt?\nWait, no. The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\nBut note: if there are n friends, then for one toast, each friend must have their own portion? Actually, the problem is about making toasts and having all friends drink the same amount.\n\nLet me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\nThis means that for one toast, we need:\n  - Drink: n * nl milliliters (because each of the n friends gets nl milliliters)\n  - Lime slices: n slices (each friend gets one slice)\n  - Salt: n * np grams (each friend gets np grams)\n\nHowever, wait! The example input: \n  \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\nExplanation from the note:\n  Overall the friends have 4*5 = 20 milliliters -> enough for 20 / (nl * n) toasts? But wait, the example says: \n      \"20 / 3 = 6 toasts\" [Wait, why divided by 3? Because nl is 3 and there are 3 friends? Then total drink needed per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml? But wait, in the example it says: 20/3=6 toasts.\n\nWait, actually the example says: \n  \"20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\nBut wait, what is the requirement per toast? The requirement per toast is: \n  - Drink: n * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 ml per toast.\nBut wait, the input says nl=3 (ml) and n=3 (friends). So one toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml.\n\nBut the example calculation says: \n  \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\nWait, that doesn't match. They are dividing by 3, but according to our reasoning, we should divide by 9.\n\nBut wait, the example input has nl=3 and np=1. And the example output is 2.\n\nAlternatively, let me read the example again: \n  \"The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nAnd the example says: \n  \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\nSo they calculated:\n  - Drink: 4 bottles * 5 ml = 20 ml. Each toast requires how much drink? The example says: 20 ml is enough for 6 toasts. Then 20/3=6? So they are saying that one toast requires 3 ml? \n\nBut wait, the requirement: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" (nl=3) and there are 3 friends -> so one toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Then 20 ml would be 20/9 ≈ 2.22 toasts, which would be 2.\n\nBut the example says 6 toasts. \n\nLet me check the example input: \n  Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\nThey say: \n  \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, here they are using the value nl=3, but not multiplying by the number of friends. \n\nThis suggests that the requirement for drink per toast is actually just nl (3 ml), not n*nl.\n\nBut wait, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So if there are n friends, then one toast requires n * nl.\n\nBut the example calculation does not multiply by n. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is ambiguous. Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n\"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nThis implies that for one toast, each friend (so all n friends) must have their own portion. Therefore, the total drink required for one toast is n * nl.\n\nBut the example calculation uses 20 / 3 = 6, meaning they are treating the drink requirement per toast as nl (not n*nl).\n\nWait, the example also says: \n  \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\"\n\nEach lime gives d=8 slices, and there are c=10 limes -> 80 slices.\n\nNow, how many slices per toast? According to the requirement: one toast requires one slice per friend? Then one toast would require n slices. But wait, the example doesn't multiply by n for the lime requirement.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a slice of lime\" (singular) per friend? Or per toast?\n\nThe sentence: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\" — meaning each friend gets one slice for the toast.\n\nSo for one toast, we need n slices (one for each friend).\n\nThen the lime constraint: \n  Total slices available: c * d = 10 * 8 = 80.\n  Each toast requires n slices. So maximum toasts from limes is 80 // n = 80 // 3 ≈ 26.66 -> 26 toasts.\n\nBut the example says: \n  \"The limes are enough for 80 toasts\"\n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nWait, the example says: \n  \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\nBut note: the example says the drink is 20 ml, which is enough for 6 toasts (so 20/3 = 6). Then the limes are 80, and the salt is 100. Then they take the minimum (6) and divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\nBut wait, why is the drink 20 ml enough for 6 toasts? That would mean 20 ml per toast? No, wait: 6 toasts * 3 ml (nl) = 18 ml, which is <=20. But then why 6? Because 20//3 = 6 (using integer division?).\n\nBut then the lime: 80 slices, and if each toast requires n=3 slices, then 80 // 3 = 26. But the example says the lime part is 80 toasts.\n\nWait, I think I misread the example explanation.\n\nThe example explanation says: \n  \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\"\n\nMeaning: each toast requires 1 slice (not n slices) because they are counting the total slices as 80, and each toast uses one slice? \n\nBut wait, the requirement says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So if there are n friends, then one toast must have n slices. \n\nUnless... the problem intended that one toast is for one friend? But then the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams of salt\" to make one toast. \n\nBut then the entire group? Or each friend independently?\n\nThe problem says: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nAnd then: \"each friend needs ...\".\n\nThis might mean: they are going to have a group toast. However, the way the example counts the drink and limes and salt seems to be independent of the number of friends for the drink and salt (except that they divide the total toasts by n at the end).\n\nWait, let me reexamine the example:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nOutput: 2\n\nSteps in the example:\n1. Drink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 ml (nl) -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (floor division? but 20//3=6, yes).\n2. Limes: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast requires 1 slice (so 80 toasts possible).\n3. Salt: 100 / 1 = 100 toasts.\n\nThen the limiting factor is the drink: 6 toasts. Then, since there are 3 friends, and they must drink the same amount, we divide the total toasts by the number of friends? \n\nBut wait, if we have 6 toasts, and 3 friends, then each friend makes 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\nBut wait, what does one toast mean? \n\nIf one toast is an event where all friends drink together, then one toast requires:\n  - Drink: 3 * 3 = 9 ml (for all three friends)\n  - Lime: 3 slices (one per friend)\n  - Salt: 3 * 1 = 3 grams\n\nThen the drink would be: 20 ml -> 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts (each toast being a group toast). Then each friend would have 2 toasts.\n\nBut wait, the example calculation did:\n\n  min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\n\nBut 6 was the drink without multiplying by n. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be defining a toast as one set of drinks for all friends? Or is a toast for one friend?\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams\" to make a toast. \n\nThis implies that if one friend makes one toast, they use nl, one slice, and np. But then the entire group: if they all make the same number of toasts, then the total drink used is n * (number of toasts per friend) * nl.\n\nBut then the total toasts (from the group's perspective) is the number of toasts per friend multiplied by the number of friends? \n\nWait, but the problem asks: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\nSo we are to compute the number of toasts per friend.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Drink: total available = k * l\n   Each friend requires (nl * (toasts per friend)) ml.\n   So total drink required = n * (nl * x) <= k * l, where x is the number of toasts per friend.\n\n   => x <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\n2. Lime: total slices = c * d\n   Each friend requires 1 slice per toast, so total slices required = n * x\n   => x <= (c * d) / n\n\n3. Salt: total grams = p\n   Each friend requires (np * x) grams\n   => x <= p / (np * n)\n\nBut wait, the example does:\n\n  Drink: 4*5=20, then 20 / 3 = 6 (which is the total toasts for the entire group? because 6 toasts for the entire group would be 3*6=18 ml, which matches the drink requirement for 6 group toasts (each group toast uses 9 ml, so 6*9=54? Wait, no, that doesn't match).\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that a toast is for one friend, then:\n\nTotal drink for x toasts per friend (with n friends): n * x * nl <= k*l\n=> x <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nTotal lime: n * x * 1 <= c*d   [since each friend uses one slice per toast]\n=> x <= (c*d) / n\n\nTotal salt: n * x * np <= p\n=> x <= p / (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values, and then we take the floor (integer) part.\n\nBut wait, the example:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nDrink: (4*5) = 20 ml\nConstraint: x <= 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so x=2.\n\nLime: 10*8=80 slices\nConstraint: x <= 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> x=26.\n\nSalt: 100 / (3*1) = 100/3 ≈33.33 -> x=33.\n\nThen the answer is 2.\n\nBut the example explanation said:\n\n  \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\nWait, 6 was 20/3 (which is 20 divided by nl, not by n*nl). \n\nAlternatively, maybe they computed:\n\nTotal toasts (if we consider the entire group as making toasts together) is limited by:\n\n  Drink: total toasts T such that T * (n * nl) <= k*l  => T <= (k*l)/(n*nl) -> T_max_drink = (4*5)/(3*3)=20/9≈2.22 -> T=2 (group toasts)\n\nBut then each friend makes T toasts (because one group toast is one toast for each friend). So each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\nBut wait, the example explanation did:\n\n  \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\nHere, 6, 80, 100 are the total toasts (for the entire group) if we were to consider one toast as one drink portion for one friend? \n\nWait, if we consider a toast as one drink portion for one friend, then:\n\n  Drink: each toast (for one friend) uses nl ml. There are n friends, so for T toasts (each friend making x toasts, so T = n*x) the total drink is n*x*nl <= k*l.\n\nBut wait, then the total toasts (for the entire group) is n*x.\n\nBut the example explanation breaks it down as:\n\n  Drink: 20 ml is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if a toast is one friend's portion). But wait, 6 toasts (for the entire group) would be 6/(number of friends) toasts per friend? \n\nActually, if a toast is defined as one set of drinks for one friend, then:\n\n  Total toasts (across all friends) cannot exceed: \n    from drink: (k*l) / nl\n    from lime: (c*d) / 1   (each toast uses one slice)\n    from salt: p / np\n\nBut then the total toasts (for the entire group) is limited by these, and then we divide by the number of friends? \n\nBut wait, the condition is that all friends drink the same amount. So if we let x be the number of toasts per friend, then the total number of toasts (each being one friend's consumption) is n*x.\n\nConstraints:\n\n  Drink: n*x*nl <= k*l   => x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n  Lime: n*x <= c*d        => x <= (c*d) / n\n  Salt: n*x*np <= p       => x <= p / (n*np)\n\nBut note: the example explanation does:\n\n  Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 -> which is (k*l) / nl = 20/3 ≈6.66 -> floor 6? But wait, that doesn't account for the number of friends.\n\nWait, maybe they are calculating the total toasts (without grouping) as:\n\n  Total toasts T = (minimum of (k*l)/nl, (c*d), p/np) \n\nBut then, since each friend must drink the same amount, the number of toasts per friend is T / n.\n\nBut wait, the drink constraint: if we consider each toast (as one friend's portion) then we need nl per toast, so total toasts T_drink = (k*l) / nl, but then T_drink is the total number of toasts (each for one friend) that can be made. Similarly, T_lime = c*d (each toast uses one slice) and T_salt = p/np.\n\nThen the total toasts (for the entire group) is min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt). Then, since each friend must drink the same amount, we divide by n.\n\nBut wait, let's compute with the example:\n\n  T_drink = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.66 -> floor? but the example used 20/3=6 (integer division? or floor?).\n\nBut the example says: \"20 / 3 = 6 toasts\", meaning they are doing integer division (floor).\n\nThen T_drink = 6\nT_lime = 80 (since 10*8=80)\nT_salt = 100 / 1 = 100\n\nThen T = min(6,80,100)=6\n\nThen toasts per friend = T / n = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\nBut wait, how does this model work?\n\nIn this model, a toast is defined as one drink portion (nl ml) for one friend. Then the total toasts (across all friends) is 6. Since there are 3 friends, each friend can have 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\nBut then the drink used: 3 friends * 2 toasts * 3 ml = 18 ml, which is within 20 ml.\n\nLime: 3 friends * 2 toasts * 1 slice = 6 slices, which is within 80 slices.\n\nSalt: 3 friends * 2 toasts * 1 gram = 6 grams, which is within 100 grams.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut wait, why did they call it \"toasts\"? In the problem, a toast is defined as requiring for each friend: nl, one slice, and np. But in this model, we are breaking the toast into individual friend's portions. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams\" to make a toast. \n\nThis means that if one friend makes one toast, they use nl, one slice, and np. \n\nBut then, if we have multiple friends, and they all make the same number of toasts, then the total resources are:\n\n  Drink: n * (number of toasts per friend) * nl\n  Lime: n * (number of toasts per friend)\n  Salt: n * (number of toasts per friend) * np\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the second model above.\n\nSo the two models are equivalent:\n\nModel 1 (per friend's toast):\n  Let x be the number of toasts per friend.\n  Then total drink = n * x * nl\n  Total lime = n * x\n  Total salt = n * x * np\n\nModel 2 (total toasts across friends is T = n*x):\n  Then constraints are:\n      T * nl <= k*l   [but wait, no: because in model 1, the drink is n*x*nl, so if T = n*x, then drink = T * nl? Actually, no: because in model 1, we have n*x*nl = (n*x)*nl = T * nl. Similarly, lime = T, and salt = T*np.\n\nBut wait, in model 2, the constraints become:\n\n  T (the total number of toasts, i.e., the total number of times a friend has drunk) must satisfy:\n\n      T <= (k*l) / nl\n      T <= (c*d)   [because each toast uses one slice, and total slices is c*d]\n      T <= p / np\n\nAnd then the number of toasts per friend is T / n.\n\nBut note: T must be an integer and divisible by n? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that the total toasts must be divisible by n. However, since all friends must drink the same amount, T must be divisible by n. But we are taking the floor (because we can only have whole toasts).\n\nBut wait, we don't require T to be divisible by n. We can have T = n*x, where x is an integer (the number of toasts per friend). So we are effectively looking for the maximum x (integer) such that:\n\n  n*x <= (k*l) / nl   [actually, drink: n*x*nl <= k*l] -> x <= (k*l)/(n*nl)\n  n*x <= c*d          -> x <= (c*d)/n\n  n*x*np <= p         -> x <= p/(n*np)\n\nSo x = floor(min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) ))\n\nBut wait, in the example:\n\n  (k*l) = 20, n=3, nl=3 -> (20)/(3*3)=20/9≈2.22 -> floor 2.\n  (c*d)=80, n=3 -> 80/3≈26.66 -> floor 26.\n  p/(n*np)=100/(3*1)=100/3≈33.33 -> floor 33.\n\nThen x=2.\n\nBut the example explanation used:\n\n  min( (k*l)/nl, c*d, p/np ) / n = min(20/3, 80, 100) / 3 = min(6.66,80,100)/3 = 6.66/3=2.22 -> floor 2.\n\nWait, that's the same result.\n\nBut wait, the example explanation did integer division (floor) for the drink and lime and salt? Actually, they did:\n\n  Drink: 20/3=6 (floor)\n  Lime: 80 (no division, so 80)\n  Salt: 100/1=100\n\nThen min(6,80,100)=6, then 6/3=2.\n\nBut note: the drink constraint in the example was expressed as (k*l)/nl, which is 20/3=6.66, but they took 6 (floor). \n\nBut wait, in the second model, the total toasts T must be an integer. The constraints for T are:\n\n  T <= floor((k*l)/nl)   [if we consider integer toasts]?\n  T <= c*d\n  T <= floor(p/np)\n\nBut wait, the example didn't use floor for the salt: 100/1=100 is integer.\n\nHowever, the drink: 20/3 is 6.66, so the maximum T (total toasts) from drink is 6 (because 7*3=21>20).\n\nSimilarly, for the lime: 80, so T<=80.\nFor the salt: T<=100.\n\nSo T_min = min( floor((k*l)/nl), c*d, floor(p/np) ) = min(6,80,100)=6.\n\nThen toasts per friend = T/n = 6/3=2.\n\nBut wait, why did they use floor for drink and not for the other constraints? \n\nActually, the drink constraint is: T * nl <= k*l -> T <= k*l / nl. Since T must be integer, we take floor(k*l / nl). Similarly, the lime constraint: T <= c*d (which is integer) and salt: T * np <= p -> T <= p/np, so we take floor(p/np).\n\nBut wait, the example didn't do floor for salt, but the salt constraint is T * np <= p, so T <= p/np. Then the maximum integer T is floor(p/np). But in the example, p/np=100, which is integer, so floor(100)=100.\n\nBut note: the example did:\n\n  min(6,80,100)=6.\n\nBut wait, the drink constraint is T <= 20/3, so maximum T is 6 (because 6*3=18<=20, but 7*3=21>20).\n\nBut in the second model, we are using:\n\n  T_drink = floor((k*l) / nl)   [but wait, is that correct?]\n\nActually, the drink constraint is: T * nl <= k*l, so T <= (k*l)/nl. Then the maximum integer T is floor((k*l)/nl) if (k*l)/nl is not an integer? Actually, no: we can have T = floor((k*l)/nl) if (k*l)%nl !=0 then we cannot use the next integer. But note: if we have 20 ml and nl=3, then the maximum T such that T*3<=20 is floor(20/3)=6.\n\nSimilarly, for salt: T*np <= p -> T <= p/np, so the maximum T is floor(p/np).\n\nBut wait, for lime: T <= c*d, and c*d is integer, so T_max = c*d.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n  T_drink = (k*l) // nl   [if we use integer division?] but wait, if (k*l) is not divisible by nl, then we take floor.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integers\", so we can use integer division (floor division) for the drink and salt.\n\nHowever, wait: the drink and salt constraints are linear. We can use:\n\n  T1 = (k * l) // nl   if we are doing integer toasts? But wait, we are allowed to use fractional toasts? No, toasts are whole.\n\nBut wait, the example did 20/3=6.66... and took 6. So we are using floor division.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that we are not exceeding the available resources.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n  Read n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n  Step 1: Compute the total resources:\n\n      total_drink = k * l\n      total_slices = c * d\n      total_salt = p\n\n  Step 2: Compute the maximum total toasts T (across all friends) as:\n\n      T_drink = total_drink // nl   [but wait, if we use floor division, then we are assuming we can only use whole toasts. However, the condition is T_drink = floor(total_drink / nl) ? Actually, we can use up to floor(total_drink / nl) toasts for the drink? \n\n  But wait, the condition is: T * nl <= total_drink. The maximum T is floor(total_drink / nl) if total_drink % nl !=0 then we can use T = total_drink // nl (which is floor division) and then we have some leftover.\n\n  Similarly, T_salt = p // np   [because T*np <= p -> T <= p/np, so T_max_salt = p // np (floor division)].\n\n  And T_lime = total_slices   [because T <= total_slices, and total_slices is integer].\n\n  Then T_max = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n  Then the number of toasts per friend is T_max // n   [since we must divide the total toasts equally among n friends, and we can only have whole toasts per friend?]\n\nWait, no. Actually, the total toasts T_max is the maximum total toasts (each toast being one friend's portion) that can be made. Then we must divide T_max by n (the number of friends) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nBut note: T_max must be divisible by n? No, because we can have T_max not divisible by n, but then we can only assign floor(T_max / n) toasts to each friend, and then we have leftovers. But wait, the problem says they all drink the same amount, so we can only assign a whole number of toasts to each friend.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each friend can make [an integer] number of toasts\", so we are to find the maximum integer x (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n  n*x <= T_max   [but wait, T_max is the maximum total toasts, so x = T_max // n?]\n\nBut wait, actually, the constraints on the resources are:\n\n  Drink: n*x*nl <= k*l   -> x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n  Lime: n*x <= c*d        -> x <= (c*d) / n\n  Salt: n*x*np <= p       -> x <= p/(n*np)\n\nBut we already computed T_max from the three constraints (in terms of total toasts). Then x = T_max // n? \n\nWait, no. Because the resource constraints are:\n\n  T_max_drink = (k*l) // nl   [maximum total toasts from drink] \n  T_max_lime = c*d\n  T_max_salt = p // np\n\nThen the overall T_max = min(T_max_drink, T_max_lime, T_max_salt)\n\nBut then, we cannot simply assign T_max // n toasts per friend because T_max might not be divisible by n. However, the condition is that all friends must drink the same amount, and we are to maximize the number of toasts per friend (which must be an integer).\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n  x = min( (k*l) // (n*nl) , (c*d) // n , p // (n*np) )\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me test with the example:\n\n  (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2 (because 9*2=18<=20, 9*3=27>20)\n  (c*d) // n = 80 // 3 = 26 (because 3*26=78<=80, 3*27=81>80)\n  p // (n*np) = 100 // (3*1) = 33 (because 3*1*33=99<=100, 3*1*34=102>100)\n\nThen x = 2.\n\nBut wait, is the drink constraint correctly represented by (k*l) // (n*nl)? \n\nIn the drink constraint: we need n*x*nl <= k*l.\n\nIf we set x=2, then n*x*nl = 3*2*3=18<=20 -> valid.\n\nBut if we set x=3, then 3*3*3=27>20 -> invalid.\n\nSo the drink constraint: x <= (k*l) / (n*nl) -> maximum integer x is floor((k*l) / (n*nl)).\n\nSimilarly for lime: x <= (c*d) / n -> floor((c*d)/n)\n\nFor salt: x <= p/(n*np) -> floor(p/(n*np))\n\nTherefore, we can compute:\n\n  x = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\nBut wait, is integer division the same as floor division for positive numbers? Yes.\n\nBut wait, note: the drink constraint is n*x*nl <= k*l, so x <= (k*l) / (n*nl). The maximum integer x is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)).\n\nSimilarly, the lime constraint: n*x <= c*d -> x <= (c*d)/n, so x_max = floor(c*d/n)\n\nSalt: n*x*np <= p -> x <= p/(n*np), so x_max = floor(p/(n*np))\n\nBut wait, the example used:\n\n  min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n\n\nBut that gave the same result: \n\n  (k*l)//nl = 20//3 = 6\n  Then 6//3=2.\n\nBut note: the two methods are equivalent:\n\nMethod 1 (using total toasts T):\n\n  T_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   # This is the total toasts (each toast being one friend's portion) that can be made.\n\n  Then toasts per friend = T_max // n\n\nBut wait, is that always the same?\n\nIn the example: T_max = 6, then 6//3=2.\n\nBut let me try another example: \n\nInput: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\nAccording to the example, output is 3.\n\nCompute with method 1 (using x directly):\n\n  n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n  Drink: (k*l) = 1000 ml.\n        x_drink = 1000 // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n\n  Lime: (c*d)=1*19=19\n        x_lime = 19 // 5 = 3 (because 5*3=15<=19, 5*4=20>19)\n\n  Salt: p=90, n*np=5*3=15\n        x_salt = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n  Then x = min(50,3,6)=3.\n\nWith method 2 (total toasts T):\n\n  T_max_drink = (k*l) // nl = 1000 //4 = 250\n  T_max_lime = c*d = 19\n  T_max_salt = p // np = 90 //3 =30\n\n  Then T_max = min(250,19,30)=19\n\n  Then toasts per friend = T_max // n = 19 //5 = 3.\n\nSo both methods give 3.\n\nBut wait, why are they equivalent?\n\nBecause:\n\n  Method 1: x = min( (k*l)//(n*nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) )\n\n  Method 2: x = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) // n\n\nBut wait, is (k*l)//nl // n equal to (k*l)//(n*nl)? \n\nYes, because (k*l)//nl // n = floor(floor(k*l / nl) / n) \n\nBut note: floor(a/b) is not necessarily the same as floor(a/(b))? \n\nExample: a=10, b=3, then floor(10/3)=3, then 3//2=1. But floor(10/6)=1. So yes, they are the same.\n\nSimilarly, for the other constraints.\n\nBut wait, the lime constraint: \n  Method 1: (c*d)//n\n  Method 2: (c*d) // n   [because T_max_lime = c*d, and then divided by n]\n\nBut wait, in method 2, the lime constraint is T_max_lime = c*d, and then we do T_max_lime // n. But in method 1, the lime constraint is (c*d)//n.\n\nSo they are the same.\n\nSimilarly, for salt: \n  Method 1: p // (n*np)\n  Method 2: (p//np) // n\n\nBut wait, is p//(n*np) the same as (p//np)//n?\n\nExample: p=10, n=2, np=3 -> n*np=6, then p//6=10//6=1.\n          p//np=10//3=3, then 3//2=1.\n\nAnother example: p=11, n=2, np=3 -> n*np=6, 11//6=1; 11//3=3, 3//2=1.\n\nBut what if p=5, n=2, np=3? \n  n*np=6,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally in the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources (drink, limes, and salt). Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt for each friend. The solution involves determining the bottleneck resource that limits the number of toasts.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution requires checking three constraints:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total available drink must be sufficient for each friend's required drink per toast multiplied by the number of friends and the number of toasts per friend.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total available lime slices (after cutting) must be enough for each friend's required slices per toast multiplied by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total available salt must be sufficient for each friend's required salt per toast multiplied by the number of friends and the number of toasts per friend.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the maximum number of toasts per friend by taking the minimum value derived from the three constraints. Each constraint is calculated by dividing the total available resource by the required amount per toast, adjusted for the number of friends.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1), suitable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    x_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    x_lime = (c * d) // n\n    x_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(x_drink, x_lime, x_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast per friend, and salt per toast per friend, respectively.\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available (k * l) is divided by the product of the number of friends (n), drink per toast per friend (nl), and the number of toasts per friend (x). This gives the maximum possible toasts per friend based on drink availability.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices (c * d) is divided by the number of friends (n) to determine the maximum toasts per friend based on lime availability.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt (p) is divided by the product of the number of friends (n), salt per toast per friend (np), and the number of toasts per friend (x) to determine the maximum toasts per friend based on salt availability.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three calculated constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource limit. This result is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all resource constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
