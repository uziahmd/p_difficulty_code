Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an initial string s and a number n of queries.\n Each query is of the form \"d->t\", meaning replace every occurrence of digit d with string t.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the queries are applied in order. But if we do naive replacement (like replacing all '2' with '00', then later replacing all '0' with something) then we have to consider that the replacements might chain.\n\n Important: The total length of all ti across queries is at most 10^5, so we cannot do a naive string replacement for each query (which would be O(|s| * (number of distinct digits)) because the string s can be up to 10^5 and the number of queries up to 10^5, but note the chaining.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order. So if we have a query \"2->00\" and then \"0->7\", then after the first query, every '2' becomes \"00\", and then the second query replaces every '0' (including the ones that were inserted by the first query) with \"7\". This leads to a potentially exponential growth in the string length if we do naive replacement.\n\n However, the problem states: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. This is a key constraint.\n\n But note: the problem also says that we have to compute the number modulo 1000000007, ignoring leading zeros. We cannot build the entire string if it becomes too long (because the replacements might lead to very long strings).\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We need to process the queries in reverse order? Or use dynamic programming or state machine?\n\n Observation: \n The problem is similar to applying a series of substitutions that can chain arbitrarily. However, the constraint on the total length of ti is 10^5, but note that the intermediate string might become very long.\n\n However, note: the initial string has at most 10^5 characters, and each query's ti has total length 10^5 (across all queries). But the same query might be applied repeatedly because the replacement in one query introduces digits that are then replaced by subsequent queries.\n\n But the total length of all ti is 10^5, and there are only 10 digits (from '0' to '9'). We can think of the problem as:\n\n We are going to perform n queries. Each query is defined by a digit d and a string t. We are to replace every occurrence of d in the current string with t.\n\n However, the catch: the replacements happen in the current string, and the current string is built from the previous one.\n\n Since the total length of t's is limited (10^5) but the intermediate string might be huge (exponentially so), we cannot build the entire string.\n\n Alternative idea: work backwards? Or use the fact that the queries are independent per digit? \n\n Actually, we can precompute for each digit what its final representation will be after all queries.\n\n Let f_i(d) = the string that the digit d becomes after processing all queries from i to n (i.e., from the last query backwards). Then, the entire string s becomes the concatenation of f_0(d) for each digit d in s.\n\n But wait: the queries are applied in the given order. So if we process from left to right, the first query is applied first, then the second, etc.\n\n However, we can use a technique called \"reverse topological sort\" on the dependencies. Notice that the queries update the meaning of digits. Specifically, if we have a query \"d->t\", then in the next queries, any occurrence of a digit in t (if that digit is updated by a later query) will be replaced.\n\n Therefore, we can process the queries from last to first, and for each digit we maintain what it will eventually become.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We'll create an array (or list) `final` of 10 elements (for digits 0 to 9) that will store the final string for that digit after all queries.\n\n 2. Initially, for each digit d, `final[d] = d` (as a string). But note: the initial state is before any queries, so we start with the identity.\n\n 3. Then, we process the queries in reverse order (from the last one to the first one). For a query \"d->t\", we want to update the representation of d such that if t contains any digit, then those digits should be replaced by their final representation (as of the time after processing the current query, which is the same as the representation after processing the remaining queries, because we are going backwards).\n\n 4. However, note: when processing the last query, we don't need to worry about further updates because it's the last. Then the second last: we have to use the updated representations for the digits in t from the last query.\n\n 5. But caution: the same digit might be updated multiple times. We are updating the `final` array for each digit.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order. When processing the last query, we update the digit d (say d0) to t, but then when processing an earlier query that uses d0, we must use the updated version from the last query.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   Let `rep` be an array (list) of strings for digits 0-9, initially rep[i] = str(i).\n\n   Then, we'll process the queries from last to first. For each query (d, t):\n        new_rep = t\n        For each char c in t:\n            if c is a digit, then we replace c with rep[int(c)]\n        Then set rep[int(d)] = new_rep\n\n 6. But wait: what if the same digit appears multiple times in t? Then we are effectively replacing all occurrences of that digit in t with their current rep (which might have been updated by later queries). And then assign that to the digit d.\n\n However, the problem is that the same query might update a digit that is used in a previous query? Actually, we are processing in reverse order, so we update the representation for the digit d only once (at the moment we see the query) and then we use that updated representation for the subsequent (earlier) queries.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      222\n      2\n      2->0\n      0->7\n\n   We process the last query first: \"0->7\"\n        rep[0] = \"7\"\n\n   Then the first query: \"2->0\"\n        t = \"0\", so we replace each digit in \"0\" (which is '0') with rep[0] which is \"7\", so rep[2] = \"7\"\n\n   Then the entire string \"222\" becomes \"777\".\n\n   Another example: \n      Input: \n          123123\n          1\n          2->00\n\n      Then we process the query: \n          rep[2] = \"00\"\n\n      Then the string becomes: for each '2' we put \"00\", so \"123123\" becomes \"10031003\"\n\n      Now, if we have two queries: \n          123123\n          2\n          2->00\n          0->7\n\n      Process the last query first: \"0->7\", then rep[0] = \"7\"\n      Then the first query: \"2->00\", so we replace each '0' in \"00\" (which are two zeros) with rep[0] which is \"7\", so rep[2] = \"77\"\n\n      Then the entire string: originally \"123123\", then replace '2' with \"77\": becomes \"17731773\"\n\n      But wait, the example input had: \n          Input: ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n      The third sample: \n          Input: \n              222\n              2\n              2->0\n              0->7\n\n          Output: 777\n\n      And the fourth sample:\n          Input: \n              1000000008\n              0\n\n          Output: 1\n\n      Also, the second sample: \n          Input: \n              123123\n              1\n              3->\n\n          This means: replace '3' with empty string. So the string becomes \"12123\" -> wait, actually: \n          Original: 123123 -> remove all '3's: becomes 1212 (the positions: first 1, then 2, then remove 3, then 1, then 2, then remove 3 -> 1212)\n\n      How does our reverse processing handle the empty string?\n          In the example \"3->\": \n          We have one query: \"3->\" (empty string). \n          Then, we set rep[3] = \"\" (empty string).\n\n          Then, the entire string \"123123\" becomes: \n            '1' -> remains '1'\n            '2' -> remains '2'\n            '3' -> replaced by '' (so removed)\n            then again: '1','2','3' (again, the last 3 is removed)\n\n          So the result is \"1212\".\n\n 7. But note: the example input also has a query that produces an empty string. Our method must handle that.\n\n However, the above method of processing queries in reverse order and updating the representation for each digit is standard for these kinds of chaining substitution problems.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial string s and the number of queries n.\n\n   Step 2: Initialize an array `rep` of 10 strings: rep[i] = str(i) for i in range(10)\n\n   Step 3: We'll read all the queries and store them in a list, then process from the last one to the first.\n\n   Step 4: For each query (from last to first) of the form \"d->t\":\n        d_char = the digit (a character from '0' to '9')\n        t_str = the replacement string (which can be empty)\n\n        Then, we want to form a new string for this digit d: we take t_str and replace every digit c in t_str with rep[int(c)]\n\n        However, note: during the reverse processing, we have already updated the representation for digits that appear in later queries. So we use the current `rep` to replace each digit in t_str.\n\n        Then set rep[int(d_char)] = the resulting string.\n\n   Step 5: After processing all queries, the entire string s is transformed by: for each character c in s, output rep[int(c)]\n\n   Step 6: Now, we have a transformed string. We need to compute the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n   But note: the transformed string might be extremely long (but the total length of all t's is 10^5, and we are doing reverse processing, but the intermediate representations might be built from multiple replacements). However, the problem says the sum of lengths of ti (the original t's) is 10^5, but the expanded string might be very long.\n\n   However, we cannot build the entire string if it is too long (like 10^5 * (expansion factor) which could be huge). We need to compute the number without building the entire string.\n\n   How to compute the number modulo 1000000007?\n\n   We can traverse the transformed string and accumulate the value. But the transformed string might be too long to store as a string.\n\n   Alternative: we can use dynamic programming or state machine to compute the value from left to right, while also keeping track of the current position and the power of 10.\n\n   But note: we have the transformed string as the concatenation of the rep for each digit in the original string.\n\n   However, we have the entire transformation for each digit. We can break down the transformed string into parts: each part is the string representation of the expansion of one digit.\n\n   We can compute the value by:\n\n        value = 0\n        power = 1\n        for each part (each digit's expansion) in the transformed string (which is the expansion of the original string s):\n\n            Let part = rep[digit]   # but note: the entire transformed string is the concatenation of these parts.\n\n            However, we cannot build the entire string because the expansion might be huge.\n\n   We need to compute the value without building the entire string.\n\n   We can compute the value by processing the entire transformed string as a sequence of digits, but the problem is that the transformed string can be very long (like billions of digits) and we cannot iterate over each digit.\n\n   But note: the total length of the transformed string is the product of the expansion factors. However, the constraint is that the sum of the lengths of the original t's is 10^5, but the expansion factors are multiplicative. However, we are storing the representation for each digit as a string, but the length of the representation for a digit might be large.\n\n   However, the problem constraints say that the sum of the lengths of the ti's (the original t's) is 10^5. But note: in our reverse processing, we are expanding the ti's by replacing the digits in them with their own expansions. The length of the representation for a digit might become huge.\n\n   Example: if we have a chain of queries that expand a digit into more digits, then the length might blow up.\n\n   But note: the problem says the initial s has at most 10^5 digits, and the total length of the original t's is 10^5. However, the reverse processing might produce exponentially long strings, but we cannot store them.\n\n   Alternative: we don't need the entire string, but we need the value modulo 1000000007.\n\n   We can compute the value by processing the transformed string as a linked list of digits? Or we can precompute the value for each digit's expansion and then combine.\n\n   Idea:\n\n   We can represent the transformed string as a list of tokens (each token is the expansion of a digit). Then, we can compute the value from left to right.\n\n   However, the issue is that the expansion of a digit might be very long, but the total length of the original t's is 10^5. But note: the reverse processing builds the representation for each digit. The length of the representation for a digit is the sum of the lengths of the representations of the digits in the original t (with the replacements done recursively). \n\n   But the problem says the total length of the original t's (without any expansion) is 10^5. However, the expansion may cause the representation to be much longer.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require us to output the string, only the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n   We can use a system that for each digit we store two things:\n\n      - the numeric value that the expansion of that digit represents (mod 1000000007)\n      - the length of the expansion (so that we know the power of 10 by which we have to shift the next part)\n\n   But wait: the expansion of a digit is a string of digits. The value of the expansion is the integer value of that string. And the length is the number of digits.\n\n   Then, for the entire transformed string, we can compute:\n\n      total_value = 0\n      current_power = 1   # but we need to account for the shifting by the length of the following parts\n\n   Alternatively, we can process from right to left:\n\n      Let dp[i] = (value, length) for the expansion of digit i.\n\n      Then, for a query \"d->t\", we break t into digits? Actually, we are going to update the representation for d by replacing each digit in t with its current (dp) representation.\n\n      Then, the value for d is the value of the string t after replacing each digit by its own expansion, and the length is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each digit in t.\n\n      We can compute:\n\n          value_d = 0\n          length_d = 0\n          base = 1\n          for each char c in t:\n             digit = int(c)\n             value_part = dp[digit][0]\n             len_part = dp[digit][1]\n\n             Then, the current part is value_part, and we are going to append this to the current string.\n\n             But note: the current string is built from left to right. However, the value of the entire string is:\n\n                 value_d = value_d * (10 ** len_part) + value_part\n\n             But we cannot use exponentiation because the exponents might be huge.\n\n      Instead, we can use modular arithmetic and precomputed powers, but the exponents (lengths) might be huge (exponential growth) and we cannot store the entire number.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the value and the length for each digit's expansion, and then update the value and length for a digit d from the string t.\n\n   Steps for updating a digit d from string t:\n\n        value_d = 0\n        length_d = 0\n\n        For each char c in t:\n            d_i = int(c)\n            value_d_i, len_d_i = dp[d_i]   # the current representation for digit d_i\n\n            Then, to append the value_d_i to the current value_d, we need to shift the current value_d by len_d_i digits and add value_d_i.\n\n            value_d = (value_d * (10**(len_d_i)) + value_d_i) % mod\n\n            length_d += len_d_i\n\n        Then set dp[d] = (value_d, length_d)\n\n   However, we don't know the exponents (the powers of 10) for the entire string, but we can compute the power of 10 for a segment of length L as pow(10, L, mod). But note: the exponents (lengths) might be huge (exponential in the number of queries) and we cannot compute 10^(10^5) directly.\n\n   But note: the modulus is 1000000007, and we can use pow(base, exponent, mod) for exponentiation. However, the exponent (length) might be huge, but the modulus for exponentiation in pow is 1000000007, but wait: we are using the length to determine the shift. The shift is 10^(L) mod 1000000007. \n\n   However, the problem: the length itself might be huge (exceeding the maximum integer in Python? Actually, no, because the problem says the total length of the original t's is 10^5, but the expansion can make the length grow exponentially. However, the length is stored as an integer, and the number of digits in the expanded string is exponential, so we cannot store the length as an integer.\n\n   Alternative: we don't need the actual length as an integer for the entire string, but we need the value modulo 1000000007 and the length modulo (phi(mod))? But wait, the shift is determined by the length: we need to compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007. However, Euler's theorem requires that we know L mod phi(1000000007) for modulus exponentiation? But note: 1000000007 is prime, so phi(1000000007)=1000000006.\n\n   However, the problem: we are building the value for each digit's expansion. The value for a digit d is computed from the expansion of the string t. And the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t.\n\n   But note: the expansion of a digit d_i is a string of digits, and we can compute the value of that expansion (mod 1000000007) and the length (number of digits) of that expansion.\n\n   However, the length is needed to compute the shift for the next part. The shift is 10^(length_of_next_part). \n\n   But the length might be huge (exceeding the modulus for exponentiation? Actually, we are only interested in 10^(length) mod 1000000007, and we can use modular exponentiation with modulus 1000000007, but we must know the length. However, the length is an integer that might be astronomically large (like 10^100000) and we cannot store it.\n\n   We must avoid storing the actual length (as an integer) because it might be too big.\n\n   Alternative approach: we can use the fact that the entire transformation is linear and use a state machine that computes the value and the length simultaneously, but without storing the length as an integer.\n\n   But wait: we need the length to compute the shift. Without the length, we cannot compute the shift.\n\n   However, note: the modulus for exponentiation is 1000000007, and we can use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo phi(1000000007)=1000000006. But the length is the total number of digits, and we need to compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007. We can store L modulo 1000000006 (the totient) for the exponentiation.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let mod_val = 1000000007\n        mod_exp = 1000000006   # Euler totient for mod_val (since mod_val is prime)\n\n        For each digit i, we store:\n            val[i] = the value of the expansion of digit i mod mod_val\n            exp_len[i] = the length of the expansion of digit i mod mod_exp   (but wait: we need the actual length for the shift? Actually, for the shift we use 10^(L) mod mod_val, and we can compute that if we know L mod mod_exp (if L is huge) because of Euler: 10^k mod mod_val = 10^(k mod mod_exp) mod mod_val, provided that k >= some value? Actually, Euler's theorem requires that 10 and mod_val are coprime, which they are (gcd(10,1000000007)=1). So yes, we can use exponent reduction modulo mod_exp.\n\n        However, the length L is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in t. And we are storing the length modulo mod_exp. But note: the length is used in two ways:\n\n            (1) To compute the shift: 10^(L) mod mod_val, which we can compute as pow(10, L_mod, mod_val) where L_mod = L % mod_exp.\n\n            (2) To update the length for the next digit: we are adding the length of the current digit's expansion.\n\n        But wait: the length is used to compute the shift for the next part. The shift for the next part is 10^(L) mod mod_val. However, if we store L_mod (the length modulo mod_exp) then we can compute the shift. But note: the length L is used in the exponent, and we can reduce the exponent modulo mod_exp.\n\n        However, the length L is the total number of digits, and we are only interested in 10^L mod mod_val. We can store L_mod = L % mod_exp, and then use that to compute the shift.\n\n        BUT: the length L is also used to update the next length: when we have a string t, the length of the expansion is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each digit in t. So we need to know the length of each expansion (and then sum them). However, we can store for each digit the length modulo mod_exp, and then the sum of the lengths modulo mod_exp is the sum of the stored lengths modulo mod_exp.\n\n        However, the length is used to compute the shift, and the shift is 10^(L) mod mod_val. But the shift is computed from the length, and the length is the total number of digits. We can compute:\n\n            shift = pow(10, L_mod, mod_val)\n\n        But note: the length L might be huge, and we are storing L_mod = L % mod_exp. This is valid for Euler's theorem, but note: Euler's theorem says that if L >= mod_exp, then 10^L mod mod_val = 10^(L mod mod_exp) * (10^(mod_exp))^(floor(L / mod_exp)) mod mod_val, but wait, that is not how Euler works. Actually, Euler's theorem says:\n\n            10^φ(mod_val) ≡ 1 (mod mod_val)\n\n            So 10^L = 10^(k * φ(mod_val) + r) = (10^(φ(mod_val)))^k * 10^r ≡ 1^k * 10^r ≡ 10^r (mod mod_val)\n\n            So we can reduce the exponent modulo φ(mod_val) (if the base and modulus are coprime).\n\n        Therefore, we can store for each digit i:\n\n            value[i] = the value of the expansion of digit i mod mod_val\n            len_mod[i] = the length of the expansion of digit i mod mod_exp   (so that we can compute 10^(len_mod[i]) mod mod_val)\n\n        However, wait: the length is the total number of digits, and we need to compute the shift for the entire concatenation. The shift for a part with length L is 10^L, and we can compute that as pow(10, L_mod, mod_val) where L_mod = L % mod_exp.\n\n        But note: the length L is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string t. So we can compute the total length for the new representation of digit d as the sum (over each digit c in t) of the length of the expansion of digit c. And we store the length modulo mod_exp.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the length is used both for the shift and for the addition of the value. The shift is 10^L, and the value is the value of the expansion.\n\n        How to update a digit d from string t:\n\n            Let L_total = 0   (this will be the total length mod mod_exp)\n            Let V = 0        (the value mod mod_val)\n\n            For each char c in t:\n                d_i = int(c)\n\n                Let len_i = len_mod[d_i]   (the length of the expansion of d_i, modulo mod_exp)\n                Let val_i = value[d_i]       (the value of the expansion of d_i, modulo mod_val)\n\n                Then, we need to shift the current V by the entire length of the next part (which is len_i) and then add val_i.\n\n                But note: the entire expansion of the current t is the concatenation of the expansions of each c. So the current value V is the value of the part we've processed so far. We are going to append the expansion of d_i.\n\n                The shift factor is 10^(len_i) mod mod_val, but note: we have already accounted for the shift due to the previous parts. Actually, the way we build the value is:\n\n                    V_new = V * (10^(len_i)) + val_i\n\n                However, we don't know the absolute length, but we know the total length so far (L_total) and the shift factor for the next part is 10^(len_i). But note: the entire expansion of the next part is val_i, and it is placed at the least significant len_i digits. So we must shift the current V by the number of digits of the next part (which is len_i) and then add val_i.\n\n                But wait: the current V is built from the previous digits, and the next part is appended to the right. The total length so far is L_total, and then we add len_i, so the new total length is (L_total + len_i) mod mod_exp.\n\n                Steps for updating:\n\n                    L_total = (L_total + len_i) % mod_exp   (but wait, we are storing the length modulo mod_exp, and the length is the sum of the lengths of the parts)\n\n                    Then, to shift V by len_i digits, we do:\n\n                        V = (V * pow(10, len_i, mod_val)) % mod_val\n\n                    Then add val_i:\n\n                        V = (V + val_i) % mod_val\n\n            Then set value[d] = V, and len_mod[d] = L_total.\n\n        However, note: the length we are storing is modulo mod_exp, and we are using it to compute the shift. But the shift factor is 10^(len_i) mod mod_val, and we have stored the length of the expansion for each digit (modulo mod_exp). This is correct.\n\n        But there is a problem: the length we are storing is the length of the expansion, and we are using the same length modulo mod_exp for two purposes: the shift factor and the total length. This is acceptable because Euler's theorem allows us to reduce the exponent modulo φ(mod_val) for the base 10.\n\n        However, note: the length L is used in two different contexts:\n\n            (1) As an exponent for the base 10 (to compute shifts) -> we can reduce modulo mod_exp.\n            (2) As a sum (for the total length) -> we can also reduce modulo mod_exp because we only care about the shift (which is 10^(L) mod mod_val) and the shift only depends on L modulo mod_exp.\n\n        But wait: the shift factor for the entire string is 10^(L) mod mod_val, and we are breaking the string into parts. However, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions, and the value is computed by:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each part (each digit's expansion) from left to right:\n                value = (value * (10^(len_i)) + val_i) % mod_val\n\n        And the length is the sum of the len_i.\n\n        However, the above update for a digit d from string t is:\n\n            V = 0\n            L_total = 0\n            for each c in t:\n                d_i = int(c)\n                L_i = len_mod[d_i]   (mod mod_exp)\n                V_i = value[d_i]\n\n                V = (V * pow(10, L_i, mod_val) + V_i) % mod_val\n                L_total = (L_total + L_i) % mod_exp\n\n            Then set value[d] = V, len_mod[d] = L_total\n\n        Then, after processing all queries, we process the initial string s:\n\n            result = 0\n            total_length = 0   (we don't actually need the total_length, but we need to shift the current result by the length of each part)\n\n            For each char c in s:\n                d = int(c)\n                L_i = len_mod[d]\n                v_i = value[d]\n\n                result = (result * pow(10, L_i, mod_val) + v_i) % mod_val\n\n            Print result\n\n   However, note: the modulus for the exponent (the length) is mod_exp (1000000006). But the length we are storing is the total length of the expansion for a digit, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. This is valid because when we compute the shift (10^(L_i)) mod mod_val, we can use L_i mod 1000000006.\n\n   But there is a caveat: the length is the actual number of digits. However, the expansion might be so long that the length is huge, but we are storing it modulo 1000000006. This is acceptable because we only use the length for:\n\n        (1) Computing the shift factor (via pow(10, L_i, mod_val)) and \n        (2) Summing the lengths (which we then use as exponents) and we store the sum modulo 1000000006.\n\n   But note: the length is additive. The total length for the expansion of a digit d from string t is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in t. And we are storing each length modulo 1000000006. Then the sum modulo 1000000006 is the sum of the stored values modulo 1000000006.\n\n   This is correct because:\n\n        (A + B) mod m = (A mod m + B mod m) mod m\n\n   However, the length is a non-negative integer and we are only concerned with the exponentiation base 10, and the exponent is the length. The property of modular exponentiation with modulus mod_val (prime) and base 10 requires that we reduce the exponent modulo φ(mod_val) (if the base and modulus are coprime). The length is the exponent, and we store it modulo φ(mod_val). \n\n   But note: the length is used in two different ways: \n\n        - In the shift factor: we need the exponent for the base 10 to shift the current value. We compute that as pow(10, L_i, mod_val) and we use L_i mod φ(mod_val) for that.\n\n        - In the update of the total length (for the entire string): we only use the length to compute the overall shift for the entire string? Actually, no: the entire string is built by the expansion of the initial string s, and we break it into the expansion of each digit. The expansion of each digit is independent, and the value is computed by:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each digit d in s:\n                result = (result * (10^(len(d))) + value(d)) % mod_val\n\n        But wait: the expansion of the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit. The shift factor for the expansion of a digit d is 10 raised to the total length of the expansion of d. However, the expansion of d is built from the replacement string, and the replacement string might contain other digits that are expanded. The total length of the expansion of d is stored in len_mod[d] (mod 1000000006). \n\n        But note: the shift factor is 10^(len(d)), and we are storing len(d) modulo 1000000006. This is correct.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        mod_val = 1000000007\n        mod_exp = 1000000006\n\n        Initialize:\n            value_arr = [0]*10\n            len_arr = [0]*10   # for storing the length mod mod_exp\n\n        But initially, for a digit d, the expansion is the digit itself (string of length 1, value = d).\n\n            value_arr[i] = i\n            len_arr[i] = 1   (because the digit is represented by one digit)\n\n        Then, read the queries and process them in reverse order.\n\n        For each query (from last to first) with format \"d->t\":\n\n            d_digit = int(query[0])\n            t_str = the rest\n\n            Then, we update the representation for d_digit:\n\n                new_value = 0\n                new_len = 0\n\n                For each char c in t_str:\n                    c_digit = int(c)\n                    # Get the current value and length for c_digit\n                    cur_val = value_arr[c_digit]\n                    cur_len = len_arr[c_digit]   # this is modulo mod_exp\n\n                    # Shift the current new_value by cur_len digits (multiply by 10^(cur_len))\n                    # But note: the entire expansion of the current part is cur_val, and we are appending it.\n\n                    # Update new_value: \n                    #   new_value = new_value * (10^(cur_len)) + cur_val   (all modulo mod_val)\n\n                    new_value = (new_value * pow(10, cur_len, mod_val) + cur_val) % mod_val\n\n                    new_len = (new_len + cur_len) % mod_exp   # but note: we are storing the length modulo mod_exp\n\n                # Now, set the representation for the digit d_digit to (new_value, new_len)\n                value_arr[d_digit] = new_value\n                len_arr[d_digit] = new_len\n\n        Then, process the initial string s:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each char c in s:\n                d = int(c)\n                cur_val = value_arr[d]\n                cur_len = len_arr[d]\n\n                # Shift the current result by cur_len digits (multiply by 10^(cur_len)) and add cur_val\n                result = (result * pow(10, cur_len, mod_val) + cur_val) % mod_val\n\n            print(result)\n\n   However, note: the above update for the query uses the current value_arr and len_arr (which have been updated by the later queries). Since we process queries in reverse order, the later queries have been processed and their representations are updated, so when processing an",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string substitution queries on an initial digit string and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the substitutions without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to their exponential growth.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple substitution queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with another string. These substitutions can chain, meaning replacements in one query can affect subsequent queries. The key observation is that each digit's final representation depends on all subsequent queries, allowing us to process queries in reverse order to determine the final form of each digit.\n\n2. **Insight**: By processing queries from last to first, we can dynamically update the representation of each digit. For each query, we replace the specified digit with a string, but during this replacement, any digits within the replacement string are further processed by their own final representations (from later queries). This allows us to build the final representation for each digit without explicitly constructing intermediate strings.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to store two pieces of information for each digit:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the digit's expansion modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The length of the digit's expansion modulo 1000000006 (using Euler's theorem for modular exponentiation).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once in reverse order, and for each query, it processes each character in the replacement string. Given that the sum of the lengths of all replacement strings is up to 10^5, the total operations are linear with respect to this sum, making the solution efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod_val = 1000000007\nmod_exp = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n        \n    value_arr = [i for i in range(10)]\n    len_arr = [1] * 10\n\n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        d_digit = int(d_char)\n        new_value = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        for char in t_str:\n            if char == '':\n                continue\n            c_digit = int(char)\n            cur_val = value_arr[c_digit]\n            cur_len = len_arr[c_digit]\n            new_value = (new_value * pow(10, cur_len, mod_val) + cur_val) % mod_val\n            new_len = (new_len + cur_len) % mod_exp\n            \n        value_arr[d_digit] = new_value\n        len_arr[d_digit] = new_len\n        \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d = int(char)\n        cur_val = value_arr[d]\n        cur_len = len_arr[d]\n        result = (result * pow(10, cur_len, mod_val) + cur_val) % mod_val\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial digit string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input. Each query is parsed into a digit and its corresponding replacement string.\n\n2. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Starting from the last query to the first, each digit's final representation is computed. For each query, the replacement string is processed by replacing each digit with its current (updated) representation. The value and length of the new representation are updated using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure efficiency.\n\n3. **Result Computation**: After processing all queries, the initial string `s` is transformed by replacing each digit with its final representation. The resulting number is computed by iteratively combining these representations, using modular exponentiation to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the chaining substitutions and computes the result without explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic for optimal performance.",
