The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait: the problem says \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\", meaning that we are taking the perimeter of the inner rectangle, but note that the inner rectangle's border includes the top, bottom, left, and right sides.\n\n But note: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8. Let's break it down:\n   For the first ring (k=1): \n        inner rectangle dimensions: w' = 3, h' = 3.\n        The border of a 3x3 grid: normally, the border would be 3*4 - 4 = 8? Actually, let's count:\n            Top: 3, Bottom: 3, Left: 1 (because top and bottom already have the corners) but wait, we don't double count the corners.\n\n Actually, the border of a rectangle of size a x b is calculated as: 2*a + 2*b - 4, because the four corners are counted twice otherwise.\n\n However, let's check with 3x3: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n But wait, what if the ring is defined for an inner rectangle? The problem says: the i-th ring should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1)). \n\n However, note: when we subtract 4*(i-1), we are effectively removing two cells from each side (top and bottom, and left and right) because each side loses 2*(i-1) cells? Actually, the inner rectangle starts at 4*(i-1) from the edges.\n\n But let's define:\n   Let n = w - 4*(i-1)   [this becomes the width of the inner rectangle]\n   Let m = h - 4*(i-1)   [this becomes the height of the inner rectangle]\n\n Then the number of cells in the ring (the border) is: 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n However, we must consider: if n or m becomes less than 2, then the ring might not be formed? But note the constraint: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). This ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3x3 (if we start from the original and subtract 4*(k-1))?\n\n Actually, the condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) means that the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= 1. However, note that the ring requires at least a 1x1 inner rectangle? But wait, the formula 2*n+2*m-4 would break for n=1 or m=1.\n\n Let's analyze the constraint: \n   k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n Example: w=h=3, then min(w,h)=3 -> floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. So k can be 1 only.\n\n Then for k=1, we have n = 3, m=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 8.\n\n Another example: w=7, h=9, k=1 -> \n   n = 7, m=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, k=2 -> \n   First ring: n0=7, m0=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4=28.\n   Second ring: n1=7-4=3, m1=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12.\n   Total = 28+12=40.\n\n But wait: the example input \"7 9 2\" gives output 40.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the rings are added consecutively. The first ring goes along the edge, the second one 2 cells away, etc. And each ring has a width of 1 cell. So the total gilded cells is the sum of the cells in each ring.\n\n But note: the second ring is entirely contained within the first ring? And they don't overlap? Yes, because the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, so it uses the cells that are inside the first ring (excluding the border of the first ring). However, the problem does not explicitly say whether the rings are non-overlapping? But by the definition, the second ring is drawn on the inner rectangle which is smaller by 4*(2-1)=4 in both dimensions. Therefore, the rings do not share any cell.\n\n However, wait: the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size 3x5. The first ring was the border of 7x9. The second ring is entirely inside the first. But the first ring is the outermost border, then the second ring is the next one. They are distinct.\n\n But note: the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40, which is 28+12.\n\n Therefore, the plan is:\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        n = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # Check: if either n or m becomes less than 2, then the ring doesn't exist? But the constraint k is bounded so that the inner rectangle has at least 3x3? Actually, no: the constraint is k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        However, let's check: for the i-th ring, the inner rectangle has dimensions (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). The smallest dimension must be at least 3? Actually, the minimal rectangle for a ring is 1x1? But wait, the formula 2*n+2*m-4 requires n>=1 and m>=1. But if n=1, then 2*1+2*m-4 = 2*m-2, and if m=1 then 2*1+2*1-4=0, which is invalid.\n\n        However, the constraint: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3x3? Let me check:\n\n        For the k-th ring: \n          n_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w,h) - 4*(floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)-1) ?\n\n        Alternatively, note: the condition k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) is equivalent to 4*(k-1) <= min(w,h)-1? Not exactly. Actually, we have:\n\n        k <= (min(w,h)+1)//4   (using integer floor division)\n\n        Then the inner rectangle for the k-th ring: \n          n_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w,h) - 4*((min(w,h)+1)//4 - 1)\n\n        But note: floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) is the maximum k allowed.\n\n        Actually, the problem states: k is at least 1 and at most that value.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to worry about negative dimensions or zero. However, we must ensure that the ring exists (i.e., the inner rectangle must have at least 2x2 to have a border? Actually, for the border to exist, we require the inner rectangle to have at least 3 cells in one dimension? Actually, the border of a 1x1 is 1 cell? But wait, the problem says \"the first one goes along the edge of the plate\", and the plate is at least 3x3. \n\n        According to the problem, the plate is at least 3x3, and k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let's test with w=3, h=3, k=1: \n            inner rectangle: 3x3 -> valid.\n\n        What if we have w=4, h=4, k= floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1 -> then inner rectangle 4x4, so the ring is 2*4+2*4-4=16-4=12.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge. The edge of a 4x4 plate: \n            It should be the outer border: 4*4 grid, the border is the outer 1 cell. The border of a 4x4 is 4*4 - 2*2 (the inner 2x2) = 16-4=12? Actually, the border of a rectangle is 2*(a+b)-4. For 4x4: 2*4+2*4-4=12.\n\n        However, the problem says the ring has width 1, so we are only taking the outermost layer. This matches.\n\n        But what if the inner rectangle becomes 1x1? Then the formula would give 2*1+2*1-4 = 0, which is wrong. But the constraint ensures we don't get to that point.\n\n        Actually, the constraint k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) implies that for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has at least 3x3? \n\n        Let me check: \n          Let m0 = min(w, h)\n          Then 4*(k-1) <= 4*(floor((m0+1)/4)-1) <= m0? Not necessarily, but note:\n\n          Since k <= floor((m0+1)/4), then 4*(k-1) <= 4*(floor((m0+1)/4)-1) <= m0 - 4? Actually, we can see:\n\n          k_max = floor((m0+1)/4)\n          Then for the last ring (k=k_max), the inner rectangle has side length: m0 - 4*(k_max-1)\n\n          We need to check if m0 - 4*(k_max-1) >= 1. But the problem doesn't require the ring to be drawn if the inner rectangle is too small. However, the constraint is chosen so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3x3? Actually, the example condition is: k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). \n\n          Let me compute for m0=3: k_max=1, then inner rectangle for k=1: 3-0=3 -> valid.\n          m0=4: k_max=floor(5/4)=1, then inner rectangle 4-0=4 -> valid.\n          m0=5: k_max=floor(6/4)=1, then inner rectangle 5 -> valid.\n          m0=6: k_max=floor(7/4)=1, then inner rectangle 6 -> valid.\n          m0=7: k_max=floor(8/4)=2, then for k=2: 7-4=3 -> valid.\n\n          So the smallest inner rectangle we get is 3x3 (for the last ring) or even 1x1? Actually, when m0=7, k=2: 7-4=3 -> 3x3.\n\n          Let me try m0=8: k_max=floor(9/4)=2, then for k=2: 8-4=4 -> 4x4.\n\n          m0=12: k_max=floor(13/4)=3, then for k=3: 12-8=4 -> 4x4.\n\n          How about m0=15: k_max=floor(16/4)=4, then for k=4: 15-12=3 -> 3x3.\n\n          So the smallest inner rectangle we get is 3x3.\n\n        Therefore, the formula for the i-th ring is safe because the inner rectangle for each ring has at least 3x3.\n\n        However, wait: if the inner rectangle is 3x3, then the border is 2*3+2*3-4=8, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the formula for the border of a rectangle a x b is: 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        However, we can also think of it as: \n            Top and bottom: each has a cells, but then subtract the two corners (so we don't double count) but actually the standard formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (counting each cell as one unit) is 2*(a+b) but then we subtract 4 because the four corners are shared by two sides and we counted them twice? Actually, no: the border is the set of cells that are on the boundary. The number of cells is:\n\n            top row: a\n            bottom row: a\n            left column (without the top and bottom): a-2\n            right column (without the top and bottom): a-2\n\n            So total: a + a + (a-2) + (a-2) = 4*a - 4? But wait, that was for a fixed width a and height b? Actually, no: the top and bottom rows are of length a, and the left and right columns are of length b. Then:\n\n            top: a\n            bottom: a\n            left: b - 2 (because we already counted the top and bottom of the left column)\n            right: b - 2\n\n            So total: a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Read w, h, k.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # i from 0 to k-1; then the current ring index is i+1, so we subtract 4*i from the original dimensions?\n            # Actually, the problem says the i-th ring (starting at 1) is defined by subtracting 4*(i-1). \n            # So for the i-th ring (0-indexed i, then ring number is i+1), we use:\n            n = w - 4*i\n            m = h - 4*i\n            # But wait, the problem says the i-th ring (i starting at 1) uses (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n            # In our loop, for the first ring (i=0) we use 4*0 -> which is 4*(1-1)=0, so that matches.\n\n            # However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate, which is the outermost. Our formula for the first ring uses the original w and h.\n\n            # But wait, in the example: \"7 9 2\": \n            #   i=0: n=7, m=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 28\n            #   i=1: n=7-4=3, m=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 12\n            #   total=40.\n\n            # That matches.\n\n            # However, note: we are subtracting 4*i, but the problem subtracts 4*(i) (if we consider i from 0) then we are subtracting 4*i for the i-th ring (0-indexed). But the problem subtracts 4*(i) for the (i+1)-th ring? Actually, the problem subtracts 4*(i-1) for the i-th ring (with i starting at 1). \n\n            # So for the (i+1)-th ring, we subtract 4*i. But we are iterating for the first k rings (from 0 to k-1). So for ring number i (0-indexed), we subtract 4*i, which corresponds to the (i+1)-th ring in the problem's indexing.\n\n            # But wait, the problem's first ring (i=1) is subtracting 4*(1-1)=0. So our iteration for the first ring (i=0) subtracts 0, which is correct.\n\n            # Therefore, we can use:\n\n            #   n = w - 4*i\n            #   m = h - 4*i\n\n            # However, we must ensure that n and m are positive and that the rectangle exists (i.e., n>=1 and m>=1). But the constraint ensures that the smallest ring (the last one) will have at least 3x3.\n\n            # But note: we are iterating from i=0 to i=k-1. The constraint says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Then the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the last ring is min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3 (as we saw). So we are safe.\n\n            if n < 3 or m < 3:\n                # Actually, we don't need to break here because the constraint ensures we don't go below 3. But if we encounter a ring that doesn't have at least 3 in one dimension, then we cannot form the ring? However, the problem states k is bounded. But just in case, we can break early if the ring becomes invalid.\n                # But the constraint ensures that we won't. So we can skip the if and just calculate.\n                # However, let's use the condition: if n<1 or m<1, then the ring doesn't exist. But the constraint ensures we don't get to that. We'll calculate anyway.\n\n                # Actually, we can still calculate even if n or m is 1 or 2, but the formula 2*n+2*m-4 might yield negative or zero? \n                # Example: n=1, m=1: 2+2-4=0 -> no cell.\n                # Example: n=1, m=2: 2+4-4=2 -> but wait, a 1x2 rectangle: the border would be the entire rectangle? Actually, the border of a 1x2 is 2 cells (both cells are borders). But according to the formula: 2*1+2*2-4=2+4-4=2. That matches.\n\n                # However, the problem says the ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w-4*i) x (h-4*i). But if the inner rectangle is 1x2, then the border is the entire rectangle. \n\n                # But wait, the problem says the ring has width 1. In the case of 1x2, the entire rectangle is the border. So the formula works.\n\n                # But the constraint ensures that we don't have a ring with inner rectangle of 1x1? Actually, the constraint k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) ensures that the smallest inner rectangle is 3x3. \n\n                # However, if we are given w=5, h=5, then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then we only do i=0: n=5, m=5 -> 2*5+2*5-4=20-4=16.\n\n                # Then if we have w=5, h=5, k=1: output 16.\n\n                # But wait, the constraint says k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For w=5, h=5: floor((5+1)/4)=1, so k=1 is allowed.\n\n                # Now, what if we have w=4, h=4, k=1: \n                #   n=4, m=4 -> 2*4+2*4-4=12.\n\n                # The example above with w=4, h=4, k=1: output 12.\n\n                # The problem does not require the inner rectangle to have at least 3 in both dimensions? Actually, the constraint is on the minimum of w and h. \n\n                # But note: the condition in the problem for k is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n                # However, if we have w=5, h=4, then min(w,h)=4 -> floor((4+1)/4)=1. Then k=1: \n                #   n=5-0=5, m=4-0=4 -> 2*5+2*4-4=10+8-4=14.\n\n                # But wait, the inner rectangle for the first ring is 5x4. The border of 5x4: \n                #   top:5, bottom:5, left:4-2=2, right:4-2=2 -> 5+5+2+2=14. Correct.\n\n                # So the formula works for any n>=1 and m>=1.\n\n            total += 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n        Print total.\n\n        But wait: the example \"3 3 1\" -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The rings are drawn consecutively. We are subtracting 4*i for the i-th ring (0-indexed). \n\n        But wait, the problem subtracts 4*(i-1) for the i-th ring (with i starting at 1). So for the first ring (i=1) we subtract 0, for the second (i=2) we subtract 4, etc.\n\n        In our loop, we are subtracting 4*i. For the first ring (i=0) we subtract 0, for the second ring (i=1) we subtract 4, which matches.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read the input, split into w, h, k.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            n = w - 4*i\n            m = h - 4*i\n            if n <= 0 or m <= 0: \n                # According to the constraint, this should not happen. But if it does, we break.\n                break\n            # Calculate the border of the rectangle n x m\n            # But note: if n==1 and m==1, then we get 0, which is correct (no ring).\n            total += 2*n + 2*m - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate, and then the second ring is 2 cells away. The second ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w-4) x (h-4). But in our code, for the second ring (i=1) we subtract 4, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the example \"7 9 2\": \n            i=0: n=7, m=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=28\n            i=1: n=3, m=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12\n            total=40.\n\n        However, the example output is 40.\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away and so on.\" \n\n        Our code subtracts 4*i, so for the first ring i=0: subtract 0 -> edge.\n        second ring i=1: subtract 4 -> 2 cells away? \n\n        Actually, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge? \n\n        How many cells away? The first ring is the outermost border (so the ring is 1 cell wide and at the edge). The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, meaning that we leave two layers of cells (the outer two) and then take the next border. \n\n        The inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4*(2-1)) = w-4, and similarly for h. \n\n        So yes, we subtract 4*(i) for the i-th ring (0-indexed) which is 4*(i) = 4*(ring_index-1) for the ring_index-th ring (if we start counting rings from 1). \n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraint says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let me test with w=3, h=3, k=1: \n            i=0: n=3, m=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        Another test: w=5, h=5, k=1: \n            i=0: 2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"7 9 1\" gives 28, and \"7 9 2\" gives 40.\n\n        However, the sample input provided in the example is:\n            Input: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n            Output: ['8', '28', '40']\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But note: there is an alternative way to compute the same thing without a loop? \n\n        The i-th ring (0-indexed) has:\n            n_i = w - 4*i\n            m_i = h - 4*i\n\n            area_i = 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4\n\n        Then total = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*(w-4*i+h-4*i) - 4] \n                 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*(w+h) - 8*i - 4]\n                 = k * [2*(w+h)-4] - 8 * sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i\n                 = k*(2*(w+h)-4) - 8*(k*(k-1)//2)\n                 = 2*k*(w+h) - 4*k - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n        But wait, let me expand:\n\n            total = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*(w+h) - 8*i - 4]\n                   = 2*(w+h)*k - 4*k - 8 * (0+1+...+(k-1))\n                   = 2*(w+h)*k - 4*k - 8*(k*(k-1)//2)\n\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k=2:\n            = 2*2*(7+9) - 4*2 - 4*2*1\n            Wait, let me recalc:\n\n            Using the expanded form: \n                = 2*k*(w+h) - 4*k - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n            Actually, wait: the term in the sum is [2*(w+h) - 4 - 8*i]. So we have:\n\n            total = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*(w+h) - 4] - 8 * (0+1+...+k-1)\n\n            = k*(2*(w+h)-4) - 8*(k*(k-1)//2)\n\n            = 2*k*(w+h) - 4*k - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n            For w=7, h=9, k=2:\n                = 2*2*(7+9) - 4*2 - 4*2*(2-1)\n                = 4*16 - 8 - 8*1\n                = 64 - 8 - 8 = 48, which is not 40.\n\n        I see, I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\n        Actually, the expression for the i-th ring is: 2*(w-4*i+h-4*i) - 4 = 2*(w+h) - 8*i - 4.\n\n        Then the total is: \n            = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*(w+h) - 4 - 8*i]\n            = k*(2*(w+h)-4) - 8 * (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i)\n            = k*(2*(w+h)-4) - 8 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n\n        Now, for w=7, h=9, k=2:\n            = 2*(2*(7+9)-4) - 8*(2*1//2)   [Wait, no: the first term is k*(2*(w+h)-4) and then subtract 8*(k*(k-1)//2)]\n\n            Step-by-step:\n            k=2, w+h=16, so 2*(w+h)=32, then 32-4=28, then k*(28)=2*28=56.\n            Then subtract 8*(2*(2-1)//2) = 8*(2*1//2)=8*1=8.\n            Then 56-8=48, which is not 40.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        Let me recompute the terms for i=0 and i=1:\n\n            i=0: 2*(7+9) - 8*0 - 4 = 2*16 - 0 -4 = 32-4=28.\n            i=1: 2*(7+9) - 8*1 -4 = 32 -8 -4 = 20.\n\n            Then total=28+20=48, but wait, we computed the second ring as 20, but earlier we did 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12.\n\n        Why the discrepancy?\n\n        Because the second ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (7-4) x (9-4)=3x5, so:\n\n            area_second_ring = 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4=16-4=12.\n\n        But in the expanded formula, we used the original w and h for the second ring? \n\n        In the expanded formula, we wrote: 2*(w+h) - 8*i -4, but for the second ring (i=1) we should have:\n\n            n = w-4*i = 7-4=3, m=9-4=5.\n            Then 2*(n+m)-4 = 2*(3+5)-4=12.\n\n        But the expanded formula I wrote was: 2*(w+h) - 8*i -4 = 2*(7+9)-8*1-4= 2*16-8-4=32-12=20.\n\n        So the expanded formula is incorrect because the term 2*(w+h) is not the same as 2*(n_i+m_i) where n_i=w-4*i and m_i=h-4*i.\n\n        Actually, 2*(n_i+m_i)-4 = 2*(w-4*i+h-4*i)-4 = 2*(w+h) - 8*i -4, so the expansion is correct.\n\n        But wait, for the second ring: \n            2*(w+h)-8*i-4 = 2*(7+9)-8*1-4 = 32-8-4=20, but the direct calculation is 12.\n\n        This is because the direct calculation uses the inner dimensions (3 and 5) and the expanded formula uses the original dimensions (7 and 9) and subtracts 8*i (which is 8) and 4, but that 8 is not the same as the reduction in the inner rectangle? \n\n        Actually, the expansion is algebraically correct, but the example shows 20 vs 12.\n\n        Let me compute the expansion step for the second ring:\n\n            n_i = w-4*i = 7-4=3, m_i=9-4=5.\n            Then 2*(n_i+m_i)-4 = 2*(3+5)-4=2*8-4=16-4=12.\n\n        And the expansion: 2*(w+h)-8*i-4 = 2*(7+9)-8*1-4 = 2*16-8-4=32-12=20.\n\n        But wait, 2*(w+h) is 2*(7+9)=32, and 8*i is 8, then subtract 4: 32-8-4=20.\n\n        Why is there a difference? \n\n        Because the expansion is correct: \n            2*(w+h) - 8*i -4 = 2*w+2*h-8*i-4.\n\n        And the direct calculation for the second ring is: 2*(w-4*i)+(h-4*i)*2-4? Actually, wait, no: the direct calculation is 2*(n_i+m_i)-4, which is 2*( (w-4*i) + (h-4*i) ) -4 = 2*(w+h)-8*i-4.\n\n        So the direct calculation is the same as the expanded formula.\n\n        Then why for the second ring we get 12 from the direct calculation and 20 from the expanded formula? \n\n        Wait, let me recalc the expanded formula for the second ring: \n            n_i = w-4*i = 7-4=3\n            m_i = h-4*i = 9-4=5\n            Then 2*(n_i+m_i)-4 = 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4=16-4=12.\n\n        And the expanded formula: 2*(w+h)-8*i-4 = 2*(7+9)-8*1-4 = 2*16-8-4=32-12=20.\n\n        There is a mistake: the expanded formula is 2*(w+h)-8*i-4, and 2*(w+h) is 2*(7+9)=32, then subtract 8*i (which is 8) and 4: 32-8-4=20.\n\n        But wait, the direct calculation is 12, and the expansion is 20. They are different.\n\n        Let me check the algebra:\n\n            Direct: 2*(w-4*i+h-4*i)-4 = 2*(w+h) - 8*i -4.\n\n        So the expansion is correct. Then why for i=1 we get 12 from the direct and 20 from the expansion? \n\n        The direct calculation: 2*(n_i+m_i)-4 = 2*(3+5)-4 = 12.\n\n        And the expansion: 2*(w+h)-8*i-4 = 2*(7+9)-8*1-4 = 32-8-4=20.\n\n        But wait, 2*(w+h) is 2*(7+9)=32, and then we subtract 8*i (which is 8) and 4, so 32-8-4=20.\n\n        But the direct calculation uses the inner dimensions, which are 3 and 5. The expansion uses the original dimensions and subtracts 8*i, but note: the expansion is derived from the inner dimensions, so it must be the same.\n\n        The issue: the expansion is 2*(w+h)-8*i-4, and the direct calculation is 2*(w-4*i+h-4*i)-4 = 2*(w+h)-8*i-4. So they are the same.\n\n        Then why 2*(3+5)-4 = 12 and 2*(7+9)-8-4=20?\n\n        Wait, 2*(3+5) is 16, then 16-4=12. \n        And 2*(7+9) is 32, then 32-8-4=20.\n\n        But wait, 3+5 is 8, and 7+9 is 16, and 8*i=8, so:\n\n        The direct calculation for the second ring: 2*(3+5)-4 = 12.\n        The expansion: 2*(7+9)-8-4=32-12=20.\n\n        But wait, the expansion is: 2*(w+h) - 8*i -4 = 2*(7+9) - 8*1 -4 = 32-8",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is defined by its distance from the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells away from the previous one. The solution involves iterating over each ring, calculating the number of cells in its border, and summing these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is a rectangle of size \\( w \\times h \\). The first ring is the outermost border of this rectangle. Each subsequent ring is formed by stepping two cells inward from the previous ring. The number of cells in each ring's border is calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for overlapping corners: \\( 2 \\times (n + m) - 4 \\), where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are the dimensions of the current inner rectangle.\n2. **Key Insight**: For the \\( i \\)-th ring (0-indexed), the inner rectangle dimensions are \\( (w - 4i) \\times (h - 4i) \\). The number of cells in this ring's border is then \\( 2 \\times (w - 4i + h - 4i) - 4 \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate from \\( i = 0 \\) to \\( k-1 \\), compute the number of cells for each ring, and accumulate the total. The loop ensures we handle all \\( k \\) rings as specified.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\( O(k) \\) time, which is efficient given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        n = w - 4 * i\n        m = h - 4 * i\n        if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n            break\n        total += 2 * n + 2 * m - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers \\( w \\), \\( h \\), and \\( k \\), representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from \\( 0 \\) to \\( k-1 \\):\n   - Calculate the inner rectangle dimensions \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) by subtracting \\( 4i \\) from the original width and height.\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, exit the loop early (though constraints ensure this doesn't happen).\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring's border using the formula \\( 2n + 2m - 4 \\) and add it to `total`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the accumulated total.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total gilded cells by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
