A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters per bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (per friend for one toast)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast\n\n Conditions for a toast:\n   Each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt\" for making one toast.\n\n However, they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount. So, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total requirement is:\n   Drink: n * t * nl\n   Lime slices: n * t   (each toast requires one slice per friend? Actually, note: the problem says \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\" for one toast.\n   Salt: n * t * np\n\n But wait: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n Explanation from example:\n   Drink: 4 bottles * 5 ml = 20 ml -> enough for 20 / (nl * n) toasts per friend? Actually, the example says: \n        \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\" (because there are 3 friends, but wait: the example does not multiply by n in the drink requirement? Let me read again.\n\n Actually, note: the example says: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n Why 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml? But wait, the input has nl=3 (milliliters per toast) and there are 3 friends? \n\n Let me clarify: the problem states that each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams for one toast.\n\n So, if we are making t toasts per friend, then for the entire group we need:\n   Drink: t * n * nl   (because each of the n friends makes t toasts, so each toast uses nl ml, so total drink = n * t * nl)\n\n However, the example calculation for drink: \n        Total drink available = k * l = 4 * 5 = 20 ml.\n        Then the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) that can be made with the drink is floor(20 / (n * nl))? \n        But wait, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts\". \n\n Here, 3 is the value of nl (ml per toast) multiplied by the number of friends? Actually, no: the example says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast, meaning that for one toast by one friend, you need nl ml. Therefore, if we are making t toasts for one friend, that friend alone would use t * nl ml. For n friends, total drink used is n * t * nl.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the total number of toasts (across all friends) is T. Then each toast requires nl ml (because each toast is for one friend, so one toast uses nl ml). But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams\" for one toast. So one toast is associated with one friend.\n\n Actually, the total number of toasts is T = n * t, because each friend makes t toasts. Then the drink required is T * nl = n * t * nl.\n\n So the example: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n Drink: total available = 4*5 = 20 ml.\n        Maximum T (total toasts) from drink: floor(20 / 3) = 6 (since 6*3=18 <=20, 7*3=21>20).\n        Then the number of toasts per friend is t = T / n = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n Similarly, for limes: \n        Total slices available = c * d = 10 * 8 = 80 slices.\n        Each toast requires 1 slice (so total toasts T cannot exceed 80). Then T_max from limes = 80.\n        Then t = min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 6/3 = 2.\n\n But wait, the example also considers salt: \n        Total salt available = 100 grams.\n        Each toast requires np=1 gram of salt, so total toasts T cannot exceed 100.\n        Then T_max = min(floor(20/3), 80, 100) = 6.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink: total_drink = k * l\n 2. The maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) from drink: max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (nl * n) ? \n    But wait: in the example, we did 20 // 3 (which is 6) and 3 is nl (the ml per toast) but note: one toast requires nl ml, and we are making T toasts (each toast being one friend's one toast). However, the drink condition: \n        total_drink >= T * nl   => T <= total_drink / nl\n    But wait, the example didn't multiply by n? \n\n Let me reexamine: In the example, they say \"it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts\". They are considering the entire group's drink for the total toasts. Actually, note: each toast requires nl milliliters. The entire group will have T toasts (each toast is one friend's one toast). So the total drink needed is T * nl.\n\n But wait, in the example they only divided by 3 (nl) and got 6. That 6 is the total toasts (for the entire group). Then the per friend toasts is 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n Alternatively, if we think: \n    Condition for drink: T * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k*l) // nl   (if we use integer division, but note we are making whole toasts)\n\n However, note: the example does not multiply by n in the denominator. Why? Because the condition is on the total drink for all toasts. The drink requirement for one toast is nl, regardless of the number of friends? Actually, no: wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if one toast is for one friend, then one toast requires nl ml. Therefore, the entire group's toasts (T) require T * nl ml.\n\n But then why in the example they divided by 3 (nl) and not by (nl * n)? \n\n Let me check: \n        If we do: total_drink / nl = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.66 -> floor to 6. This is the total number of toasts (across all friends) that can be made with the drink.\n\n Now, the same condition can be written as: \n        T <= (k * l) / nl\n\n Then the number of toasts per friend is T / n, but we must take the floor (integer) and also consider the other resources.\n\n However, note: we cannot have fractional toasts. So we have to take the floor of the minimum of the three resources.\n\n Steps:\n\n   total_drink = k * l\n   total_lime_slices = c * d\n   total_salt = p\n\n   The maximum toasts (for the entire group) from drink: T_drink = total_drink // nl   [but wait, is that correct?]\n\n   But note: the condition for drink is: T * nl <= total_drink. Since T must be an integer, we can have at most floor(total_drink / nl) toasts.\n\n   Similarly, for limes: each toast requires 1 slice, so we can have at most total_lime_slices toasts.\n\n   For salt: each toast requires np grams, so we can have at most p // np toasts (using integer division).\n\n   Then the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) is:\n        T = min(total_drink // nl, total_lime_slices, p // np)\n\n   Then the number of toasts per friend is T // n? \n\n   Wait, no: because T is the total toasts (for all friends). Then each friend can make T / n toasts? But T might not be divisible by n. However, the problem requires that each friend drinks the same amount (same number of toasts). So we cannot exceed T_total = T, and then we divide T_total by n (and we must use integer division? because we cannot have a fraction of a toast per friend).\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\" and the answer is the maximum integer t such that:\n        n * t * nl <= total_drink\n        n * t <= total_lime_slices   (each toast per friend requires one slice, so for each friend t slices, and total slices used is n*t)\n        n * t * np <= p\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n        t1 = total_drink // (n * nl)   -> maximum t for drink? But wait, this is not the same.\n\n   Let me compare two methods:\n\n   Method 1 (by total toasts):\n        T_max = min(total_drink // nl, total_lime_slices, p // np)\n        Then t = T_max // n   (but wait, if T_max is 6 and n=3, then 6//3=2)\n\n   But is that correct? Let's test with the example:\n\n        T_drink = 20 // 3 = 6\n        T_lime = 80\n        T_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n        T_max = 6\n        t = 6 // 3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   However, consider another example: \n        Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n        Here: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        total_drink = 100 * 10 = 1000\n        T_drink = 1000 // 4 = 250\n\n        total_lime_slices = 1 * 19 = 19\n        T_lime = 19\n\n        total_salt = 90\n        T_salt = 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        T_max = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n\n        Then t = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19 divided by 5 is 3 with remainder 4)\n\n        Output: 3 -> matches the sample output.\n\n   Another sample: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n        total_drink = 1000*1000 = 1000000\n        T_drink = 1000000 // 50 = 20000\n\n        total_lime_slices = 25*23 = 575\n        T_lime = 575\n\n        total_salt = 1\n        T_salt = 1 // 1 = 1\n\n        T_max = 1\n        t = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n   So the answer is 0.\n\n   But wait: the condition for drink: 10 * t * 50 <= 1000000 -> t <= 200000, which is satisfied for t=0.\n   Condition for lime: 10 * t <= 575 -> t <= 57.5 -> so t<=57 for the entire group, but we are limited by salt to 0.5? Actually, the condition for salt: 10 * t * 1 <= 1 -> t <= 0.1, so t must be 0.\n\n   Therefore, the method is:\n\n        Read the 8 integers.\n\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_lime_slices = c * d\n        total_salt = p\n\n        # Calculate the maximum total toasts (across all friends) for each resource:\n        # For drink: total_drink / nl -> but we can only use whole toasts, so floor division. However, note: we cannot use more than total_drink, so T_drink = total_drink // nl   (this gives the maximum total toasts from drink)\n        # For lime: T_lime = total_lime_slices   (each toast uses 1 slice)\n        # For salt: T_salt = total_salt // np   (each toast uses np grams, so floor division)\n\n        Then T_max = min(total_drink // nl, total_lime_slices, total_salt // np)\n\n        Then the number of toasts per friend is T_max // n   (because T_max is the total toasts, and there are n friends, each must have the same integer number of toasts, so we divide by n and take the floor)\n\n   However, wait: the condition for drink is that the total drink is n * t * nl, so we can also compute:\n\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [maximum t from drink] \n        t_lime = (c * d) // n            [because each friend needs t slices, so total slices needed is n*t, and we have c*d slices] -> then t <= (c*d) // n (using integer division)\n        t_salt = (p) // (n * np)          [because total salt needed is n * t * np]\n\n        Then t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n   Let me test the first example with this method:\n\n        Example 1: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        t_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n        t_lime = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26   (but wait, we are calculating the number of toasts per friend? Then the total toasts is n * t, so for drink: total drink needed = n * t * nl = 3 * t * 3 = 9*t. So t_drink = 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n        t_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n        Then t = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Now the second example:\n\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n        t_drink = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n        t_lime = (1*19) // 5 = 19 // 5 = 3\n        t_salt = 90 // (5*3) = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n        Then t = min(50, 3, 6) = 3.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Third example:\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n        t_drink = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n        t_lime = (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n        t_salt = 1 // (10*1) = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        Then t = 0.\n\n   So both methods are equivalent.\n\n   Which one to choose?\n\n   The first method (using total toasts) is:\n\n        T_drink = (k * l) // nl   [then we are going to divide by n to get per friend? but wait, no: because the condition is that the total toasts T must satisfy T <= (k*l)//nl and T <= (c*d) and T <= (p)//np, and then t = T // n? \n\n   But note: the condition for drink in the first method is: T * nl <= k * l, and the condition for the per friend is that the total toasts T must be divisible by n? Actually, no: the problem requires that each friend makes the same number of toasts, but the total toasts T does not necessarily have to be divisible by n. We are to find the maximum t (integer) such that:\n\n        n * t * nl <= k * l\n        n * t <= c * d\n        n * t * np <= p\n\n   Then t is the same for each friend.\n\n   We can solve for t:\n\n        t <= (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t <= (c * d) // n\n        t <= (p) // (n * np)\n\n   Then t = min( (k * l) // (n * nl), (c * d) // n, (p) // (n * np) )\n\n   This is the same as the second method.\n\n   However, note: the first method also uses integer division and the same result.\n\n   Why? Because:\n\n        In the first method, we computed T_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) and then t = T_max // n.\n\n        But note: the condition for drink in the first method is T * nl <= k*l, and T = n*t, so:\n\n            n*t * nl <= k*l  => t <= (k*l) // (n*nl)   (using integer division, because we cannot use a fraction of a toast per friend)\n\n        Similarly, for lime: n*t <= c*d  => t <= (c*d) // n.\n\n        For salt: n*t*np <= p  => t <= p // (n*np).\n\n   Therefore, both methods are equivalent.\n\n   However, the first method might be slightly more straightforward to understand.\n\n   But wait: the first method uses the total toasts (T) and then divides by n to get t. However, the condition for drink is that the total toasts T must be <= (k*l)//nl, and then t = T // n. But note: T must be divisible by n? Not necessarily. We want the maximum t such that n*t <= T_max (from each condition). \n\n   Actually, the maximum t is the minimum of the three:\n\n        t1 = (k*l) // (nl * n)   [because n*t <= (k*l)//nl doesn't directly give this, but wait: we have two ways to express the same condition]\n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n        Condition 1: n * t * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)   -> so the maximum t from drink is floor((k*l)/(n*nl))\n\n        Condition 2: n * t <= c * d   => t <= (c*d) / n   -> floor((c*d)/n)\n\n        Condition 3: n * t * np <= p   => t <= p / (n*np)   -> floor(p/(n*np))\n\n   So the second method is:\n\n        t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n   However, note: integer division truncates towards zero. But since we are dealing with positive integers and the conditions are about whole toasts, we can use floor division (which is the same as integer division for positive numbers).\n\n   But caution: in Python, for positive numbers, // is the same as floor division.\n\n   Let me test with the first example using the second method:\n\n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // 9 = 2\n        (c*d) // n = 80 // 3 = 26\n        p // (n*np) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n        t = 2.\n\n   The third example: \n        (k*l) // (n*nl) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n        (c*d) // n = 575 // 10 = 57\n        p // (n*np) = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        t = 0.\n\n   So we'll use the second method.\n\n   However, note: the condition for drink in the second method is expressed as (k*l) // (n*nl). But wait, what if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl)? Then we are taking the floor, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        # There are 8 integers\n        n = int(data[0])\n        k = int(data[1])\n        l = int(data[2])\n        c = int(data[3])\n        d = int(data[4])\n        p = int(data[5])\n        nl = int(data[6])\n        np = int(data[7])\n\n        # Calculate the maximum t for each constraint\n\n        # Drink constraint: n * t * nl <= k * l  => t <= (k * l) // (n * nl)   [using integer floor division]\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # Note: if (k*l) is less than (n*nl), then this will be 0.\n\n        # Lime constraint: n * t <= c * d  => t <= (c * d) // n\n        t_lime = (c * d) // n\n\n        # Salt constraint: n * t * np <= p  => t <= p // (n * np)\n        t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n        t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n        print(t)\n\n   Let me test with a sample that fails the first method? Actually, let me test a different one.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"2 10 10 10 10 10 5 1\"\n\n        n=2, k=10, l=10, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=5, np=1.\n\n        Drink: total_drink = 100\n        Condition for drink: total_drink >= n*t*nl -> 100 >= 2*t*5 -> 100 >= 10*t -> t <= 10.\n\n        Lime: total_slices = 100, condition: 2*t <= 100 -> t <= 50.\n        Salt: 2*t*1 <= 10 -> t <= 5.\n\n        Then t = 5.\n\n        Using our code:\n\n        t_drink = 100 // (2*5) = 100 // 10 = 10\n        t_lime = (10*10) // 2 = 100 // 2 = 50\n        t_salt = 10 // (2*1) = 10 // 2 = 5\n\n        min(10,50,5)=5 -> correct.\n\n   Another test: when one of the constraints is not an integer division? \n\n        Example: \"2 11 10 10 10 10 5 1\"\n\n        total_drink = 110 -> 110 // 10 = 11, so t_drink=11, but condition: 2*t*5<=110 -> 10*t<=110 -> t<=11 -> so 11 is allowed.\n\n        But wait, the drink condition: 2*11*5=110 <=110 -> yes.\n\n        Then t=5 (from salt) remains the limiting factor? Actually, the salt constraint is still 10//(2)=5, so t=5.\n\n        However, if we change the salt to 11, then t_salt = 11//2=5 (same). \n\n   It's consistent.\n\n   But note: the second method uses integer division for all, which is correct because we cannot have a fraction of a toast.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the condition for drink and salt are linear, but the lime condition is just integer division. But the problem says the inputs are positive integers.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        Read the 8 integers.\n\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t_lime = (c * d) // n\n        t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n        t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n        print(t)\n\n   But wait, what if n * nl is zero? The problem says positive integers, so n>=1, nl>=1, so no division by zero.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the example input format: one line with 8 space separated integers.\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # According to the problem, there is one line with 8 integers, so normally there should be 8 tokens.\n            # But if there's an empty line, we skip.\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n = int(data[0]); k = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); c = int(data[3]); d = int(data[4]); p = int(data[5]); nl = int(data[6]); np = int(data[7])\n\n        # Now calculate\n\n        # But note: the drink condition: total_drink = k*l, and we need to divide by (n*nl). Similarly for others.\n\n        # However, note: the condition for drink is: n * t * nl <= k * l\n        # We are solving for t: t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n        t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # This is the maximum t from drink\n        t2 = (c * d) // n           # From lime\n        t3 = p // (n * np)           # From salt\n\n        ans = min(t1, t2, t3)\n        print(ans)\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the input numbers are not less than 1, so no zeros.\n\n   But note: the example \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" gives 0, which is correct.\n\n   This matches the sample outputs.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> 2\n        Example 2: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> 3\n        Example 3: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> 0\n\n   So we output the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the example input was given as a list of strings in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the numbers are positive and not exceeding 1000, so integer division is safe.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring that all friends can partake equally in the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on three constraints: the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource, and the solution must ensure that all friends have the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves determining the maximum number of toasts per friend by considering each resource separately. For each resource, we calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made (considering the entire group) and then divide by the number of friends to get the per-friend count. The smallest of these values across all resources will be the answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Calculating the total available drink and dividing it by the product of the number of friends and the drink required per toast.\n   - Calculating the total available lime slices and dividing by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - Calculating the total available salt and dividing it by the product of the number of friends and the salt required per toast.\n   - The minimum of these three values gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, which are constant time operations O(1), making it very efficient even for the upper constraint limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t_lime = (c * d) // n\n    t_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink required per toast, and salt required per toast, respectively.\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l`. Each friend requires `nl` milliliters per toast, so the maximum toasts per friend from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each friend requires one slice per toast, so the maximum toasts per friend from limes is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each friend requires `np` grams per toast, so the maximum toasts per friend from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Determining the Answer**: The answer is the minimum of the three calculated values, as this represents the limiting factor that no other resource can exceed. This ensures all friends can make the same number of toasts without running out of any resource. The result is printed as an integer.",
