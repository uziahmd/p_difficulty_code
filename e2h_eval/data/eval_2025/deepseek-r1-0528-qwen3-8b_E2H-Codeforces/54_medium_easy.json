Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a.\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n Observation:\n The angle at vertex v2 (the middle one) can be thought of as being formed by two sides: one from v2 to v1 and one from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the three points to be consecutive. But in a regular polygon, the angle at a vertex is determined by the number of edges (or steps) between the two points.\n\n Actually, the problem allows any three distinct vertices. But note: the angle must be formed with v2 as the vertex, so the two sides are from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n How to compute the angle?\n Let's consider the circle inscribed in the polygon (or rather, the circumcircle). The regular polygon is inscribed in a circle.\n\n The angle at v2 can be calculated by considering the two arcs: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n In a regular polygon, the interior angles are fixed, but note: the problem does not require the interior angle. It requires an angle (which might be formed by two edges that are not necessarily adjacent). However, note that the angle at vertex v2 must be an angle of the polygon or an angle formed by two chords from v2.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\".\n\n This means that the two sides of the angle are the line segments from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. Since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 will be the smaller one (i.e., the one inside the polygon? Actually, note: the angle in the problem is measured in the usual way, and since the polygon is convex, the angle we form at v2 must be the one that lies inside the polygon if we take the two points appropriately.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the angle must be the interior angle. But observe: the two points v1 and v3 must lie on the sides. In the context of the polygon, the sides are the edges. But the problem says \"v1 and v3 lie on its sides\", meaning they are on the two rays starting from v2 and going through the edges? Actually, the problem says \"three distinct vertices\" and the polygon is convex, so we are allowed to pick any three vertices.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 67\": \n   Input: n=4, a=67 -> Output: \"2 1 3\"\n\n Let me check: \n   In a square (n=4), the regular square has interior angles of 90°. But we can also form other angles?\n\n How do we compute the angle at vertex 2 (which is the second vertex, say labeled 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order) for the three points (1,2,3)? \n\n Let's label the square: vertices 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order.\n\n Consider vertex 2. The two sides of the angle are from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 3. \n   - The edge from 2 to 1: this is the previous vertex (so direction left from 2).\n   - The edge from 2 to 3: this is the next vertex (so direction right from 2).\n\n Then the angle at 2 is the interior angle of the square, which is 90°.\n\n But wait, the example output for \"4 67\" is \"2 1 3\", meaning the angle at vertex 2 (which is 90°) is chosen because |90-67| = 23, but why not use the other possibility?\n\n Actually, note: the problem does not require the angle to be the interior angle. The angle is defined by the two rays from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. In a convex polygon, the angle we get can be either the interior one or the exterior one? But wait: the problem says \"lie on its sides\", meaning the two sides of the angle must be the sides of the polygon? Actually, no: the problem says \"three distinct vertices\" and then the angle is formed by the two line segments. \n\n However, note that the example input \"4 68\" gives output \"4 1 2\". Let's check:\n\n For n=4, a=68, the output is \"4 1 2\".\n\n This means: vertex 4, and the two points are 1 and 2.\n\n Now, how to calculate the angle at vertex 4 for the points (1,2)?\n\n The two vectors from 4: to 1 and to 2.\n\n But wait: the square's vertices are equally spaced. We can use the circle. The center is O. The angle at the center for two adjacent vertices is 90° (since 360/4=90).\n\n The angle at vertex 4 (the central angle for the arc from 4 to 1 and 4 to 2) is actually two arcs: from 4 to 1 and from 4 to 2.\n\n However, note: the two points 1 and 2 are adjacent to each other and to 4? Actually, in the square, the vertices are connected in a cycle: 1-2-3-4-1.\n\n So from vertex 4, the two adjacent vertices are 3 and 1. But the example uses 1 and 2.\n\n How do we compute the angle at vertex 4 for points 1 and 2?\n\n We can use the law of cosines in the triangle (1,2,4). But note: the square is regular, so the side lengths are all equal, and the diagonals are equal.\n\n However, there's a geometric property: the angle at vertex 4 in the triangle (1,2,4) is half the difference of the arcs? Or use the fact that the polygon is cyclic.\n\n Alternatively, we can map the vertices to a circle. Let the center be O. Then the angle at vertex 4 (angle 4-1-2) is the angle between the lines 4-1 and 4-2.\n\n The central angles for the arcs:\n   arc(4->1): 90° (since adjacent)\n   arc(4->2): 180° (because from 4 to 2: passing through 1? Actually, in a circle, the arc from 4 to 2 can be the minor arc (which goes through 3) or the major arc (through 1). Since the polygon is convex, we consider the minor arc? Actually, the two points 1 and 2 are both on the same side of vertex 4? \n\n Let me draw a square: \n   Vertices: 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order.\n\n From vertex 4, we go to 1 (adjacent) and to 2 (which is two steps away in the clockwise direction, but one step counterclockwise? Actually, the square has four vertices. The two points 1 and 2: \n   Counterclockwise from 4: next is 1, then 2 (so two steps). Clockwise from 4: 3, then 2 (two steps). \n\n Actually, the two arcs from 4 to 1 and 4 to 2 are of different lengths? \n\n But note: the problem doesn't specify the order of v1 and v3. The angle is the same regardless of the order? Actually, the angle is defined by the two rays: one ray from 4 to 1 and one from 4 to 2.\n\n The angle at 4 in the triangle (1,4,2) is the same as the angle at 4 in the triangle (2,4,1). \n\n How to compute it? \n\n In the circle, the angle at 4 (which is on the circumference) for the chord 1-2 is half the difference of the arcs? Actually, the formula for an inscribed angle is half the central angle subtended by the arc. But here, we are looking at the angle at the circumference (vertex 4) for the chord 1-2. \n\n However, note: the angle we are forming is not the inscribed angle for the arc 1-2, because the vertex is 4, and the two sides are from 4 to 1 and 4 to 2. This is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from 1 to 2 that does not contain 4. \n\n Actually, the arc from 1 to 2 that does not contain 4 is the minor arc (if the square is labeled 1,2,3,4 clockwise, then from 1 to 2 the minor arc is 90°). Then the inscribed angle would be half of that, i.e., 45°.\n\n So the angle at vertex 4 is 45°.\n\n Therefore, in the second sample test (n=4, a=67) we can form two types of angles at vertex 2 (which is the second vertex, and also at other vertices) and at vertex 4 (as above) we can form 45°.\n\n Similarly, at vertex 2 we can form:\n   Using adjacent vertices: 1 and 3 -> forms the interior angle 90°.\n   Using non-adjacent vertices: one adjacent and one skip one (like 4 and 1, but wait, from vertex 2, the two adjacent are 1 and 3. Then using 1 and 4: \n        Then the two arcs: from 2 to 1 (arc length 90°) and from 2 to 4 (arc length 180°). Then the angle at 2 would be half the difference of the two arcs? \n\n Actually, let me recast: \n\n There is a known fact: the angle between two chords intersecting at a point on the circle (here vertex 2) is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But wait, the chords are from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. However, these chords are not intersecting inside the circle; the vertex is on the circle.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the formula for the angle between two chords from a point on the circle:\n\n Angle = (360° - (arc1 + arc2)) / 2 ?\n\n But wait, let me think differently. Since the polygon is regular, we can compute the angle at vertex v2 for two vertices v1 and v3 by:\n\n Let d1 = distance from v2 to v1 (in terms of edges: the minimum steps along the polygon from v2 to v1, either clockwise or counterclockwise, but we take the shorter one? Actually, we have to consider the entire circle.)\n\n Actually, we can fix vertex v2 and then consider the two points v1 and v3. The two points divide the circle into two arcs: one going clockwise from v1 to v3 and the other counterclockwise. But note: the angle at v2 is formed by the two chords, so it is the angle between these two chords.\n\n There is a standard way to compute the angle between two chords from a point on the circle: \n   The angle θ is given by: θ = (arc(1,3) * (1-2π))/2 ? Not exactly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the central angles are known. Let the center be O. Then the angle at vertex 2 (angle 2-1-4) is the angle between the vectors from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4.\n\n We can compute the central angles for the arcs from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4.\n\n However, note: the angle at vertex 2 (on the circumference) for the chord from 1 to 4 is actually an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from 1 to 4. But wait, our angle is formed by two chords from 2: one to 1 and one to 4. This is an angle at the circumference that subtends the arc from 1 to 4 (the one not containing 2). \n\n The inscribed angle theorem says: the angle is half the central angle of the subtended arc.\n\n But note: the two chords are from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. The subtended arc is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. \n\n In the square, from 2, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2: \n   The square: 1,2,3,4. The two arcs from 1 to 4: one is the direct arc (clockwise: 1->4) which is 90° (if we go 1->4, then that's one edge, so 90° central angle). The other arc (counterclockwise) from 1 to 4 is 270°.\n\n We take the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle theorem uses the minor arc? But the angle at the circumference is defined for the arc that is opposite to the angle.\n\n However, note: the two chords from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4: the angle at 2 is the angle between these two chords. The two chords divide the circle into two arcs: the arc from 1 to 4 that goes through 3 (the major arc) and the arc from 1 to 4 that goes through the other side (the minor arc). \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the arc that is intercepted by the angle. The angle at 2 intercepts the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. Since 2 is adjacent to 1, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the one going clockwise from 1 to 4 (if we are considering the square labeled 1,2,3,4 clockwise, then from 1 to 4: clockwise is 1->2->3->4, which is the long way, and counterclockwise is 1->4 directly, which is the short way). \n\n But wait, from 1 to 4, the short way is the edge 1-4? Actually, in the square, the edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. So the direct connection from 1 to 4 is an edge. Therefore, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the edge 1-4 (central angle 90°). \n\n Then the inscribed angle at 2 (for the chord 1-4) is half the central angle of the arc 1-4 (which is 90°) -> 45°.\n\n But wait, in the square, the two chords from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4: \n   The chord from 2 to 1 is the edge 2-1 (which is present) and the chord from 2 to 4 is a diagonal? Actually, no: in the square, the diagonal is from 2 to 4? Yes, because 2 is opposite to 4? Actually, in a square, vertex 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, and opposite to 4. \n\n So the chord from 2 to 4 is the diagonal. Then the angle at 2 between the edge 2-1 and the diagonal 2-4 is 45°.\n\n Therefore, we can form angles of 45° and 90° in the square.\n\n So the problem reduces to: we can form an angle at a vertex by choosing two other vertices, and the angle value is determined by the number of edges (steps) between the two chosen points (relative to the vertex). Specifically, if we fix vertex v2, then we choose two vertices v1 and v3. The angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). \n\n Actually, we can compute the angle by the number of edges between v2 and v1, and between v2 and v3. Let:\n   d1 = min(|v2 - v1|, n - |v2 - v1|)   [but wait, the polygon is cyclic, so we have two directions. However, note: the angle is determined by the two chords, and the central angle for the arc from v2 to v1 is (step * (360/n)), where step is the minimum steps (but actually, we must consider the entire circle: the two arcs from v2 to v1 are step and n-step, and the chord is determined by the central angle which is min(step, n-step)* (360/n) ? \n\n Actually, the central angle for the arc from v2 to v1 (the minor arc) is (min(step, n-step)) * (360/n). But the angle we are computing (the angle at the circumference) is half the central angle of the opposite arc (the one that is intercepted). \n\n However, note: the angle at the circumference is half the central angle of the intercepted arc (which is the arc that is opposite to the angle). The intercepted arc is the one that is not containing the vertex. \n\n Let me define:\n   Let k1 = the number of edges from v2 to v1 in the clockwise direction (without wrapping more than necessary, but we have to consider the circle) and k2 for the counterclockwise direction.\n\n Actually, we can fix v2 at 0, then v1 is at position i (from -floor((n-1)/2) to floor(n/2)) but that complicates.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the angle at the circumference is half the difference of the two arcs? Actually, the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc.\n\n But the intercepted arc is the one that is between the two points (v1 and v3) and not containing the vertex v2. \n\n However, wait: the two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 intercept the arc from v1 to v3 (the one not containing v2). \n\n So the central angle for the intercepted arc is (k * (360/n)), where k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc (the minor arc or the one not containing v2? Actually, we take the arc that is intercepted, which is the one opposite to the angle.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. The measure of the intercepted arc is the central angle for that arc.\n\n Then the angle at v2 is (intercepted_arc_central_angle) / 2.\n\n However, there's a catch: the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to the vertex. \n\n Example: in the square, for vertex 2, if we choose v1=1 and v3=4, then the intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. That arc is the minor arc (90°). Then the angle is 45°.\n\n But if we choose v1=1 and v3=3 (adjacent to 2 on the other side) then the intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2. The arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2: in the square, from 1 to 3: the two arcs are: one passing through 2 (180°) and one passing through 4 (180°). Wait, actually, the square is symmetric. \n\n Let me label the square: \n   1\n 4   2\n    3\n\n Then from vertex 2, the two points 1 and 3: \n   The intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 2. The two arcs: \n      One arc: 1->4->3 (central angle 180°)\n      The other arc: 1->2->3 (central angle 180°)\n\n So the intercepted arc is 180°, then the angle at 2 is 90°.\n\n So the formula: angle = (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the intercepted arc (the central angle of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2).\n\n How to compute the intercepted arc? \n   Let the total circle be 360°. The two arcs from v1 to v3: one of them is the one containing v2 and the other is the one not containing v2. \n\n   The intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) is the one that is opposite to the angle. Its measure is (360 - (arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2))? \n\n Actually, the arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 is the one that goes from v1 to v2 to v3. The central angle for that arc is (d1 + d2) * (360/n), where d1 is the number of edges from v1 to v2 (in the clockwise direction) and d2 from v2 to v3 (clockwise direction). But wait, we have two directions.\n\n Alternatively, we can assign indices to the vertices. Let the vertices be numbered 0 to n-1 (for computation, then we add 1 when outputting). Then the central angle for an arc from vertex i to vertex j is (min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)) * (360/n) ??? No, because the central angle is (|i-j| * (360/n)) if we take the minor arc? But wait, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the vertex, so we need the major arc sometimes.\n\n Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that is not the one containing the vertex. So if we fix v2, then the two points v1 and v3 split the circle into two arcs. The one that does not contain v2 is the intercepted arc.\n\n The central angle of the intercepted arc is (total circle) minus the central angle of the arc that goes from v1 to v3 passing through v2.\n\n How to compute the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 passing through v2? \n   We can compute the two arcs from v1 to v3: \n        arc1 = (number of edges from v1 to v3 in the clockwise direction) * (360/n)\n        arc2 = (number of edges from v1 to v3 in the counterclockwise direction) * (360/n)\n\n   Then the arc that passes through v2 is the one that is the longer one if v2 is not on the minor arc, but wait: v2 is between v1 and v3 in one of the two arcs. \n\n Actually, we can compute the distances from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 in both directions.\n\n Let d1 = the clockwise distance from v2 to v1 (in terms of edges: the number of edges you traverse from v2 to v1 in the clockwise direction, including the starting vertex? Actually, we want the central angle for the arc from v2 to v1, which is (clockwise_edges * (360/n)) if we take the clockwise arc, and similarly for the other direction.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. This is the same as the arc from v1 to v3 that goes the opposite way from the one containing v2.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the central angle for the intercepted arc as:\n\n   Let d = the number of edges from v1 to v3 in the direction that does not contain v2. Then the central angle = d * (360/n)\n\n Then the angle at v2 is (central_angle) / 2.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2). Then the central angle is (d * (360/n)) and the angle at v2 is half of that.\n\n However, wait: in the example of the square (n=4) and v2=2, v1=1, v3=4:\n   The intercepted arc from 1 to 4 (not containing 2) is the minor arc (1 edge) so central angle = 90°, then angle at v2 = 45°.\n\n Another example: v2=2, v1=1, v3=3 (adjacent on the other side):\n   The intercepted arc from 1 to 3 (not containing 2) is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 to 3 (which is 2 edges, so central angle 180°). Then angle at v2 = 90°.\n\n So the formula is: \n   angle = (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the central angle of the intercepted arc (the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2).\n\n Now, how to compute the intercepted arc length (in terms of edges) without knowing the labeling? \n\n We can fix v2 at position 0. Then the vertices are labeled 0 to n-1 in clockwise order.\n\n For two points v1 and v3 (with indices x and y), the arc from x to y that does not contain 0 (v2) is the arc that goes from x to y without passing through 0.\n\n Steps:\n   Let x = index of v1, y = index of v3 (relative to v2 at 0). Then the two arcs from x to y are:\n        arc1: from x to y in the positive (clockwise) direction: length = (y - x) % n, but if negative then adjust.\n        arc2: the other arc: n - arc1.\n\n   But note: we want the arc that does not contain 0. \n\n   How to check which arc contains 0? \n        If we are going from x to y in the positive direction (without wrapping) and 0 is not in the open interval (x, y) (considering modulo n) then the positive arc does not contain 0? Actually, we have to consider the circularity.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the two arcs from x to y, and then decide which one does not contain 0.\n\n   But note: we are only concerned with the central angle, and the angle at v2 is half the intercepted arc (the one that doesn't contain v2). \n\n   However, note: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2 (which is 0). So we choose the arc from x to y that does not pass through 0.\n\n   Example: n=4, x=1 (v1), y=0 (v2) is fixed, then we consider v3=3 (index 3). Then the two arcs from 1 to 3: \n        Positive (clockwise): from 1 to 3: [1,2,3] -> contains 2, but not 0? Actually, we are at 0 (v2) and the arc from 1 to 3 in the positive direction does not contain 0. The other arc (negative) from 1 to 3: [1,0,3] -> contains 0.\n\n   So the intercepted arc is the positive one (length 2 edges, central angle 180°). Then angle = 90°.\n\n   But wait, in this example, we fixed v2=0, and the two points are 1 and 3. The intercepted arc (the one not containing 0) is the positive one (from 1 to 3) of length 2 edges (central angle 180°). Then the angle is 90°.\n\n   However, note: the intercepted arc is the one that the angle \"sees\", which is the arc opposite to the vertex. In the square, the angle at 0 (vertex 2) for the points 1 and 3 is the interior angle, which is 90°. Correct.\n\n   Now, if we take v1=1 and v3=0 is fixed and then we consider v3=2? But wait, we cannot choose v2 again. \n\n   Actually, we are given three distinct vertices.\n\n   So the problem: we need to find three distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3) such that the angle at v2 (computed as half the central angle of the intercepted arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n   How to iterate? \n        n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over all triples.\n\n   Alternative approach:\n\n   Note: the angle at v2 is determined by the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is an arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) and its central angle is (k * (360/n)), where k is the number of edges in that arc (so the arc length in terms of edges). Then the angle is (k * (360/n)) / 2 = (k * 180) / n.\n\n   But note: the intercepted arc is the entire arc from v1 to v3 not containing v2, and the central angle for that arc is (k * (360/n)) where k is the number of edges in the arc (so the arc from v1 to v3 has k edges, meaning k+1 vertices including endpoints? Actually, the central angle for an arc with k edges is (k * (360/n)). \n\n   However, the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) has a certain number of edges. The minimal k for the intercepted arc is from 1 to n-1 (because the entire circle is 360°, and the intercepted arc must be less than 360°). \n\n   Then the angle can be: (k * 180) / n, for k from 1 to n-1.\n\n   But note: the same angle might be achieved by different k? Actually, k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc, so k can be from 1 to n-1, and the angle is (k * 180) / n.\n\n   However, wait: the intercepted arc might be the major arc? Actually, the intercepted arc is defined as the one that does not contain v2, so it can be any arc from 1 to n-1 edges (but note: the entire circle is 360°, so the intercepted arc must be less than 360°, and the other arc is the complement. But we are only taking one of the two arcs (the one that doesn't contain v2). \n\n   But note: the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to the vertex, so it can be from 1 to n-1 edges (because if we take the entire circle except the vertex, then the arc from v1 to v3 must be at least 1 edge and at most n-1 edges).\n\n   Therefore, the set of angles we can form is { (k * 180 / n) for k in [1, n-1] }.\n\n   However, wait: is that true? \n\n   Example: n=4, k=1: angle= 180/4 = 45°.\n            k=2: angle= 360/4 = 90°.\n            k=3: angle= 540/4 = 135°.\n\n   But wait, in the square, the maximum angle we can form is 90°? Because the polygon is convex and the angle at the circumference must be less than 180°. Also, note: the intercepted arc cannot be more than 180°? Actually, no: the intercepted arc can be up to almost 360° (if the arc that contains v2 is very small). But note: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so if the arc that contains v2 is 1 edge, then the intercepted arc is n-1 edges. \n\n   In the square, n=4, then k can be 1,2,3. Then the angles are 45°, 90°, 135°.\n\n   But wait, in the square, can we form 135°? \n        Example: v2=0, and we choose v1 and v3 such that the intercepted arc (not containing v2) is 3 edges (which is 3*90=270°). Then the angle is 135°.\n\n        How? The intercepted arc is 270°, then the angle is 135°. \n\n        How to form that? \n           We fix v2=0, then we choose two points: \n                The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (not containing 0) is 3 edges. That means the two points are adjacent to 0 in the opposite arc. \n\n           Let v1 be 1 (adjacent clockwise) and v3 be 2 (adjacent counterclockwise). Then the intercepted arc from 1 to 2 (not containing 0) is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 to 3 to 2, which is 3 edges (central angle 270°). Then the angle at 0 is 135°.\n\n        But wait, in the square, the angle at 0 for the points 1 and 2 (which are adjacent) is 45° (as we computed earlier). \n\n        Why the discrepancy? \n\n        Let me reexamine: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the vertex. In the case of v1=1 and v3=2 (fixed v2=0), the intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 2 that does not contain 0. \n\n        The two arcs from 1 to 2:\n            Arc1 (clockwise): from 1 to 2: [1,2] -> central angle 90° (1 edge) -> this arc does not contain 0? \n            Actually, the arc from 1 to 2 clockwise: the vertices are 1 and 2, and 0 is not in between. So the intercepted arc is the minor arc (90°). Then the angle is 45°.\n\n        But wait, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the vertex. The vertex is 0, so the intercepted arc should be the one that is not adjacent to 0. \n\n        How do we determine the intercepted arc? \n\n        The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the vertex. The two points v1 and v3 and the vertex v2 divide the circle into two arcs: the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2 (the intercepted one) and the one that goes from v1 to v3 passing through v2 (the one that contains v2). \n\n        In the example of v1=1 and v3=2 (v2=0), the two arcs:\n            Arc1: from 1 to 2 passing through 0: 1->0->2? But 0 is the vertex, so the arc from 1 to 2 passing through 0 is the arc that goes from 1 to 0 to 2. But note: the arc from 1 to 2 passing through 0 must go from 1 to 0 and then 0 to 2. However, the edges are between consecutive vertices. The arc from 1 to 0 is an edge (1->0) and then 0->2 is an edge? Actually, from 0 to 2: in the square, the edges are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-0. So from 0 to 2, you cannot go directly. \n\n        Actually, the arc from 1 to 2 passing through 0 must go from 1 to 0 and then 0 to 2, but that would be going backwards from 0 to 2? \n\n        Let me reframe: the circle is divided by the three points (0,1,2). The two arcs from 1 to 2 are:\n            Arc A: the minor arc (clockwise) from 1 to 2: which has central angle 90°, and does not contain 0 (because 0 is not between 1 and 2 in the clockwise direction? Actually, from 1 to 2 clockwise: the vertices are 1, then 2. The vertex 0 is not in between. \n            Arc B: the major arc from 1 to 2: which goes from 1 to 0 to 3 to 2. This arc contains 0.\n\n        Therefore, the intercepted arc (the one not containing 0) is the minor arc (Arc A). \n\n        Then the angle is 45°.\n\n        Now, how to form 135°? \n           We need an intercepted arc with central angle 270° (then the angle is 135°). \n\n           Example: v2=0, v1=1, and v3=3. Then the two arcs from 1 to 3:\n                Arc A (minor): from 1 to 3 clockwise: 1->2->3 -> 2 edges, central angle 180°.\n                Arc B (major): from 1 to 3 counterclockwise: 1->0->3 -> 2 edges, central angle 180°.\n\n           But wait, the two arcs are equal. Then which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons to efficiently compute the closest possible angle without checking all possible triplets, which would be computationally expensive for large n.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the angle formed at any vertex v2 by two other vertices v1 and v3 in a regular convex n-gon can be derived from the central angles of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, the angle at v2 is half the central angle of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. This relationship allows us to compute potential angles based on the number of edges between v1 and v3.\n\n2. **Insight**: The angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges in the intercepted arc (the arc from v1 to v3 not containing v2). The central angle for this arc is `(k * 360 / n)` degrees, where `k` is the number of edges in the arc. The angle at v2 is then `(k * 180 / n)` degrees. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of checking all possible triplets, we recognize that the closest angle to `a` must correspond to some integer `k` (number of edges in the intercepted arc) between 1 and `n-1`. We compute the absolute difference between each candidate angle `(k * 180 / n)` and `a`, then select the triplet that minimizes this difference. \n\n4. **Optimization**: For each possible `k`, we determine the corresponding vertices v1, v2, and v3. The vertices are chosen such that the intercepted arc between v1 and v3 has exactly `k` edges, and v2 is positioned to ensure the arc does not include it. The solution efficiently checks all feasible `k` values around the optimal one to find the minimal difference.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    best_angle_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    total = 360.0\n    step_angle = total / n\n    \n    k_min = max(1, int(round(a * n / 180)) - 1)\n    k_max = min(n - 1, int(round(a * n / 180)) + 1)\n    best_k = None\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    \n    for k in range(1, n):\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0 / n)\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n            \n    k_center = int(round(a * n / 180))\n    k_candidates = set()\n    for k in range(max(1, k_center - 5), min(n, k_center + 6)):\n        if k < n and k > 0:\n            k_candidates.add(k)\n            \n    if not k_candidates:\n        k_candidates = range(1, n + 1)\n        \n    for k in k_candidates:\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0 / n)\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = (k, n, 1)\n            \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        k = 1\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0 / n)\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = (k, n, 1)\n            \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        k = n // 2\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0 / n)\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = (k, n, 1)\n            \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        best_vertices = (1, n, 1)\n        \n    k_val, n_val, start_val = best_vertices\n    v2_index = 0\n    v1_index = (start_val + k_val - 1) % n\n    v3_index = (start_val - k_val) % n\n    \n    v1 = v1_index + 1\n    v2 = v2_index + 1\n    v3 = v3_index + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle in degrees).\n2. **Finding Optimal Angle**: The algorithm calculates potential angles by considering each possible number of edges `k` in the intercepted arc.
