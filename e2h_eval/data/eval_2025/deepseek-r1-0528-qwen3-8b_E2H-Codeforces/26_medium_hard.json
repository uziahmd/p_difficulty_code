    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x,y,z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, note that we have fixed ordering: \n   x <= y <= z.\n\nIn a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the only condition we need to check is: x + y > z.\n\nBut note: our sides are constrained by ranges: x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D]. \n\nWe can rewrite the condition: x+y>z.\n\nHowever, iterating over all possibilities (which would be (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)) is too slow because the ranges can be up to 500000.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can fix the side z (from C to D) and then for each z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, and x+y > z.\n\nBut note: since x<=y<=z, the condition x+y>z is the critical one.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix y and z and then count x, but note the constraints on x (only between A and B). Or fix x and y? But note the ranges.\n\nAnother idea: Instead of iterating over z, we can consider the entire set of (x,y) and then for each (x,y) count the z in [max(C, ceil((x+y)/ something)), D] but wait, the condition is x+y>z, so z < x+y.\n\nBut note: we also have z>=C and z<=D.\n\nSo for a fixed (x,y), the condition on z is: z in [C, min(D, x+y-1)] (since z must be at least C and at most D, and strictly less than x+y).\n\nBut then we would need to iterate over x and y, which is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be about (500000)^2 worst-case, which is 250e9, too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient way.\n\nLet's try to fix the largest side z (from C to D). Then we need to count the pairs (x,y) in [A,B]×[B,C] such that x+y > z.\n\nBut note: we have the additional constraint that x<=y<=z, but actually x,y are independent in their ranges (x from A to B, y from B to C). However, note that the triangle condition requires x+y>z, and we are fixing z.\n\nBut wait, we don't require that x<=y<=z? Actually the problem says: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So x<=y<=z is enforced by the ranges. So we are good.\n\nNow, for fixed z, we need to count the number of (x,y) with:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, and x+y > z.\n\nWe can break down:\n\nFor fixed z, the condition is x+y > z.\n\nWe can fix y (from B to C) and then for each y, x must be in [max(A, z-y+1), B] (because x > z-y, so x >= floor(z-y)+1, but note: x must be at least A and at most B).\n\nBut then we would iterate for each z from C to D, and for each y from B to C, and then for each x from max(A, z-y+1) to B. That is O(D-C+1)*(C-B+1) per z, which is too heavy.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the pairs (x,y) and then use two-dimensional prefix sums? But note the ranges: x from [A,B] and y from [B,C]. The total number of pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be 250e9, so we cannot even store all pairs.\n\nWe need to use mathematical formulas.\n\nLet F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) such that A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>z.\n\nThen the answer is sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z).\n\nHow to compute F(z) without iterating over all y?\n\nWe can change the condition: x+y>z  <=> x > z-y.\n\nBut note: x is bounded by [A, B]. For a fixed y, x must be at least max(A, floor(z-y)+1) and at most B.\n\nBut we can also think: the condition x+y>z is equivalent to y>z-x. However, we are fixing y and then x, or we can fix x and then y? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the following:\n\nTotal pairs (without the triangle condition) is T = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1).\n\nThen, the condition x+y<=z is the complement. So F(z) = T - (# of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z).\n\nBut then we have to count the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\nNow, how to count the pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y<=z?\n\nWe can fix x from A to B, and then y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)] (but note: if z-x < B, then no y satisfies). But then we are iterating over x.\n\nWe can do:\n\nFor fixed x, y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)].\n\nBut note: we also require y>=B and y<=min(C, z-x). So if z-x < B, then there are 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can use two pointers or binary search.\n\nBut note: we have to do this for each z from C to D. And the total work might be too much.\n\nAnother idea: Precompute an array for all possible s = x+y, then use cumulative sums.\n\nBut note: x from [A,B] and y from [B,C]. The minimum sum is A+B and maximum is B+C.\n\nWe can create an array S where S[k] = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = k.\n\nThen the condition x+y<=z is the sum_{k=A+B}^{z} S[k] (if z>=A+B, otherwise 0).\n\nBut note: k must be at least A+B and at most B+C.\n\nThen F(z) = T - (sum_{k=A+B}^{min(B+C, z)} S[k])\n\nBut how to compute S[k]? \n\nWe can iterate over x from A to B, and for each x, y from B to min(C, k-x). But k goes from A+B to B+C.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\nFor a fixed x, y can range from B to min(C, k-x). But then we can use two nested loops, but that is O(n) per k? \n\nActually, we can use:\n\nS[k] = number of x in [A, B] such that k-x is in [B, min(C, k-x)]? \n\nWait, we can reframe: for a fixed k, x must be in [max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)] and also k-x must be between B and C.\n\nBut note: k-x>=B => x<=k-B\n        k-x<=C => x>=k-C\n\nSo x must be in [max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)] and also we must have k-x<=C and k-x>=B, but these are already captured.\n\nBut note: the condition on y is that y=k-x must be between B and C. So we require:\n   B <= k-x <= C  => k-C <= x <= k-B.\n\nAlso, x must be between A and B.\n\nTherefore, x must be in [max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)] and the length of x for which k-x is in [B, C] is: \n\n   L = max(0, min(B, k-B) - max(A, k-C) + 1)\n\nBut wait, we must ensure that the interval [max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)] is non-empty.\n\nThen, S[k] = max(0, min(B, k-B) - max(A, k-C) + 1)   if the interval is valid, else 0.\n\nBut note: k must be at least A+B and at most B+C, and we can define an array for k from A+B to B+C.\n\nThe length of k is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = C - A + 1, which can be up to 500000, so we can iterate k from A+B to B+C.\n\nBut then we have to do:\n\nSteps:\n1. Precompute an array S for k from A+B to B+C (inclusive) as described.\n2. Then, build a prefix sum array P for S, so that P[i] = S[A+B] + S[A+B+1] + ... + S[i].\n3. Then for each z from C to D:\n      Let M = min(B+C, z)\n      Then the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is the sum of S[k] for k from A+B to M.\n      But note: if z < A+B, then there are 0, but our z starts from C and C>=B>=A, so z>=A+B? Not necessarily: if A=1, B=2, C=3, then A+B=3, and z starts from 3, so okay. But if A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, then z from 3 to 4, and A+B=3. But what if A=2, B=3, C=4, then A+B=5, and z starts from 4 -> then for z=4, we would take k from 5 to 4? Then we must be cautious.\n\nActually, note: the smallest value for x+y is A+B, and the largest is B+C. Also, z is from C to D. But note: we require x+y>z, so for a fixed z, we consider x+y from z+1 to B+C.\n\nBut when computing the complement (pairs with x+y<=z), we consider x+y from A+B to min(B+C, z). If z < A+B, then there are no pairs (so 0). But our z starts from C and we know that C>=B>=A, so the smallest x+y is A+B. Since A<=B, then A+B <= B+B <= B+C, and also A+B <= A+C <= B+C. But is A+B <= C? Not necessarily: if A=1, B=1, C=1, then A+B=2, and z starts at 1, so we have to be careful.\n\nWait, the input condition: A<=B<=C<=D. So A+B <= B+B <= C+C, but we have no direct relation between A+B and C. However, note that we have the constraint: x>=A, y>=B, so x+y>=A+B. But also, the condition for a triangle requires x+y>z and z>=C. So if A+B <= C, then for z>=C, the condition x+y>z might not be satisfied by many pairs.\n\nBut note: the problem does not guarantee that A+B > C. In fact, in the example \"1 2 2 5\": A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5. Then A+B=3, which is greater than C=2, but then we have to count pairs (x,y) with x+y>z (z from 2 to 5). However, note that y is at least B=2, so the smallest x+y is 1+2=3.\n\nActually, the condition in the problem: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So y>=B, and x>=A, so x+y>=A+B. And z>=C. But note: the triangle condition requires x+y>z. So if A+B<=C, then for z=C, we require x+y>C, so even the minimal x+y (A+B) might be <=C, so we need to avoid counting the cases where x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: the example \"1 2 2 5\": \n   x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (because C=2, so y<=2 and y>=2) and z in [2,5]. \n   The pairs (x,y) are: (1,2) and (2,2). \n   For (1,2): x+y=3, so z must be <3, i.e., z=2 -> but then we have a triangle (1,2,2) which satisfies 1+2>2, 1+2>2, 2+2>1. \n   For (2,2): x+y=4, so z must be <4, i.e., z=2,3 -> triangles (2,2,2) and (2,2,3).\n\nSo the condition x+y>z must hold, and the minimal x+y is 3, which is greater than C=2, so we are safe.\n\nBut note: the minimal x+y is A+B, and we require for a triangle that x+y>z, and z>=C. So if A+B <= C, then we cannot form a triangle for the minimal pair? Actually, if A+B <= C, then the minimal x+y is <=C, and since z>=C, we have x+y (minimal) <= z, so the condition fails for the minimal pair? \n\nWait, in the example above: A+B=3 and C=2, so 3>2, so it's okay. But what if A+B <= C? Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4. Then minimal x+y=3, and z>=3. Then for z=3, we require x+y>3. The minimal x+y is 3, so we must have x+y>=4. \n\nBut note: the minimal x+y is 3, so for z=3, we need x+y>3, i.e., x+y>=4.\n\nSo the condition is: for a fixed z, the pairs (x,y) must satisfy x+y>z. The minimal x+y is A+B, so if A+B<=z, then some pairs (the ones with x+y<=z) are excluded.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the minimal x+y is greater than the minimal z. It just requires that the triangle condition holds.\n\nSo, our method:\n\nStep 1: Precompute S[k] for k from A+B to B+C (if k is outside, then 0). But note: k must be at least A+B and at most B+C.\n\nBut note: we might have k values that are not in [A+B, B+C] but we are going to sum from A+B to min(B+C, z). So we only care about k from A+B to B+C.\n\nHowever, note: if z is very large, say D, then we consider k from A+B to B+C.\n\nStep 2: Precompute prefix sum P for the array S from index=A+B to index=B+C.\n\nBut note: we have to map k to an index. We can let:\n\n   Let L = A+B, R = B+C.\n\n   Then for k in [L, R]: S[k] = max(0, min(B, k-B) - max(A, k-C) + 1)   [if the interval is non-empty]\n\nBut wait, let me verify with example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nThen L=3, R=5.\n\nk=3: \n   x in [max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1, min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1] -> [1,1] -> 1 element.\n   So S[3]=1.\n\nk=4:\n   x in [max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1, min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2] -> [1,2] -> 2 elements.\n\nk=5:\n   x in [max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2, min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2] -> [2,2] -> 1 element.\n\nThen total pairs (x,y): 1+2+1=4. But in the example, the triangles were 4. However, note: the example input was \"1 2 3 4\", and the output is 4.\n\nBut wait, the example input \"1 2 3 4\" gives 4 triangles. So our S[k] counts the pairs (x,y) for each k=x+y.\n\nThen the total pairs (without condition) is 4. Now, for each z from C=3 to D=4:\n\nFor z=3: we want pairs (x,y) such that x+y>3, i.e., k>=4. So we take k=4 and k=5: 2+1=3.\nBut wait, the example output is 4, meaning we have 4 triangles. \n\nWait, the example says: \n   (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4)\n\nBut note: the sides are (x,y,z). In our representation, x is from [1,2], y from [2,3], z from [3,4].\n\nSo the triangles are:\n\n   (1,3,3): x=1, y=3, z=3 -> x+y=4>3 -> valid.\n   (2,2,3): x=2, y=2, z=3 -> 2+2=4>3 -> valid.\n   (2,3,3): x=2, y=3, z=3 -> 2+3=5>3 -> valid.\n   (2,3,4): x=2, y=3, z=4 -> 2+3=5>4 -> valid.\n\nSo 4 triangles.\n\nBut according to our method:\n\nWe are counting the pairs (x,y) for each z. \n\nFor z=3: we require x+y>3, so pairs (x,y) with x+y>=4. \n   (x,y) pairs: \n        (1,3): 1+3=4 -> valid for z=3 (and also for z=4? no, because for z=4 we require x+y>4, so 4 is not allowed for z=4).\n        (2,2): 2+2=4 -> valid for z=3 (and for z=4? no, because 4 is not >4).\n        (2,3): 2+3=5 -> valid for both z=3 and z=4.\n\nSo for z=3: we have three pairs: (1,3), (2,2), (2,3) -> but wait, (2,2) has x+y=4, which is >3, so yes. So three for z=3.\n\nFor z=4: we require x+y>4. Only (2,3) has 5>4, so one for z=4.\n\nTotal: 3+1=4.\n\nBut wait, in our S array we have:\n   k=3: 1 pair -> (1,2) -> but wait, in the example, y is from [B, C] i.e., [2,3]. So (1,2) is also a pair? Then we have:\n\n   The pairs (x,y) are:\n        x=1: y=2 -> (1,2) -> k=3\n               y=3 -> (1,3) -> k=4\n        x=2: y=2 -> (2,2) -> k=4\n               y=3 -> (2,3) -> k=5\n\nSo the pairs are: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). \n\nSo the S array should be:\n   S[3] = 1 (from (1,2))\n   S[4] = 2 (from (1,3) and (2,2))\n   S[5] = 1 (from (2,3))\n\nThen for z=3: we need to subtract the pairs with x+y<=3, i.e., k=3 -> 1 pair. Then F(3)=4-1=3? But wait, total pairs is 4, and we subtract the pairs with x+y<=3, which is 1, so 3. Then for z=4: subtract pairs with x+y<=4, which is S[3]+S[4]=1+2=3, so F(4)=4-3=1. Then total triangles=3+1=4.\n\nBut note: the condition for a triangle is x+y>z, so for a fixed z, we count the pairs (x,y) that are in the set { (x,y) | x+y>z }.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute:\n\n   For a fixed z, the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is the sum_{k=A+B}^{min(B+C, z)} S[k].\n\nThen F(z) = (total pairs) - (number of pairs with x+y<=z)\n\nBut note: the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) = 2*2=4.\n\nBut wait, we computed S[k] for k from 3 to 5, and the total pairs is 4, so that matches.\n\nBut note: the above formula for S[k] is:\n\n   S[k] = max(0, min(B, k-B) - max(A, k-C) + 1)   [if the interval is non-empty, else 0]\n\nBut wait, for k=3: \n   min(B, k-B) = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n   max(A, k-C)=max(1,3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n   Then 1-1+1 = 1.\n\nFor k=4:\n   min(B, k-B)=min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n   max(A, k-C)=max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n   Then 2-1+1=2.\n\nFor k=5:\n   min(B,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n   max(A,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n   Then 2-2+1=1.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nBut note: the formula can be negative? We take max(0, ...). Also, we must ensure that min(B, k-B) >= max(A, k-C). Otherwise, we get 0.\n\nBut note: k-B = k - B, and k-C = k - C. Since B<=C, k-B>=k-C.\n\nAnd we require x in [max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)]. But note: k-C <= k-B, so the lower bound is k-C and the upper bound is k-B, but then we also clamp by [A,B]. \n\nBut note: k-C might be greater than B? Then the interval is empty. Similarly, k-B might be less than A? Then empty.\n\nBut note: k is at least A+B, so k-C >= A+B-C. Since A<=B<=C, then A+B-C could be negative, but then max(A, k-C) becomes A? Actually, we are using max(A, k-C) so if k-C < A, then we use A.\n\nSimilarly, k-B might be less than A? Then the interval is empty.\n\nBut note: k>=A+B, so k-B>=A. Therefore, min(B, k-B) is at least A? Not necessarily: if k-B < A, then we use k-B, but k-B>=A (since k>=A+B => k-B>=A) so min(B, k-B) is at least A.\n\nWait, k>=A+B => k-B>=A, so min(B, k-B) is at least A (because k-B>=A and B>=A, but A<=B, so k-B>=A and then min(B, k-B) is at least A). \n\nBut wait, k-B>=A, so the lower bound is max(A, k-C) and the upper bound is min(B, k-B). \n\nBut note: k-C = k - C, and since k>=A+B, and C>=B, then k-C>=A+B-C. But A+B-C might be negative, so we use max(A, k-C). \n\nBut note: k-C might be less than A? Then we use A. Then the interval [A, min(B, k-B)] is valid because k-B>=A, so the lower bound is A and the upper bound is at least A (because k-B>=A). \n\nBut if k-C is greater than B, then the interval [max(A,k-C), min(B, k-B)] becomes [k-C, min(B, k-B)] and since k-C>B and k-B<=B (because k-B<=B? Not necessarily: k-B can be greater than B? Actually, k can be up to B+C, so k-B can be up to C, and C>=B, so k-B can be greater than B.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the formula for S[k] is:\n\n   low = max(A, k-C)\n   high = min(B, k-B)\n\nThen the number of x is max(0, high - low + 1) if high>=low, else 0.\n\nBut note: the condition for x is that x must be in [low, high] and also y=k-x must be in [B, C]. But we derived the bounds from the condition on y: y=k-x must be in [B, C] -> x in [k-C, k-B]. Then we intersect with [A, B] to get [max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)].\n\nBut note: the condition on y is that y=k-x must be in [B, C] (which is enforced by the x bounds). \n\nBut wait, if we fix x, then y=k-x must be at least B and at most C, which is exactly what we did.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D.\n2. Let L = A+B, R = B+C.\n3. Create an array S of zeros for indices from L to R (or use a dictionary or just a list of length (R-L+1)).\n4. For k from L to R:\n        low_x = max(A, k-C)\n        high_x = min(B, k-B)\n        if high_x >= low_x:\n            S[k] = high_x - low_x + 1\n        else:\n            S[k] = 0\n\n5. Build a prefix sum array P for S, so that P[i] = S[L] + S[L+1] + ... + S[i] (for i from L to R). But note: we need to be able to query the sum from L to M (where M is from L to R). We can use a list and then cumulative sum.\n\nBut note: the indices k are consecutive from L to R.\n\n6. Then, for each z from C to D (inclusive):\n\n        Let M = min(R, z)   # Because we only have S[k] for k from L to R, and k<=z (we consider k<=z) but note: we defined S for k from L to R, and if z < L, then we use 0. But note: z>=C and C>=B>=A, and L=A+B. Since A<=B<=C, then A+B <= B+B <= C+C, but we don't know if A+B <= C. However, if z < L, then we skip.\n\n        Actually, if z < L, then there are no pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z (because the minimal x+y is L). So the number of pairs with x+y<=z is 0.\n\n        But note: our S array is defined only for k from L to R. So we can write:\n\n        total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)   # This is the total number of pairs (x,y) without condition.\n\n        But wait, we can also compute the total_pairs from the S array: total_pairs = sum(S[L:R+1])? Actually, we built S for k from L to R, so yes.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        Let F(z) = total_pairs - (number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z)\n\n        How to compute the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z?\n\n        If z < L: then 0.\n        Else if z >= R: then total_pairs.\n        Else: sum_{k=L}^{min(R, z)} S[k] = P[min(R, z)] - P[L-1] (if we built P from L to R, then we need to handle the prefix).\n\n        But note: we built S from L to R. Let's define:\n\n        Let base = L\n        Then we can create an array P of length (R-L+1) such that:\n            P[i] = S[base] + S[base+1] + ... + S[base+i]   (if we index by offset)\n\n        Actually, let index = k - L, then k = index+L.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let P[k] = S[k] + P[k-1] for k from L to R, but then we need to initialize P[L]=S[L].\n\n        But we can do:\n\n        Let arr = [0]*(R+2)   # We'll index from 0 to R, but we are only interested from L to R.\n\n        But note: R can be up to 10^6? Actually, A,B,C,D up to 500000, so R = B+C <= 1000000.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let n = R - L + 1\n        S_arr = [0]*(n+1)   # 0-indexed, index 0 corresponds to L, index n-1 corresponds to R.\n\n        But maybe we can do:\n\n        Let S_arr = [0]*(R+1)   # from 0 to R, but we only care from L to R.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let S_arr = [0]*(R+2)   # indices 0..R+1\n\n        Then for k from L to R:\n            idx = k   # we store S[k] at index k\n            S_arr[k] = ... \n\n        Then build prefix P for indices from 0 to R: \n            P[i] = S_arr[0]+...+S_arr[i]\n\n        But then for a given z, the sum from k=L to min(R, z) is P[min(R, z)] - P[L-1] (if L>0) but if L==0, then we start from 0.\n\n        However, note: L=A+B, which can be as small as 1+1=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        Let F(z) = total_pairs - (prefix_sum at min(R, z) from L to min(R,z))\n\n        But note: we have built S_arr for indices from 0 to R, but we only computed S_arr[k] for k in [L,R]. For k<L or k>R, we set S_arr[k]=0.\n\n        Then the prefix sum from 0 to i is the cumulative sum of S_arr from 0 to i.\n\n        Then the sum from L to min(R,z) is: \n            If z < L: 0\n            Else: P[min(R,z)] - P[L-1]\n\n        But note: we defined S_arr for indices below L as 0, so P[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i} S_arr[k] = sum_{k=L}^{min(i,R)} S_arr[k] (if i>=L) plus zeros for k< L.\n\n        Then the sum for k from L to min(R,z) is P[min(R,z)] - P[L-1] (if we define P[-1]=0 for L-1).\n\n        However, we can avoid building the entire array from 0 to R (which is 500000*2=1000000) by only building from L to R.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n        total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)\n\n        Precompute an array S for k from L to R (inclusive) as above.\n\n        Then, let M = min(R, z)   # the maximum k we consider for the condition x+y<=z is min(R, z)\n\n        Then, if z < L:\n            num_pairs_le_z = 0\n        elif z >= R:\n            num_pairs_le_z = total_pairs\n        else:\n            # We need to compute the sum of S[k] for k from L to z (if z is within [L, R])\n            # But note: we have built S for k from L to R, but we haven't built an array for the entire range [0, R] necessarily.\n\n        We can build a prefix array for the range [L, R]:\n\n        Let Q = [0]*(n+1)   # n = R-L+1\n        Q[0] = S[L]\n        for i from 1 to n-1:\n            Q[i] = Q[i-1] + S[L+i]\n\n        Then the sum for k from L to z (if z is between L and R) is:\n\n            if z < L: 0\n            elif z >= R: total_pairs\n            else: \n                # Find the index i such that L+i = z -> i = z - L\n                idx = z - L\n                # Then the sum from L to z is the first idx+1 elements of Q (from 0 to idx)\n                num_pairs_le_z = Q[idx]   # because Q[i] is the prefix sum from L to L+i (inclusive)\n\n        But note: our Q is built for indices from 0 to n-1, and the i-th element is the sum from L to L+i.\n\n        Then F(z) = total_pairs - num_pairs_le_z\n\n        Then the answer is the sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z)\n\n        But wait, no: for each z, F(z) is the number of pairs (x,y) that form a triangle with that z. Then the total triangles is the sum over z from C to D of F(z).\n\n        However, note: the same pair (x,y) can be used for multiple z? No, because for a fixed (x,y), z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)] (and also >=C and <=D). \n\n        But we are counting for each z independently: for z, we count the (x,y) such that x+y>z. \n\n        And that is correct.\n\n        However, note: the same triangle (x,y,z) is uniquely determined by (x,y,z). So we are counting each triangle once.\n\n        But the problem: the input \"1 2 3 4\" gives 4, and we are getting:\n\n            For z=3: F(3)=4 - (number of pairs with x+y<=3) = 4 - 1 = 3.\n            For z=4: F(4)=4 - (number of pairs with x+y<=4) = 4 - (1+2)=1.\n\n            Then total triangles = 3+1=4.\n\n        So that matches.\n\n        But wait, the above computation for the example:\n\n            total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) = (2-1+1)*(3-2+1)=2*2=4.\n\n            For z=3: \n                num_pairs_le_3 = S[3] = 1 -> 4-1=3.\n            For z=4:\n                num_pairs_le_4 = S[3]+S[4] = 1+2=3 -> 4-3=1.\n\n        Then the answer is 3+1=4.\n\n        But note: the above method for building Q: \n            n = R-L+1 = 5-3+1=3.\n            Q[0] = S[3] = 1\n            Q[1] = S[3]+S[4] = 1+2=3\n            Q[2] = S[3]+S[4]+S[5]=1+2+1=4.\n\n        Then for z=3: index = 3-3=0 -> Q[0]=1 -> correct.\n        for z=4: index=4-3=1 -> Q[1]=3 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, so for z=3 we require x+y>=4. So we subtract the pairs with x+y<=3 (which is 1).",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle must satisfy the non-degenerate condition, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use a mathematical approach to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition to check is \\(x + y > z\\). This is derived from the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we need to count all valid triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) is in \\([A, B]\\), \\(y\\) is in \\([B, C]\\), and \\(z\\) is in \\([C, D]\\), and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For each possible \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\), we count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) in \\([A, B] \\times [B, C]\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This can be rephrased as counting the total pairs minus the pairs where \\(x + y \\leq z\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: \n   - **Precompute Sums**: For each possible sum \\(k = x + y\\) (where \\(k\\) ranges from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\)), precompute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that sum to \\(k\\).\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Build a prefix sum array from the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the number of pairs with sums up to a given value.\n   - **Iterate Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), use the prefix sum array to determine the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\), then subtract this from the total pairs to get the count of valid triangles for that \\(z\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n_x = B - A + 1\n    n_y = C - B + 1\n    total_pairs = n_x * n_y\n    \n    L = A + B\n    R = B + C\n    \n    if R < L:\n        S_arr = []\n    else:\n        S_arr = [0] * (R + 1)\n        for k in range(L, R + 1):\n            low_x = max(A, k - C)\n            high_x = min(B, k - B)\n            if high_x >= low_x:\n                S_arr[k] = high_x - low_x + 1\n    \n    if R < L:\n        P_arr = []\n    else:\n        P_arr = [0] * (R + 1)\n        if L <= R:\n            P_arr[L] = S_arr[L]\n            for k in range(L + 1, R + 1):\n                P_arr[k] = P_arr[k - 1] + S_arr[k]\n        else:\n            P_arr = []\n    \n    ans = 0\n    for z_val in range(C, D + 1):\n        if z_val < L:\n            num_le_z = 0\n        elif z_val >= R:\n            num_le_z = total_pairs\n        else:\n            num_le_z = P_arr[z_val]\n        ans += (total_pairs - num_le_z)\n    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Total Pairs Calculation**: Compute the total number of possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) without any triangle condition.\n3. **Sum Range Calculation**: Determine the minimum and maximum possible sums \\(L\\) (i.e., \\(A + B\\)) and \\(R\\) (i.e., \\(B + C\\)) for the pairs \\((x, y)\\).\n4. **S_arr Construction**: For each sum \\(k\\) from \\(L\\) to \\(R\\), count the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that sum to \\(k\\).\n5. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array \\(P_arr\\) from \\(S_arr\\) to quickly compute the number of pairs with sums up to any given \\(z\\).\n6. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), use \\(P_arr\\) to find the number of invalid pairs (where \\(x + y \\leq z\\)) and subtract this from the total pairs to get the count of valid triangles for that \\(z\\).
