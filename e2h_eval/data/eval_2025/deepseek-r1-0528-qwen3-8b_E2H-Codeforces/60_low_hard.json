Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given m (number of modifications) and then m lines each containing either '0' or '1'\n\n We are building a string S one character at a time. After each modification, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code.\n\n Important: The valid Morse code strings for English letters (using 0 for dot and 1 for dash) are all binary strings of length 1 to 4 except the four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\n Observation:\n We are counting distinct sequences of letters. However, note that the same Morse string might appear multiple times, but if two different substrings yield the same letter, then they would be considered as the same letter? Actually, no: the problem is about sequences of letters. But note: the example counts:\n\n For S = \"111\": \n   T (\"1\") -> one letter sequence \"T\"\n   M (\"11\") -> one letter sequence \"M\"\n   O (\"111\") -> one letter sequence \"O\"\n   Then sequences of two letters: \"TT\" (which is \"11\"), \"TM\" (which is \"111\") and \"MT\" (which is \"111\") and \"TT\" again? Actually, note: \n        \"TT\" is from substring \"11\" (the first two) and also the last two? But wait, the example says:\n        \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n However, note: the example says:\n        \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n But note: the example counts \"TT\" as one occurrence even if the substring \"11\" appears twice? Actually, the problem says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\n\n So we are counting distinct sequences (each sequence is a string of one or more letters) that can be obtained by taking any contiguous substring of S and interpreting that substring (by splitting it into Morse code tokens) as a sequence of letters.\n\n However, note: the Morse code tokens must be contiguous and of length 1 to 4. Also, the entire substring must be split into tokens (each token being 1 to 4 bits) such that the tokens are valid.\n\n But wait: the example does not break the substring arbitrarily. The problem states: \"represented with some substring\". This means that we are looking for contiguous substrings of S that can be split (from left to right) into tokens, each of which is a valid Morse code representation.\n\n However, note: the example does not break the substring \"111\" (which is three ones) into two tokens because that would require a token of length 1 and then a token of length 2, but then the remaining one? Actually, the example counts:\n\n   \"1\" -> T\n   \"11\" -> M\n   \"111\" -> O\n\n And then sequences of two letters: \n   \"TT\": two T's, so we need two tokens: the first token is the first '1', the second token is the second '1'. But wait, the substring \"11\" is used for M, so how do we get two T's? \n\n Actually, the problem does not require that the entire substring is broken into tokens without gaps. It says: \"some substring\" and the substring is taken as a contiguous part of S. Then, we interpret that substring as a sequence of Morse code tokens. But note: the tokens must be contiguous and of length 1 to 4, and the entire substring must be partitioned into tokens (without leftover). \n\n However, the example counts the substring \"11\" as both \"M\" (one letter) and \"TT\" (two letters). So the same substring can be interpreted in two ways? But wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". That means we are counting every distinct sequence (i.e., every distinct string of letters) that appears as a contiguous substring of S, when we break that substring into tokens (each token is a valid Morse code of length 1-4) and then map each token to a letter.\n\n But note: the example does not say that the same substring can be broken in multiple ways. Actually, the problem is ambiguous. However, looking at the example output:\n\n Input: \"111\" (m=3) gives 7.\n\n Let me list the sequences (as sequences of letters):\n\n 1-letter: \n   \"T\" (from \"1\")\n   \"T\" (from \"1\") [but wait, the substring \"1\" appears three times? Actually, we have three single-letter substrings: [0:1]=\"1\", [1:2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by interpreting contiguous substrings of a dynamically built string S. The string S is built by appending either '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) one character at a time. After each modification to S, we need to compute the answer modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that any valid Morse code substring must be split into tokens of lengths 1 to 4, where each token is a valid English letter representation. The invalid tokens are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". The challenge is to efficiently track all valid token sequences as S grows incrementally.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending exactly at position `i` in S. This helps in efficiently counting sequences without recomputing from scratch each time.\n\n3. **Token Validation**: For each new character appended to S, we check all possible token lengths (1 to 4) ending at the current position. A token is valid if it does not match any of the four invalid strings.\n\n4. **Sequence Counting**: For each valid token ending at the current position, we add the count of sequences ending before the start of this token. This leverages the DP array to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n5. **Modulo Handling**: Since the results can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    ans = []\n    total_sequences = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        char = s_list[i - 1]\n        new_sequences_here = 0\n        for length in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = i - length\n            if start_index < 0:\n                break\n            token = ''.join(s_list[j] for j in range(start_index, i))\n            if len(token) != length:\n                continue\n            if token in [\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"]:\n                continue\n            prev = start_index - 1\n            if prev >= 0:\n                new_sequences_here = (new_sequences_here + dp[prev]) % MOD\n            else:\n                new_sequences_here = (new_sequences_here + 1) % MOD\n        \n        dp[i] = new_sequences_here\n        total_sequences = (total_sequences + new_sequences_here) % MOD\n        ans.append(str(total_sequences))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads input values and initializes necessary variables, including a DP array `dp` to store counts of valid sequences ending at each position.\n\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to S, the code checks all possible token lengths (1 to 4) ending at the current position. If the token is valid (not one of the four invalid strings), it updates the DP array and the total count of sequences.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: The DP array is updated based on valid tokens found. For each valid token, the count of sequences ending before the token is added to the current position's DP value.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences up to that point is incremented by the count of new sequences ending at the current position. This total is stored in the answer list.\n\n5. **Output**: The results after each modification are printed line by line.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences using dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 3000 modifications.",
