    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized.\n\n Let d = a - b. Without loss of generality, assume a <= b, then we can set d = b - a (if negative, we swap). But note: the problem does not specify which is larger.\n\n Alternatively, let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then note:\n   (a+k) * (b+k) = LCM(a+k, b+k) * GCD(a+k, b+k)\n\n However, we can also note that the difference between (a+k) and (b+k) is fixed: |(a+k) - (b+k)| = |a-b|.\n\n Let d = |a-b|. Then, for any k, we have:\n   gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, d)\n\n Why? Because gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, y-x). So gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, b-a) [if b>=a] or gcd(b+k, a-b) if a>=b.\n\n Therefore, let d = abs(a-b). Then the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) is gcd(a+k, d). \n\n Then, the LCM is: \n   LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / gcd(a+k, d)\n\n But note: we are to minimize the LCM.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since d is fixed, the gcd(a+k, d) must be a divisor of d. Let g be a divisor of d. Then we can consider k such that g divides (a+k) and g divides d. Then k ≡ (-a) mod g, i.e., k = t*g - a (for some t) but we require k >= 0.\n\n However, note that k must also satisfy that the gcd(a+k, d) is exactly g (or at least a divisor of d). But actually, the gcd might be greater than g if there are common factors beyond g? Actually, we are using that the gcd is g, so we need to consider all divisors.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If a == b, then we have two same numbers. Then LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k. We want to minimize a+k, so k=0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, let d = abs(a-b). We need to consider all divisors g of d (positive divisors). Then we can set k_min[g] to be the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k) (and hence divides d). \n\n    Condition: (a+k) mod g == 0  => k ≡ (-a) mod g, so k_min[g] = (g - a % g) % g. But note: if a % g == 0, then k=0. However, note that k must be non-negative and we are looking for the minimal k that satisfies the condition for each divisor? Actually, we are going to consider multiple divisors, but note: the LCM expression depends on the gcd, which is a divisor of d. However, the minimal LCM might come from a divisor that is not necessarily the greatest?\n\n    But note: the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k, d). The gcd(a+k, d) is at most d, and the more factors we have in the gcd, the smaller the LCM might become because the denominator increases. However, the numerator (a+k)*(b+k) also changes with k.\n\n 3. Actually, we can iterate over the divisors of d. For each divisor g (positive) of d, we compute:\n\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0]\n\n    Then, we have candidate k = k0, and then we can compute:\n\n        n1 = a + k\n        n2 = b + k\n        g_val = gcd(n1, n2)   [But note: we know that gcd(n1, n2) must divide d, but it might be larger than g? Actually, no: because we set k so that g divides (a+k) and d, so g divides both (a+k) and (b+k) because d divides the difference and g divides d and a+k. But wait: the gcd might be a multiple of g? Actually, the gcd is at least g, but we don't know. However, note that we are iterating by divisors of d. But the gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, d) and since (a+k) is divisible by g and d is divisible by g, then gcd(a+k, d) is at least g. However, it could be larger. How do we know the exact gcd?\n\n    Alternatively, we can note: \n        Let g0 = gcd(a+k, d). Then g0 must be a divisor of d and also divides (a+k). But we set k so that g divides (a+k). However, the gcd(a+k, d) might be any divisor of d that divides (a+k). \n\n    But note: the gcd(a+k, d) is the greatest common divisor, so it is the greatest divisor of d that divides (a+k). So if we set k0 for a divisor g, then the gcd(a+k0, d) might be greater than g. \n\n    So we cannot simply use the divisor g to compute the gcd. Instead, we should consider that the gcd(a+k, d) is a divisor of d, and then k must be chosen so that the gcd is as large as possible? Actually, the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k,d). To minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the gcd (because the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k, but the gcd might help reduce the fraction). However, note that k increases the numbers, so the product increases, but the gcd might also increase.\n\n    Actually, we can try to consider that the optimal k will be one of the following:\n\n        k = 0\n        k = d/g - a % g   for each divisor g of d? \n\n    But note: we are iterating over divisors. However, the above k0 is the smallest k that makes g divide (a+k). Then, the gcd(a+k0, d) is at least g, but it could be a multiple of g (if (a+k0) has more factors of g). \n\n    Alternatively, we can consider that the problem is symmetric and known to have solutions among the divisors of d. However, note that the example: \n        Input: 6 10 -> d=4, divisors: 1,2,4.\n        k0 for g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1) % 1 -> 0 (since 6%1 is 0, so 0)\n        k0 for g=2: k0 = (2 - 6%2) % 2 -> (2-0)%2=0\n        k0 for g=4: k0 = (4 - 6%4) % 4 -> (4-2)%4=2\n\n        Then we compute for k=0 and k=2.\n\n        k=0: numbers are 6,10 -> gcd=2, LCM= (6*10)/2 = 30.\n        k=2: numbers are 8,12 -> gcd=4, LCM= (8*12)/4 = 24.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n    But why did k0 for g=2 give k=0? Then we also considered k0 for g=4 which gave k=2. And k0 for g=1 was 0.\n\n    However, note: the condition for g=2: we set k0=0, then (a+0)=6 is divisible by 2. Then the gcd(6,10)=2, which is indeed the divisor g=2. But then we also have the divisor g=4: which gives k=2, and then gcd(8,12)=4.\n\n    So the candidate k's are the ones for each divisor g of d: k0(g) = (g - a % g) % g.\n\n    But note: we must consider that k0(g) must be non-negative and minimal for that divisor.\n\n    However, there's a catch: the divisor g must divide d, and the candidate k0(g) is the smallest k such that g divides (a+k). Then, for each candidate k (from each divisor), we compute:\n\n        n1 = a+k\n        n2 = b+k\n        g_val = gcd(n1, n2)   [which is gcd(n1, d) because n2-n1=d]\n\n    Then, LCM = n1 * n2 // g_val\n\n    Then we choose the candidate k that minimizes the LCM, and if there are multiple, the smallest k.\n\n    But note: k0(g) might be very large if g is large? Actually, g is a divisor of d, and d = |a-b|, which can be up to 10^9, so the number of divisors is at most around 1344 (for highly composite numbers). So we can iterate over all divisors.\n\n    However, what about divisors that are not positive? We consider positive divisors.\n\n    Also, note: we must consider k=0? Actually, k0(g) for g=1 always gives 0 (if a%1==0, which it is). So we cover k=0.\n\n    But wait: what if d=0? Then a==b, which we handled separately.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        If a == b: print 0 and exit.\n\n        Let d = abs(a-b)\n        Find all divisors of d.\n\n        Initialize:\n            best_k = 0\n            best_lcm = LCM(a, b)   [which is abs(a*b)//gcd(a,b)]\n\n        For each divisor g in divisors (including 1 and d):\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This ensures k0 is non-negative and minimal for this divisor]\n\n            Now, we must check: is k0 the smallest k that satisfies (a+k) divisible by g? Yes.\n\n            Then, we compute the new numbers: n1 = a+k0, n2 = b+k0.\n\n            Then, g_val = gcd(n1, n2)   [but note: we know that gcd(n1, n2) must divide d, but we can compute it via Euclidean algorithm]\n\n            Then, lcm_val = n1 * n2 // g_val\n\n            But wait: we must consider that the gcd(n1, n2) might be greater than g. However, that is okay because we are computing the actual LCM.\n\n            Then, if lcm_val < best_lcm, update best_lcm and best_k = k0.\n            If lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k, then update best_k = k0.\n\n        Then, output best_k.\n\n    However, note: the LCM formula: LCM(n1, n2) = n1*n2 // gcd(n1,n2). But when n1 and n2 are very large (up to 10^9 + k0, and k0 is at most d, which is <=10^9) then n1*n2 can be up to 10^18, which is acceptable in Python for integers.\n\n    But wait: there's a problem. The divisor g must divide d, but the k0 we get is the smallest k such that g divides (a+k). However, note that the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. So we are going to consider the same k0 multiple times? \n\n    Example: for d=4, divisors: 1,2,4. For a=6, then:\n        g=1: k0=0\n        g=2: k0=0\n        g=4: k0=2\n\n    Then we consider k=0 twice. That's okay, because we are storing the best_lcm and best_k. But we can avoid duplicates by storing the candidate k's and then processing unique k's? Or just let it run, because the set of divisors is small (at most 1344) and duplicates are not too many.\n\n    However, we must be cautious: the same k0 might be produced by different divisors. Then we are doing redundant calculations.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider that the candidate k's are the ones that make (a+k) divisible by some divisor of d. But note: the condition for a divisor g is equivalent to k ≡ (-a) mod g. Then the set of candidate k's is the set of numbers of the form (g - a%g) % g for every divisor g of d.\n\n    But note: the set of divisors is the same as the set of divisors of d, and we are generating k0 for each divisor.\n\n    However, there is an alternative: the minimal k must be such that (a+k) and (b+k) have a large gcd. The gcd is a divisor of d, so k must be chosen so that (a+k) is divisible by some divisor g of d. \n\n    But note: we must consider that k must be at least 0, and the set of divisors is fixed.\n\n    But wait: is it true that the optimal k must be one of these? \n\n    Proof sketch: Consider the condition that the gcd(a+k, b+k) divides d. Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then g divides d. Then, k must satisfy: (a+k) ≡ 0 (mod g). So k ≡ (-a) mod g. Therefore, for the divisor g, the smallest non-negative k is k0(g) as above. Then, the candidate set is exactly the set of k0(g) for all divisors g of d.\n\n    However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. But that is okay.\n\n    But there's a caveat: we must consider that the divisor g must be the gcd? No, the gcd might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd is the greatest common divisor, so it is the maximum divisor of d that divides (a+k). But our candidate k0(g) is the minimal k for which (a+k) is divisible by g. However, the gcd might be a divisor of d that is greater than g, and then the LCM might be computed with a larger divisor, but we are not missing that because we are iterating over all divisors (so we will also have a candidate k0(h) for h being the actual gcd). \n\n    However, note: the candidate set is defined by the divisors of d. The gcd(a+k, d) is a divisor of d, but it might be any divisor (not necessarily the one we started with). But we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n    Example: \n        a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n        k0(1)=0 -> gcd(6,10)=2 (which is divisor 2, but we are not using 2 as the divisor to generate k0, but we also have k0(2)=0 and k0(4)=2).\n        Then we compute LCM for k=0 and k=2.\n\n    But note: the candidate k0(2)=0 is already included. So we are considering the divisor 2 and getting k=0, and then the gcd is 2, so the LCM is (6*10)//2=30.\n\n    So we are not missing the divisor 2 even though we generated k0 for divisor 1 and divisor 2 and divisor 4.\n\n    Therefore, the plan is:\n\n        if a == b:\n            print(0)\n            exit()\n\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        Find all divisors of d.\n\n        best_k = 0\n        best_lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)   # initial with k=0\n\n        for each divisor g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            n1 = a + k0\n            n2 = b + k0\n            g_val = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n            lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g_val\n\n            # Compare lcm_val with best_lcm\n            if lcm_val < best_lcm:\n                best_lcm = lcm_val\n                best_k = k0\n            elif lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n                best_k = k0\n\n        print(best_k)\n\n    However, wait: is k0 always non-negative? Yes, because modulo operation.\n\n    But note: the modulus operation: \n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n\n    This is the standard way to get the smallest non-negative solution for k ≡ (-a) mod g.\n\n    However, note: if a % g == 0, then (g - a%g) % g = 0, which is correct.\n\n    But what if a % g != 0?\n        Example: a=6, g=4 -> 6 % 4 = 2, then (4-2)=2, then 2 %4 =2.\n\n    It works.\n\n    But note: the set of divisors includes all positive divisors. We must factor d (which can be up to 10^9) to get all divisors. \n\n    How to factor d (up to 10^9)? We can do trial division up to sqrt(d). The worst-case d is around 10^9, then sqrt(d) is about 31622. We can do that.\n\n    Steps for factorization:\n\n        We'll write a function to factorize a number and then generate all divisors.\n\n    However, note: d might be 0, but we already handled a==b.\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \"5 10\" -> d=5, divisors=[1,5]\n        k0 for g=1: (1 - 5%1) %1 -> 0 (because 5%1=0, so 0)\n        k0 for g=5: (5 - 5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0\n\n        Then we consider k=0 twice.\n\n        Then we compute for k=0: \n            n1=5, n2=10, gcd(5,10)=5, LCM= (5*10)//5 = 10.\n\n        So output 0.\n\n    But the example says: \n        Input: ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'] -> Output: ['2','9','0']\n\n    So for '5 10' we output 0.\n\n    Another example: \n        Input: 21 31 -> d=10, divisors=[1,2,5,10]\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0\n        k0 for g=2: (2 - 21%2) %2 = (2-1)%2=1\n        k0 for g=5: (5 - 21%5)%5 = (5-1)%5=4\n        k0 for g=10: (10 - 21%10)%10 = (10-1)%10=9\n\n        Then we consider k=0,1,4,9.\n\n        k=0: (21,31) -> gcd(21,31)=1, LCM=21*31//1=651.\n        k=1: (22,32) -> gcd(22,32)=2, LCM=22*32//2=352.\n        k=4: (25,35) -> gcd(25,35)=5, LCM=25*35//5=175.\n        k=9: (30,40) -> gcd(30,40)=10, LCM=30*40//10=120.\n\n        The smallest LCM is 120, which occurs at k=9. So output 9.\n\n    Therefore, the code must consider all divisors.\n\n    However, note: the divisor set must include all divisors, including those that are not prime. The method to generate divisors from prime factors is standard.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Factorize d (if d>0)\n        Step 2: Generate all divisors.\n\n    But note: d might be 1, then divisors=[1].\n\n    Let's test with d=1: \n        a=2, b=3 -> d=1\n        divisors=[1]\n        k0 = (1 - 2%1)%1 -> (1-0)%1=0\n        Then n1=2, n2=3 -> gcd=1, LCM=6.\n\n        But is k=0 the best? \n            k=0: LCM=6.\n            k=1: (3,4) -> gcd=1, LCM=12 -> worse.\n            k=2: (4,5) -> gcd=1, LCM=20 -> worse.\n\n        So yes.\n\n    But note: what if we have negative numbers? The input constraints say a,b>=1.\n\n    However, the problem says non-negative k, so k>=0.\n\n    One more edge: when d is large, but the divisors are few.\n\n    But note: the LCM computation: n1*n2 might be very large (if k0 is large, then n1 and n2 are large). But d is at most 10^9, and k0 is at most d (the divisor g is at most d, so k0 <= g-1 <= d-1). Then n1 and n2 are at most a+d (if a is 10^9 and d is 10^9, then n1 is 2e9, and n1*n2 is 4e18, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n    However, we must use integer arithmetic and math.gcd is efficient for numbers up to 4e9? The gcd algorithm (Euclidean) runs in O(log(min(n1,n2))) steps, so it's efficient.\n\n    But note: the set of divisors of d (which is up to 10^9) can be generated by trial division. The worst-case d is a prime, then the divisors are [1, d]. \n\n    Steps for factorization:\n\n        We can do:\n\n        def get_divisors(n):\n            # returns a list of divisors of n\n            divisors = set()\n            i = 1\n            while i*i <= n:\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    divisors.add(i)\n                    divisors.add(n//i)\n                i += 1\n            return sorted(divisors)   # or just return the set and then convert to list\n\n    But note: d can be 1, then i*i<=1 -> i=1, then divisors={1}.\n\n    However, the divisor generation might take O(sqrt(n)) which is about 31622 iterations for n=10^9, which is acceptable.\n\n    But note: we are only dealing with one number d (which is |a-b|). \n\n    Code structure:\n\n        import math\n\n        def main():\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                return\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n\n            if a == b:\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n            d = abs(a-b)\n            divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n            # Start with k=0\n            best_k = 0\n            # Compute initial LCM at k=0\n            g0 = math.gcd(a, b)\n            best_lcm = (a * b) // g0\n\n            # Iterate over each divisor\n            for g in divisors:\n                # k0 = smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0\n                remainder = a % g\n                if remainder == 0:\n                    k0 = 0\n                else:\n                    k0 = g - remainder\n\n                n1 = a + k0\n                n2 = b + k0\n                g_val = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n                lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g_val\n\n                # Compare\n                if lcm_val < best_lcm:\n                    best_lcm = lcm_val\n                    best_k = k0\n                elif lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n                    best_k = k0\n\n            print(best_k)\n\n        We need to define get_divisors(n):\n\n        However, note: what if d is 0? But we handled a==b, so d>0.\n\n    But wait: what if a and b are very large and d is 1? Then we have only one divisor.\n\n    Let me test with a=10**9, b=10**9-1 -> d=1, then divisors=[1]. Then k0= (1 - (10**9 %1)) %1 -> 0, and then we compute the LCM at k=0.\n\n    However, is there a possibility that a divisor is negative? No, we consider positive divisors.\n\n    But note: the divisor g must be positive because divisors of a positive integer are positive.\n\n    One more thing: the divisor set must include all divisors, including 1 and d.\n\n    Let's test with d=12, divisors should be [1,2,3,4,6,12].\n\n    However, note: the problem statement says: two integers a and b (1<=a,b<=10^9). \n\n    There's a catch: the above method considers k0 for every divisor. But note: the same k0 might appear for multiple divisors, but that's okay.\n\n    But wait: is it possible that there exists a k that is not generated by any divisor? \n\n    Remember: the condition for k is that the gcd(a+k, b+k) divides d. So the gcd must be one of the divisors. Then, k must be congruent to (-a) mod g, for g being the gcd. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities for the gcd. But note: we are not requiring that the gcd is exactly g, but we are setting k to make (a+k) divisible by g. Then the gcd(a+k, d) might be a multiple of g (if d has factors beyond g) and then the LCM calculation uses the actual gcd.\n\n    But note: the candidate k0 is the smallest k for divisor g. Then the actual gcd might be larger, but we are still calculating the LCM correctly.\n\n    However, there is an alternative candidate: sometimes, a k that is generated by a divisor g might not be the best for a divisor h (with h being the actual gcd). But we are iterating over all divisors, so we will also have the divisor h (if h divides d) and then k0 for h might be the same k? \n\n    Example: d=12, divisors=[1,2,3,4,6,12]. Suppose we have a=1, then:\n        For g=1: k0=0 -> (1, b+0) -> gcd(1, b) = gcd(1, b) [if b=11 then gcd(1,11)=1] -> LCM=11.\n        For g=2: k0=(2-1%2)=1 -> (2,12) -> gcd(2,12)=2, LCM=12.\n        For g=3: k0=(3-1%3)=2 -> (3,13) -> gcd(3,13)=1, LCM=39.\n        For g=4: k0=(4-1%4)=3 -> (4,14) -> gcd(4,14)=2, LCM=28.\n        For g=6: k0=(6-1%6)=5 -> (6,16) -> gcd(6,16)=2, LCM=48.\n        For g=12: k0=(12-1%12)=11 -> (12,22) -> gcd(12,22)=2, LCM=132.\n\n    But wait, the minimal LCM is 11 (k=0). \n\n    However, note: the divisor set is complete, so we found k=0.\n\n    But what if the actual gcd is 1 (which is in the divisor set) and we get k0=0 for divisor 1. Then we are good.\n\n    But note: the above example: a=1, b=11, d=10. Then divisors of 10: [1,2,5,10]. Then k0 for g=1:0, g=2: (2-1%2)=1, g=5: (5-1%5)=4, g=10: (10-1%10)=9.\n\n    Then we consider k=0,1,4,9.\n\n    k=0: (1,11) -> gcd=1, LCM=11.\n    k=1: (2,12) -> gcd=2, LCM=12.\n    k=4: (5,15) -> gcd=5, LCM=15.\n    k=9: (10,20) -> gcd=10, LCM=20.\n\n    So the minimal is 11, k=0.\n\n    But wait, the example I used d=10, but the example above was for d=10? Actually, no: a=1, b=11 -> d=10.\n\n    However, the example above with d=12 (a=1, b=13) was incorrect because I set b=13, then d=12. But the example above was for d=12, and then the minimal k was 0.\n\n    So the algorithm seems to work.\n\n    But note: there is a possibility that the minimal k is not generated by a divisor? \n\n    Let me think: the condition for the gcd is that it divides d. Then, for the gcd g0 (which is a divisor of d), we must have k ≡ (-a) mod g0. Then the minimal k for which the gcd divides d is at least the minimal k0 for one of the divisors. But note: the gcd might be any divisor, so we must consider all divisors.\n\n    However, note: the gcd might be a divisor that is not necessarily the one we started with (g) but we are iterating over all divisors (including the actual gcd). \n\n    But wait: the candidate k0(g) is the smallest k such that g divides (a+k). Then, the gcd(a+k0(g), d) is at least g, and we are computing the actual LCM with the gcd being the actual gcd (which is the gcd(a+k0(g), d)). \n\n    Therefore, we are covering all possibilities.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, choose the smallest one\". Our method iterates over divisors and updates best_k only if we find a strictly smaller LCM, or the same LCM with a smaller k. But note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. Then, we are updating best_k to the smallest k that achieves the minimal LCM.\n\n    But note: the candidate k's are generated by divisors, and we are storing the best k (lowest LCM and then smallest k). \n\n    However, there is a possibility that two different divisors yield the same k0? Then we are computing the same k twice. But that's okay.\n\n    But wait: the same k0 might be generated by different divisors. Then, we are recalculating the LCM for the same k0. We can optimize by storing the candidate k's and then deduplicate, but the divisor set is small so it doesn't matter.\n\n    However, note: the LCM value for the same k0 is the same. So if we get the same k0 from two divisors, we can break early? But we don't know the LCM until we compute it.\n\n    But note: the LCM depends on the actual gcd, not just k0. So even for the same k0, if the divisor set changes (because d changes) then the gcd might be different? Actually, no: the k0 is fixed, so a+k0 and b+k0 are fixed, so the gcd is fixed. \n\n    Therefore, we can store the candidate k0's and then process distinct k0's only. But the problem is that the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, and we are doing the same computation twice. \n\n    Since the divisor set is small (max ~1344 divisors) and the same k0 might be generated multiple times, we can use a set to record the k0's we've already processed. But note: the LCM computation is cheap compared to factorization? Actually, the factorization is the expensive part (but we did it once). \n\n    Alternatively, we can break the loop if we already computed a particular k0? But note: the same k0 may come from different divisors, but the LCM is the same. So we can skip duplicate k0's.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, choose the smallest one\", and we are iterating and updating best_k. We are not storing the entire set of k0's, so we are doing redundant calculations.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        candidates = set()\n        for g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            candidates.add(k0)\n\n        Then iterate over the distinct k0's.\n\n    But note: the divisor set is small, so we can do that.\n\n    However, there is a catch: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, but the LCM computation is independent and we must do it for each distinct k0. \n\n    But note: the LCM is determined by k0, so we can compute it once per distinct k0.\n\n    Revised plan:\n\n        if a==b: print(0); return\n\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n        candidate_ks = set()\n        for g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            candidate_ks.add(k0)\n\n        Then, we also must consider k=0 (already included) and possibly other k's? No, because we are generating all divisors.\n\n        Then, we iterate over each distinct candidate_ks, and also we must consider that the minimal k must be non-negative and we have generated all k0's.\n\n        But wait: the set of candidate_ks is the set of k0's for each divisor. Then we can do:\n\n        best_k = None\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for k0 in candidate_ks:\n            n1 = a + k0\n            n2 = b + k0\n            g_val = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n            lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g_val\n\n            if best_lcm is None or lcm_val < best_lcm:\n                best_lcm = lcm_val\n                best_k = k0\n            elif lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n                best_k = k0\n\n        print(best_k)\n\n    But wait: is it possible that a candidate k0 that is not generated by any divisor is better? \n\n    The answer is no, because the condition for the gcd requires that the gcd divides d, and then k0 must be one of the values we generated (the minimal k for each divisor). \n\n    However, note: the above candidate_ks set is built from the divisors. But what if the gcd is a divisor of d, then k0 must be congruent to (-a) mod g, and the minimal non-negative solution is (g - a%g) % g. Therefore, we have generated all candidate k's that could possibly yield a divisor g.\n\n    But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, but that doesn't hurt.\n\n    However, there's a catch: the divisor set must be the divisors of d, and we are generating k0 for each divisor. But note: the divisors of d are the same as the divisors of |a-b|.\n\n    But wait: what if d is 0? Handled.\n\n    But note: the problem says a,b>=1, so d>=0, and we handled d=0.\n\n    However, the above method is more efficient if the same k0 appears multiple times.\n\n    But note: the set of divisors is small (at most 1344) and the set of candidate_ks is even smaller (at most 1344 distinct k0's). \n\n    But wait: is the set of candidate_ks necessarily a subset of the divisors? Not necessarily: k0 can be any non-negative integer (as long as it is the minimal solution for a divisor). For example, if d=12 and a=5, then for divisor 3: k",
