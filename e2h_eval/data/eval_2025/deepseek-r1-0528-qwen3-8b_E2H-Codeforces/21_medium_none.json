The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the condition for a key j to open a chest i is that a_i + b_j is odd. \n This means one of them must be even and the other odd.\n\n We can break down the problem by considering the parity (even or odd) of the numbers.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n      count_even_chests = number of chests with even a_i\n      count_odd_chests = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n      count_even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n      count_odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note:\n   - An even chest requires an odd key (because even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest requires an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n But we cannot use a key more than once.\n\n So, the maximum number of chests we can open is limited by:\n\n   For even chests: we can use at most min(count_even_chests, count_odd_keys) from the odd keys.\n   For odd chests: we can use at most min(count_odd_chests, count_even_keys) from the even keys.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are using two disjoint sets of keys (the even keys and odd keys). \n\n Actually, the total matching is constrained by the two independent requirements:\n\n   Let x = number of even chests we open -> then we use x odd keys.\n   Let y = number of odd chests we open -> then we use y even keys.\n\n Then, we must have:\n   x <= count_even_chests\n   y <= count_odd_chests\n   x <= count_odd_keys\n   y <= count_even_keys\n\n And the total chests opened is x+y.\n\n We want to maximize x+y.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n   The entire set of keys (both even and odd) must be partitioned into two sets: one used for even chests and one for odd chests.\n\n But note: even keys can only open odd chests, and odd keys can only open even chests.\n\n So, the maximum number of even chests we can open is limited by the available odd keys (and the total even chests).\n Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests we can open is limited by the available even keys (and the total odd chests).\n\n However, we cannot assign more than the available keys of each type.\n\n Therefore, the maximum chests we can open is:\n\n   even_chest_limit = min(count_even_chests, count_odd_keys)\n   odd_chest_limit = min(count_odd_chests, count_even_keys)\n\n But wait: is that independent? Yes, because the two sets of keys (even and odd) are being used for disjoint sets of chests.\n\n So, the total chests we can open is even_chest_limit + odd_chest_limit?\n\n Let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n        count_even_chests = 3, count_odd_chests = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n        count_even_keys = 3, count_odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then:\n        even_chest_limit = min(3, 1) = 1\n        odd_chest_limit = min(2, 3) = 2\n\n   Total = 3. Which matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10] (all even), keys = [5] (odd)\n\n        count_even_chests = 5, count_odd_chests = 0\n        count_even_keys = 0, count_odd_keys = 1\n\n        even_chest_limit = min(5,1)=1\n        odd_chest_limit = min(0,0)=0\n        Total = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests = [10] (even), keys = [20,30,40,50] (all even)\n\n        count_even_chests = 1, count_odd_chests = 0\n        count_even_keys = 4, count_odd_keys = 0\n\n        even_chest_limit = min(1,0)=0\n        odd_chest_limit = 0\n        Total = 0 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward:\n\n Steps:\n   1. Read n, m.\n   2. Read the list of n integers (a_i) for chests.\n   3. Read the list of m integers (b_j) for keys.\n   4. Count the number of even and odd in chests and keys.\n   5. Compute:\n        even_chest_limit = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n        odd_chest_limit = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n   6. Print even_chest_limit + odd_chest_limit.\n\n However, note: the condition is that the sum is odd. But the above reasoning holds because:\n   - Even chest requires odd key -> so we use odd_keys for even_chest_limit.\n   - Odd chest requires even key -> so we use even_keys for odd_chest_limit.\n\n But what if there are not enough keys of the opposite parity? Then we take the minimum.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: the constraints are up to 10^5, so we can do simple counting.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chests = 0\n   for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n   odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = 0\n   for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n   odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   ans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n   print(ans)\n\n However, wait: is there any possibility that the same key is used twice? The problem states one key for one chest and vice versa, and our method accounts for disjoint usage (one set of keys for even chests and the other set for odd chests). Since even keys and odd keys are distinct and the two sets of chests are distinct, this is valid.\n\n Let me run the examples again:\n\n Example 1: \n   even_chests=3, odd_chests=2\n   even_keys=3, odd_keys=1\n   even_chest_limit = min(3,1)=1\n   odd_chest_limit = min(2,3)=2\n   total=3.\n\n Example 2:\n   even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n   even_chest_limit = min(5,1)=1\n   odd_chest_limit = min(0,0)=0\n   total=1.\n\n Example 3:\n   even_chests=1, odd_chests=0\n   even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n   even_chest_limit = min(1,0)=0\n   odd_chest_limit = 0\n   total=0.\n\n So, yes, the answer is correct.\n\n But wait, let me consider another example:\n\n Example 4:\n   Chests: [1,2] (one odd, one even)\n   Keys: [2,3] (one even, one odd)\n\n   even_chests = 1, odd_chests=1\n   even_keys=1, odd_keys=1\n\n   even_chest_limit = min(1,1)=1\n   odd_chest_limit = min(1,1)=1\n   total=2.\n\n How does that work?\n   Use key 2 (even) for chest 2 (even) -> but wait, condition: even+even = even (not odd) -> so that doesn't work.\n\n Correction: \n   Condition: a_i + b_j must be odd.\n\n   For chest 2 (even): we need an odd key. We have one odd key (3). So use key 3 for chest 2 (even) -> 2+3=5 (odd) -> valid.\n\n   For chest 1 (odd): we need an even key. We have one even key (2). So use key 2 for chest 1 -> 1+2=3 (odd) -> valid.\n\n   So indeed, we can open both.\n\n   But note: the assignment is: \n        even_chest_limit = min(1, odd_keys)=min(1,1)=1 -> meaning we use one odd key for the even chest.\n        odd_chest_limit = min(1, even_keys)=min(1,1)=1 -> meaning we use one even key for the odd chest.\n\n   And since the odd key and even key are distinct, we don't run into conflict.\n\n   However, in this example, the two keys are distinct and we are allowed to use each key only once.\n\n   The catch: the same key cannot be used twice, but we are using two different keys (one even and one odd) for two different chests.\n\n   So the formula still holds.\n\n Another example: \n   Chests: [1,2,3] (two odds, one even)\n   Keys: [2,4,5] (two evens, one odd)\n\n   even_chests=1, odd_chests=2\n   even_keys=2, odd_keys=1\n\n   even_chest_limit = min(1,1)=1\n   odd_chest_limit = min(2,2)=2\n\n   total=3.\n\n   Check:\n     Chest 2 (even): needs odd key -> use 5 (odd key) -> then we have two even keys left and two odd chests (chests 1 and 3).\n     Then use one even key for chest 1 (odd): 1+2=3 (odd) -> valid.\n     Then use the other even key for chest 3 (odd): 3+4=7 (odd) -> valid.\n\n   So 3 is correct.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of chests and keys.\n   Count the number of even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Then, \n        ans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n   Print ans.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Note: We must read the input from stdin and output the answer.\n\n However, note the input format: the first line is \"n m\", then the second line is the chests, third line the keys.\n\n Example input string: '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20'\n\n We split the first line to get n and m.\n\n Code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   # But the first two tokens are n and m, then next n tokens are chests, then next m tokens are keys.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n But note: the problem says the input has three lines.\n\n Let me code accordingly.\n\n However, note that the input might be large (up to 10^5 numbers per line). Using input().split() for the second and third lines is acceptable because 10^5 is acceptable in Python.\n\n But let me check: \n\n   We can do:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n Then process.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chests = sum(1 for a in a_list if a % 2 == 0)\n   odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = sum(1 for b in b_list if b % 2 == 0)\n   odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n   print(result)\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   n=5, m=4, a_list=[9,14,6,2,11] -> even_chests=3, odd_chests=2\n   b_list=[8,4,7,20] -> even_keys=3, odd_keys=1\n   result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1+2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: \n   n=5, m=1, a_list=[2,4,6,8,10] -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   b_list=[5] -> even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n   result = min(5,1)+min(0,0)=1+0=1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3: \n   n=1, m=4, a_list=[10] -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=0\n   b_list=[20,30,40,50] -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n   result = min(1,0)+min(0,4)=0+0=0 -> correct.\n\n So we are good.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that n, m can be up to 10^5, and the numbers can be up to 10^9. Our method uses modulus 2 which is O(n+m) and efficient.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair (chest, key) meets the condition that their sum is odd. This translates to pairing even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on counting how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and the keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is constrained by the smaller of these counts:\n   - For even-numbered chests, the maximum possible openings is the minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys (since even chests require odd keys).\n   - For odd-numbered chests, the maximum possible openings is the minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys (since odd chests require even keys).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Reading the input values for the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in both the chests and keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum chests that can be opened by combining the results from the two constraints mentioned above.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once to count even and odd numbers, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = sum(1 for a in a_list if a % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = sum(1 for b in b_list if b % 2 == 0)\n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the potentially large input size. The first two values are the number of chests (n) and keys (m). The next n values are the chest numbers, followed by m key numbers.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: For both chests and keys, we count how many are even and how many are odd. This helps in determining how many valid pairs can be formed.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering two separate scenarios:\n   - Using odd keys to open even chests (min of even chests and odd keys).\n   - Using even keys to open odd chests (min of odd chests and even keys).\n4. **Output the Result**: The sum of these two minima gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple counting and arithmetic operations to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
