Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input might use different letters (like 'x' and 'o', or 'w','s','p').\n\n Steps:\n  - Read n.\n  - Read the grid.\n\n  Let's define:\n    Let the main diagonal be from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1)\n    Let the anti-diagonal be from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0)\n\n  Conditions:\n    a) For every cell (i, j) on the main diagonal (i.e., i == j) OR on the anti-diagonal (i+j == n-1), the letter must be the same, say letter A.\n    b) For every cell not on these diagonals, the letter must be the same, say letter B, and letter B != letter A.\n\n  But note: there might be cases where the diagonals have multiple letters? Then we must check that all the diagonal cells are the same.\n\n  Approach:\n    Step 1: Traverse the grid and collect:\n        - The set of letters on the main diagonal.\n        - The set of letters on the anti-diagonal.\n\n    However, note: it is possible that the two diagonals have different letters? Then condition fails.\n\n    Actually, condition says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning each diagonal individually must be same, but the two diagonals can have different letters? \n\n    But wait, read the problem statement: \n      \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n    So the two diagonals can have different letters? Actually, no: because the example does not specify, but let me check the example:\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \n            5\n            xooox\n            oxoxo\n            soxoo\n            oxoxo\n            xooox\n\n        Here, the main diagonal: \n            positions: (0,0): 'x', (1,1): 'o', (2,2): 's', (3,3): 'o', (4,4): 'x'\n        This is not the same letter! So why was the example output 'NO'?\n\n    Wait, the example input is given as a list of strings in the example input, but the example input string is:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\n    Let me break down the example:\n\n        Example 1: \n            n = 5\n            Grid:\n                'xooox'\n                'oxoxo'\n                'soxoo'\n                'oxoxo'\n                'xooox'\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'o'\n            row2: 's'\n            row3: 'o'\n            row4: 'x'\n\n        This is not all the same. So the condition fails.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'w', row1: 's', row2: 'w' -> not same? But wait, the example output is 'YES'\n\n        Let me re-read the condition: \n          \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n        In example 2, the main diagonal has: 'w', 's', 'w' -> not all same? \n        But wait, the example output is 'YES'. \n\n        Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the diagonals.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"on both diagonals\" meaning the entire diagonal must be the same letter.\n\n        In example 2, the main diagonal is: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] -> ['w','s','w'] -> not same.\n\n        Now, what about the anti-diagonal? \n            grid[0][2] = 'w'\n            grid[1][1] = 's'\n            grid[2][0] = 'w'\n\n        Also not the same.\n\n        But the example output is \"YES\". \n\n        Let me read the example again: \n            Input: \n                3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n        How is this an X?\n\n        Actually, the example might be using the center as the common point? \n\n        Let me draw:\n\n            w s w\n            s s s   -> wait, no, the grid is:\n            w s w\n\n        Actually, the grid is:\n\n            row0: w s w\n            row1: s w s   ? Wait, no: the second row is \"sws\", so that is: \n            row1: s, w, s\n\n        Correction: the example input is:\n\n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        So the grid is:\n\n            [['w','s','w'],\n             ['s','w','s'],\n             ['w','s','w']]\n\n        Now, the main diagonal: \n            [grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][2] = 'w'] -> same (all 'w')\n        The anti-diagonal:\n            [grid[0][2] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w'] -> same (all 'w')\n\n        And then the rest of the squares (the non-diagonal ones) are:\n            (0,1): 's', (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's', (2,1): 's'\n\n        So they are all 's', which is different from 'w'.\n\n        So condition holds.\n\n        Why did I get confused? Because the example provided in the input example is represented as a string with single quotes, but the actual grid is:\n\n            \"wsw\"\n            \"sws\"\n            \"wsw\"\n\n        So the grid is:\n\n            row0: 'w','s','w'\n            row1: 's','w','s'\n            row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n        Therefore, the main diagonal is indeed all 'w' and the anti-diagonal is all 'w', and the rest is 's'.\n\n    So the condition is:\n        Condition 1: All the main diagonal elements are the same, say A.\n        Condition 2: All the anti-diagonal elements are the same, say A (but note: the example above used the same letter for both diagonals). \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the two diagonals to have the same letter? It only requires that each diagonal individually has the same letter. But note: the example 2 uses the same letter for both diagonals.\n\n        However, consider if the two diagonals have different letters? Then condition fails.\n\n        Example: \n            n=3\n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n            Condition 1: a, e, i must be same (say A).\n            Condition 2: c, e, g must be same (say B).\n\n            Then the center (e) must be both A and B -> so A must equal B.\n\n        Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter (because they share the center). \n\n        So we can deduce:\n            - The entire main diagonal must be the same letter (say X_letter).\n            - The entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter (which must also be X_letter, because the center is common).\n\n        Then, for the rest of the cells (non-diagonal), they must all be the same letter (say dot_letter) and dot_letter != X_letter.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        1. Read n and grid.\n\n        2. Check the main diagonal: \n            for i in range(n): if grid[i][i] != first_diagonal_letter (which is grid[0][0]), then break and set condition fails.\n\n        3. Check the anti-diagonal:\n            for i in range(n): if grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][0] (or should we use the same letter? Actually, the center must be the same, but the entire anti-diagonal must be the same, and the center is shared. So we can check the entire anti-diagonal must be the same, and then compare that same letter with the main diagonal's letter? But note: the problem does not explicitly say the two diagonals must have the same letter, but by the example we see they do. However, from the center being common, the two diagonals must have the same letter at the center. But the problem says \"on both diagonals all letters are the same\", meaning the entire main diagonal is one letter, and the entire anti-diagonal is one letter, and then the other condition says the rest is a different letter. There is no explicit requirement that the two diagonals must be the same. However, the center is part of both, so the two diagonals must have the same center letter. Therefore, the entire main diagonal must be one letter (say A) and the entire anti-diagonal must be one letter (say B). Since they share the center, A must equal B.\n\n        But note: what if the main diagonal has one letter and the anti-diagonal has a different letter? Then the center is the same for both, so they must be the same. So we can check:\n\n            Let A = grid[0][0]\n            Check main diagonal: all grid[i][i] == A for i in range(n)\n            Check anti-diagonal: all grid[i][n-1-i] == A for i in range(n)\n\n        4. Then, for the rest of the cells (every cell that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal), check that they are all the same letter, say B, and B != A.\n\n        However, note: the center cell is already checked (it is on both diagonals). So when we traverse the grid, we can skip the diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let center_letter = grid[0][0]   (because the main diagonal starts with grid[0][0] and the anti-diagonal ends with grid[0][n-1] but wait, the center is grid[n//2][n//2] and must be the same as grid[0][0] and grid[0][n-1] and so on.)\n\n        Actually, we can check the entire main diagonal and entire anti-diagonal must be the same as grid[0][0] (if we assume the main diagonal is all grid[0][0]). But wait, what if the main diagonal is all 'x' and grid[0][0] is 'x', then okay. Similarly, the anti-diagonal must be all 'x'. \n\n        But note: the example input:\n\n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Output is \"NO\".\n\n        Let's analyze this example:\n\n            Grid:\n                row0: 'x','p','x'\n                row1: 'p','x','p'\n                row2: 'x','p','e'\n\n            Main diagonal: [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e'] -> not all same (has 'x','x','e') -> fails.\n\n            So condition 1 fails.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            n=3\n            aaa\n            aba\n            aaa\n\n            Main diagonal: 'a','a','a' -> good.\n            Anti-diagonal: grid[0][2]='a', grid[1][1]='b', grid[2][0]='a' -> not same -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must check:\n\n            Step 1: Check main diagonal: all same letter, call it A.\n            Step 2: Check anti-diagonal: all same letter, and that letter must be A (because center is common) -> actually, we can just check the entire anti-diagonal is A.\n\n            Step 3: Check that for every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal, the letter is the same and different from A.\n\n        However, note: the center cell is already covered by both diagonals. So in step 3, we don't want to include the center twice.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n            Step 2: Let A = grid[0][0]\n\n            Step 3: Check main diagonal: for i in range(n): if grid[i][i] != A -> print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n            Step 4: Check anti-diagonal: for i in range(n): if grid[i][n-1-i] != A -> print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n            Step 5: Now, we need to check the rest of the cells. We'll traverse every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal.\n\n            Let B = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue   # skip the diagonals, we already checked they are A\n                    if B is None:\n                        B = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != B:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit()\n\n            But wait, we must also check that B != A.\n\n            However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? That happens when n==1, but n>=3 and odd, so at least 3x3, so there will be non-diagonal cells.\n\n            But note: what if the non-diagonal cells are not all the same? Then we break and say NO.\n\n            Also, after collecting B, we must check that B != A.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n            Step 5a: Let B = None\n            Step 5b: For each cell not on the diagonals, assign B if not set, and then check consistency.\n\n            But we must also check that B != A.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Step 5: Traverse the grid for non-diagonal cells and check that they are all the same, and then check that that same letter is different from A.\n\n            However, note: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Actually, for n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n            Example: n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the four corners? Actually, no: for 3x3, the non-diagonal cells are the ones that are not (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and not (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center (1,1) is skipped (already in both diagonals). Then the remaining cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). \n\n            We can do:\n\n            Step 5: Set B = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if B is None:\n                        B = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != B:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return   # or break\n\n            Then, after the loops, check if B != A and if we didn't break.\n\n            But wait, what if the grid is all A? Then the non-diagonal cells would be A, but then B==A -> fails the condition (must be different). \n\n            However, the problem states: the non-diagonal squares must contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n            So if the grid is all A, then the diagonals are A (good) but the non-diagonals are A (same as diagonals) -> fails.\n\n            So we must check that the non-diagonal letter is different from A.\n\n            However, note: the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from A.\n\n            Therefore, after step 5, if we found B and B != A, then YES, else NO.\n\n            But what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Actually, for n>=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is n*n - (2*n - 1) = (n^2 - 2*n + 1) = (n-1)^2. For n=3, that's 4, which is positive.\n\n            However, if n==1, but n>=3 so we don't have to worry.\n\n            But wait: what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are empty? Actually, they are not. \n\n            However, there's a catch: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells but they are not the same? Then we break and say NO.\n\n            So the code structure:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                grid = []\n                for i in range(n):\n                    grid.append(input().strip())\n\n                # Step 1: Check main diagonal\n                A = grid[0][0]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if grid[i][i] != A:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n                # Step 2: Check anti-diagonal\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n                # Step 3: Check the rest of the cells\n                B = None\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                            continue\n                        if B is None:\n                            B = grid[i][j]\n                        else:\n                            if grid[i][j] != B:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                exit(0)\n\n                # Now, if we get here, then the non-diagonal cells are all the same (B) and the diagonals are A.\n                if B is None:\n                    # This means there are no non-diagonal cells. According to our calculation, that only happens if n=1, but n>=3.\n                    # But for n>=3, (n-1)**2 >= 4, so there are non-diagonal cells. So this case shouldn't happen.\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    if B != A:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, wait: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells but they are not the same? We break in the loop and never get to the if B is None. So the above code handles that.\n\n        But note: the example that fails in the anti-diagonal might break earlier.\n\n        Let me test with example 1:\n\n            Input: \n                5\n                xooox\n                oxoxo\n                soxoo\n                oxoxo\n                xooox\n\n            Step 1: Check main diagonal: \n                i=0: 'x' == 'x' -> ok.\n                i=1: 'o' == 'x'? -> no. So we print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n        Example 2 (from the example):\n\n            Input:\n                3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n            Step 1: A = grid[0][0] = 'w'\n            Step 2: Check main diagonal: \n                i=0: grid[0][0]=='w' -> ok.\n                i=1: grid[1][1]=='w' -> ok.\n                i=2: grid[2][2]=='w' -> ok.\n\n            Step 3: Check anti-diagonal:\n                i=0: grid[0][2]=='w' -> ok.\n                i=1: grid[1][1]=='w' -> ok.\n                i=2: grid[2][0]=='w' -> ok.\n\n            Step 4: Now, check the rest of the cells (non-diagonal). The non-diagonal cells are:\n                (0,1): 's'\n                (1,0): 's'\n                (1,2): 's'\n                (2,1): 's'\n\n            We set B = 's' (first non-diagonal cell). Then we check the others are 's'. Then we check B != A -> 's' != 'w' -> True, so we print \"YES\".\n\n        Example 3:\n\n            Input: \n                3\n                xpx\n                pxp\n                xpe\n\n            Step 1: A = grid[0][0] = 'x'\n            Step 2: Check main diagonal: \n                i=0: 'x' -> ok.\n                i=1: grid[1][1] = 'x' -> ok.\n                i=2: grid[2][2] = 'e' -> not 'x' -> print \"NO\"\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"NO\", so that matches.\n\n        However, there's an alternative scenario: what if the main diagonal is not starting with grid[0][0] but the entire main diagonal is the same? \n\n        Actually, we set A = grid[0][0] and then check the entire main diagonal is that. \n\n        But what if the main diagonal is all the same, but not grid[0][0]? \n\n        Example: \n            n=3\n            aaa\n            bbb\n            aaa\n\n        This is not valid because the main diagonal is ['a','b','a'] -> not the same.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But wait, what if the main diagonal is all the same, but the anti-diagonal is not the same as that? \n\n        Example:\n\n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xyy\n            xxx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> not same -> fails.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            n=3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n        Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='a', grid[1][1]='a', grid[2][0]='a'] -> same. Then we check non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> but wait, the condition says non-diagonal must be the same and different from A. Here A='a', and the non-diagonal includes (0,1) which is 'a' -> same as A -> fails.\n\n        So we must check that the non-diagonal cells are not A.\n\n        But note: the example above has non-diagonal cells that are 'a' (at (0,1)) and then (1,2)='b' and (2,1)='a'. \n\n        Actually, wait: the grid is:\n\n            row0: 'a','a','a'\n            row1: 'a','a','b'\n            row2: 'a','a','a'\n\n        The main diagonal: [0,0]='a', [1,1]='a', [2,2]='a' -> ok.\n        The anti-diagonal: [0,2]='a', [1,1]='a', [2,0]='a' -> ok.\n\n        Then the non-diagonal cells: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> set B='a'\n            (0,2) is diagonal, skip.\n            (1,0): 'a' -> same as B -> ok.\n            (1,2): 'b' -> not same as B -> fails.\n\n        So we break and say \"NO\".\n\n        But note: the example above has two different non-diagonal letters? Actually, the non-diagonal cells must all be the same. In this example, we have 'a' and 'b'. So we break at (1,2).\n\n        However, what if the entire non-diagonal is the same? Then we proceed and check that that letter is not A.\n\n        Example:\n\n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xyy\n            xxx\n\n        We already saw: main diagonal is not same -> fails.\n\n        Example that passes:\n\n            n=3\n            www\n            wwww   -> wait, no, we have 3 rows. Let me write:\n\n            n=3\n            www\n            www\n            www\n\n        Main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n        Anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> ok.\n        Non-diagonal: the entire grid is 'w'. So non-diagonal cells are all 'w'. Then we check: B='w', and A='w', so B==A -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must output \"NO\".\n\n        Another example that passes:\n\n            n=3\n            www\n            www\n            www\n\n        -> NO.\n\n        Example that passes:\n\n            n=3\n            aab\n            aba\n            aca\n\n        This is not symmetric.\n\n        Let me think of a valid example:\n\n            n=3\n            x..\n            .x.\n            ..x\n\n        But wait, the entire main diagonal is 'x', anti-diagonal is 'x', and the rest are '.'.\n\n        So:\n\n            grid = \n                ['x','.','.']\n                ['.','x','.']\n                ['.','.','x']\n\n        But wait, the anti-diagonal: \n            (0,2): '.' -> not 'x'. So fails.\n\n        Let me fix:\n\n            We need the anti-diagonal to be 'x'. So:\n\n            grid = \n                ['x','.','.']\n                ['.','x','.']\n                ['.','.','x']   -> anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='.', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][0]='.'] -> not same.\n\n        So we must have the anti-diagonal as all 'x'. \n\n        Then:\n\n            grid = \n                ['x','.','.']\n                ['.','x','.']\n                ['.','.','x']   -> not valid.\n\n        How about:\n\n            n=3\n            x.x\n            ...   -> no, wait, the anti-diagonal must be 'x'\n\n        Actually, the anti-diagonal must be: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) -> so we need:\n\n            grid[0][2] = 'x'\n            grid[1][1] = 'x'\n            grid[2][0] = 'x'\n\n        Then the grid:\n\n            row0: 'a','b','x'\n            row1: 'c','x','d'\n            row2: 'e','f','g'\n\n        But we have constraints on the diagonals.\n\n        Example:\n\n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xyy\n            xxx\n\n        We already know the main diagonal is 'x','y','x' -> not same.\n\n        Example:\n\n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xyx\n            xxx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> not same.\n\n        Example:\n\n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xxy\n            xxx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> same.\n        Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][0]='x'] -> same.\n        Non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'x' -> same as A -> fails.\n\n        So the non-diagonal must be a different letter.\n\n        Example valid:\n\n            n=3\n            x..\n            .x.\n            ..x   -> but then the anti-diagonal is not the same? \n\n        Let me define the grid for 3x3:\n\n            We want:\n                main diagonal: all 'x'\n                anti-diagonal: all 'x'\n\n            Then the grid must be:\n\n                [x, ., .]\n                [., x, .]\n                [., ., x]\n\n            Then the anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='.', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][0]='.'] -> not same.\n\n        So we must have the anti-diagonal as 'x'. Therefore, the grid must be:\n\n            [x, ., x]   -> but then the center is (1,1) which is not defined in the first row? Wait, no.\n\n            Actually, the grid must be:\n\n                row0: [x, a, x]\n                row1: [b, x, c]\n                row2: [d, e, f]\n\n            Conditions for diagonals:\n                main: x, x, f -> so f must be x -> so row2[2] is x.\n                anti: x, x, d -> so d must be x.\n\n            Then the grid becomes:\n\n                row0: [x, a, x]\n                row1: [b, x, c]\n                row2: [x, e, x]\n\n            Now, the non-diagonal cells: \n                (0,1): a\n                (1,0): b\n                (1,2): c\n                (2,1): e\n\n            They must all be the same letter (say '.') and different from x.\n\n            So set a, b, c, e must be the same.\n\n            Then the grid:\n\n                x a x\n                b x c\n                x e x\n\n            with a=b=c=e='.'.\n\n            Now, check the anti-diagonal: \n                (0,2): 'x' -> ok\n                (1,1): 'x' -> ok\n                (2,0): 'x' -> ok.\n\n            Main diagonal: \n                (0,0): 'x', (1,1): 'x', (2,2): 'x' -> ok.\n\n            Non-diagonal: \n                (0,1): '.', (1,0): '.', (1,2): '.', (2,1): '.' -> same and different from 'x'.\n\n            So the grid:\n\n                x.x\n                .x.\n                x.x   -> but wait, the second row: ['.', 'x', '.'] -> then the non-diagonal cells are the dots.\n\n            But wait, the grid must be 3x3, and the example above has:\n\n                row0: \"x.x\" -> three letters: 'x','.','x'\n                row1: \".x.\" -> three letters: '.','x','.'\n                row2: \"x.x\" -> three letters: 'x','.','x'\n\n            Now, the anti-diagonal: \n                row0: index2 -> 'x'\n                row1: index1 -> 'x'\n                row2: index0 -> 'x'\n\n            Main diagonal: \n                row0:0->'x', row1:1->'x', row2:2->'x'\n\n            Non-diagonal: \n                (0,1): '.' -> set B='.'\n                (1,0): '.' -> same\n                (1,2): '.' -> same\n                (2,1): '.' -> same\n\n            Then '.' != 'x' -> YES.\n\n        But wait, the example input format: \n\n            Input: \n                3\n                x.x\n                .x.\n                x.x\n\n            This would be:\n\n                n=3\n                grid = ['x.x', '.x.', 'x.x']\n\n            However, the problem says: the grid is given with n lines, each containing n small English letters.\n\n            This grid is valid.\n\n        However, the example input provided in the problem:\n\n            Example inputs:\n\n                ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n            Our program must handle these.\n\n        Let me test with the grid:\n\n            n=3\n            grid = ['x.x','.x.','x.x']\n\n            Step 1: A = grid[0][0] = 'x'\n            Step 2: Check main diagonal: \n                i0: grid[0][0] = 'x' -> ok\n                i1: grid[1][1] = 'x' -> ok\n                i2: grid[2][2] = 'x' -> ok\n\n            Step 3: Check anti-diagonal:\n                i0: grid[0][2] = 'x' -> ok\n                i1: grid[1][1] = 'x' -> ok\n                i2: grid[2][0] = 'x' -> ok\n\n            Step 4: Check non-diagonal cells:\n                (0,1): '.' -> set B='.'\n                (1,0): '.' -> same\n                (1,2): '.' -> same\n                (2,1): '.' -> same\n\n            Then check B != A: '.' != 'x' -> True -> YES.\n\n        But wait, the grid has 3 rows and 3 columns, and the representation is:\n\n            row0: \"x.x\" -> so the characters are ['x', '.', 'x']\n            row1: \".x.\" -> ['.', 'x', '.']\n            row2: \"x.x\" -> ['x', '.', 'x']\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input provided in the problem:\n\n            Example 3: \n                Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n            This grid:\n\n                row0: 'xpx' -> ['x','p','x']\n                row1: 'pxp' -> ['p','x','p']\n                row2: 'xpe' -> ['x','p','e']\n\n            Our program: \n                Step1: A = 'x'\n                Step2: Check main diagonal: \n                    i0: 'x' -> ok\n                    i1: 'x' (from row1[1]) -> wait, row1 is 'pxp', so grid[1][1] is 'x' -> ok\n                    i2: 'e' -> not 'x' -> prints \"NO\"\n\n            Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                grid.append(input().strip())\n\n            #

The problem states n>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        But note: the problem says n is odd and n>=3, so n>=3.\n\n        However, there is a possibility that the grid might have non-diagonal cells that are the same as A, but we break because of the anti-diagonal or main diagonal? \n\n        Example: \n\n            n=3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        We break in the anti-diagonal check? No, because the anti-diagonal is [grid[0][2]='a', grid[1][1]='a', grid[2][0]='a'] -> same. Then we go to non-diagonal and break because (1,2) is 'b' and then (0,1) is 'a' (but wait, (0,1) is non-diagonal: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> set B='a'\n            (1,0): 'a' -> same\n            (1,2): 'b' -> not same -> break.\n\n        So we break and print \"NO\".\n\n        But what if the non-diagonal cells are the same but that same letter is A? Then we break at the end: \n\n            n=3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa   -> wait, no, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1)='a', (1,0)='a', (1,2)='b', (2,1)='a'. \n\n        Actually, in the above example, the grid:\n\n            row0: \"aaa\" -> ['a','a','a']\n            row1: \"aab\" -> ['a','a','b']\n            row2: \"aaa\" -> ['a','a','a']\n\n        Then the anti-diagonal: \n            (0,2)='a', (1,1)='a', (2,0)='a' -> ok.\n\n        Then the non-diagonal cells: \n            (0,1): 'a' -> set B='a'\n            (1,0): 'a' -> same\n            (1,2): 'b' -> not same -> break and say NO.\n\n        But what if the entire non-diagonal is A? \n\n            Example: \n                n=3\n                aaa\n                aab\n                aaa   -> same as above, but if we change the last row to \"aaa\", then the grid:\n\n                row0: \"aaa\"\n                row1: \"aab\"\n                row2: \"aaa\"\n\n            Then the anti-diagonal: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal**: The main diagonal consists of cells where the row index equals the column index (i.e., (0,0), (1,1), ..., (n-1,n-1)). All these cells must contain the same letter, say `A`.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal**: The anti-diagonal consists of cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (i.e., (0,n-1), (1,n-2), ..., (n-1,0)). All these cells must also contain the same letter `A`.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: All cells not on either diagonal must contain the same letter, say `B`, and `B` must be different from `A`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    A = grid[0][0]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != A:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    B = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            if B is None:\n                B = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != B:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if B is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if B != A:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Checking Main Diagonal**: The code checks if all elements on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) are the same letter `A`. If any element differs, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Checking Anti-Diagonal**: Similarly, the code checks if all elements on the anti-diagonal (where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`) are the same letter `A`. If any element differs, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Checking Non-Diagonal Cells**: The code then checks all other cells (not on either diagonal) to ensure they are the same letter `B` and that `B` is different from `A`. If any cell does not meet these conditions, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, the code prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the required conditions for the grid to form an \"X\" by systematically checking each part of the grid.",
