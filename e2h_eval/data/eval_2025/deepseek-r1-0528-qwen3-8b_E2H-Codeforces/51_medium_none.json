Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the target string (since we need to form both names).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the third string.\n    - If they are the same, then we can rearrange the pile to form the two names (so output \"YES\").\n    - Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says there should be no extra letters and we shouldn't need to cut more. So the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Here, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". \n   The pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which when sorted is the same as the sorted combined string.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string with newlines. We'll split by lines.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Combined string: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n   Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> but wait, the example output is 'NO'. \n\n   Actually, let me check the example input provided in the problem:\n\n   The example input is given as:\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But the example output is:\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   The second sample input (second line) is:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   However, the example input in the problem statement for the second sample is actually the third sample? \n\n   Clarification from the problem statement:\n\n   Input example:\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   And the output example is:\n        YES, NO, NO\n\n   So the three examples are separate.\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each containing the three lines for one test case? \n\n   But the problem says: \n        The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\n   So the input file has three lines for one test case? Or multiple test cases?\n\n   However, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is confusing. The problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Looking at the example input format: it says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case per run. But the example input provided is a list of three test cases? \n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is a list of three strings, each string being the entire three lines for one test case? \n\n   But the problem states: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   So the example input is three test cases? Or one test case with three lines?\n\n   Let me re-read: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input description.\n\n   The example input is given as a list of three strings, each string containing three lines (with newline characters). \n\n   However, in competitive programming problems, sometimes they give multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   This implies one test case with three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a list of three such test cases. \n\n   Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   and the expected output is:\n\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   So the problem actually expects three test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   That is ambiguous. However, looking at the example input, it is three test cases.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement again: \n\n        Input\n        The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\n   This suggests one test case.\n\n   But then the example input is provided as three different sets of three lines? \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but each string is the entire three lines for one test case.\n\n   How should we process?\n\n   The problem says: \"The input file\" (singular) consists of three lines. \n\n   But the example input is three test cases. \n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n        Then the problem description.\n\n        Then example input and output.\n\n   And the example input is shown as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   and the output is:\n\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   So the problem expects three answers.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. \n\n   However, the example input format is ambiguous. \n\n   Clarification: In many competitive programming problems, the input format is described per test case, and the number of test cases is provided first. But here, the input file has three lines (one test case) or multiple test cases?\n\n   Since the example input is provided as a list of three strings (each being three lines) and the output is a list of three strings, we can assume that the input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\" — meaning one test case. \n\n   There's a discrepancy.\n\n   Actually, looking at the example input, it is provided as:\n\n        Line1: 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n        Line2: 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n        Line3: 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines. So if we have three test cases, then the input file would have 3 * 3 = 9 lines.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be using a multi-line input for one test case, and the example input is just showing three separate test cases for illustration.\n\n   However, the example output is three answers.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again, it says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   So one test case.\n\n   But then the example input is three test cases. \n\n   I think there's a misunderstanding: the example input is provided in a single string representation, but the actual input for the program is three lines for one test case.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   So we are to read three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being the entire three lines for one test case. \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me look at the example:\n\n        Input:\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Then the next example:\n\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   And then:\n\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   So actually, the example input is three separate test cases, each having three lines.\n\n   How do we know how many test cases? The problem statement doesn't specify.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   This implies one test case. \n\n   However, the example input is three test cases. \n\n   There's an inconsistency.\n\n   After checking the example input format in the problem statement: \n\n        Example Input:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is a list of three strings, each string is the concatenation of the three lines for one test case.\n\n   But the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   So the intended way is that the input file has three lines (for one test case). \n\n   However, the example input is provided as a list of three test cases for illustration.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n        \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   This is singular: three lines.\n\n   So we are to read three lines.\n\n   But the example input is three test cases (each test case being three lines). \n\n   This means the example input is three test cases, so the input file has 3 * 3 = 9 lines.\n\n   However, the problem says \"three lines\", so perhaps the example input is given in a compact form for clarity, but the actual input for the program is one test case (three lines).\n\n   But the example output is three answers.\n\n   Now I'm confused.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement from the original source (if available) or the competition website.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be designed for multiple test cases, and the input starts with the number of test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement doesn't mention that.\n\n   After re‐reading: the problem statement says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case.\n\n   So we should assume one test case.\n\n   But the example input is three test cases.\n\n   There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   However, the example output is three answers.\n\n   How did the example input become three test cases? \n\n   Let me see: the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being the entire three lines for one test case.\n\n   So the example input is three test cases, but the problem says the input file has three lines (one test case). \n\n   This is contradictory.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competitive programming context, it is common to have multiple test cases, but the problem statement here does not specify.\n\n   But note: the example input is provided as a list of three test cases, and the expected output is three answers.\n\n   Therefore, I will assume that the input may contain multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"three lines\", so one test case.\n\n   I think the problem intended to say that each test case has three lines, but the entire input file has t * 3 lines, where t is the number of test cases.\n\n   But the problem does not specify t.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the example input is meant to be three separate runs of the program.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I must rely on the example: the example input is three test cases, so we must handle multiple test cases.\n\n   How to determine the number of test cases?\n\n   The problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   So we cannot change the assumption.\n\n   Wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\" — meaning the entire input file has three lines.\n\n   So one test case.\n\n   Then why is the example input given as three test cases?\n\n   I think the example input is just an illustration of three different test cases, but the actual input for the program is one test case (three lines).\n\n   Therefore, we read three lines.\n\n   But the example output is three answers. \n\n   This does not match.\n\n   Another possibility: the example input is provided in a compact form, and the three test cases are separated by blank lines or something? \n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   I think there is an error in the problem statement.\n\n   Let me look at the sample input again:\n\n        Example Input:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is a list of three strings, each string being the entire three lines for one test case.\n\n   So the input file has 3 * 3 = 9 lines.\n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   There is a disconnect.\n\n   I will ask for clarification, but since I can't, I must make a decision.\n\n   Since the problem is presented in this form, and the example input is three test cases, I will assume that the input file has multiple test cases, and each test case is three lines.\n\n   How many test cases? The problem does not specify, so we must read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we don't know.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have a fixed number of test cases (like three) but that is not stated.\n\n   After reading the example input again, I notice that the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being three lines (with newlines). \n\n   This is typical for a multi-test-case input: the entire input is 9 lines, but the problem statement says three lines.\n\n   I think the problem intended to say: \"The input consists of multiple test cases, each test case has three lines.\"\n\n   But they forgot to specify the number of test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not provide a way to know the number of test cases.\n\n   Since the constraints say \"The length of each line does not exceed 100\", and the input file is not empty, we can try to read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have been designed for a single test case, and the example input was given in a compact form for the reader.\n\n   Given the confusion, I will write the program to handle one test case (three lines) as per the problem statement.\n\n   Then, if the judge provides multiple test cases, we might fail.\n\n   But the problem statement says three lines.\n\n   So we read three lines.\n\n   Steps for one test case:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n        target = line1 + line2\n        pile = line3\n\n        if sorted(target) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases. \n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a list of three test cases, so the judge will run the program three times, each time with three lines for one test case.\n\n   Or the judge provides a file with three test cases, each test case being three lines, so total nine lines.\n\n   Then we need to read until EOF.\n\n   The problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are only guaranteed three lines.\n\n   But if the judge gives nine lines, we must read all nine and process three test cases.\n\n   How to handle?\n\n   The problem statement is ambiguous.\n\n   Since the example input is three test cases, and the expected output is three answers, we must support multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   I think the problem intended to say: \"Each test case consists of three lines.\"\n\n   And the entire input file has t test cases, each test case having three lines.\n\n   How to determine t? The problem does not specify.\n\n   Another possibility: the input file has exactly three lines, but these three lines are the three inputs for one test case.\n\n   Then the example input is three test cases, meaning the judge will run the program three times, each time with three lines.\n\n   So we write the program for one test case.\n\n   Then the judge runs the program three times, providing three different sets of three lines each.\n\n   But then the example output is three answers, which would be printed three times.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, the judge provides a file with three test cases, and we read until EOF.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   Then we expect that the number of lines is a multiple of 3, and then we process each group of three lines.\n\n   But the problem says \"three lines\", so we don't know.\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases, so we assume the input is a sequence of test cases, each test case having three lines.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        t = len(lines) // 3   # assuming the entire input has 3*t lines\n\n        for i in range(t):\n            guest = lines[3*i].strip()\n            host = lines[3*i+1].strip()\n            pile = lines[3*i+2].strip()\n\n            target = guest + host\n            if sorted(target) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But the problem says three lines, not 3*t.\n\n   Another approach: the problem says the input file consists of three lines, so we read three lines and process one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases, so the judge is running the program three times.\n\n   We'll stick to the problem statement and read three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a list of three test cases. \n\n   Since the problem statement says three lines, we'll assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example output is three answers, so the judge must be running the program three times.\n\n   Therefore, the problem statement is flawed.\n\n   I decide to write the program to handle one test case (three lines) as per the problem statement.\n\n   Then the user (or judge) must run the program three times with the three test cases.\n\n   But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we read three lines.\n\n   Let me test with the first test case:\n\n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        We strip each line (though there are no extra spaces, but just in case).\n\n        target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Now, we need to check if sorted(target) == sorted(pile)\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n            target: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' -> sorted: \n            pile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' -> sorted: \n\n        They are the same set of letters, so YES.\n\n   Second test case:\n\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        target = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n        pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count the letters:\n\n        target: \n            P: 3, A: 2, I: 1, N: 1, O: 2, E: 1, L: 1, J: 1, U: 2, K: 1\n\n        pile:\n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, A:2 -> wait, let me count:\n\n            Actually, let's break down the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:1\n\n            But target has:\n                P:3 -> in pile we have only 1 P -> so not equal.\n\n        So we get NO.\n\n   Third test case:\n\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        target = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n        pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count:\n\n        target: \n            B:2, A:4, B:2 -> total B:4? \n            Let me count manually:\n\n            BABBONATALE: B:2, A:2, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS: F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1, S:1\n\n            Combined: \n            B:2, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:2, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1\n\n        pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            B:2, A:2, B:2 -> wait, let's break down:\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            B:2 (from 'BA'), then another 'B'? Actually, the word: \n            BAB -> B:2, A:1; then the rest.\n\n            Let me count properly:\n\n            B: appears in 'BAB', then again in 'BONAT' -> so B:3?\n            Actually, let's write it out:\n\n            B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R\n\n            Count B: positions 0,2,12 -> 3 times.\n\n            But target has B:2 -> so already we have an extra B.\n\n            So it's NO.\n\n        However, the example output is NO.\n\n   So the program for one test case works for the examples.\n\n   But the problem says the input file consists of three lines, so we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases.\n\n   I think the judge is providing three separate runs, each with three lines.\n\n   Therefore, we write the program for one test case.\n\n   Code:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n        s1 = line1 + line2\n        s2 = line3\n\n        if sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This means the first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", the second line is \"DEDMOROZ\", the third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Our program reads three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as a string with newlines. \n\n   In Python, when reading from stdin, if the input is provided as:\n\n        SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Then the first input() call will read \"SANTACLAUS\" (without the newline), because input() by default skips the trailing newline.\n\n   But wait, the example input string is: \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   When we do:\n\n        input() -> reads the first line: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        input() -> reads the second line: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        input() -> reads the third line: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   But note: the example input string includes the newlines. However, the input() function in Python will return the string without the trailing newline.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, the problem says the input file consists of three lines, so we read three lines.\n\n   But what if the input file has more than three lines? \n\n   According to the problem, it has three lines.\n\n   Therefore, we assume exactly three lines.\n\n   Let me run the first test case with the code above.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a string with newlines, but the actual input for the program is three lines (each line is given).\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases, meaning the judge will run the program three times.\n\n   But the problem statement says three lines, so we assume one test case.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n        if sorted(line1+line2) == sorted(line3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, the problem says the third line contains the letters in the pile. We are not told that the pile is exactly the letters of the two names, but we are to verify that the pile can be permuted to form the two names.\n\n   This code does exactly that.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", but the example input is three test cases. \n\n   We are assuming one test case.\n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases, we must adjust.\n\n   But the problem statement says three lines.\n\n   We'll submit this and hope the judge provides one test case per run.\n\n   Alternatively, if the judge provides multiple test cases, we can read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says three lines.\n\n   We'll stick to three lines.\n\n   However, the example input is three test cases, so the judge must be providing three test cases in three separate runs.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   All correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the letters are uppercase. We are not converting to lower case, so we assume uppercase only.\n\n   The problem says: \"contain only uppercase Latin letters\"\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Code:\n\n        def main():\n            line1 = input().strip()\n            line2 = input().strip()\n            line3 = input().strip()\n\n            if sorted(line1 + line2) == sorted(line3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n            main()\n\n   However, the problem says the input file has three lines. What if there are less than three lines? Then we get an error.\n\n   But the problem says the input file consists of three lines, so we assume three lines.\n\n   We are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined names of the guest and the host. The solution involves checking if the multiset of characters in the pile matches the multiset of characters formed by concatenating the guest's name and the host's name.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Character Counts**: Compare the sorted list of characters from the combined names with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    line1 = input().strip()\n    line2 = input().strip()\n    line3 = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = line1 + line2\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(line3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three lines of input, each stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and the host's name are concatenated into a single string (`combined`).\n3. **Character Comparison**: The sorted list of characters in `combined` is compared with the sorted list of characters in the pile (`line3`). If they match, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, allowing them to be rearranged into the original names. The result is \"YES\" if they match, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in character counts between the combined names and the pile by leveraging sorting, which ensures an accurate comparison regardless of the order of characters. The solution handles all edge cases, including extra or missing letters, by directly comparing the sorted character lists.",
