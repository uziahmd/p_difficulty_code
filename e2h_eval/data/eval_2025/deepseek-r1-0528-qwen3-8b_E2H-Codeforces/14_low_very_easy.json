He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, note that we are asked: for a given m, how many n have Z(n) = m?\n\n Observation:\n   Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. For example:\n     Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n   But note: the value of Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5. Also, for a given m, there might be a range of n with Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input m=1 -> Output: 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n So, we are to output the set of n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, and then the largest n such that Z(n) <= m? Actually, we want exactly m.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can find the range of n for which Z(n) = m.\n\n Let's define:\n   L(m): the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1? Actually, we want the smallest n for which Z(n) becomes at least m? Then the numbers from the first n where Z(n) becomes m to the last n where Z(n) is still m.\n\n But note: Z(n) is constant over intervals. For example, once Z(n) reaches m, it will remain m until we hit the next multiple of 5 (or until we accumulate an extra factor of 5 and 2).\n\n Actually, we can think:\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n). Then we want n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   We know that f(n) is constant on intervals [a, b] and jumps at multiples of 5. However, note that sometimes the jump is more than one? Actually, the jump size is the number of factors of 5 in the new number (which is the exponent of 5 in n). For example, when n=25, we add two factors of 5.\n\n   But note: the jump at n=25 is from Z(24)=4 to Z(25)=6 (because 25 adds two factors of 5). So for m=5, we don't have any n with Z(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, for some m, there might be no n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n   Example: m=5. Then we would check:\n\n     Find n0: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= 5.\n        n=5: 1\n        n=10: 2\n        n=15: 3\n        n=20: 4\n        n=25: 6 -> so at n=25 we jump from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\n\n   So the answer for m=5 is 0.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Similarly, we can find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, if we let:\n        low = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n        high = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then, the numbers n for which Z(n) = m are those n in the interval [low, high-1] (if we consider that at n=high, Z(n) becomes at least m+1).\n\n   However, note: it's possible that there is no n with Z(n)=m. Then the interval [low, high-1] would be empty if low >= high.\n\n   But wait: what if we don't have an m+1? Actually, we can always compute the next jump because m is at most 100000, and n can be as large as needed.\n\n   However, note that we cannot compute Z(n) for very large n by iterating from 1 to n. We need a function that computes Z(n) in logarithmic steps.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Define a function count_trailing_zeros(n):\n        count =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This count can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The numbers \\( n \\) for which \\( Z(n) = m \\) lie between these two bounds. If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound), then there are no solutions.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation of \\( Z(n) \\)**: The function `count_trailing_zeros` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 until the division result becomes zero.\n\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Special cases where \\( m = 0 \\) or \\( m \\) is very large (up to 100,000) are handled by adjusting the bounds and ensuring the solution is efficient even for the upper constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    low = 0\n    high = m * 5 + 1\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n\n    start = low\n\n    low_next = 0\n    high_next = m * 5 + 10\n    while low_next < high_next:\n        mid_next = (low_next + high_next) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid_next) < m + 1:\n            low_next = mid_next + 1\n        else:\n            high_next = mid_next\n\n    end = low_next - 1\n\n    if start >= end:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = end - start + 1\n        print(k)\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(start, end + 1)]\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound (start)**: The binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). This is done by adjusting the search range based on whether the midpoint's trailing zero count is less than \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound (end)**: Similarly, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The upper bound for valid \\( n \\) values is one less than this result.\n\n4. **Output Handling**: If the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound, it means no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition, and the output is 0. Otherwise, the count of valid \\( n \\) values is the difference between the upper and lower bounds plus one. The valid \\( n \\) values are listed in increasing order from the lower bound to the upper bound.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about trailing zeroes in factorials to handle large input constraints effectively.",
