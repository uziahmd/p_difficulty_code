Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Note that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\n Observation:\n The operations allow us to move:\n   - '0's can only be moved by swapping with '1's (so they can pass through '1's, but not through '2's? Actually, note: \n        We cannot swap '0' and '2' directly. However, a '0' might use a chain of swaps to go around a '2'? But wait: \n        Consider the possibility of moving a '0' past a '2' by going through a '1'. \n\n However, note that the operations are:\n    Swap '0' and '1' (adjacent) -> this means we can rearrange the zeros and ones arbitrarily, because zeros and ones can be swapped arbitrarily (like in bubble sort). Similarly, ones and twos can be swapped arbitrarily. But zeros and twos cannot be swapped directly.\n\n But note: a zero can be moved past a one, and a one can be moved past a two, so indirectly a zero can be moved past a two (if there is a one to help). However, if we have a sequence like \"02\", we cannot swap them. Similarly, \"20\" is fixed until the zero moves past the two? Actually, we cannot swap \"02\" or \"20\" without a one in between.\n\n How do we think?\n\n Let's break down the string into three independent parts? Or consider the following:\n\n We have three types: 0, 1, 2. The allowed swaps are:\n   Operation1: swap '0' and '1' (adjacent) -> so zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily (because we can simulate any permutation of zeros and ones by adjacent swaps). However, note that we cannot swap zeros and twos, so the relative order of zeros and twos is constrained by the ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string is broken into two independent chains? Or we can assign weights to each character.\n\n Another approach: think about which characters can be moved arbitrarily relative to which.\n\n Since we can swap zeros and ones arbitrarily, all zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily. Similarly, all ones and twos can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the zeros cannot pass through twos without ones. However, the key is that the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed unless there is a one that can help to bypass.\n\n However, let me consider the entire set of operations: we can independently rearrange the zeros and ones, and the ones and twos. But wait, what about the zeros and twos? They are connected via the ones.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to having two independent sets of inversions: one for zeros and ones, and one for ones and twos. But note: the ones are shared.\n\n We can also note that the operations generate a group that allows us to independently rearrange the zeros and ones (so zeros can be anywhere relative to ones) and independently rearrange the ones and twos. However, the zeros and twos cannot be arbitrarily rearranged because the path from a zero to a two must go through the ones.\n\n What are the constraints?\n\n The relative order of zeros and twos must be such that if we look at the entire string, the zeros that are originally to the left of a two, we can bring the two to the right of the zero by using the ones as intermediaries? Not necessarily: we can move zeros to the right if we swap with ones, and we can move twos to the left if we swap with ones. So if we have a zero and a two, we can potentially separate them by moving the zero to the right past the two? Actually, no direct swap, but we can do:\n\n Example: \"02\"\n   We cannot swap directly. But if we have at least one '1' somewhere, we might be able to use it to swap the zero and two indirectly? However, note the operations require adjacent swaps and only for specific pairs.\n\n But note: the example input includes strings of length up to 10^5, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Insight:\n\n In fact, the operations allow the following:\n\n   - We can rearrange the zeros arbitrarily relative to the ones.\n   - We can rearrange the ones arbitrarily relative to the twos.\n\n But then, what about zeros and twos? Consider:\n\n   We can have a zero and a two separated by some ones. Then we can move the zero to the right past the ones (since we can swap zero and one) and the two to the left past the ones (since we can swap one and two). So if we have:\n\n        ... zero ... one ... two ... \n\n   Then we can move the zero to the right until it passes all the ones (but note: when the zero passes",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on '0's and '1's, and '1's and '2's. The key observation here is that while '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, they can be rearranged relative to each other through the intermediary of '1's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The allowed operations are swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. This means '0's and '1's can be rearranged freely among themselves, and similarly for '1's and '2's. However, the relative positions of '0's and '2's are constrained by the presence of '1's. Specifically, a '0' can move past a '2' only if there is at least one '1' in between, allowing the '0' to swap with the '1' and then the '2' with the '1'.\n\n2. **Insight**: The lexicographically smallest string will have all '0's first, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. However, because '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, we need to ensure that any '2's that originally appear before '0's can be moved past the '0's only if there are sufficient '1's to facilitate the swaps.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Count Characters**: Count the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the string.\n   - **Construct Result String**: The result string will consist of three parts:\n     - **Part 1**: All '0's followed by as many '1's as needed to separate them from '2's.\n     - **Part 2**: The remaining '1's.\n     - **Part 3**: All '2's.\n   - **Handling Separation**: The number of '1's required to separate '0's from '2's is determined by the positions of '0's and '2's in the original string. Specifically, if there are `k` '2's before the first '0', then at least `k` '1's must be placed between the '0's and '2's in the result string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    \n    total_zeros = count0\n    total_ones = count1\n    total_twos = count2\n    \n    # Find the starting index of zeros\n    start_index = s.find('0')\n    if start_index == -1:\n        # There are no zeros\n        start_index = 0\n        \n    # Count how many twos are before the first zero (if any)\n    num_twos_before_first_zero = 0\n    for char in s[:start_index]:\n        if char == '2':\n            num_twos_before_first_zero += 1\n            \n    # The number of ones needed to separate the zeros and twos is the number of twos before the first zero\n    # But note: we might have more than enough ones, so we take the minimum of the required separation and available ones?\n    # Actually, in the result, we want to put all zeros first, then the necessary ones to separate from twos, then the rest of the ones, then twos.\n    # The number of ones that must be placed between zeros and twos is exactly the number of twos that originally were before the first zero.\n    # Because each such two must be separated from the zeros by an '1' (in the sense of the final arrangement, but actually we can think of it as needing to have at least that many ones in between).\n    \n    # Construct the result string:\n    # First part: zeros and the necessary ones (num_twos_before_first_zero) to separate from twos.\n    result = ['0'] * total_zeros + ['1'] * num_twos_before_first_zero\n    \n    # Second part: the remaining ones (if any)\n    remaining_ones = total_ones - num_twos_before_first_zero\n    if remaining_ones > 0:\n        result.extend(['1'] * remaining_ones)\n        \n    # Third part: all twos\n    result.extend(['2'] * total_twos)\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Counting**: The code first counts the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the input string.\n2. **Finding Initial Zero Position**: It locates the first occurrence of '0' in the string. If there are no '0's, it defaults to starting at the beginning.\n3. **Counting Twos Before First Zero**: The code counts how many '2's appear before the first '0' in the original string. This count determines how many '1's must be placed between '0's and '2's in the result to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.\n4. **Constructing Result String**: The result string is built by concatenating:\n   - All '0's.\n   - Enough '1's to separate the '0's from the '2's (based on the count of '2's before the first '0').\n   - The remaining '1's (if any).\n   - All '2's.\n5. **Output**: The constructed string is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps to minimize the string lexicographically by strategically placing '1's between '0's and '2's based on their original positions.",
