On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of integers that are either 1 or 2, and we can reverse any contiguous subarray (or not, if reversing doesn't help). We want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: Since the array only contains 1 and 2, the entire sequence is made of two numbers. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such an array is just the consecutive 1's and then 2's. But note: we are allowed to reverse a contiguous part.\n\n Observation:\n Without any reversal, the array is given. However, by reversing a contiguous segment, we can change the order of 1s and 2s in that segment.\n\n Let's consider the entire sequence. After reversal, the entire sequence will have a part (prefix) unchanged, then a reversed segment, then a suffix unchanged.\n\n The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Since the array is only 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence can be at most the total number of 1's plus the total number of 2's (which is n) but wait, that would be the whole array if it is non-decreasing. However, we might break the sequence with a reversed part.\n\n Actually, note: the entire sequence may not be non-decreasing, but we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that is the entire sequence if we arrange all 1s first and then 2s. But wait, the problem allows one reversal.\n\n Important: In fact, we can think of the reversal as being able to rearrange a contiguous segment arbitrarily? Not exactly: the reversal operation is fixed (it reverses the segment). But note: if we reverse a segment, then the entire sequence becomes:\n\n [a1, a2, ..., a_{l-1}] + [reverse of (a_l, a_l+1, ..., a_r)] + [a_{r+1}, ..., a_n]\n\n However, we are not limited to having only the entire sequence as the non-decreasing subsequence. The non-decreasing subsequence does not need to be contiguous.\n\n But note: the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but we are allowed to take non-contiguous elements.\n\n However, note the following: in an array of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the total number of elements if we can arrange them as all 1s then all 2s. But we are only allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n How can we think?\n\n Alternate approach: what is the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence we can get?\n\n In fact, the entire sequence after reversal can have at most all the 1s and then all the 2s, so the entire sequence would be non-decreasing and the answer would be n. But wait, is that always achievable?\n\n Example: [1, 2] -> already non-decreasing, so we don't need to reverse. But what about [2,1]? Then we reverse [2,1] to get [1,2] and the entire sequence is non-decreasing.\n\n So the goal is to arrange the array so that we have all 1s (in increasing order, which they are) and then all 2s. However, we are only allowed one reversal. So we can fix the entire sequence to be non-decreasing by reversing a segment that has a drop from 1 to 2? Actually, no: if we have [1,2,1] then reversing the middle [2,1] gives [1,1,2] which is non-decreasing. Similarly, if we have [2,2,1,1] then reversing [2,1,1] (from index 2 to 4) gives [2,1,1,2] which is not entirely non-decreasing. But wait, the entire sequence doesn't have to be non-decreasing, but we are looking for the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence might be arranged as non-decreasing if we choose the reversal appropriately. But sometimes we cannot get the entire sequence to be non-decreasing because there might be multiple segments of 1s and 2s that are interleaved.\n\n But wait: the reversal operation is contiguous. We can only reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire sequence to be non-decreasing, but the longest non-decreasing subsequence. In an array of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s (if the entire sequence is arranged as 1s then 2s) but if we cannot arrange the entire sequence as 1s then 2s, then we can still have a long non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Actually, the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the optimal solution will have all 1s appearing before all 2s, which would make the entire sequence non-decreasing, thus the LNDS would be the entire sequence. However, if the original sequence cannot be transformed into such a sequence with a single reversal, we need to find the longest segment where the sequence is already non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by reversing a part of it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Analysis**: The sequence consists of only 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence is simply the entire sequence if all 1s come before all 2s. Otherwise, the LNDS might be shorter.\n2. **Reversal Impact**: Reversing a contiguous subarray can help in moving 1s to the left and 2s to the right. The goal is to maximize the number of consecutive 1s followed by 2s.\n3. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution involves transforming the sequence into a state where all 1s are as left as possible and all 2s as right as possible. This can be achieved by reversing a segment that contains some 2s followed by some 1s.\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: We can use dynamic programming to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for different segments, but given the constraints (n ≤ 2000), a more efficient approach is needed. Instead, we precompute prefix and suffix arrays to determine the best possible segments to reverse.\n5. **Efficiency**: The solution involves iterating through the array to compute the necessary prefix and suffix sums, which allows us to determine the optimal reversal segment in O(n) time after preprocessing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for num in arr if num == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if total_ones == 0 or total_twos == 0:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [0] * (n + 1)\n    right_arr = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if arr[i - 1] == 1:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i - 1] + 1\n        else:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i - 1]\n            \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if arr[n - i] == 1:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i - 1] + 1\n        else:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i - 1]\n            \n    max_prefix = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if left_arr[i] == i:\n            max_prefix = i\n            \n    max_suffix = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if right_arr[i] == i:\n            max_suffix = i\n            \n    total_ones_after_removal = total_ones - (max_prefix + max_suffix)\n    total_twos_after_removal = total_twos - (n - max_prefix - n + max_suffix)\n    candidate = total_ones_after_removal + total_twos_after_removal\n    candidate = min(candidate, n)\n    \n    ans = max(total_ones, total_twos)\n    if candidate > ans:\n        ans = candidate\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Cases**: If the sequence consists entirely of 1s or 2s, the answer is trivially the length of the sequence.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays store the count of consecutive 1s from the start (prefix) and end (suffix) of the sequence. This helps in identifying segments that are already non-decreasing.\n4. **Max Segments**: The maximum lengths of the prefix and suffix segments that are entirely 1s are determined.\n5. **Optimal Reversal Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the maximum possible LNDS by considering the removal of the largest prefix and suffix segments of 1s, then combining the remaining 1s and 2s.\n6. **Result**: The result is the maximum between the total number of 1s or 2s and the calculated candidate value after potential reversal, ensuring the optimal solution is found efficiently.",
