The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can move clockwise.\n\n The key observation: \n   We start at house 1. Then we have to complete tasks in the given order (each task i requires being at house a_i, and all previous tasks must be done).\n\n However, note that we can revisit houses and the ring is circular. The ringroad has n houses, so the distance from a house i to a house j in a clockwise ring of n houses is:\n   If j >= i: j - i\n   If j < i: (n - i) + j   [because we go from i to n, then wrap around from 1 to j]\n\n But note: we are allowed to move only clockwise. So we can also think of the ring as having positions modulo n.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to break down each move separately because the total time is the sum of the distances traveled.\n\n We are going to traverse the tasks in order. We start at position 1 (which is index 0 in zero-indexed if we consider 1-indexed positions). \n\n Steps:\n\n Let current = 1 (current house number)\n\n Then for each task location a (converted to integer), we calculate the distance from current to a.\n\n But note: the ring is circular and one-way (clockwise). So the movement is always clockwise.\n\n How to compute the distance from current to a?\n   We can consider two cases:\n\n   Case 1: a >= current -> then the distance is a - current.\n   Case 2: a < current -> then the distance is (n - current + 1) + (a - 1) ? Let's think:\n\n   Actually, from current to n (which is the last house) and then from house 1 to house a? But wait, after house n comes house 1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can map the houses to a linear representation by considering the circularity.\n\n   Another way: the ring can be thought of as a circle of n nodes. The clockwise distance from current to a is:\n\n      d = (a - current) % n   but that doesn't work directly because if a < current, (a - current) % n gives a negative remainder.\n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n      If we let the positions be 1-indexed, then the clockwise distance from current to a is:\n\n        If a >= current: d = a - current\n        If a < current: d = (a + n) - current   [but wait, this would be the same as (a - current) mod n?] \n\n   However, note: from current to a when a < current: we go from current to the end (house n) and then from house 1 to house a.\n\n        d = (n - current + 1) + (a)   but wait, actually:\n\n        From current to n: n - current moves (because from current to current+1, ... until n: that's n - current steps)\n        Then from house 1 to house a: a - 1 steps? No, because we are already at house n and then we move to house 1 (which is the next) and then to house a.\n\n        Actually, from current to a (when a < current) is: \n            (n - current) + a\n\n        Example: n=4, current=3, a=2 -> (4-3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3. \n        But the direct clockwise path from 3 to 2: 3->4->1->2: that's 3 steps. Correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write: d = (a - current + n) % n   but wait, if we do that:\n\n        For a=3, current=3: (3-3+n)%n = n%n = 0 -> correct.\n        For a=2, current=3: (2-3+n) % n = (2-3+4) %4 = 3 %4 = 3 -> correct.\n\n        However, note that the modulus operation might not give the positive distance in the clockwise direction for the entire circle?\n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from current to a should be:\n\n          d = (a - current) % n   if we adjust for negative: but if (a - current) is negative, then we add n and then take modulus? Actually, we don't need modulus if we use:\n\n          d = (a - current) % n\n          But if a < current, (a - current) is negative, so (a - current) % n in Python will give a value between 0 and n-1. However, we want the actual clockwise steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n          d = (a - current) % n\n          But wait, if a >= current, then (a - current) % n = a - current (if a-current < n, which it is because a and current are in [1, n] and a>=current, then a-current is at most n-1, so modulus doesn't change it).\n          If a < current, then (a - current) % n = (a - current + n) % n. And since (a - current + n) is positive and less than n (because a-current is negative and adding n makes it positive and less than n? Actually, no: a-current is negative, say -k, then adding n gives n-k, and since k = current - a, and current<=n, a>=1, then k<=n-1, so n-k>=1 and <=n. But wait, if current=4, a=1, n=4: then (1-4+4)=1, which is correct because from 4 to 1: 4->1 is 1 step? Actually, in the example above we had 3 steps for 3->2, but 4->1: \n          Actually, from house 4 to house 1: we move from 4 to 1 (which is the next house in clockwise? Wait, the ringroad is clockwise and the houses are numbered 1 to n. After house n (which is 4) comes house 1. So from 4 to 1 is one step.\n\n          But wait, our example above for current=3, a=2: we did 3->4->1->2 (three steps). But according to the formula: (2-3+4) %4 = 3, which is correct.\n\n          Now, what is the distance from 4 to 1? (1-4+4)%4 = (1)%4 = 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in this case gives the shortest clockwise path? Yes, because in a ring of n houses, the clockwise distance from i to j is (j - i) mod n, but if j-i is negative then we add n.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative: \n          (a - current) % n   when a < current gives (a - current + n) % n, but if (a - current + n) is still negative? Actually, no: because a>=1, current<=n, so (a - current) is at least (1-n) and at most (n-1). When negative, adding n makes it positive and then modulus n gives the value between 0 and n-1. However, we don't want 0 when we are at the same house, and the distance should be positive.\n\n        But wait, the problem: the distance from current to a is the number of steps. We can use:\n\n          d = (a - current) % n\n          But if (a - current) is negative, then we get a positive value. However, if we do modulus, then for example from 2 to 5 in n=5: \n            (5-2)%5 = 3, correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation does not exactly give the clockwise distance if we consider that the modulus n is the size, but wait:\n\n        In fact, the clockwise distance from current to a in a ring of n houses is:\n\n          d = (a - current) if a >= current else (a - current + n)\n\n        But wait, in the example current=3, a=2, n=4: \n          (a - current + n) = (2-3+4)=3 -> correct.\n\n        And if we do (a - current) % n, then (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (in Python, because -1 % 4 gives 3). So both methods are equivalent.\n\n        However, note: if a == current, then (a - current) % n = 0, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance as:\n\n          d = (a - current) % n   if we are sure that a and current are in [1, n] and n is the modulus base.\n\n        But wait, the modulus base should be n? Actually, the ring has n houses, so the modulus should be n. However, note: the positions are 1-indexed and the modulus operation with n gives the same result as the formula above.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the modulus operation in this case is defined for the additive group modulo n, but the houses are from 1 to n. The modulus operation (a - current) % n gives a value between 0 and n-1. But note:\n\n          If we are at house current and want to go to house a, and if a==current, then 0 steps. If we are at house 1 and want to go to house n, then (n-1) % n = n-1, which is correct (from 1 to n: we move n-1 steps? Actually, no: from 1 to n: we move n-1 steps? Let me count: 1->2->...->n: that's n-1 steps. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example above for 3->2 was 3 steps, and 3 is (2-3+4)=3, which is the same as (2-3)%4=3. But (2-3) %4 = 3, so yes.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation is defined for the entire circle. The clockwise distance from current to a is the smallest nonnegative solution to (current + d) ≡ a (mod n) with d in [0, n-1]. This is exactly (a - current) mod n, but note: the modulus operation in modular arithmetic gives the smallest nonnegative residue. However, in our case, we are traversing the entire circle clockwise and the distance is defined as the minimal positive steps (which is the same as the modulus operation).\n\n        However, there's a nuance: the problem says that moving from a house to the next takes one unit of time. The entire ring is of n houses, so the maximum distance without wrapping is n-1. But the modulus operation gives a value from 0 to n-1, which is exactly the distance.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance as:\n\n          d = (a - current) % n\n\n        But wait, let's test with a=current: d=0 -> correct.\n        Test with a=current+1: (a-current)%n = 1 -> correct.\n        Test with a=current-1 (and current>1): (a-current) is negative, so (a-current+n) % n = (a-current+n) (because a-current+n is positive and less than n? Actually, if current=2, a=1: (1-2+n) % n = (n-1) % n = n-1. Correct.\n\n        However, note: the example above for current=3, a=2, n=4: (2-3+4)=3, which is 3, and 3 is the distance (since from 3: 3->4 (1), 4->1 (2), 1->2 (3)).\n\n        But wait, the modulus operation in Python for (a - current) % n: \n          (a - current) % n = (a - current + n) % n   [if a-current is negative, we add n until positive]\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n          The formula is: a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)\n\n        But in our case, we want the clockwise distance. The modulus method works.\n\n        BUT: there is an alternative. We can also compute the distance without modulus by:\n\n          if a >= current:\n              d = a - current\n          else:\n              d = a - current + n\n\n        This is the same as (a - current) % n when (a - current) is negative? Not exactly, because the modulus operation might return a value that is not the same as adding n until positive? Actually, for negative, adding n once is sufficient because the absolute difference is less than n.\n\n        Actually, the absolute difference between a and current is at most n-1, so adding n once is enough.\n\n        However, the modulus operation is more straightforward and handles negative correctly.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation might be slower than an if statement? For 10^5 operations, it probably doesn't matter, but let's stick to clarity.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for integers is efficient.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n        For each task_location in the list of tasks:\n            d = (task_location - current) % n\n            But wait: if we use modulus, then we must be cautious: the modulus operation in this case gives the correct clockwise distance?\n\n        Let me test with current=1, task_location=3, n=4: (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2 -> correct (from 1->2->3: two steps).\n        current=3, task_location=1, n=4: (1-3)%4 = (-2)%4 = 2 -> but wait, the clockwise distance from 3 to 1 is 2 steps: 3->4->1. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: from 3 to 1: \n          We have two ways? But the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So we cannot go counter-clockwise. The clockwise direction from 3: 3->4->1, which is two steps. Correct.\n\n        But wait, the modulus operation gives 2, which is the same as (1-3+4)%4 = (1+1)%4 = 2. Correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives a value between 0 and n-1. The distance we are calculating is the minimal steps in the clockwise direction, which is exactly the modulus value.\n\n        But wait: what if the task_location is 1 and current is 3? Then (1-3)%4 = 2. And that is the distance. Correct.\n\n        However, there is a problem: the modulus operation does not account for the fact that we are in a circle of n houses, but the modulus operation is defined for modulo n, which matches.\n\n        BUT: note that the modulus operation in mathematics for negative numbers is defined such that (a - current) % n gives the unique integer d in [0, n-1] such that (a - current) ≡ d (mod n). And in our case, we want the clockwise distance, which is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that moving d steps clockwise from current lands on a.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1. Then we update current to the task_location at the end of each task.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          current = 1\n          total_time = 0\n\n          for a in tasks:\n              # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to a\n              # Using modulus: d = (a - current) % n\n              # But note: if (a - current) is negative, then modulus adds n until positive, and then takes modulo n, but since |a-current| < n, we just add n once and then take modulo n? Actually, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers does that.\n\n              d = (a - current) % n\n              # However, if d==0, then we don't move, but if d is positive, we move d steps.\n\n              total_time += d\n              current = a   # because after completing the task, we are at a.\n\n          print(total_time)\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n          Step1: current=1, a=3 -> d = (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2; total_time=2, current becomes 3.\n          Step2: current=3, a=2 -> d=(2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3; total_time=2+3=5, current becomes 2.\n          Step3: current=2, a=3 -> d=(3-2)%4=1%4=1; total_time=5+1=6.\n\n          Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n        Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n          Step1: current=1, a=2 -> d=(2-1)%4=1; total_time=1, current=2.\n          Step2: current=2, a=3 -> d=(3-2)%4=1; total_time=2, current=3.\n          Step3: current=3, a=3 -> d=0; total_time=2.\n\n          Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n        However, wait: the example output is 2. But let's simulate:\n\n          Start at 1.\n          First task: go to 2 -> 1 step (from 1 to 2).\n          Second task: go to 3 -> from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n          Third task: stay at 3.\n\n          Total steps: 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", so the tasks are [2,3,3]. The example output is 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input in the problem is:\n\n          Input: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n          Output:\n            ['6', '2']\n\n        So our code produces the expected outputs.\n\n        However, wait: why in the first example we got 6? \n          Start at 1.\n          Task1: 1->3: 2 steps (because 1->2->3, two steps) -> time=2\n          Then from 3 to 2: 3->4->1->2: 3 steps -> time=5\n          Then from 2 to 3: 2->3: 1 step -> time=6.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\"\n\n        That sequence has 6 moves. Each arrow is one step, so 6 steps.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, what about the modulus operation: is it safe for very large n (up to 10^5) and m (up to 10^5)? \n\n        The modulus operation is O(1) per operation, so overall O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation might be slightly slower than a conditional, but for 10^5 operations, it's negligible.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers: (a - current) % n, when a < current, we are effectively computing (a - current + n) % n. However, note that (a - current) might be negative and large in absolute value? \n\n        But note: a and current are in [1, n], so the difference (a - current) is in the range [-(n-1), n-1]. So adding n once is sufficient, and the modulus operation in Python for such small range is efficient.\n\n        However, there's an alternative: we can avoid modulus by checking if a >= current, then d = a - current, else d = a - current + n.\n\n        Which is faster? Probably the conditionals are faster for integers, but again, 10^5 operations, and the modulus operation is also very fast.\n\n        Let me compare:\n\n          Option 1: using modulus\n          Option 2: using if\n\n        We can write:\n\n          if a >= current:\n              d = a - current\n          else:\n              d = a - current + n\n\n        Then update.\n\n        This avoids the modulus operation. Let's test with the examples.\n\n        Example1: [3,2,3] for n=4\n          current=1, a=3 -> 3>=1 -> d=2\n          current=3, a=2 -> 2<3 -> d=2-3+4=3\n          current=2, a=3 -> 3>=2 -> d=1\n          total_time=2+3+1=6\n\n        Example2: [2,3,3] for n=4\n          current=1, a=2 -> 2>=1 -> d=1\n          current=2, a=3 -> 3>=2 -> d=1\n          current=3, a=3 -> 3>=3 -> d=0\n          total_time=2\n\n        Same results.\n\n        Which one to choose? Both are correct.\n\n        Since the problem constraints are up to 10^5, and we are doing 10^5 iterations, we should choose the faster one.\n\n        In Python, modulus might be implemented in C and be fast, but conditionals are also fast. However, modulus for negative numbers might involve some overhead.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python: it computes the remainder, which is defined as:\n\n          a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)\n\n        For negative a, floor(a/b) rounds towards -infinity.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the conditional to avoid modulus for negative.\n\n        However, I think the problem is small enough (10^5) that we can use either. But for clarity, the conditional version is more explicit.\n\n        Let's use the conditional version.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          current = 1\n          total_time = 0\n\n          for a in tasks:\n              if a >= current:\n                  d = a - current\n              else:\n                  d = a - current + n\n              total_time += d\n              current = a\n\n          print(total_time)\n\n        Let's run the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: [3,2,3] -> 2 + 3 + 1 = 6\n        Example2: [2,3,3] -> 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\n\n        It works.\n\n        But wait, what if the tasks are not in increasing or decreasing order? \n\n        Example: n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1]\n\n          Start at 1.\n          Task1: 5 -> 5>=1 -> d=4, total_time=4, current=5.\n          Task2: 4 -> 4<5 -> d=4-5+5=4, total_time=8, current=4.\n          Task3: 3 -> 3<4 -> d=3-4+5=4, total_time=12, current=3.\n          Task4: 2 -> 2<3 -> d=2-3+5=4, total_time=16, current=2.\n          Task5: 1 -> 1<2 -> d=1-2+5=4, total_time=20.\n\n        Now, let's simulate manually:\n\n          Start at 1.\n          Go from 1 to 5: 1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps.\n          Then from 5 to 4: 5->1->2->3->4: 4 steps (because from 5, next is 1, then 2, then 3, then 4: 4 steps).\n          Then from 4 to 3: 4->5->1->2->3: 4 steps.\n          Then from 3 to 2: 3->4->5->1->2: 4 steps.\n          Then from 2 to 1: 2->3->4->5->1: 4 steps.\n\n          Total: 4*5 = 20. Correct.\n\n        Another example: n=5, tasks=[1,2,3,4,5]\n\n          Start at 1.\n          Task1: 1>=1 -> d=0, current=1.\n          Task2: 2>=1 -> d=1, current=2.\n          Task3: 3>=2 -> d=1, current=3.\n          Task4: 4>=3 -> d=1, current=4.\n          Task5: 5>=4 -> d=1, current=5.\n\n          Total_time=0+1+1+1+1=4.\n\n        Manually: \n          Start at 1 (already at 1 for task1).\n          Then go from 1 to 2: 1 step.\n          Then from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n          Then from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n          Then from 4 to 5: 1 step.\n\n        Total 4 steps. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that initially she is at house 1, and then the tasks are given. The first task might be house 1, so we don't move.\n\n        We'll submit the conditional version.\n\n        But wait, the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, so we must be efficient.\n\n        The algorithm is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        One more edge: n=2, m=1, task=[1]\n\n          current=1, a=1 -> d=0, total_time=0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        n=2, m=1, task=[2]\n\n          d = 2-1=1, total_time=1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n\n          Step1: current=1, a=2 -> d=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n          Step2: current=2, a=1 -> d=1-2+2=1, total_time=2.\n\n        Correct: from 1 to 2: 1 step, then from 2 to 1: 1 step (2->1 is one step in the clockwise direction? Wait, the ring has two houses: 1 and 2. From 2, the next is 1 (since it's a ring). So one step.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad of houses. The ringroad is one-way and clockwise, so Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction. The key is to calculate the shortest path from her current position to each subsequent task location, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1 (the initial position).\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task location, compute the distance from the current position to the task location. Since the ringroad is circular, the distance is calculated differently based on whether the task location is ahead or behind the current position:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between the task location and the current position.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, the distance is the sum of the remaining houses from the current position to the end of the ringroad plus the houses from the start to the task location.\n3. **Accumulate time**: Add the computed distance to the total time for each task.\n4. **Update current position**: After processing each task, update the current position to the task location for the next iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    if a >= current:\n        d = a - current\n    else:\n        d = a - current + n\n    total_time += d\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The variables `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks) are read from the input. The list `tasks` contains the sequence of house numbers where Xenia needs to perform her tasks.\n- **Loop through tasks**: For each task location `a`:\n  - **Distance Calculation**: If `a` is ahead of the current position (`a >= current`), the distance is straightforward (`a - current`). Otherwise, the distance wraps around the ring (`a - current + n`).\n  - **Time Accumulation**: The computed distance is added to `total_time`.\n  - **Position Update**: The current position is updated to the task location `a` for the next iteration.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated `total_time` is printed, representing the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the ringroad by dynamically adjusting the distance calculation based on the relative positions of the current and target houses, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
