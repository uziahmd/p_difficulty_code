After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns (each row is a student, each column is a subject).\n 3. For each subject (column), we can find the maximum mark (as a character, but we'll convert to int for comparison? or keep as char since '9' > '1').\n    However, note: the problem says best at a subject if there's no higher mark. Since the marks are from '1' to '9', we can compare by their character value (but note: '1' < '2' ... < '9').\n\n 4. For each student (row), we need to check if there exists at least one subject (column) in which he is the best.\n\n 5. But note: being the best means that in that subject, his mark is the highest (i.e., equal to the maximum in that subject). However, note that if multiple students have the same highest mark, then they are all considered best for that subject.\n\n 6. Therefore, for each subject j, let max_j = maximum mark in column j (converted to integer or just compare as char? Actually, comparing characters is the same as integers for digits '1'..'9' because '1'<'2'<...<'9'. But we can do it with integers for clarity.\n\n However, note: the input gives characters. We can either convert to int or not. Since the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, we can do:\n\n Let's create a list for each subject (column) of the marks (as integers) OR we can work with the original strings.\n\n Approach:\n   - We can precompute for each column j the maximum mark (as integer) and then also record which students achieved that maximum (if multiple, then they are all best).\n\n But note: we don't actually need to know which students are best per subject, we only need to know for each student if they have at least one subject where they are best.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   For each student i, we want to know if there exists at least one subject j such that:\n        grade[i][j] == max_grade[j]\n\n However, we need the maximum for each subject.\n\n Steps:\n   Step 1: Parse the input.\n   Step 2: Create a list `max_marks` of length m (for each subject) that holds the maximum mark (as integer) for that subject.\n   Step 3: Alternatively, we can create a list `best_in_subject` for each subject: which indices (students) have the mark equal to the maximum.\n\n   But wait, we don't need to store which students are best for each subject. We can do:\n\n   For each subject j, compute the maximum mark (say max_j). Then for each student i, check for any subject j: grid[i][j] == max_j (as integer? but note: we have characters)\n\n   However, we can convert the entire grid to integers? Or we can do without conversion by comparing the characters (since '1' to '9' are in increasing order). But note: if we use characters, then we have to compare the character version of the mark.\n\n   Since the input is given as strings, we can do:\n\n   Let grid be a list of strings (each string is a row, each character is a mark).\n\n   Then for subject j, we can compute the maximum character in that column, but note: '9' is the highest. However, if we convert to int, we can also do.\n\n   Let me choose: we can convert each character to an integer for easier comparison.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid conversion and use the fact that the character comparison for digits is the same as integer comparison.\n\n   Example: \n        Compare '2' and '3': '3' > '2'\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        max_char = max(column)   # for a column, which is a list of characters\n\n   Then for a student in that subject, we check if the character equals max_char.\n\n   However, note: the maximum character in the column is the highest mark.\n\n   But: what if we have two different subjects with the same maximum mark? Then we are comparing by the same condition.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read n and m.\n\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n\n   Then, for each column j (0 to m-1), we can extract the j-th character from each row.\n\n   Then, for each column j, compute max_col = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\n   Now, for each student i, we check for any column j: grid[i][",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read each student's marks as strings.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check for Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the highest mark for that subject. If so, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [int(grid[i][j]) for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks[j] = max(col)\n    \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if int(grid[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The first line of input is read to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines are read as strings representing each student's marks.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code checks all student marks to find the highest mark. This is stored in the `max_marks` array.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks each subject to see if their mark matches the highest mark for that subject. If found, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result.",
