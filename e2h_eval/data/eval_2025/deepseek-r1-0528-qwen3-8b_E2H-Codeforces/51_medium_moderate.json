Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings combined, and nothing extra.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings and count the frequency of each letter.\n 3. Count the frequency of each letter in the third string.\n 4. Compare the two frequency counts. If they match exactly, then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile might have been shuffled, so we just need to check if the multiset (count) of the pile is exactly the multiset of the two names.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"SANTACLAUS\", \"DEDMOROZ\", \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> but note that the example output is YES because the pile \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has the same letters.\n\n But wait: let's break down the example:\n\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Combined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Actually, note that the example input is given as a single string with spaces and backslashes? \n   The example input format is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But the actual input will be three separate lines.\n\n   So, we should read:\n\n        guest_name = input().strip()\n        host_name = input().strip()\n        pile_letters = input().strip()\n\n   Then, the combined string is guest_name + host_name.\n\n   Then, we can use collections.Counter to count the letters.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        Input: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But actually, the example input has three lines. So we read three lines.\n\n   Let me clarify with the first sample:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, combine Line1 and Line2: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Count for Line1+Line2:\n        S: 4, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n   Now, Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Let's break it down: \n        S: 4, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, M: 1, O: 2, R: 1, Z: 1, D: 2, E: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1\n\n   Wait, there's an extra 'O' in the pile? And missing one 'C'? Actually, let's recount:\n\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n        S: appears in \"SANTA\" (2 times already?) -> let me count manually:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: \n            S: 2 (because Santa has two S's? Actually: Santa: S, a, n, t, a, C, l, a, u, s -> wait, let's write:\n\n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\": \n            S: 2? Actually: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> so two S's and three A's.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n            S: 2 (first and last)\n            A: 3 (positions 2,5,8)\n            N: 1\n            T: 1\n            C: 1\n            L: 1\n            U: 1\n\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\":\n            D: 2 (D and D)\n            E: 1\n            M: 1\n            O: 1\n            R: 1\n            Z: 1\n\n        Combined: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Now, pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            S: appears at least twice: first and last? \n            Let's list: \n                S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n            Counting:\n                S: 2 (at the beginning and the end)\n                A: 3 (positions 2,5,16)\n                N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        So we see: \n            Combined: S:2, A:3, O:1\n            Pile:    S:2, A:3, O:2\n\n        There's an extra 'O' in the pile and missing one 'A'? Actually, no: wait, the combined string has 3 A's and the pile has 3 A's.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n        Let me check the example again: \n            The example input is given as: \n                ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n        Actually, the example input is provided as a string with three lines. The example output is \"YES\".\n\n        Let me reexamine: \n\n            Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> length 10, Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> length 8, total 18 letters.\n            Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> let's count: \n                S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> that's 18 letters.\n\n            Now, the combined guest and host is 18 letters. \n\n            But the counts don't match: \n                In guest: \"SANTACLAUS\": \n                    S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n                Host: \"DEDMOROZ\": \n                    D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n            Combined: \n                S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n            Pile: \n                S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n            So the pile has an extra 'O' and is missing... wait, the combined doesn't have two O's? \n\n            Wait, the host has one O, and the guest has no O? \n                Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> no O.\n                Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> one O.\n\n            So the combined should have one O.\n\n            But the pile has two O's.\n\n            So why is the example output \"YES\"?\n\n        Let me read the example again: \n            Input: \n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n            Wait, the host name is \"DEDMOROZ\", which indeed has one 'O'. \n\n            But the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me write it out:\n\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: \n                S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n            That's 18 letters.\n\n            Now, the expected combined letters: \n                Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> 10 letters.\n                Host: DEDMOROZ -> D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> wait, wait, actually the host is \"DEDMOROZ\", which is 8 letters: D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> that's two O's?\n\n            Actually, the host name \"DEDMOROZ\": \n                D E D M O R O Z -> indeed two O's.\n\n            Correction: \n                Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" has two O's? Let me count: \n                    D E D M O R O Z -> positions: 5th and 7th are O.\n\n            So the host has two O's.\n\n            Then the combined: \n                Guest: SANTACLAUS -> no O.\n                Host: DEDMOROZ -> two O's.\n\n            So combined: two O's.\n\n            Now the pile: two O's.\n\n            Let me recount the combined:\n\n                Guest: SANTACLAUS -> \n                    S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n                Host: DEDMOROZ ->\n                    D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n                Combined: \n                    S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n            Now pile: \n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n                    S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n            They match.\n\n        So the issue was: the host had two O's.\n\n        Therefore, the method is to count the letters in the combined string (guest + host) and compare with the letter counts in the pile.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            guest = input().strip()\n            host = input().strip()\n            pile = input().strip()\n\n            total_letters = guest + host\n            counter_total = Counter(total_letters)\n            counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n            if counter_total == counter_pile:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            This should be YES.\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \n                PAPAINOEL\n                JOULUPUKKI\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n            According to the example output: NO.\n\n            Let's break down example 2:\n\n            Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n\n            Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n            Count the letters in the combined.\n\n            Now, pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            We'll compare the two.\n\n            Alternatively, we can also check the lengths: \n                len(guest) + len(host) = 9 + 11 = 20.\n                len(pile) = 20.\n\n            But the example says NO because there's an extra letter \"L\" and missing a \"P\".\n\n            Actually, the example says: \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n            So we can rely on the Counter.\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: \n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Output: NO.\n\n            Why? There's an extra 'L'.\n\n            Let's check the lengths:\n                Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> 11\n                Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> 14\n                Combined: 25 letters.\n\n                Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> let's count: \n                    BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> 26? \n\n            Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n                ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n            But note: the example output is NO because of an extra letter.\n\n            The pile has 26 letters? But wait, the example says there's an extra letter 'L'. \n\n            Actually, the example input string is: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me count: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Without counting manually, we can trust the Counter method.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            data = []\n            for _ in range(3):\n                s = input().strip()\n                data.append(s)\n\n            # But the first two are the names, the third is the pile.\n            guest = data[0]\n            host = data[1]\n            pile = data[2]\n\n            total_letters = guest + host\n            if len(total_letters) != len(pile):\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                # Use Counter to compare\n                if Counter(total_letters) == Counter(pile):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the total_letters might be up to 200, which is acceptable for Counter.\n\n        But what if there are no letters? The problem says each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters, so we don't have to worry about empty strings.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire Counter if the length is different.\n\n        Let me run the example 2 with the code:\n\n            guest = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            host = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n            pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            total_letters = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n            Counter(total_letters): \n                P: 3 (from \"PAPA\" and then one more in host? Actually: \n                    PAPAINOEL: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n                    JOULUPUKKI: J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1\n                    Combined: P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n            Counter(pile) = Counter(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\")\n                J:1, O:3, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            They don't match.\n\n        Example 3:\n\n            guest = \"BABBONATALE\"\n            host = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            total_letters = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n            Count the letters in total_letters and pile.\n\n            Since the example says there's an extra 'L', the pile has one more 'L' than the combined.\n\n            Actually, let me count the 'L' in the combined:\n\n            Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> \n                B:2, A:2, B: already counted, O:1, N:1, T:1, A: already, L:1, E:1\n\n            Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> \n                F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1, S:1 -> no L.\n\n            So combined has L:1.\n\n            Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> \n                ... and we see \"ALLE\" -> so two L's.\n\n            Therefore, the pile has two L's and the combined has one.\n\n            So the Counter would show:\n\n            total_letters: L:1\n            pile: L:2 -> not equal.\n\n        Therefore, the code should work.\n\n        However, we can also do without importing Counter by using dictionaries or by sorting the strings, but Counter is efficient and clear.\n\n        Since the constraints are small (max 100 per line, so total 200), we can safely use Counter.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Note: The problem reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n        Example input format:\n\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        We assume the input is given via standard input.\n\n        Code:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            def main():\n                guest = input().strip()\n                host = input().strip()\n                pile = input().strip()\n\n                total_str = guest + host\n                if len(total_str) != len(pile):\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n                if Counter(total_str) == Counter(pile):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n            if __name__ == '__main__':\n                main()\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: YES -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: NO -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: NO -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input provided in the problem statement is given as a list of three strings, but our code reads three lines.\n\n        One more edge case: what if the pile has the exact same letters but in different order? The Counter doesn't care about order.\n\n        This meets the requirement.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is given as a list of three strings, but we are reading three lines.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        Let me run the code with the provided example inputs.\n\n        Example 1:\n\n            Input:\n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n            Output: YES\n\n        Example 2:\n\n            Input:\n                PAPAINOEL\n                JOULUPUKKI\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n            Output: NO\n\n        Example 3:\n\n            Input:\n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Output: NO\n\n        All correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example input in the problem statement is provided as:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        But this is just a representation. When we run the program, we must input three lines.\n\n        So, we are reading three lines.\n\n        I think we are set.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we can rely on three lines.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset (count) of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters from the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines of input are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: If the length of the combined names does not match the length of the pile, immediately output \"NO\" since there must be no extra or missing letters.\n4. **Count Letters**: Use a counter to compare the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile. If the counts match exactly, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    total_letters = guest + host\n    if len(total_letters) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if Counter(total_letters) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines from standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`total_letters`).\n3. **Length Check**: The code checks if the length of `total_letters` matches the length of the pile. If not, it prints \"NO\" because the pile either has extra or missing letters.\n4. **Letter Count Comparison**: Using the `Counter` from the `collections` module, the code counts the occurrences of each letter in both `total_letters` and the pile. If the counts match exactly, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\". This ensures that the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names without any extra or missing letters.",
