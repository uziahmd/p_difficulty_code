For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. The notes are in a circular list of 12 notes.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) for easier calculation of distances.\n    The 12 notes: \n        ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] \n    But wait, the problem says: \"after H goes C\", and the example includes 'H'? Actually, the example input has 'A B H'. However, note that the example also uses 'C# B F'. \n\n    Let's map:\n        C -> 0\n        C# -> 1\n        D -> 2\n        D# -> 3\n        E -> 4\n        F -> 5\n        F# -> 6\n        G -> 7\n        G# -> 8\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11   ? But wait, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" meaning that from E (4) to C (0) is 8? Actually, since the circle is 12, then from E to C: \n            E(4) -> F(5) -> F#(6) -> G(7) -> G#(8) -> A(9) -> B(10) -> H(11) -> C(0): that's 8 steps (each step is 1 semitone). So the mapping for H is 11.\n\n    However, note: the example input has 'A B H' and the expected output is 'strange'. We need to be cautious.\n\n 2. Given three notes, we can consider all cyclic orders? Actually, the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to order the notes arbitrarily (in the musical scale). So we have to consider the circular arrangement.\n\n 3. Since the circle has 12 notes, we can represent the three notes as three numbers in [0,11]. Then we can compute the distances (in semitones) between consecutive notes in the circle.\n\n 4. We can try all 3! = 6 permutations? But note: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" (then major). Similarly for minor.\n\n However, we can also think: in a triad, the intervals must add up to 7 semitones (from X to Z via Y) and the entire circle is 12. But we can also consider the gaps.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   Since we have three distinct notes (assuming no duplicates? The problem doesn't say, but typically chords have distinct notes), we can arrange the three notes in increasing order (modulo the circle). But because it's circular, we have to break the circle.\n\n Idea: \n   Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers). We can arrange them in a circular way, but we can fix one note and then look at the two others.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify the starting note. We are allowed to reorder arbitrarily.\n\n Steps:\n   a) Map the input string to three numbers (mod 12).\n   b) We have three distinct numbers? If there are duplicates, then it's not a valid triad (needs exactly three notes). But the problem says \"exactly three notes\", so we assume distinct.\n\n   c) We can generate all cyclic shifts and then check the two possibilities for the ordering? Actually, we can consider the three possible starting points and then two directions? Alternatively, we can consider the three gaps between the three notes (in the circle). The three gaps must sum to 12.\n\n   d) For a major chord: the intervals (when ordered properly) must be 4 and 3 (so total 7). But wait, the condition is: \n        Option 1: X to Y: 4, Y to Z: 3 -> then X to Z: 7 (which is the same as skipping 5 notes? Actually, the circle is 12, so from X to Z via the other direction would be 12-7=5, but we don't care about the opposite direction because we are only going from low to high? \n\n   But note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. However, when the chord wraps around, we have to consider the circle.\n\n   Example: \"C E G\": \n        C:0, E:4, G:7 -> \n        Order: [0,4,7]\n        Then: from 0 to 4: 4 semitones, 4 to 7: 3 semitones -> major.\n\n   Example: \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n        We need to order them. The example says: order as \"B C# F\", so [10,1,5] (but then we have to consider the circle). Alternatively, we can map them to the circle and then take the circular order.\n\n   How to handle circular ordering?\n        We can sort the three numbers and then consider the circle: the gaps are:\n          gap1 = (b - a) % 12, but if we do modulo, we might get negative. Alternatively, we can break the circle by duplicating the list.\n\n   Another idea: \n        Since the chord is unordered, we can consider the three possible intervals (without worrying about direction) and see if they form a major or minor.\n\n   Conditions for major:\n        There exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n            (b - a) % 12 = 4   and (c - b) % 12 = 3   OR\n            (b - a) % 12 = 3   and (c - b) % 12 = 4   -> this is minor.\n\n        But note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So if we have a chord that wraps around, we must account for that.\n\n   However, we can also consider: the three gaps (distances) between the notes (in the circle) must be such that one gap is 4 and the next is 3 (with the third being 5, because 4+3+5=12) OR one gap is 3 and the next is 4 (and the third is 5). \n\n   But wait, the circle has 12. The three gaps should sum to 12. And the condition for a major chord is that the two smallest gaps (or the consecutive ones) must be 3 and 4? Actually, no: the condition is on consecutive intervals in the ordering.\n\n   Let me clarify: \n        In the example \"C# B F\": \n            Notes: B (10), C# (1), F (5). \n            Now, if we arrange them in increasing order (on the circle) we have to break the circle. We can fix the note with the smallest value and then go forward. But note: the circle is cyclic.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Convert the three notes to numbers.\n        Step 2: Sort the numbers, then the circle can be broken at the point where the gap from the last to the first (wrapping) is considered, but we can also consider the gaps without wrapping by duplicating the sorted array.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the three gaps (without direction) and then check if the three gaps are {3,4,5} (because 3+4+5=12). Then, for major we require that the two consecutive gaps (in the circle) that are 3 and 4 (in that order) OR 4 and 3 (for minor) are adjacent?\n\n        But note: the condition is about consecutive notes in the ordering that we choose. \n\n        However, let's define the gaps in the circle from the three notes. We can have three gaps: \n            g1 = (b - a) % 12, but if we break the circle arbitrarily, we can consider the three arcs.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers). We can consider the sorted list: [x, y, z] (ascending). Then the gaps are:\n            gap1 = y - x\n            gap2 = z - y\n            gap3 = (x + 12) - z   (to complete the circle)\n\n        Then the entire set of gaps is [gap1, gap2, gap3] and they must sum to 12.\n\n        Now, for a major chord, we require that when we traverse the circle (starting from the root) we get 4 and then 3. But the root can be any note? \n\n        Actually, the condition for a major chord is that there exists a root such that the next note is 4 semitones above, and then the next is 3 semitones above from the second. \n\n        This means that the gaps (if we start at the root) must be 4 and 3. But note: the entire chord must be contained in the 12-note circle.\n\n        However, the example \"C E G\": gaps from C (0) to E (4) is 4, then E to G is 3, and then from G back to C: 5 (because 12 - (4+3)=5). \n\n        Similarly, for minor: from root to second: 3, then second to third: 4.\n\n        So the gaps in the circle for a major chord must be 4, 3, and 5 (in some order). Similarly, for minor: 3,4,5.\n\n        But wait: both major and minor have the same set of gaps: {3,4,5}. Then how to distinguish?\n\n        The problem says: \n          Major: distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3.\n          Minor: distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\n        So the ordering matters. Therefore, we must know which note is the root (X).\n\n        Approach:\n\n        We have three notes. We can consider each note as the root (X) and then check the two following notes (Y and Z) to see if they form the required intervals.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let the three notes (as numbers) be a, b, c.\n\n        For each permutation (x, y, z) of (a, b, c):\n\n            We want to check if in the circle, moving from x to y is 4 semitones and from y to z is 3 semitones (then major) OR from x to y is 3 and from y to z is 4 (then minor).\n\n        But note: the distances are computed in the circle. How to compute the distance from x to y? It's (y - x) % 12, but if negative, we adjust.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n        But wait, the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. However, if we have a chord that wraps around, then the direct distance might be the short way or the long way. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning that we take the upward path from E to C? But wait, in a circle, from E to C there are two ways: \n            Forward: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: 8 semitones (if we go up)\n            Backward: E->D->C: but that's 2 semitones? But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n        However, in a chord, when we order the notes, we are effectively considering the entire circle and the chord is a set. The ordering must be such that the notes are in increasing order (from the root to the next, and then the next) without wrapping? Or with wrapping?\n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the direction. But note: the example \"C E G\": \n            C to E: 4 (which is less than 12/2, so the upward direction is taken). \n            But what if we have a chord that requires wrapping? \n\n        Let me re-read: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n        This implies that we are only concerned with the positive direction (i.e., the upward direction). But then if we have two notes, say E and C, then the distance from E to C upward is 8 (because we go from E to F to ... to C). \n\n        However, in the definition of the chord, we are allowed to choose any ordering. So we can choose the ordering that makes the distances as defined.\n\n        So, for a given root x, the next note y must be at least 3 semitones away (so that we can have either 3 or 4) and then the next note z must be at least 3 more (so 3+4=7). \n\n        But wait, the entire chord must fit in the circle? \n\n        Actually, the condition for a major chord is that there exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n            (y - x) mod 12 = 4   OR   (y - x) mod 12 = 8 (if we go the other way, but wait: the problem says the distance is from the lowest to the highest, so if we have a chord that wraps, then we cannot use the negative direction? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n            The problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". So if we have a chord that has notes E and C, then the distance from E to C is 8 (if we are going from E to C and we take the upward path, even though C is lower in pitch? Actually, the musical scale is cyclic, but the distance is defined as the upward distance. \n\n        However, in a chord, the notes are not necessarily in ascending order. We are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. \n\n        So we can consider two directions for each interval? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the direction of the distance. But note: the example \"C E G\" has C as the root, then E is above C (so upward) and then G is above E (upward). \n\n        So the distances must be the upward distances (the minimal upward distance? No, because 8 is not minimal: from E to C upward is 8, but downward is 4. But the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are going from a lower note to a higher note. \n\n        However, if we have a chord that wraps, then we might have to consider the entire circle. \n\n        Example: Consider the chord \"C E Bb\". Wait, let me not complicate. \n\n        But note: the example input is given as three distinct notes. \n\n        Let's stick to the condition:\n\n        We are to check for an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n            Condition for major: \n                (distance from x to y) = 4 (meaning y is 4 semitones above x, but if y is below x in the linear scale, then we can't use that? Actually, the problem allows circular ordering, so we can consider the circle. \n\n        But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are going from a lower note to a higher note. In the circle, we can consider two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. \n\n        However, the definition of the chord ordering does not require the entire chord to be in one octave. \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" So we are working modulo 12.\n\n        And the distance from x to y is defined as the minimal upward distance? Or the entire upward distance until we hit the next occurrence? \n\n        But the example: distance from E to C is 8. That is the entire upward distance (from E to the next C). \n\n        So the distance from x to y is defined as (y - x) mod 12, but if negative, we add 12. However, wait: from E(4) to C(0): (0-4) mod 12 = -4 mod 12 = 8 (if we take modulo 12 and adjust to positive). \n\n        So we can compute the distance from x to y as (y - x) % 12, but if negative, we do (y - x + 12) % 12. Alternatively, we can use modulo arithmetic: \n            distance = (y - x) % 12\n            if distance < 0: distance += 12\n\n        But note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the uppest, meaning we are always going forward (clockwise). \n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance from x to y as (y - x) % 12, but if the result is negative, we add 12 to get the positive equivalent. \n\n        However, in modulo arithmetic, we can do:\n\n            dist = (y - x) % 12\n            if dist < 0: dist += 12\n\n        But note: the condition for the chord is that the distances are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        Example: \"C# B F\": \n            Notes: B (10), C# (1), F (5)\n\n        Let me try to order them as the example: B, C#, F.\n\n            From B to C#: (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9 -> then +12 -> 3. \n            From C# to F: (5 - 1) % 12 = 4.\n\n            So the distances are 3 and 4 -> minor.\n\n        Now, we must check all permutations? There are 6 permutations.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Map the input notes to numbers (0-11).\n        2. Generate all 6 permutations of these three numbers.\n        3. For each permutation (x,y,z):\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            if d1 < 0: d1 += 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n            if d2 < 0: d2 += 12\n\n            Then, check:\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3: then it's major.\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4: then it's minor.\n\n        But wait, is that sufficient? \n\n        Example: \"C E G\": \n            Permutation (0,4,7): \n                d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4 -> no adjustment, then d2 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> major -> correct.\n\n        Example: \"C E Gb\": \n            But wait, Gb is enharmonic to F#? Actually, the problem doesn't have enharmonic equivalents. But our mapping is fixed: \n                G is 7, and F# is 6. \n\n        However, the input will only use the given 12 notes. \n\n        But note: the example input is given as three distinct notes. \n\n        But what if the chord is given with two same notes? The problem says \"exactly three notes\", so we assume distinct.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the condition does not require the entire chord to be within one octave? \n\n        Example: \"C E G\" is major. But what about \"C E G'\" (same as C E G but G an octave higher)? Then the numbers would be [0,4,19] -> but wait, we are working modulo 12. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" So the notes are repeated every 12. \n\n        So if we have a note that is an octave higher, we map it to the same number. \n\n        Therefore, the input will not have duplicate numbers (because the same note name is used, and the same note name always maps to the same number). \n\n        However, wait: the example input has \"C# B F\", and the note B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. \n\n        But note: the example input may give the same note twice? The problem says \"exactly three notes\", so no duplicates.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"unordered set\", so no duplicates.\n\n        However, we must consider: the distances are computed modulo 12. \n\n        But what if the chord has notes that are more than one octave apart? \n\n        Example: C, E, G (octave above G). Then the numbers would be [0,4,7+12=19]. Then modulo 12: [0,4,7]. \n\n        So we reduce all notes modulo 12. \n\n        Therefore, we can map each note to a number in [0,11] and then proceed.\n\n        But wait: the input note names are fixed. We are given the note names from the list. \n\n        Steps for mapping:\n\n        note_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n        Then, for a given note string, split the input and then map each token to the index in note_list.\n\n        Example: \"C# B F\" -> tokens: ['C#', 'B', 'F'] -> [1, 10, 5]\n\n        However, the problem says the input is one line with three space-separated notes.\n\n        But note: the example input: \n            Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] -> actually, the example input format is one string per test case? The problem says: \"The only line contains 3 space-separated notes\".\n\n        So we can read the line and split.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as a list of strings, but in the actual input, it's one line.\n\n        Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if len(data) != 3:\n            # but the problem says three, so we assume three\n            pass\n\n        Then, create a mapping dictionary or list for the 12 notes.\n\n        However, note: the note_list: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n        But wait: the note_list has 12 elements, and the note names are as given.\n\n        But wait: the example input has 'H'. Is H included? Yes.\n\n        But note: the note_list: the last element is 'H'. \n\n        However, the example input also has 'B'. \n\n        But wait: the note_list has two different accidentals: '#' and 'b'? Actually, no, the note_list is given with sharps only, and then 'B' and 'H' at the end. \n\n        The problem says: the 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n        So the mapping is:\n\n        'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"A B H\": \n            A:9, B:10, H:11 -> [9,10,11]\n\n        Then, we check the permutations:\n\n        Permutation (9,10,11):\n            d1 = (10-9)%12 = 1 -> then adjust: 1, then d2 = (11-10)%12=1 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        Permutation (9,11,10): \n            d1 = (11-9)%12=2, then d2=(10-11)%12 = -1 -> 11 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        Permutation (10,9,11): \n            d1=(9-10)%12=-1 -> 11, d2=(11-9)%12=2 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        Permutation (10,11,9): \n            d1=(11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)%12=-2 -> 10 -> not.\n\n        Permutation (11,9,10): \n            d1=(9-11)%12=-2 -> 10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> not.\n\n        Permutation (11,10,9): \n            d1=(10-11)%12=-1 ->11, d2=(9-10)%12=-1->11 -> not.\n\n        So it returns 'strange'. \n\n        But wait, is \"A B H\" a known chord? According to the problem, it's strange.\n\n        However, let me check: \n            A B H: \n            A to B: 2 semitones (since A->A#->B, but wait, we don't have A#? Actually, the note_list has A#? No, the note_list has A, then B, then H. So the distance from A to B: \n                In our mapping: A=9, B=10 -> (10-9)=1 semitone. \n            Similarly, B to H: (11-10)=1 semitone.\n\n            And the third gap from H to A: (9-11)%12 = (9-11+12)=10 semitones.\n\n            The gaps are 1,1,10. \n\n        So it's not a major or minor.\n\n        So the method is: for each permutation, compute the two distances (from x to y and y to z) in the circle (using modulo 12 and adjusting negatives) and check if they are (4,3) or (3,4).\n\n        However, note: the condition for the chord requires that the entire set of three notes forms the triad. But the condition is that the two consecutive distances (in the chosen ordering) are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        But note: the third distance (from z to x) is not used. \n\n        However, we must ensure that the entire chord is accounted for. But the condition is defined solely on the two consecutive distances.\n\n        But wait, what if we have a permutation that gives (4,3) but the third note is not the next in the circle? Actually, the chord is defined by the set of three notes. The condition is that there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3 (then the entire chord spans 7 semitones, and the remaining gap is 5). \n\n        Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n        However, we must note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous (no chord is both major and minor). \n\n        But what if we find one permutation that is major and another that is minor? Then we would have to decide? \n\n        Example: is there a chord that is both? \n\n        Let me check: \n            Condition for major: (4,3)\n            Condition for minor: (3,4)\n\n        They are different.\n\n        But note: the entire set of gaps must be {3,4,5}. \n\n        Actually, the gaps for a major chord: 4,3,5 (because 4+3+5=12) and for minor: 3,4,5. So the set of gaps is the same. \n\n        However, the ordering matters. \n\n        But the problem says: \"there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously\". \n\n        So we can break once we find a major or a minor.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        1. Map the three notes to numbers (0-11).\n        2. Generate all 6 permutations of these three numbers.\n        3. For each permutation (x,y,z):\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            if d1 < 0: d1 += 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n            if d2 < 0: d2 += 12\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                print(\"major\")\n                exit or break\n            elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                print(\"minor\")\n                exit or break\n\n        4. If none of the permutations satisfy, then print \"strange\"\n\n        But wait: is that efficient? Only 6 permutations, so yes.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, and we are generating all orders. \n\n        But note: the condition requires an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distances are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). \n\n        But what if the chord is given as (x,y,z) and we don't check the entire circle? \n\n        Example: consider a chord that is major but the root is not the first note in the permutation? \n\n        Actually, we are checking all starting points (all six permutations). \n\n        But wait: the condition requires the two consecutive distances. The root is the first note. \n\n        However, note: the chord can be considered with any note as the root. \n\n        But the condition is defined as: \n            major: exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3.\n\n        So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        Let me test with \"C E G\": \n            [0,4,7] -> (4,3) -> major.\n\n        Test with \"C E G\" in a different order: \n            [0,7,4]: \n                d1 = (7-0)%12=7, d2=(4-7)%12=-3 -> 9 -> not.\n            [4,0,7]:\n                d1=(0-4)%12=-4 ->8, d2=(7-0)%12=7 -> not.\n            [4,7,0]:\n                d1= (7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)%12=-7+12=5 -> not.\n            [7,0,4]:\n                d1=(0-7)%12=-7+12=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> not.\n            [7,4,0]:\n                d1=(4-7)%12=-3+12=9, d2=(0-4)%12=-4+12=8 -> not.\n\n        So only the permutation [0,4,7] works.\n\n        Similarly, for minor: \"C# B F\" -> [10,1,5] (which is [10,1,5]):\n\n            Check [10,1,5]: \n                d1 = (1-10)%12 = -9 -> 3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n        Now, let's check if there's another permutation that might also satisfy minor? \n\n        The example says the ordering is \"B C# F\", which is [10,1,5] (B=10, C#=1, F=5). \n\n        But what if we consider the same set of notes in a different root? \n\n        Actually, the chord has three notes, and the root is the one that is the first in the ordering. \n\n        However, note: the chord \"C# B F\" is minor. What if we consider the same set of notes and call the root F? \n\n        Then we would need to check if from F to the next note (which would be B) is 3 and then to C# is 4? \n\n        But wait, the ordering must be the entire set. \n\n        Let me check the permutation [5,10,1]:\n            d1 = (10-5)=5, d2=(1-10)%12=-9+12=3 -> not (we need 3 and 4 for minor, but here we have 5 and 3 -> not).\n\n        [5,1,10]:\n            d1=(1-5)%12=-4+12=8, d2=(10-1)=9 -> not.\n\n        [1,5,10]:\n            d1=(5-1)=4, d2=(10-5)=5 -> not.\n\n        [1,10,5]:\n            d1=(10-1)=9, d2=(5-10)%12=-5+12=7 -> not.\n\n        [10,5,1]:\n            d1=(5-10)%12=-5+12=7, d2=(1-5)%12=-4+12=8 -> not.\n\n        So only the permutation [10,1,5] works.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        note_to_index = {\n            'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11\n        }\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if len(data) != 3:\n            # But the problem says three, so we assume three.\n            # If not, we might have to adjust, but let's assume three.\n            pass\n\n        nums = [note_to_index[note] for note in data]\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n        for perm in permutations(nums):\n            # Each perm is a tuple of three numbers: (a,b,c)\n            a, b, c = perm\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            if d1 < 0:\n                d1 += 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            if d2 < 0:\n                d2 += 12\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        if found_major:\n            print(\"major\")\n        elif found_minor:\n            print(\"minor\")\n        else:\n            print(\"strange\")\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break early if we find one? \n\n        But note: the problem says there are no chords that are both major and minor. So we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n        Revised:\n\n        for perm in permutations(nums):\n            a, b, c = perm\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            if d1 < 0: d1 += 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            if d2 < 0: d2 += 12\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                print(\"major\")\n                exit(0)   # or break and then not check the rest, but we can break the loop.\n\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                print(\"minor\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n        But wait, we must check all permutations until we find one? Actually, the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break as soon as we find a major or a minor.\n\n        However, we must be sure that the same chord isn't major and minor? The problem says no. So we can break.\n\n        But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11 based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (orderings) to explore every potential sequence that could satisfy the chord conditions.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, compute the intervals (distances) between consecutive notes in the sequence. The intervals are calculated modulo 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Determining Chord Type**: A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second interval to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second interval to be 4 semitones. If any permutation meets these conditions, the corresponding chord type is identified. If no permutation meets the conditions, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [note_to_index[note] for note in data]\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        if d1 < 0:\n            d1 += 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        if d2 < 0:\n            d2 += 12\n            \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale. For example, 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, and so on.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual note names, which are then converted to their respective numerical values using the predefined dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all possible orderings of the three input notes. For each ordering, it calculates the intervals between consecutive notes, adjusting for negative values by adding 12 (modulo operation).\n4. **Chord Identification**: The intervals are checked against the conditions for major (4 and 3 semitones) and minor (3 and 4 semitones) chords. If either condition is met, the corresponding chord type is printed, and the program exits. If no conditions are met after checking all permutations, the chord is labeled \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes.",
