A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have n friends and they want to make as many toasts as possible, with each friend making the same number of toasts.\n 2. Each toast requires:\n      - nl milliliters of drink (from k bottles of l milliliters each)\n      - 1 slice of lime (each lime is cut into d slices, and there are c limes)\n      - np grams of salt (there are p grams available)\n\n 3. The total available resources are:\n      - Drink: k * l milliliters\n      - Lime slices: c * d\n      - Salt: p grams\n\n 4. The total number of toasts that can be made is limited by the minimum of:\n      a) (total drink) / (nl per toast)   -> drink_limit = (k * l) // nl\n      b) (total lime slices)              -> lime_limit = c * d\n      c) (total salt) / (np per toast)    -> salt_limit = p // np\n\n But note: the problem says that each friend must drink the same amount. And we are to find the number of toasts per friend.\n\n However, the example does:\n      Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n      Steps in example:\n          Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (because each toast needs 3 ml) = 6.66... -> but they take integer toasts? Actually, the example uses integer division (floor) because you can't make a fraction of a toast?\n\n But note: the example says: min(6,80,100) / 3 = 2.\n\n However, wait: the example does not use the same base for the drink and salt. For drink, they did 20/3 which is 6.66..., then took floor? Actually, the example says \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". So they are using integer division (floor) for the drink and salt separately?\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so the total drink required for T total toasts (across all friends) is T * nl * ? \n\n Let's clarify:\n\n We are making T toasts in total (for the entire group). Then, since each friend makes the same number, say t, then T = n * t.\n\n Conditions:\n      T * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)   [but wait, no: because each toast requires nl, and we have T toasts, so total drink needed is T * nl]\n      Similarly, T <= c * d   (because each toast requires one slice, and we have c*d slices)\n      T * np <= p        => t <= (p / (n * np))   ? \n\n Alternatively, think: \n      Total toasts T must satisfy:\n          T <= (k * l) / nl\n          T <= (c * d)\n          T <= p / np\n\n And then, since each friend makes t toasts, T = n * t.\n\n Therefore, the maximum T is the minimum of the three limits, but then we have to divide by n? Actually, no: because T is the total number of toasts, and we require that T is divisible by n? Not necessarily, but we are making the same number per friend, so T must be a multiple of n, and we want the maximum t such that T = n*t is <= the minimum limit.\n\n However, note: we cannot exceed the resource limits. So:\n\n      Let T_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   [using integer division? But note: the drink and salt might not be divisible]\n\n But wait: the example does:\n      n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n      Drink: (4*5)=20 -> 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> if we use integer division (floor) then 20//3 = 6. But the example says 6 toasts from drink.\n\n      However, the example says: min(6,80,100) -> so they used floor for drink and salt? For salt: 100/1=100, which is integer.\n\n      But note: the condition for drink is that we need nl per toast. We have 20 ml, and each toast uses 3 ml. We can only make whole toasts. So the maximum number of toasts from drink is floor(20 / 3) = 6.\n\n      Similarly, for salt: we have 100 grams, each toast uses 1 gram. So 100 toasts.\n\n      Now, the total toasts T must be at most 6 (from drink), 80 (from limes) and 100 (from salt). So T_max = 6.\n\n      Then, since there are 3 friends, each friend can make T_max // n = 6 // 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n      However, what if T_max is not divisible by n? Then we have to take the floor of T_max/n? Or we can only use up to the multiple of n that is <= T_max.\n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast. So if we make t toasts per friend, then the total toasts is n*t.\n\n      Therefore, we must have n*t <= T_max (where T_max is the minimum of the three resource limits). So the maximum t is floor(T_max / n) ?\n\n      But wait: the example doesn't do that. They first compute the individual resource limits and then take the minimum, and then divide by n.\n\n      Actually, the example does:\n\n          drink_limit = (k*l) // nl   [which is 20//3 = 6]   -> This is the maximum total toasts from drink?\n          lime_limit  = c*d            [10*8=80]\n          salt_limit  = p // np        [100//1=100]\n\n          Then T_max = min(6,80,100) = 6.\n\n          Then t = T_max // n = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n      However, consider an alternative: maybe we should calculate the maximum toasts per person without aggregating the total? \n\n      Another way: \n          For drink: each friend requires t * nl ml. We have k*l ml. So t <= (k*l) / (n * nl)   -> but wait, that would be 20/(3*3)=20/9 ~ 2.22 -> floor to 2.\n\n      Similarly, for lime: each friend requires t * 1 slice. We have c*d slices. So t <= (c*d) / n = 80/3 ~ 26.66 -> 26? But wait, we are going to have n*t toasts, so the total slices must be at least n*t. \n\n      And for salt: t <= p / (n * np) = 100/(3*1) ~ 33.33 -> 33.\n\n      Then t_max = min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) ) -> then take floor? \n\n      But note: the example does not use this method. \n\n      Let me compare:\n\n      Method 1 (as in example):\n          T_max_drink = (k*l) // nl   -> 20//3 = 6\n          T_max_lime  = c*d            -> 80\n          T_max_salt  = p // np        -> 100\n          T_total = min(T_max_drink, T_max_lime, T_max_salt)   -> 6\n          t = T_total // n   -> 6//3=2\n\n      Method 2:\n          t_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)   -> 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n          t_lime  = (c*d) // n           -> 80//3 = 26\n          t_salt  = p // (n * np)        -> 100//3 = 33\n          t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)   -> 2\n\n      Both methods give 2.\n\n      Why? Because the conditions are linear and the total toasts T = n*t must satisfy:\n\n          n*t * nl <= k*l   -> t <= (k*l)/(n*nl)\n          n*t <= c*d        -> t <= (c*d)/n\n          n*t * np <= p     -> t <= (p)/(n*np)\n\n      So the two methods are equivalent. \n\n      However, note: the drink condition in method 2 is (k*l) // (n*nl) which is integer division. But we could have non-integer? \n\n      But we are working with integers and the problem says positive integers. However, we must use integer division (floor) because we cannot use fractions.\n\n      But wait: in the drink condition, if we use method 2: (k*l) // (n*nl) is the same as (k*l) // (n*nl). \n\n      However, note: the drink condition in method 1: (k*l)//nl gives the maximum total toasts from drink, then we divide by n (and then floor again) is the same as first dividing the total drink by (n*nl) and then flooring.\n\n      Example: \n          n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3.\n          Method 1: \n               total_drink = 20, then 20 // 3 = 6, then 6 // 3 = 2.\n          Method 2:\n               total_drink_condition = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\n      But what if the numbers are not divisible?\n\n      Example 2: Input \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n      Break down:\n          n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n      Using method 1:\n          Drink: (100*10) = 1000 ml -> 1000 / 4 = 250 toasts (so T_max_drink = 250)\n          Lime: 1 * 19 = 19 toasts (T_max_lime = 19)\n          Salt: 90 / 3 = 30 toasts (T_max_salt = 30)\n\n          Then T_total = min(250,19,30) = 19\n          Then t = 19 // 5 = 3 (because 19//5 is 3 with remainder 4)\n\n      Using method 2:\n          Drink: (1000) // (5*4) = 1000//20 = 50\n          Lime: (19) // 5 = 3 (because 19//5=3)\n          Salt: (90) // (5*3) = 90//15 = 6\n\n          Then t = min(50,3,6) = 3.\n\n      So both methods are consistent.\n\n      However, note: in method 1, when we compute T_total (the total toasts) we use integer division (floor) for drink and salt, but for lime we use exact (because it's integer). Then we divide by n (floor) to get the per-person toasts.\n\n      In method 2, we use integer division (floor) for all conditions.\n\n      Why are they the same? \n\n      Condition 1: n*t <= (k*l)//nl   [from method 1] is equivalent to t <= ((k*l)//nl) // n   [if we do floor division]? \n\n      Actually, no. They are two different ways to compute the same result. \n\n      But note: the condition for drink is that the total toasts T (which is n*t) must be at most (k*l)//nl (the maximum total toasts from drink). Then the maximum t is floor((k*l)//nl / n) = floor((k*l)/(n*nl))? Not exactly, because (k*l)//nl is the floor of (k*l)/nl, and then we divide by n and take floor.\n\n      Alternatively, we can think of the drink constraint as: n*t <= (k*l)//nl   -> but wait, no: the drink condition is that the total drink required (n*t * nl) must be <= k*l. \n\n      However, we cannot use more than k*l milliliters. So the maximum total toasts from drink is floor(k*l / nl). Then we require that n*t <= floor(k*l / nl). \n\n      Similarly, for salt: n*t * np <= p, so the maximum total toasts from salt is floor(p / np). Then n*t <= floor(p / np).\n\n      And for lime: n*t <= c*d.\n\n      Therefore, the maximum t is the minimum of:\n          t1 = floor( (k*l) / (nl * n) )   [from drink: n*t*nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l)/(nl*n)]\n          t2 = floor( (c*d) / n )           [from lime: n*t <= c*d]\n          t3 = floor( (p) / (np * n) )      [from salt: n*t*np <= p -> t <= p/(np*n)]\n\n      But wait, the drink condition is actually: n*t * nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l) / (nl * n). Since we are dealing with integers, we can use floor division.\n\n      However, note: (k*l) / (nl * n) might not be an integer, so we use floor.\n\n      But we have to be cautious: the condition for drink is that the total drink used is n*t*nl, which must be <= k*l. We can write: t <= (k*l) / (nl * n). Then the maximum integer t is floor((k*l) / (nl * n)).\n\n      Similarly for salt: t <= p / (np * n) -> floor(p / (np * n))\n\n      And for lime: t <= (c*d) / n -> floor((c*d) / n)\n\n      Then t = min( floor((k*l)/(nl*n)), floor((c*d)/n), floor(p/(np*n)) )\n\n      This matches method 2.\n\n      However, let me test with the second example:\n\n          Example 2: n=5, k=100, l=10, nl=4, np=3, c=1, d=19, p=90.\n\n          Drink: (100*10) = 1000, then 1000/(4*5)=1000/20=50 -> floor(50)=50.\n          Lime: (1*19)=19, 19/5=3.8 -> floor(3.8)=3.\n          Salt: 90/(3*5)=90/15=6 -> floor(6)=6.\n\n          Then t = min(50,3,6)=3.\n\n      And the example output is 3.\n\n      Now, the third example: Input \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n          n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n          Drink: (1000*1000) = 1000000, then 1000000/(50*10)=1000000/500=2000 -> floor(2000)=2000.\n          Lime: (25*23)=575, 575/10=57.5 -> floor(57.5)=57.\n          Salt: 1/(1*10)=0.1 -> floor(0.1)=0.\n\n          Then t = min(2000,57,0)=0.\n\n      Output is 0.\n\n      So we can implement by:\n\n          Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n          t_drink = (k * l) // (nl * n)   [Note: integer division, and we assume that nl*n is positive so no division by zero]\n          t_lime  = (c * d) // n\n          t_salt  = p // (np * n)\n\n          Then answer = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n      But wait: what if the product nl * n is larger than k*l? Then (k*l)//(nl*n) becomes 0. Similarly for others.\n\n      This is correct.\n\n      However, note: the drink condition: total drink required for t toasts per friend is n*t*nl. We are computing t_drink as the maximum t from drink: (k*l) // (nl*n). This is the same as floor((k*l)/(nl*n)).\n\n      But what if the division is not exact? The floor operation is correct because we cannot use fractional toasts.\n\n      However, there is a caveat: the condition for drink is that n*t*nl <= k*l. The maximum integer t satisfying that is floor((k*l) / (nl*n)). So we are correct.\n\n      But note: the example method 1 used a different order: first computed the total toasts from drink (without considering n) and then divided by n. \n\n      We can also do:\n\n          total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n          then t = total_toasts // n\n\n      Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: \n          total_toasts_drink = (4*5)//3 = 20//3 = 6\n          total_toasts_lime  = 10*8 = 80\n          total_toasts_salt  = 100//1 = 100\n          total_toasts = 6\n          t = 6//3 = 2.\n\n      Example 2:\n          total_toasts_drink = (100*10)//4 = 1000//4=250\n          total_toasts_lime  = 1*19=19\n          total_toasts_salt  = 90//3=30\n          total_toasts = 19\n          t = 19//5 = 3.\n\n      Example 3:\n          total_toasts_drink = (1000*1000)//50 = 1000000//50 = 20000\n          total_toasts_lime  = 25*23=575\n          total_toasts_salt  = 1//1 = 1\n          total_toasts = 1\n          t = 1//10 = 0.\n\n      Wait, example 3: \n          According to the third sample input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> output is 0.\n\n      But note: the example input was given as: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'] -> and the expected output is 0.\n\n      However, in the example explanation, they said: \n          \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n      But note: the third example: \n          Drink: 1000 * 1000 = 1e6 ml, nl=50 -> 1e6 /50 = 20000 toasts (total) -> so that's a lot.\n          Lime: 25*23=575 -> so 575 toasts (total)\n          Salt: 1 gram, np=1 -> 1 toast (total)\n\n          Then total_toasts = min(20000,575,1) = 1.\n          Then per friend: 1 // 10 = 0.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      However, which method is better? \n\n      Both methods are mathematically equivalent. \n\n      But note: the condition for drink in method 1: (k*l)//nl gives the maximum total toasts from drink, but if (k*l) is not divisible by nl, then we are flooring. Then we divide by n (floor again). \n\n      In method 2: we are flooring after multiplying by n? Actually, no: we are doing (k*l) // (nl*n). \n\n      These two methods are equivalent only when the operations are distributive with respect to floor? \n\n      Actually, they are the same because:\n\n          Let A = k*l, B = nl, C = n, D = c*d, E = p, F = np.\n\n          Condition 1 (method 1): n*t <= (A // B)   [since (A//B) is the maximum total toasts from drink] \n          Condition 2 (method 2): n*t <= (A) / (B*C)   [in real numbers] but then floor.\n\n      But note: the condition for drink is that the total drink consumed is n*t*B <= A.\n\n      In method 1, we first compute the total toasts from drink (ignoring the number of friends) as A//B, then we require that the total toasts (which is n*t) is <= A//B. \n\n      However, this is not the same as the condition n*t*B <= A.\n\n      Example: \n          A=5, B=2, n=2.\n          Condition: 2*t*2 <=5 -> 4*t<=5 -> t<=1.25 -> so t=1.\n\n      Method 1:\n          total_toasts_drink = 5//2 = 2.\n          Then total toasts T = 2*t <= 2 -> t<=1 -> so t=1.\n\n      Now, if we use method 2:\n          t_drink = 5 // (2*2) = 5//4 = 1.\n\n      So they are the same.\n\n      But wait: the condition in method 1 is: n*t <= (A//B). In our example: 2*t <= 2 -> t<=1.\n\n      The condition in method 2 is: n*t <= (A) / (B*C) in real numbers? Actually, we are using floor division. \n\n      However, note: the condition n*t*B <= A is equivalent to t <= A/(B*n). The maximum integer t is floor(A/(B*n)).\n\n      But in method 1, we are effectively requiring that the total toasts T = n*t is at most (A//B). \n\n      Why is that equivalent?\n\n      Because: n*t*B <= A   <=>   T = n*t <= A/B   (in real numbers) and then we take the floor for T? \n\n      Actually, no: the condition for the drink is on the total amount of drink, which is n*t*B, and we have A milliliters. So we require n*t*B <= A.\n\n      The maximum T (total toasts) is floor(A / B). Then we require n*t <= floor(A/B). \n\n      But note: the total drink used is n*t*B, and we can use at most A. So:\n\n          n*t*B <= A   =>   t <= A/(B*n)\n\n      And the maximum integer t is floor(A/(B*n)).\n\n      However, in method 1, we are using:\n\n          T_total = floor(A / B)   [maximum total toasts from drink]\n          Then we require n*t <= T_total   =>   t <= T_total / n   =>   t = floor(T_total / n)\n\n      Is floor(floor(A/B)/n) equal to floor(A/(B*n))?\n\n      Example: A=5, B=2, n=2.\n          floor(A/B) = floor(5/2)=2.\n          Then floor(2/2)=1.\n          floor(A/(B*n))=floor(5/4)=1.\n\n      Example 2: A=10, B=3, n=4.\n          Condition: n*t*B = 4*t*3 = 12*t <=10 -> t<=10/12 -> t=0.\n          Method 1: T_total = 10//3 = 3. Then t = 3//4 = 0.\n          Method 2: floor(10/(3*4)) = floor(10/12)=0.\n\n      Example 3: A=10, B=3, n=3.\n          Condition: 3*t*3=9*t<=10 -> t<=10/9 -> t=1.\n          Method 1: T_total = 10//3=3, then t=3//3=1.\n          Method 2: floor(10/(3*3))=floor(10/9)=1.\n\n      Example 4: A=10, B=3, n=2.\n          Condition: 2*t*3=6*t<=10 -> t<=10/6 -> t=1.\n          Method 1: T_total=10//3=3, then t=3//2=1.\n          Method 2: floor(10/(3*2))=floor(10/6)=1.\n\n      Example 5: A=10, B=3, n=1.\n          Condition: 1*t*3=3*t<=10 -> t<=10/3 -> t=3.\n          Method 1: T_total=10//3=3, then t=3//1=3.\n          Method 2: floor(10/(3*1))=3.\n\n      It seems that floor(floor(A/B)/n) == floor(A/(B*n)) in these examples. \n\n      Why? \n\n      We know that floor(x) <= x < floor(x)+1.\n\n      Then floor(x)/n <= x/n < (floor(x)+1)/n.\n\n      But note: we are taking floor(floor(A/B)/n). \n\n      Actually, we have:\n\n          Let x = A/B, so floor(x) = A//B.\n\n          Then we are computing floor(floor(x)/n).\n\n          And we want to compare with floor(x/n).\n\n          We know that floor(x)/n <= x/n, so floor(floor(x)/n) <= floor(x/n).\n\n          Also, we know that floor(x) >= x-1, so floor(x)/n >= (x-1)/n.\n\n          Then floor(floor(x)/n) is the greatest integer less than or equal to floor(x)/n.\n\n          But note: floor(x/n) is the greatest integer less than or equal to x/n.\n\n          And floor(x)/n might not be the same as floor(x/n). \n\n      Example: A=10, B=3, n=2 -> x=10/3≈3.33, floor(x)=3, then floor(3/2)=1, and floor(10/6)=1 -> same.\n\n      Example: A=11, B=3, n=2 -> x=11/3≈3.66, floor(x)=3, floor(3/2)=1, floor(11/6)=1.\n\n      Example: A=12, B=5, n=3 -> x=12/5=2.4, floor(x)=2, then floor(2/3)=0, and floor(12/15)=0.\n\n      Example: A=13, B=5, n=3 -> x=13/5=2.6, floor(x)=2, floor(2/3)=0, floor(13/15)=0.\n\n      Example: A=14, B=5, n=3 -> x=14/5=2.8, floor(x)=2, floor(2/3)=0, floor(14/15)=0.\n\n      Example: A=15, B=5, n=3 -> x=3, floor(x)=3, floor(3/3)=1, floor(15/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=16, B=5, n=3 -> x=16/5=3.2, floor(x)=3, floor(3/3)=1, floor(16/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=17, B=5, n=3 -> x=17/5=3.4, floor(x)=3, floor(3/3)=1, floor(17/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=18, B=5, n=3 -> x=18/5=3.6, floor(x)=3, floor(3/3)=1, floor(18/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=19, B=5, n=3 -> x=19/5=3.8, floor(x)=3, floor(3/3)=1, floor(19/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=20, B=5, n=3 -> x=4, floor(x)=4, floor(4/3)=1, floor(20/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=21, B=5, n=3 -> x=4.2, floor(x)=4, floor(4/3)=1, floor(21/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=22, B=5, n=3 -> x=4.4, floor(x)=4, floor(4/3)=1, floor(22/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=23, B=5, n=3 -> x=4.6, floor(x)=4, floor(4/3)=1, floor(23/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=24, B=5, n=3 -> x=4.8, floor(x)=4, floor(4/3)=1, floor(24/15)=1.\n\n      Example: A=25, B=5, n=3 -> x=5, floor(x)=5, floor(5/3)=1, floor(25/15)=1.\n\n      It seems that for these examples, floor(floor(A/B)/n) equals floor(A/(B*n)).\n\n      But wait: what if n=0? The problem says positive integers, so n>=1.\n\n      Actually, the two methods are equivalent. \n\n      However, there is a nuance: the condition for the drink in method 1 is that the total toasts (n*t) must be at most the floor of the total drink divided by nl. This is a necessary condition (because the drink is used in chunks of nl). But is it sufficient? \n\n      The condition for drink is: n*t * nl <= k*l.\n\n      In method 1, we first compute the maximum total toasts from drink as (k*l)//nl. Then we require that n*t <= (k*l)//nl.\n\n      But note: if n*t <= (k*l)//nl, then n*t * nl <= (k*l)//nl * nl <= k*l? \n\n      Actually, (k*l)//nl * nl <= k*l, so yes, the condition n*t <= (k*l)//nl implies n*t*nl <= k*l.\n\n      Conversely, if n*t*nl <= k*l, then n*t <= k*l / nl, so n*t <= floor(k*l / nl) might not hold? \n\n      Example: k*l=10, nl=3, n*t=4 -> 4*3=12>10 -> fails, so not considered. \n\n      Now, if n*t*nl <= k*l, then n*t <= k*l / nl. Then n*t <= floor(k*l / nl) + (fractional part). \n\n      But we are using integer division. \n\n      Actually, the condition n*t <= floor(k*l / nl) is stronger than n*t*nl <= k*l? \n\n      Let me check: \n          Condition1: n*t*nl <= k*l   (this is the actual physical condition)\n          Condition2: n*t <= floor(k*l / nl)\n\n      Condition2 implies Condition1: \n          n*t*nl <= n*t * nl <= floor(k*l / nl) * nl <= k*l   (because floor(k*l/nl)*nl <= k*l)\n\n      But Condition1 does not imply Condition2: \n          Example: k*l=10, nl=3, n*t=4 -> Condition1: 4*3=12>10 -> fails, so not applicable.\n\n          Example: k*l=10, nl=3, n*t=3 -> Condition1: 3*3=9<=10 -> holds. Condition2: 3 <= floor(10/3)=3 -> holds.\n\n          Example: k*l=10, nl=3, n*t=4 -> Condition1 fails.\n\n          Example: k*l=11, nl=3, n*t=4 -> Condition1: 4*3=12>11 -> fails.\n\n          Example: k*l=12, nl=3, n*t=4 -> Condition1: 12<=12 -> holds. Condition2: 4 <= floor(12/3)=4 -> holds.\n\n          Example: k*l=13, nl=3, n*t=4 -> Condition1: 12<=13 -> holds. Condition2: 4 <= floor(13/3)=4 -> holds.\n\n          Example: k*l=13, nl=3, n*t=5 -> Condition1: 15>13 -> fails.\n\n          Example: k*l=13, nl=3, n*t=4 is the maximum.\n\n      Now, consider: k*l=10, nl=3, n*t=3 -> works.\n\n      What if n*t= floor(k*l/nl) + 1? Then Condition2 fails, so we don't allow it. But Condition1: (floor(k*l/nl)+1)*nl <= k*l? \n\n      Example: k*l=10, nl=3, floor(10/3)=3, then 4*3=12>10 -> Condition1 fails.\n\n      Example: k*l=11, nl=3, floor(11/3)=3, then 4*3=12>11 -> Condition1 fails.\n\n      Example: k*l=12, nl=3, floor(12/3)=4, then 5*3=15>12 -> Condition1 fails.\n\n      So Condition2 is actually equivalent to Condition1? \n\n      Condition2: n*t <= floor(k*l / nl)   =>   n*t*nl <= floor(k*l / nl)*nl <= k*l   (so Condition1 holds)\n\n      Condition1: n*t*nl <= k*l   =>   n*t <= k*l / nl   =>   n*t <= floor(k*l / nl) + (k*l mod nl)/nl   (by definition of floor)\n\n      Then n*t might be greater than floor(k*l / nl) but still Condition1 holds? \n\n      Example: k*l=13, nl=3, floor(13/3)=4. Then Condition1: n*t*3<=13. \n          If n*t=5, then 15>13 -> fails.\n          If n*t=4, then 12<=13 -> holds, and 4<=4 (Condition2 holds).\n          If n*t=5 -> fails.\n\n      Example: k*l=14, nl=3, floor(14/3)=4. Condition1: n*t*3<=14.\n          n*t=5: 15>14 -> fails.\n          n*t=4: 12<=14 -> holds, and 4<=4 -> Condition2 holds.\n\n      Example: k*l=15, nl=3, floor(15/3)=5. Condition1: n*t*3<=15.\n          n*t=6: 18>15 -> fails.\n          n*t=5: 15<=15 -> holds, and 5<=5 -> Condition2 holds.\n\n      Example: k*l=16, nl=3, floor(16/3)=5.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then determine how many toasts each friend can make based on these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering three resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and each friend must make the same number of toasts.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution hinges on finding the bottleneck resource that limits the number of toasts. The maximum number of toasts per friend is determined by the minimum of the three individual resource constraints divided by the number of friends.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Drink Constraint**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available (k * l) and divide by the milliliters required per toast (nl). This gives the maximum total toasts possible from the drink.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Multiply the number of limes (c) by the number of slices per lime (d) to get the total lime slices available. Each toast requires one slice, so this directly gives the maximum total toasts possible from limes.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Divide the total grams of salt (p) by the grams required per toast (np) to get the maximum total toasts possible from salt.\n   - The smallest of these three values gives the maximum total toasts possible. Dividing this value by the number of friends (n) (using integer division) yields the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    drink_total = k * l\n    lime_total = c * d\n    salt_total = p\n    \n    max_toasts_drink = drink_total // nl\n    max_toasts_lime = lime_total\n    max_toasts_salt = salt_total // np\n    \n    total_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n\n    \n    print(toasts_per_friend)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: The total milliliters of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (k) by the milliliters per bottle (l). The maximum toasts from the drink is the total milliliters divided by the milliliters per toast (nl), using integer division.\n   - **Lime**: The total number of lime slices is the product of the number of limes (c) and slices per lime (d). Each toast requires one slice, so this product directly gives the maximum toasts from limes.\n   - **Salt**: The maximum toasts from salt is the total grams (p) divided by the grams per toast (np), using integer division.\n3. **Determine Limiting Factor**: The smallest value among the three resource-based maximum toasts determines the overall maximum toasts possible.\n4. **Per Friend Calculation**: The number of toasts each friend can make is the total toasts divided by the number of friends (n), again using integer division to ensure whole numbers.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints.",
