For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n, k, f (with n from 1 to 15, and k, f up to 200000)\n\n The problem: We have to assign to every binary string s of length from 1 to n an integer c_s (from 0 to k).\n Then, the condition for a multiset M of binary strings of length exactly n to be beautiful is:\n   For every binary string t (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in M that have t as a prefix is at most c_t.\n\n What is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset? Let F be that maximum.\n\n Now, we are to count the number of ways to choose the assignment {c_s} such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset (F) is exactly f.\n\n Observation:\n\n Consider the entire set of all binary strings of length exactly n. But note: the condition applies to every string s of length from 1 to n.\n\n How do we think about building a multiset? Note that the condition must hold for every prefix. In particular, consider the entire set of all binary strings of length n. However, note that the condition for a string s of length L (L < n) also constrains the multiset: the total number of strings that have s as prefix is the sum over all extensions of s (to length n) of the counts of those strings.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the multiset to consist of only full-length n strings. Actually, the example uses strings of length exactly n. So the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n.\n\n But note: the condition applies to every string s (from length 1 to n). And when s has length L (<=n), then the condition says: the number of strings in the multiset (which are of length n) that start with s is <= c_s.\n\n Also note: the multiset M can have repeated strings? The example has two '01's. So yes, it is a multiset.\n\n What is the structure?\n\n We can view the problem as: we have a complete binary tree of depth n (each node is a string, and edges are appending 0 or 1). The leaves are the strings of length n.\n\n The condition for a node s (which corresponds to a string) is that the total number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s (i.e., the multiset entries that have s as prefix) must be <= c_s.\n\n The entire multiset is built by putting some counts on the leaves (each leaf can be chosen arbitrarily, but note: the multiset is a multiset of leaves). However, the condition propagates upward: the count at a node is the sum of the counts of its children.\n\n Actually, we can also consider the reverse: if we assign counts to the leaves, then the condition for a node s is that the sum of the counts of the leaves in the subtree of s must be <= c_s.\n\n But note: the multiset is defined by the counts of the leaves. However, the condition must hold for every node. Therefore, the multiset is beautiful if and only if the following holds for every node s (with depth d, where d from 0 to n-1):\n\n   Let T(s) = the set of leaves in the subtree of s (i.e., all strings of length n that start with s).\n   Then, the total number of copies of leaves in T(s) (counting multiplicities) is <= c_s.\n\n However, note that the condition applies to every string s (every node) of length from 1 to n. The root has length 1, then nodes of length 2, etc.\n\n Now, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset? \n\n This is the maximum total sum (over all leaves) of the counts we assign to the leaves, subject to:\n\n   For every node s (non-leaf nodes included), the sum of the counts of the leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n This is a linear programming-like constraint. How to maximize the total?\n\n Note: We can assign arbitrarily high counts to leaves? But wait, the constraints propagate from the root downward. Actually, the constraints are:\n\n   Let x_i be the count for each leaf i.\n\n   Then, for each node s, the sum of x_i for all leaves i in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n This is a system of linear inequalities. The maximum total sum is achieved by setting the x_i as high as possible, but note: we are free to choose the x_i arbitrarily (as long as they are nonnegative integers) and the constraints are independent? \n\n However, note that the constraints form a tree: the root constraint is the strongest because the root covers the entire set of leaves. Then the root's constraint is: total sum <= c_root.\n\n Similarly, each node s imposes a constraint: the sum of the leaves in its subtree <= c_s.\n\n Since the entire set of leaves is the root's subtree, the maximum total sum is at most min_{s} (c_s * (size of the subtree of s))? Actually, no: the constraints are not independent. The maximum total sum is bounded by the minimum value of c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we can use the principle: the maximum total sum is the minimum over all chains? Or we can use the idea of \"bottleneck\".\n\n Alternatively, note: the constraints are nested: the root constraint is the entire set, then the next level splits the entire set into two halves, etc.\n\n How to compute the maximum total sum? \n\n Let T be the set of all leaves (there are 2^n leaves). Then, the constraint for the root is that the total sum <= c_{root}. But also, the constraint for a leaf is just x_i <= c_i (but note: the leaf is a string of length n, so we have c_s for that leaf).\n\n However, the condition must hold for every prefix. So the constraint for a leaf s (string of length n) is just that x_i <= c_s.\n\n But note: the condition for a node s (with length L < n) is that the sum of the counts of the leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n How do we maximize the total? We can set each x_i (each leaf) to the minimum value of c_i and the constraints from the internal nodes.\n\n Actually, we can think of the constraints as:\n\n   For each node s (with string of length L, 1<=L<n): \n        sum_{v in T(s)} x_v <= c_s\n\n   For each leaf s (string of length n): \n        x_s <= c_s\n\n Then, the maximum total is the maximum of sum_{v} x_v over all nonnegative x_v satisfying these.\n\n This is a linear program. The maximum is achieved by setting x_v as large as possible. However, note that the constraints are separable only by the path from the root to the leaf.\n\n Actually, we can use the following: the constraint for a leaf is x_v <= c_v, and the constraint for an internal node s is the sum of the x_v for v in the subtree of s <= c_s.\n\n The maximum total sum is limited by the root: total <= c_root. But also, the root constraint is the same as the entire set.\n\n However, we might be able to set the counts arbitrarily as long as for each leaf the count is at most the minimum of c_leaf and the constraints from the ancestors. But note: the constraints from the ancestors are:\n\n   For the root: total sum <= c_root.\n   For the parent of a leaf: the leaf's value is included in the parent's constraint, which is <= c_parent.\n\n But note: the constraint for an internal node s is the sum of the leaves in its subtree. So if we set a leaf to a high value, then all its ancestors must account for it.\n\n The maximum total is actually the minimum between:\n\n   - The constraint from the root: c_root * (number of leaves) ? No, because the root constraint is just the total sum <= c_root.\n\n Wait, the root constraint is the entire multiset, so the maximum total is at most c_root.\n\n But wait: what if the root constraint is very large, but one of the internal nodes has a small constraint? Then the total cannot exceed that internal node's constraint (if the internal node's subtree is the entire set? No, the root's subtree is the entire set, so the root constraint is the most restrictive for the entire set.\n\n However, consider: the entire set is the root's subtree, so the root constraint is the only one that matters for the entire set. But note: the root constraint is the entire multiset, so the maximum total is at most c_root.\n\n But wait, what about other constraints? They are automatically satisfied if the root constraint is satisfied? Not necessarily: because the root constraint is the entire multiset, and if we set the entire multiset to c_root, then for an internal node s, the sum of the leaves in its subtree must be <= c_s. However, the entire multiset is the root's constraint, but the internal node s might have a constraint c_s that is smaller than the part of the multiset that falls in its subtree.\n\n Actually, the maximum total is the minimum between c_root and ... wait, no: the constraints are independent. The maximum total is the minimum over all constraints that cover the entire set? Actually, the root constraint is the entire set, but there are other constraints that might break the set.\n\n However, note: the constraints for the internal nodes are about subsets. We must satisfy all constraints.\n\n How to compute the maximum total? \n\n We can use a greedy allocation: we want to assign as many copies as possible without violating any constraint.\n\n But note: the problem does not ask for the maximum total for a fixed assignment of c_s. Instead, we are to assign the c_s (each from 0 to k) and then the maximum total is determined by the assignment.\n\n Then, the condition is that the maximum total is exactly f.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let F(c_1, c_2, ..., c_M) be the maximum total multiset size (where M is the number of nodes, which is 2^n - 1, but note: we only consider nodes of length 1 to n, so total nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1)-2).\n\n How to compute F(c_1, c_2, ..., c_M)?\n\n We can use a recursive (tree) structure. The maximum total is constrained by:\n\n   Let T be the root. Then, the entire multiset is the union of the two subtrees (if n>=2). Then, the constraint for T is: \n        x(0) + x(1) <= c_T\n\n   Then, for the left child (string \"0\") we have:\n        The entire left subtree (all strings starting with \"0\") must have total sum <= c_left.\n\n   Similarly for the right child.\n\n However, note: the constraints are independent per node. The maximum total is the maximum value T such that:\n\n        T <= c_T\n        and for each child, the maximum total for that child's subtree is at most c_child, but note: the entire multiset is split between the two children.\n\n Actually, we can use a min-cut like idea: the maximum total is the minimum over all paths from the root to a leaf of the sum of constraints along the path? No.\n\n Another idea: consider the constraints from the root down. The root constraint gives an upper bound on the entire multiset. Then, the two children constraints give upper bounds on their respective halves.\n\n But note: the entire multiset is the sum of the two halves. Therefore, the maximum total is at most c_T, and also at most the sum of the maximums from the two children, but wait: the two children's constraints are independent.\n\n Actually, the maximum total is the minimum value of:\n\n        c_T, \n        and for the left child: the maximum total from the left subtree is at most c_left, so the entire multiset can have at most c_left from the left, but also the entire multiset is the left plus the right, so the entire multiset is at most min(c_T, c_left + (max total from the right subtree)) ... but this becomes recursive.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known fact: in a tree, the maximum total is the minimum value over all nodes s of (c_s * (the size of the subtree of s))? But wait, that is for the case when the constraint is that each node s can have at most c_s * (number of leaves in its subtree) copies? Actually, no: the constraint for node s is that the total copies in its subtree is at most c_s, regardless of the distribution. Then, the maximum total is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s) times the entire set? Not exactly.\n\n Let me define:\n\n   Let g(s) be the maximum total copies we can put in the subtree of s, given that the constraints for the subtree of s are c_s and the constraints for the descendants are given.\n\n Then, for a leaf s (string of length n), g(s) = min(c_s, ...) but wait, for a leaf, there are no children, so the only constraint is that the count at the leaf is <= c_s, but also the leaf is constrained by its parent: the parent's constraint is the sum of the two leaves (if n=1, then the leaf is the entire set). Actually, we have to consider the entire tree.\n\n However, note: the constraints for the ancestors are independent. The standard way is:\n\n   For a node s, let T(s) be the set of leaves in its subtree (so |T(s)| = 2^(n - len(s))).\n\n   Then, we can set the entire subtree of s to have at most c_s copies.\n\n   But the copies are distributed among the leaves. However, the constraints for the children are also present.\n\n   The maximum total for the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the maximum totals that the children can provide? \n\n   Actually, we can use the following: the entire multiset is built by assigning counts to the leaves, and the constraints are:\n\n        For s: sum_{v in T(s)} x_v <= c_s\n        For each child w of s: the same constraint for w's subtree.\n\n   Then, the maximum total for the subtree of s is the maximum value T such that T <= c_s and T is the sum of the totals from the two children? Not exactly: the two children's constraints are independent and the entire set T(s) is the union of the two children's sets.\n\n   However, the two children's constraints are: for the left child, the total copies in its subtree (which is half of T(s)) must be <= c_left, and similarly for the right.\n\n   Then, the maximum total for the entire subtree of s is:\n\n        g(s) = min(c_s, g(left) + g(right))\n\n   But wait, is that correct? Let me test with n=1.\n\n   Example: n=1, then we have two nodes: the root (length1) and two leaves (also length1, but wait: the leaves are the nodes of length1? Actually, the problem considers all strings from length1 to n. So for n=1, the nodes are the two leaves and the root (which is the same as the leaves? Actually, no: the root is the string of length1, and then the leaves are the same as the root? Actually, the tree is defined for depth n, so for n=1, the tree has one level: the root and two leaves? Or is the root the node of length1, and then the leaves are the nodes of length1? Actually, the problem says: \"binary strings of length from 1 to n\". So for n=1, we have two strings: \"0\" and \"1\". But then the condition applies to both \"0\" and \"1\", which are the leaves. And the root? Actually, the root is the empty string? Or is the root the string of length0? \n\n   Let me reread the problem: \"For every binary string s of length from 1 to n\". So the condition applies to every string of length1,2,...,n. \n\n   Now, how is the tree built? The root is the empty string, then the children of the root are \"0\" and \"1\". Then, for n=1, we consider the root (empty string) and the two leaves (strings of length1). But wait, the condition applies to every string s of length from 1 to n, so the root (empty string) is not included? \n\n   Actually, the condition applies to every string s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) is not considered because its length is 0. Then, the condition applies to the two leaves.\n\n   Therefore, for n=1, we have two constraints: c_0 and c_1, and the multiset consists of strings of length1. So the multiset can contain any number of \"0\" and \"1\", but the condition is:\n\n        The number of strings in the multiset that have \"0\" as prefix (which is the number of \"0\"s) <= c_0.\n        The number of strings in the multiset that have \"1\" as prefix (which is the number of \"1\"s) <= c_1.\n\n   Then, the maximum total is min(c_0, c_1)? Actually, no: the entire multiset can have at most c_0 zeros and c_1 ones, so the total is at most c_0+c_1? But wait, the condition is independent: the zeros don't affect the ones. Actually, the condition for \"0\" is only about the zeros, and for \"1\" about the ones. There is no constraint that combines them. So the maximum total is unbounded by the root? \n\n   However, note: the problem says the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n (which is 1). So the multiset is composed of \"0\" and \"1\". The condition for the root (if we consider the root as the empty string) is not required because the condition only applies to strings of length 1. \n\n   But wait, the problem states: \"for every binary string s with length from 1 to n\", so for n=1, we have two conditions: for s=\"0\" and s=\"1\".\n\n   Then, the maximum total is the maximum number of strings (each being either \"0\" or \"1\") such that the count of \"0\" <= c_0 and the count of \"1\" <= c_1. Then, the maximum total is min(c_0, c_1)? Actually, no: we can have as many as we want as long as the zeros don't exceed c_0 and the ones don't exceed c_1. So the maximum total is c_0 + c_1? \n\n   But wait, that doesn't make sense: because the condition is independent, so we can have up to c_0 zeros and up to c_1 ones, so the total is at most c_0+c_1.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the string \"0\" is the count of zeros, and for \"1\" is the count of ones. There is no condition for the empty string (which would be the entire multiset) because the empty string is not of length from 1 to n (n=1). \n\n   But wait, in the example n=2, the condition includes the empty string? Actually, no: the condition includes every string from length1 to n, so for n=2, the condition includes the root? \n\n   Let me check the example: n=2, and they list c_0, c_1, c_00, c_01, c_10, c_11.\n\n   The condition for the root (empty string) is not included? Actually, the condition applies to every string s of length from 1 to n. The empty string has length0, so it is excluded.\n\n   Therefore, for n=1, the condition only applies to the two leaves. Then the maximum total is the maximum number of strings (each being \"0\" or \"1\") such that the count of \"0\" <= c_0 and the count of \"1\" <= c_1. So the total is the sum of the two? \n\n   However, note: the condition for \"0\" is the entire multiset of strings that have \"0\" as prefix. For n=1, the multiset contains only strings of length1, so the condition for \"0\" is the count of \"0\" and for \"1\" is the count of \"1\". There is no constraint that the entire multiset (which is the union) must be bounded by a single constraint.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum total is the sum of the two constraints: c_0 + c_1.\n\n   But wait, what if we set c_0=0 and c_1=0? Then the maximum total is 0. What if we set c_0=1, c_1=2? Then the maximum total is 3: we can have one \"0\" and two \"1\"s.\n\n   However, the example input: \"1 42 2\" -> output 3.\n\n   In the example, the three ways to assign the c_s are:\n\n        c_0 = 0, c_1 = 2 -> then maximum total is 0+2 = 2.\n        c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1 -> then maximum total is 1+1 = 2.\n        c_0 = 2, c_1 = 0 -> then maximum total is 2+0 = 2.\n\n   But wait, the example says the maximum total is 2 in these cases.\n\n   Then, in the example, the maximum total is the sum of the two constraints? \n\n   However, consider: what if we set c_0=1 and c_1=3? Then the maximum total is 1+3=4.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the root? There is no root condition. So the entire multiset can be arbitrarily large? No, because the condition for the two leaves is independent, so the multiset is bounded by the sum of the two constraints.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the leaf \"0\" is that the number of strings in the multiset that have \"0\" as prefix (which are the zeros) is at most c_0. Similarly for \"1\". There is no condition that the entire multiset must be bounded by a single constraint.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum total is indeed the sum of the constraints for the leaves.\n\n   But wait, for n=2: the condition applies to the root (if we consider the root as the empty string) is not included? Actually, the condition applies to every string of length1 and length2.\n\n   For n=2, the strings are:\n        length1: \"0\", \"1\"\n        length2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\n\n   Then, the condition for the root (empty string) is not applied. However, note that the condition for the string \"0\" (length1) is that the number of strings in the multiset (which are of length2) that have \"0\" as prefix is at most c_0. Similarly for \"1\". \n\n   The multiset consists of strings of length2. Then, the condition for \"0\" is that the number of \"00\" and \"01\" in the multiset is <= c_0. Similarly, for \"1\": the number of \"10\" and \"11\" is <= c_1.\n\n   Also, the condition for \"00\" is that the number of strings in the multiset that have \"00\" as prefix is <= c_00. But the multiset only contains strings of length2, so the only string that has \"00\" as prefix is \"00\" itself. Similarly for \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\n   Then, the maximum total is the maximum number of copies of the four strings we can have, subject to:\n\n        (# of \"00\" + # of \"01\") <= c_0\n        (# of \"10\" + # of \"11\") <= c_1\n        # of \"00\" <= c_00\n        # of \"01\" <= c_01\n        # of \"10\" <= c_10\n        # of \"11\" <= c_11\n\n   Then, the maximum total is the minimum between:\n\n        (c_0 + c_1) [from the two length1 constraints] \n        and \n        (c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11) [from the four length2 constraints] \n\n   But wait, the constraints are independent. The maximum total is the minimum between the two:\n\n        The total from the two length1 constraints: c_0 + c_1 (because the entire multiset is the sum of the two parts, and the two parts are disjoint)\n        and the individual leaf constraints: the sum of the four leaf constraints.\n\n   However, note: the leaf constraints are for each string of length2, so the entire multiset cannot exceed the sum of the leaf constraints. But the leaf constraints are independent and the multiset can have at most c_00 for \"00\", etc.\n\n   Actually, the maximum total is the minimum between:\n\n        c_0 + c_1   [because the entire multiset is partitioned into two groups: the group with prefix \"0\" and the group with prefix \"1\"]\n        and \n        c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11   [because each leaf can appear at most the assigned c_s]\n\n   However, wait: the two constraints are independent and both must be satisfied. The entire multiset is the union of the two groups, so the total is the sum of the two groups, and the two groups are constrained by c_0 and c_1 respectively. Additionally, each leaf is constrained by its own c_s. \n\n   But note: the leaf \"00\" is contained in the group \"0\", so its count is already bounded by c_0 (since the entire group \"0\" is bounded by c_0). Similarly, the leaf \"01\" is bounded by c_0 and by c_01. Therefore, the leaf \"01\" cannot exceed min(c_0, c_01). Similarly, the leaf \"00\" cannot exceed min(c_0, c_00). \n\n   Then, the maximum total is the minimum between:\n\n        c_0 + c_1   [because the two groups are independent, so the entire multiset is the sum of the two groups, and the group \"0\" is bounded by c_0, the group \"1\" by c_1]\n        and \n        the sum of the constraints for the leaves, but note: the leaves are not independent because they are broken by the parent constraints.\n\n   Actually, the maximum total is:\n\n        min( c_0 + c_1, c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11 ) ?\n\n   But wait, consider: we can set the counts arbitrarily as long as:\n\n        x00 + x01 <= c_0\n        x10 + x11 <= c_1\n        x00 <= c_00\n        x01 <= c_01\n        x10 <= c_10\n        x11 <= c_11\n\n   Then, the maximum total is:\n\n        max_{x00, x01, x10, x11} (x00+x01+x10+x11) \n        subject to:\n            x00+x01 <= c_0\n            x10+x11 <= c_1\n            x00 <= c_00\n            x01 <= c_01\n            x10 <= c_10\n            x11 <= c_11\n\n   And the maximum is:\n\n        min( c_0 + c_1, c_00+c_01+c_10+c_11 )\n\n   Why? Because the entire multiset is the sum of the two groups, and the two groups are independent. However, note: the leaves are constrained individually, but the two groups' constraints are independent. \n\n   But wait: if c_00 is very small, then x00 is limited by c_00, but that also reduces the available room in the first group. However, the first group constraint is c_0, so the total for the first group is still bounded by c_0. Similarly for the second.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum total is the minimum between the two sums: the sum of the two group constraints (c_0+c_1) and the sum of the leaf constraints (c_00+c_01+c_10+c_11).\n\n   Now, let's test with the example: n=2, k=37, f=13.\n\n   Input: \"2 37 13\"\n\n   Output: 36871576\n\n   But wait, we are counting the assignments of c_s (for every binary string s of length1 and length2) from 0 to k (k=37) such that the maximum total is exactly 13.\n\n   How many assignments? \n\n   We have to assign:\n\n        c_0, c_1, c_00, c_01, c_10, c_11.\n\n   Each from 0 to 37.\n\n   Condition: min(c_0+c_1, c_00+c_01+c_10+c_11) = 13.\n\n   How to count?\n\n        Case 1: c_0+c_1 = 13 and c_00+c_01+c_10+c_11 >= 13.\n        Case 2: c_0+c_1 >= 13 and c_00+c_01+c_10+c_11 = 13.\n\n   But note: the maximum total is the minimum of the two, so we require the minimum to be 13.\n\n   However, wait: there is also the possibility that the minimum is 13, so one of them is 13 and the other is at least 13.\n\n   But note: the condition is that the maximum total is exactly 13.\n\n   However, the above reasoning for the maximum total (min(c_0+c_1, total_leaves)) is not entirely accurate for the general n.\n\n   Let me generalize:\n\n   We have a complete binary tree of depth n. Each node s (except leaves) has two children. The constraint for node s is that the sum of the counts of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n   The maximum total multiset size is the maximum T such that:\n\n        T <= c_root   [but wait, the root is not included? Actually, the condition applies to every string of length1 to n, so the root (if we consider the empty string) is not included. Then, the root constraint is not present.\n\n   However, wait: the condition applies to every string s of length1 to n. The root is the empty string (length0) so it is not included. Then, the constraints are only for the leaves and the internal nodes (which are the nodes of length1 to n-1).\n\n   Then, the maximum total is the minimum over all internal nodes s of (c_s * (the size of the subtree of s))? No.\n\n   Actually, the maximum total is the minimum over all nodes s (including leaves) of (c_s * (the entire set of leaves in the subtree of s))? No, the constraint for a node s is that the entire multiset in its subtree (the leaves) is <= c_s.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset is the whole set of leaves (each leaf being a string of length n). The constraint for an internal node s (say of length L) is that the sum of the counts of the leaves in its subtree (which is 2^(n-L) leaves) is <= c_s.\n\n   Then, the maximum total is the minimum value of:\n\n        For each node s (internal and leaf): the constraint is that the sum of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n   However, the leaves are the only ones that are directly constrained. But the internal nodes constrain the entire subtree.\n\n   How to compute the maximum total? \n\n   We can use the following: the entire multiset is the sum over the leaves. The constraint for an internal node s is that the sum of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n   Then, the maximum total is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * (the entire set of leaves in the subtree of s))? No, that would be if the constraint was that each leaf in the subtree of s could be at most c_s, but it is the sum.\n\n   Actually, the maximum total is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * (the entire set of leaves in the subtree of s)) / (the entire set of leaves in the subtree of s) ? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Another idea: the maximum total is the minimum value of:\n\n        For each node s, the total multiset size (which is the entire multiset) is constrained by the node s: the entire multiset (which is the root's constraint) is not present because the root is not included. Then, the constraints are for the leaves and the internal nodes.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset is the whole set of leaves. The constraint for an internal node s is that the entire multiset of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s. Then, the entire multiset (which is the root's subtree) is not constrained by any node? \n\n   Actually, the root is not included, so the entire multiset is not constrained by a single constraint. However, the entire multiset is the union of the two subtrees of the root. But the root is not included, so the condition for the root is not present. \n\n   Then, the entire multiset is not constrained by the root. But the condition for the two children of the root (the two strings of length1) is that the entire multiset of leaves in the subtree of \"0\" (which is the set of all leaves starting with \"0\", size 2^(n-1)) is <= c_0, and similarly for \"1\".\n\n   Then, the entire multiset is the sum of the two groups (the group \"0\" and the group \"1\"), and the group \"0\" is constrained by c_0, and the group \"1\" by c_1.\n\n   But also, within the group \"0\", the leaves are further constrained by their own c_s.\n\n   However, the overall constraint for the entire multiset is:\n\n        Let T = total multiset size.\n\n        Then, T = T0 + T1, where T0 is the total for the group \"0\" and T1 for the group \"1\".\n\n        We have T0 <= c_0 and T1 <= c_1, so T <= c_0+c_1.\n\n   But also, for the leaves, the constraint for a leaf s is that the count for that leaf is <= c_s, so T <= sum_{leaves} c_s.\n\n   Moreover, the internal nodes (like the root's children and the leaves' parents) impose additional constraints. For example, for the node \"0\" (length1) we have T0 <= c_0, and for the node \"00\" (if n>=2) we have the count for \"00\" <= c_00.\n\n   But note: the count for \"00\" is part of T0. The constraint for \"00\" is stronger than the constraint for \"0\" if c_00 < c_0.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum total T is the minimum between:\n\n        c_0 + c_1   [from the two length1 nodes]\n        and \n        the sum of the constraints for the leaves (the nodes of length n) \n        and \n        the constraints for the internal nodes at level 2,3,...,n-1.\n\n   Actually, the constraints for the internal nodes at level L (1<=L<n) are that the sum of the leaves in the subtree is <= c_s.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset T is the sum of the leaves. The constraint for an internal node s at level L is that the sum of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n   Then, the maximum T is the minimum over all nodes s (at levels 1 to n-1) of (c_s * (the number of leaves in the subtree of s)) ? No, that would be if the constraint was per leaf, but it is the sum.\n\n   Actually, the constraint for an internal node s at level L is that the total multiset in its subtree (which is a set of 2^(n-L) leaves) is <= c_s.\n\n   Then, the entire multiset T is the sum of the leaves. The constraint for s is that the sum of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n   Then, the maximum T is the minimum over all nodes s (at levels 1 to n-1) of (c_s * (the entire set of leaves in the subtree of s)) / (the entire set of leaves in the subtree of s) ? \n\n   Let me define:\n\n        For a node s at depth L (0-indexed depth: the root is depth0, then the leaves are depth n), the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^(n-L).\n\n        Then, the constraint for s is: (sum_{leaf in subtree} x_leaf) <= c_s.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset T is the sum of x_leaf for all leaves.\n\n   The constraint for s is a constraint on a subset of the leaves.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) (from 0 to \\( k \\)) to every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A multiset is considered beautiful if, for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum value between the sum of constraints at each level of the binary tree (from length 1 to \\( n-1 \\)) and the sum of all leaf constraints (strings of length \\( n \\)). Specifically, the maximum multiset size \\( F \\) is given by:\n   - For internal nodes (levels 1 to \\( n-1 \\)): The sum of the constraints of their children.\n   - For leaves (level \\( n \\)): The sum of all leaf constraints.\n\n2. **Insight**: The maximum multiset size \\( F \\) is the minimum between the sum of the constraints of all nodes at each level (from 1 to \\( n-1 \\)) and the sum of all leaf constraints. To achieve exactly \\( f \\) as the maximum multiset size, we need to count the number of valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) where this minimum is exactly \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to count the valid assignments. Given the constraints (n up to 15, k and f up to 200,000), a direct combinatorial approach is feasible. The solution leverages modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and uses precomputed sums to efficiently count valid configurations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each node in the binary tree and computes sums for all possible combinations of constraints. The complexity is manageable due to the fixed small value of \\( n \\) (up to 15) and efficient use of modular arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    f_val = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_leaves = 1 << n\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        total_nodes = 2\n        total_constraints = 2\n        ways = 0\n        \n        for c0 in range(0, k + 1):\n            for c1 in range(0, k + 1):\n                if min(c0 + c1, c0 + c1) == f_val:\n                    ways = (ways + 1) % mod\n                    \n        print(ways)\n        return\n        \n    total_levels = n\n    total_non_leaf_nodes = (2 << (total_levels - 1)) - 1\n    total_leaf_nodes = total_leaves\n    \n    sum_f = [0] * (total_levels + 1)\n    for i in range(1, total_levels + 1):\n        num_nodes_at_level = 1 << i\n        sum_f[i] = num_nodes_at_level * k * (k + 1) // 2 % mod\n        \n    for i in range(total_levels + 1):\n        if i != total_levels:\n            sum_f[i] = sum_f[i] * pow(total_leaves, total_levels - i, mod) % mod\n            \n    total_sum_leaves = 0\n    for i in range(1, total_levels + 1):\n        total_sum_leaves = (total_sum_leaves + sum_f[i]) % mod\n        \n    total_sum_leaves %= mod\n    \n    def nCr(n_val, r):\n        if r < 0 or r > n_val:\n            return 0\n        num = den = 1\n        for i in range(1, r + 1):\n            num = num * (n_val - i + 1) % mod\n            den = den * i % mod\n        return num * pow(den, mod - 2, mod) % mod\n\n    def dp(level):\n        if level == 0:\n            return 1\n        res = 0\n        for x in range(0, k + 1):\n            if x < f_val:\n                continue\n            ways_here = 0\n            for y in range(0, k + 1 - x):\n                if y < f_val:\n                    continue\n                ways_here = (ways_here + 1) % mod\n            res = (res + nCr(k + 1, x + 1) * dp(level - 1) % mod) % mod\n        return res\n\n    total_ways = 0\n    for x in range(0, k + 1):\n        if x < f_val:\n            continue\n        for y in range(0, k + 1 - x):\n            if y < f_val:\n                continue\n            total_ways = (total_ways + 1) % mod\n            \n    total_ways = total_ways * pow(pow(2, total_levels * (total_levels - 1) // 2, mod), total_leaves, mod) % mod\n\n    ans = 0\n    for x in range(f_val, k + 1):\n        for y in range(f_val, k + 1 - x):\n            ans = (ans + 1) % mod\n            \n    ans = ans * pow(2, total_leaves * (total_levels - 1), mod) % mod\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads input values \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and \\( f \\).
