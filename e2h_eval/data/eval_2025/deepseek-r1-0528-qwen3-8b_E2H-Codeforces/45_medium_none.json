There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament structure is constrained by the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to allow the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n The key idea is that the tournament can be broken down into rounds, and the winner must go through several rounds. However, the constraint on the difference of games played may force us to arrange the bracket in a way that the winner doesn't get too many games.\n\n Alternatively, note that the winner must beat k opponents (so the winner plays k games). The question is: what is the maximum k?\n\n Conditions for the winner to play k games:\n\n 1. The winner must start with 0, then 1, then 2, ... up to k-1 wins (so each game increases the count of games the winner has played by one).\n\n 2. The rule: when the winner is about to play the i-th game (i from 1 to k), the next opponent must have a number of games played either equal to i-1 (if the winner has played i-1 games and the opponent i-1) or i-2 (if the winner has played i-1 and the opponent has played i-2) or even i-1 or i-2? Actually, the rule says: the number of games one of them has played must differ by no more than one. So when the winner has played i-1 games, the opponent must have played either i-2, i-1, or i (but note: the opponent must have won all their games, so the opponent's number of games is the same as the number of wins they have. Also, we are constructing the tournament grid optimally to maximize the winner's games.\n\n However, the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner can face k opponents. How many total players are required?\n\n Consider: the winner must beat k opponents. But these opponents might have also beaten some other players.\n\n We can model the tournament as having two halves (like a binary tree) but the constraint allows for a slight imbalance.\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players needed to have a winner who plays k games.\n\n How do we form the tournament?\n\n - The first game: the winner (player 1) plays one game. So we need one opponent for the first game.\n\n - For the second game: the winner now has 1 win. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1 wins. But note, if the opponent has 0 wins, then that opponent must not have played any game before. However, in the first round, if we set up the tournament so that the first opponent is from a group that hasn't been used, we can have multiple paths. \n\n Alternatively, consider building the tournament backwards:\n\n We know the winner must win k games. The entire tournament is a knockout tournament with n players.\n\n The minimal structure to have a player with k wins is that the winner must defeat k opponents, and each of those opponents must have defeated a certain number of players.\n\n The rule allows for the following: the tournament can be thought of as having two \"branches\" for each win of the winner. But note the constraint on the number of games the opponent has played.\n\n Actually, we can use a recursive structure:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimal number of players required so that one of them can win k games under the given rules.\n\n Then, the base case is:\n   F(0) = 1   [the winner without playing any game]\n\n For k>=1:\n   In order for the winner to have k wins, he must first have a bracket that leads to him playing k games.\n\n How many players are needed to have a winner with k wins?\n\n Consider the last (k-th) game: the winner must have already won k-1 games, and the opponent must have either k-2 or k-1 wins (because the rule requires the opponent's wins to be k-2 or k-1). But wait, actually the rule is about the current state: when the winner has k-1 wins, the opponent must have either k-2, k-1, or k wins? \n\n However, note: the opponent must have lost only to the winner (since they haven't met before) and must have won all their previous games. But we are constructing the minimal structure. \n\n Actually, the tournament can be arranged in two halves: one half that leads to the winner and one half that leads to the opponent. The constraint is that the two halves must be as balanced as possible.\n\n There is a known way to compute the maximum number of wins the winner can have:\n\n We can use a recurrence:\n\n   Let a0 = 1 (a single player, the winner)\n   Then, to have a winner with 1 win, we need 2 players.\n\n   For 2 wins: \n        The winner must have 1 win, and the opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. \n        If we use an opponent with 0 wins, then that opponent must come from a group of 1 player (so total players = 1 (for the winner) + 1 (opponent) + the opponent's initial group? Actually, the opponent with 0 wins didn't play any game, so we don't need extra players for that opponent's wins. But wait, the tournament must be arranged so that the winner gets to play two games. \n\n        Actually, we can think: \n          Round 1: The winner beats one player (who has 0 wins). Then the winner must beat another player. But the second opponent must have either 0 or 1 wins. If we let the second opponent be a player that hasn't played any game, then we can have two initial players. But then the tournament would have 3 players. However, we have n=4 in the example.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a balanced structure:\n\n        To have the winner play k games, we can break the tournament into two parts: the winner's part and the opponents' part.\n\n        We can define:\n          Let A(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can have k wins.\n\n        Then, the first win: we need one opponent (so total 2 players).\n        For the second win: the winner must have one win, and the second opponent must have either 0 or 1 win. \n            If the second opponent has 0 wins, then we just add one more player (so total 3 players) -> but then the winner would have to play two games in a row, and the second opponent has 0 wins. However, the tournament with 3 players: \n                First game: winner vs player2 -> winner wins.\n                Second game: winner vs player3 -> winner wins.\n            This is allowed because the rule: when the winner has 1 win (from the first game), then the second opponent (player3) has 0 wins -> difference is 1, which is allowed.\n\n            But wait, the example input: \n                n=2 -> output 1\n                n=3 -> output 2\n                n=4 -> output 2\n\n            With n=3, the maximum wins for the winner is 2.\n\n        However, in the example, the input n=4 gives output 2, meaning the winner can have at most 2 wins. Why? Because if we try to have the winner play 3 games, we need at least 5 players? \n\n        Let's compute the minimal players for k wins:\n\n        k=0: 1 player\n        k=1: 2 players\n        k=2: 3 players (as above)\n\n        Now, for k=3: \n            The winner must have 2 wins, so the third opponent must have either 1 or 2 wins (because the winner has 2 wins, so the opponent must have 1,2, or 3? Actually, the rule says the difference is at most one, so the third opponent must have 1, 2, or 3 wins. But note: the third opponent must have lost only to the winner (so they haven't met the winner before). \n\n            However, if we want to minimize the total players, we can give the third opponent 1 win (so that opponent must have beaten one player). Then the total players are:\n                Winner: 1\n                Opponent for the third game: 1 (with 1 win) -> which means that opponent must have beaten one player (so one additional player). Then the two opponents for the first two games: one for the first (with 0 wins) and one for the second (with 0 or 1 wins). \n\n            But wait, we can structure the tournament as:\n\n            Let the winner be A.\n            A beats B (first game) -> B has 0 wins.\n            A beats C (second game) -> C must have either 0 or 1 win. \n            To minimize the total players, we can let C be a player that has 0 wins (then we only have 3 players so far). Then for the third game, we need an opponent D who has 1 win (because the winner has 2 wins, so D must have 1 or 2 wins; but if we use a player with 1 win, then D must have beaten someone. That someone could be E. Then total players: A, B, C, D, E -> 5.\n\n            Alternatively, we can give C 1 win? Then we need to have an opponent for C. But wait, if we do that, then we need to have a game between C and someone else (say E) before the final. Then the structure:\n\n            First, E beats F (so E has 1 win). Then C beats E (so C has 1 win). Then A beats B (so A has 1 win). Then A must play C (who has 1 win) and then A can play D (who must have 1 or 2 wins) for the third game? Actually, we can arrange:\n\n            We have 5 players: A, B, C, D, E.\n\n            But note: the rule says that when A has 1 win (after beating B) then the next opponent (C) must have 0 or 1 wins. And we can set up that C has 1 win (by beating E). Then after A beats C, A has 2 wins. Then we need a fourth opponent (D) for the third game? Actually, we are trying to get three wins for A, so we need three opponents. The third opponent must be someone who has 1 or 2 wins. \n\n            However, the minimal number of players for k wins seems to follow:\n\n            Let F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5.\n\n            This looks like Fibonacci numbers.\n\n            Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n            F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)   for k>=2.\n\n            Then:\n                k=0: 1\n                k=1: 2\n                k=2: 2+1 = 3\n                k=3: 3+2 = 5\n                k=4: 5+3 = 8\n                k=5: 8+5 = 13\n\n            Then, the problem reduces to: given n, find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            Then the answer is k (the number of wins, which is the number of games the winner plays).\n\n            Let's test with the examples:\n\n            Example 1: n=2 -> maximum k such that F(k)<=2 -> F(0)=1<=2, F(1)=2<=2, F(2)=3>2 -> so k=1 -> answer=1. Correct.\n\n            Example 2: n=3 -> F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3<=3, F(3)=5>3 -> k=2 -> answer=2. Correct.\n\n            Example 3: n=4 -> F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3<=4, F(3)=5>4 -> k=2 -> answer=2. Correct.\n\n            Example 4: n=10 -> \n                k=0: 1\n                k=1: 2\n                k=2: 3\n                k=3: 5\n                k=4: 8\n                k=5: 13 >10 -> so k=4 -> answer=4. Correct.\n\n            Therefore, we can solve the problem by:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute the Fibonacci-like sequence (starting with F0=1, F1=2) until the value exceeds n.\n\n            Step 2: The answer is the index (which is the number of wins) of the last term that is <= n.\n\n            However, note: the sequence is defined as:\n                F(0) = 1\n                F(1) = 2\n                F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n            We need to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            Since n can be up to 10^18, we cannot iterate k from 0 until we exceed n (because k will be around 90, so that's acceptable).\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n            Read n.\n\n            If n==1, then k=0? But the problem states n>=2.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Let k = 0, a = 1, b = 2\n            Then while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            But note: our sequence: \n                k0: a=1, k=0 -> then we set k=0, then we update: \n                Then k becomes 1, and a=2, b=1+2=3.\n                Then k=2, a=3, b=2+3=5.\n                Then k=3, a=5, b=3+5=8.\n                Then k=4, a=8, b=5+8=13.\n\n            Then the last k for which F(k) <= n is the current k (if we break when b>n, then the last valid k is the previous one? Actually, we break when we are about to set k to a value for which the next term is too big.\n\n            Actually, we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            k = 0\n            a0 = 1\n            a1 = 2\n\n            Then we traverse:\n\n            k0: a0 = 1 -> k=0, then update a0 = a1, a1 = a0+a1 -> then k=1\n            k1: a1 = 2 -> k=1, then update a0 = a1, a1 = a0+a1 -> then k=2\n            k2: a0=2, a1=3 -> k=2, then update a0=3, a1=5 -> k=3\n            k3: a0=3, a1=5 -> k=3, then update a0=5, a1=8 -> k=4\n            k4: a0=5, a1=8 -> k=4, then update a0=8, a1=13 -> k=5, but then we break because 13>n (if n=10, then 13>10).\n\n            Then the answer is k (the last k for which the term was <=n)? But note, we broke when a1 (which is the next term) is greater than n. So the last valid k is k-1? \n\n            Actually, we are storing two consecutive terms. We start with k=0 (term0=1) and k=1 (term1=2). Then we are going to k=2 (term2=3) and so on.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            Let k = 1   (we consider the first term as k=0 and second as k=1, but we want to count the index)\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            k = 0\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then at the end, k is the index (starting from 0) of the last term that is <= n? Actually, in the loop, we update a and b to the next term, and then k++. So when we break, the last term we computed (b) is the first one exceeding n, and the last valid term is the previous a (which is the (k-1)-th term). But note: we started with a=1 (k=0) and b=2 (k=1). Then we enter the loop and update a=2, b=3, then k=2. Then check 3<=n? Then update a=3, b=5, k=3. Then check 5<=n? ... until we break.\n\n            Actually, the variable k at the end is the index (starting from 0) of the next term that exceeds n, but the last computed term (b) is the one that exceeded, and the last valid term is the previous a (which is the k-1 term). But wait, we are counting k as the index of the term we just updated.\n\n            Actually, let me re-index:\n\n            Initially: \n                k = 0, a=1 (F0), b=2 (F1)\n\n            Then the loop condition is b<=n (so 2<=n, which is true for n>=2). Then we update: a, b = 2, 3 -> now a is F1, and b is F2, and k becomes 1.\n\n            Then we check 3<=n? If yes, then update: a, b = 3, 5 -> k becomes 2.\n\n            Then we check 5<=n? ...\n\n            Then when we break, k is the index (starting from 0) of the next term that we would have to compute, but actually k is the index of the last computed term (which is the term we just updated to b) minus one? Not exactly.\n\n            Let me change the code to store the index separately:\n\n            We want to know the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            k = 0\n            a = 1\n            b = 2\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then the last value of k is the index of the last term that is <= n? \n\n            But note: initially, we have two terms: k=0 (a=1) and k=1 (b=2). Then we update and set k=1 (meaning we've found F1=2) and then continue.\n\n            Actually, the index k in the loop is the index of the new term we are computing. But we break when the new term (b) exceeds n. Then the last valid term is the previous one (a) and its index is k-1.\n\n            However, let's see with n=2:\n\n            Initially: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n            Condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n            Then set a=2, b=3, k=1.\n            Then condition: 3<=2 -> false, break.\n\n            Then we output k=1, which is correct (the maximum k is 1).\n\n            For n=3:\n            Start: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n            Condition: 2<=3 -> true -> a=2, b=3, k=1.\n            Then condition: 3<=3 -> true -> a=3, b=5, k=2.\n            Then condition: 5<=3 -> false -> break. Then output k=2.\n\n            For n=4:\n            Start: a=1, b=2, k=0 -> update to a=2, b=3, k=1 -> 3<=4 -> update to a=3, b=5, k=2 -> 5<=4 false -> output k=2.\n\n            So the algorithm is:\n\n            k = 0\n            a = 1\n            b = 2\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then print(k)\n\n            But wait, in the example n=10, we want k=4.\n\n            Steps for n=10:\n\n            Start: a=1, b=2, k=0 -> 2<=10 -> update: a=2, b=3, k=1.\n            Then 3<=10 -> update: a=3, b=5, k=2.\n            Then 5<=10 -> update: a=5, b=8, k=3.\n            Then 8<=10 -> update: a=8, b=13, k=4.\n            Then 13<=10 -> false -> break. Output k=4.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            However, note: the Fibonacci sequence we are generating is:\n\n            k0: 1\n            k1: 2\n            k2: 3\n            k3: 5\n            k4: 8\n            k5: 13\n\n            And we are breaking when we are about to set k=5 (because 13>10) so we output k=4.\n\n            So the answer is k (the number of wins) and that is the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n            Note: n can be as large as 10^18, so we must be careful with the while loop. The sequence grows exponentially (like the Fibonacci sequence), so the number of iterations is logarithmic (base about 1.6) of n, which is about 90 for n=10^18. So it's safe.\n\n            Code:\n\n            Read n from stdin.\n\n            Special note: if n=1, then the tournament has 1 player, so the winner plays 0 games. But the input constraint says n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n            Let's code accordingly.\n\n            Example: \n                Input: 2 -> output 1\n                Input: 3 -> output 2\n                Input: 4 -> output 2\n                Input: 10 -> output 4\n\n            But wait, the example input includes ['2','3','4','10'] and the expected outputs are ['1','2','2','4'].\n\n            Our code produces for n=2: 1, n=3:2, n=4:2, n=10:4 -> correct.\n\n            However, note that the example input n=10 is provided as string '10', so we read as integer.\n\n            Code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n\n            if n == 1:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                k = 0\n                a = 1\n                b = 2\n                while b <= n:\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n                    k += 1\n                print(k)\n\n            But wait, the example input n=2: \n                Start: a=1, b=2, k=0 -> condition 2<=2 -> True, then a=2, b=3, k=1 -> then condition 3<=2 -> False -> break, then print(1). Correct.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the winner must win k games, and k is the number of games. So we are outputting k.\n\n            But note: the example n=2: the winner plays 1 game -> correct.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            However, there is an alternative way to look at it: the maximum wins the winner can have is the largest k such that F(k) <= n, and F(k) is defined as above.\n\n            Let me write the sequence explicitly:\n\n            k: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n            F(k): 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...\n\n            This is the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1,2.\n\n            We can also use the standard Fibonacci sequence but shifted.\n\n            But we have solved it.\n\n            One more edge: n=1 is not allowed, but if we consider n=1, we output 0.\n\n            But the problem states n>=2, so we don't need to handle n=1.\n\n            However, to be safe, we can also consider:\n\n            Another approach: use recursion or memoization? But the iterative method is efficient.\n\n            Let me run with n=1 (even though not in constraints) -> prints 0, which is correct.\n\n            Since the problem says n>=2, we can skip the n=1 case.\n\n            But the problem says: 2<=n<=10^18.\n\n            So we assume n>=2.\n\n            Final code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            k = 0\n            # We start by checking the first term (k=0) is always <= n (since n>=2, and 1<=n) but we are going to update and then k increases.\n            # Actually, we don't need to check the first term (k=0) because we are going to update and then check the next term.\n\n            # But wait, our while condition checks the next term (b) which is the second term (k=1). We want to include k=0 if n>=1, but since n>=2, k=0 is always satisfied.\n\n            # However, the problem is: we are counting k as the number of wins, and the first win is k=1 (which corresponds to the second term, F(1)=2). \n\n            # But note: the winner with 0 wins is the case of 1 player. The problem requires at least 2 players, so the winner must play at least one game.\n\n            # Our code: \n            #   n=2: \n            #       a=1, b=2, k=0 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true -> then we update and k becomes 1, and then we break because the next term (3) is not <=2.\n\n            #   So k=1 is the answer.\n\n            #   But note: the 0-win case is not considered in the loop because we break at the first condition? Actually, the 0-win case is when there are 1 player, but we don't have that.\n\n            #   We are good.\n\n            However, note that the sequence we are generating includes the 0-win case (F0=1) and the 1-win case (F1=2). But the problem does not require to consider the 0-win case because n>=2, so the minimum n is 2 (which is F1). \n\n            We can also start the loop with:\n\n            k = 0\n            a = 1\n            b = 2\n            while True:\n                if b > n:\n                    break\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then print(k)\n\n            But wait, in this version, we break when b>n, and then k is the number of wins for the last valid term? Actually, we break before updating k for the term that exceeds n.\n\n            Let me test with n=2:\n\n            Start: a=1, b=2, k=0 -> condition: 2<=2 -> then update: a=2, b=3, k=1 -> then check 3>2 -> break. Then print(1). Correct.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break inside the condition:\n\n            We are doing:\n\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then the last update is done and k is incremented, then we check the next term and break.\n\n            This is the same.\n\n            I'll stick to the current code.\n\n            Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n            But note: the problem says n can be up to 10^18, and we are using integers which in Python can handle that.\n\n            Code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            k = 0\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n            print(k)\n\n            However, wait: in the first iteration, we update a and b to the next term and then k becomes 1. Then we check the next term (which is the third term) and so on.\n\n            But note: the sequence we are building is:\n\n            term0: 1 (k=0, but we don't use k=0 in the condition because we break on the next term)\n            term1: 2 (k=1) -> then we update to term2: 3 (k=2) and so on.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            But let me check the example n=1 (even though not in the input range) -> the condition 2<=1 fails, so we don't enter the loop, then k=0 is printed. Correct.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            k = 0\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n            print(k)\n\n            However, note: the problem statement says that in the second sample (n=3) the answer is 2. Our code for n=3:\n\n            n=3\n            a=1, b=2 -> 2<=3 -> enter loop: a=2, b=3, k=1 -> then condition: 3<=3 -> enter loop: a=3, b=5, k=2 -> then condition: 5<=3 -> false -> break. Print 2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            One more: n=5 -> \n                a=1, b=2 -> 2<=5 -> update: a=2, b=3, k=1.\n                Then 3<=5 -> update: a=3, b=5, k=2.\n                Then 5<=5 -> update: a=5, b=8, k=3.\n                Then 8<=5 -> false -> break. Print 3.\n\n            Now, let's verify with n=5: \n                The minimal players for 3 wins is 5, so the winner can have 3 wins? Then the answer is 3.\n\n            But wait, the example input only goes up to 10, and the sample output for n=10 is 4.\n\n            Is 3 wins for n=5 correct?\n\n            Tournament with 5 players:\n\n            We need to arrange the tournament so that the winner plays 3 games.\n\n            According to the minimal structure for 3 wins: 5 players.\n\n            Structure:\n\n            Let the winner be A.\n\n            We need three opponents: B, C, D.\n\n            The first game: A beats B (B has 0 wins).\n\n            The second game: A beats C. Now, C must have 0 or 1 win. Since C has not played any game (if we put C as a first-time opponent) then 0 wins -> allowed.\n\n            Then the third game: A must beat D. Now, D must have either 1 or 2 wins (because A has 2 wins). \n\n            How to set up D? \n\n            We have one more player (E). \n\n            We can have:\n\n            First, E beats F? But we only have 5 players. \n\n            Alternatively, we can have:\n\n            Round 1: \n                Match1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                Match2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)   -> but wait, we only have 5 players: A,B,C,D,E.\n\n            Then Round 2:\n                Match3: A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1)\n                Then we have two left: E and the loser of D vs ... wait, we have E still.\n\n            Actually, let me list the players: A, B, C, D, E.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            Round 1:\n                A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                E ? -> no, we have 5 players, so one bye? Or we can arrange differently.\n\n            Alternatively, we can have:\n\n            We need to have the third opponent D to have 1 or 2 wins.\n\n            Since we have 5 players, we can have:\n\n            Round 1:\n                A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                E sits out? But then we have two winners (A and C) and one bye (E). Then Round 2: A vs C, and E must play someone? \n\n            Actually, the rule is knockout, so we need to arrange the entire bracket.\n\n            But note: the minimal structure for 3 wins is 5 players, so it is possible.\n\n            However, the problem says: two players can play only if the number of games differs by at most one.\n\n            After the first two wins, A has 2 wins. Then the third opponent must have either 1 or 2 wins.\n\n            We have two players left: D (with 0 wins) and E (with 0 wins). \n\n            But wait, we only have two players (D and E) left? Then we can have:\n\n            Round 1:\n                Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                Game2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)\n                Game3: E vs ... no, we have 5 players, so we have to have two games in the first round? Actually, 5 players: one bye.\n\n            Standard way to arrange a knockout tournament with 5 players:\n\n            Round 1: 3 games (but 5 players: one bye). But the problem doesn't specify the arrangement.\n\n            However, the constraint is only about the number of games played by the two players at the time of the match.\n\n            We can arrange:\n\n            First, we have to ensure that the winner (A) can have 3 wins.\n\n            Let me try:\n\n            First, we have to set up the games so that the third opponent has 1 win.\n\n            How? We can have:\n\n            Before the third game, the opponent D must have played one game and won.\n\n            Then, the entire structure:\n\n            - In the first round, we have:\n                A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)   -> but then D has 0 wins, not 1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can have:\n\n            First round: \n                A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                C vs E -> C wins (C:1, E:0)\n                Then second round: \n                    A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1)\n                    Then we have two players: D and E (both with 0 wins). Then we have to have a game between D and E? But then the winner of that game (say D) will have 1 win, and then the final game between A and D: A has 2 wins, D has 1 win -> allowed.\n\n            Then the tournament:\n\n            Round1: A beats B, C beats E.\n            Round2: A beats C, D beats E? Wait, E already played and lost in round1, so E is out.\n\n            Actually, we have 5 players: A, B, C, D, E.\n\n            Round1: \n                Game1: A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                Game2: C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)   -> but wait, we have E left? Then we have a bye for E? Or we can do:\n\n            Alternatively, we can have a different arrangement:\n\n            We want the third opponent to have 1 win. So we must have a player that has already played one game.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            - First, we have a preliminary round to create a player with 1 win.\n\n            But note: we have 5 players. We can do:\n\n            Round0: \n                E vs someone? But we don't want to interfere with the main path.\n\n            Actually, we can arrange:\n\n            Let the tournament be:\n\n            First, we have a small tournament to produce a player with 1 win from the other players.\n\n            However, the problem does not specify the exact grid, so we can arrange arbitrarily as long as the rule holds.\n\n            So for n=5, we can have:\n\n            Round1:\n                A vs B -> A wins (A:1, B:0)\n                C vs D -> C wins (C:1, D:0)   [now we have A and C as winners, and E is left]\n                Then we have to arrange the next round.\n\n            But wait, we have 3 winners (A, C) and one bye (E). Then:\n\n            Round2:\n                A vs C -> A wins (A:2, C:1)\n                Then we have E (who hasn't",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence to find the minimal number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that two players can only compete if the number of games they have played differs by at most one. The winner must win all their games. The challenge is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play under these constraints.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves generating a sequence where each term represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play a certain number of games. This sequence starts with 1 (0 games) and 2 (1 game), and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms (like the Fibonacci sequence).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use an iterative approach to generate terms of this sequence until the term exceeds the given number of players `n`. The index of the last term that is less than or equal to `n` gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The sequence grows exponentially, so the number of iterations required is logarithmic in `n`, making the solution efficient even for very large `n` (up to 10^18).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 0\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the minimal players needed for 0 and 1 game(s) respectively. The variable `k` keeps track of the number of games.\n2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `b` (the next term in the sequence) is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to the next terms in the sequence, and `k` is incremented.\n3. **Termination**: The loop exits when the next term exceeds `n`, and the current value of `k` is printed, which represents the maximum number of games the winner can play.\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the solution without explicitly constructing the entire tournament structure, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
