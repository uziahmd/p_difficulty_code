Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row (index 2, which is the middle) the third character (index 2) is 's' but it should be part of the diagonal? \n   Actually, let's break down:\n\n   The diagonals:\n      Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) -> all should be the same letter, say 'x'\n      Anti-diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) -> same letter 'x'\n\n   But note: the center (2,2) is common to both diagonals.\n\n   Now, what about the rest?\n   Condition 2: All non-diagonal squares must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n   In the example, the center is (2,2). According to the example input, the third row (index 2) is \"soxoo\". So the center is 's'. \n   But wait, the diagonal requires the center to be 'x' (from the main diagonal) and also from the anti-diagonal. However, the third row's center is 's', which is not 'x'. \n\n   Therefore, we must check:\n     - For every cell (i, j) that is on either diagonal, the letter must be the same (say, 'x').\n     - For every cell (i, j) that is not on either diagonal, the letter must be the same (say, '.') and that '.' != 'x'.\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Read n.\n     2. Read the grid (n lines)\n\n     3. Determine the center letter (from the diagonal) and the background letter (for non-diagonals).\n\n     4. Check the two diagonals: \n          diagonal1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n          diagonal2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        Both diagonals must consist of the same letter, say `d`.\n\n     5. Check the non-diagonal cells: \n        For each cell (i, j):\n          if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): then it's on a diagonal -> must be `d`\n          else: must be the same letter (say `b`) and `b` != `d`\n\n     6. However, note: the entire grid must have the same background letter `b` for all non-diagonal cells.\n\n   But there's a catch: the two diagonals must have the same letter, but what if the grid has two different letters on the two diagonals?\n   Then it fails.\n\n   Let's design:\n\n     Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n     Step 2: Extract the two diagonals and check they are all the same and also the same as each other.\n\n     Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let d1 = set(diagonal1) -> must have size 1, and d2 = set(diagonal2) -> must have size 1, and then d1 == d2.\n\n     But note: the center is in both, so that doesn't matter.\n\n     Step 3: For non-diagonal cells, we want to check that they are all the same and not equal to the diagonal letter.\n\n        We can collect all non-diagonal letters into a set. However, note: if there are multiple distinct letters in non-diagonals, then it fails.\n\n        But wait: the condition says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\", meaning one fixed letter.\n\n        However, we must also ensure that the letter in the non-diagonals is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n     But note: what if the two diagonals are made of letter 'a' and the non-diagonals are made of letter 'b'. Then we are good.\n\n     However, what if the non-diagonals have two different letters? Then we fail.\n\n     Approach:\n\n        Let diag_letter = None\n\n        Check diagonal1: \n            for char in diagonal1:\n                if diag_letter is None: diag_letter = char\n                else if char != diag_letter -> invalid.\n\n        Similarly, check diagonal2: same.\n\n        Then, check non-diagon",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms an \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the integer `n` which specifies the size of the grid. Then read the next `n` lines to get the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Extract the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`). Verify that all characters in both diagonals are identical.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: For all cells not on either diagonal, ensure they contain the same character. This character must be different from the one found on the diagonals.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n            diag_letter = None\n            break\n    else:\n        diag_letter = grid[0][0]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != grid[0][0]:\n            diag_letter = None\n            break\n    else:\n        if diag_letter is None:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    \n    background_letter = None\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if background_letter is None:\n                background_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != background_letter:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if grid[i][j] == diag_letter:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    \n    if valid and background_letter is not None and background_letter != diag_letter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and then reads each line of the grid into a list of strings.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks if all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same character. If they are not, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For each cell not on the diagonals, the code ensures they all contain the same character, which must differ from the diagonal character. If any non-diagonal cell violates this condition, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Result**: If all checks pass, the code outputs \"YES\", indicating the grid forms an \"X\" as specified. Otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions by systematically checking each part of the grid, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
