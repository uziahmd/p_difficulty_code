He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b.\n The second line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to base 10 (integer) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    Note: The input number in base a might have leading zeros, but its length is up to 1000. However, if it's Roman, the number is <= 300010 and not zero.\n\n 2. Otherwise, convert the number from base a to base 10, then from base 10 to base b (which is an integer between 2 and 25). \n    But note: the input number in base a can be very large (up to 10^1000 in base 25? Actually, the input says \"in any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning base 10 representation of the number is up to 10^1510, which is too big for normal integers). \n\n However, note the problem statement: \n   \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\" -> This means that when b is not R, the base a number is such that when converted to base 10, the value is at most 10^1510. But wait, base a (from 2 to 25) and the string length up to 1000. \n\n But note: the example input: '2 2\\n1111001' -> base 2, so the number is 1*2^8 + ... which is 255. So the input string length is 7, but the problem says \"its length doesn't exceed 103\".\n\n However, the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". This might be a typo because 10^1510 is an astronomically large number, but the base a is at least 2, so the maximum number we can represent with 1000 digits in base a is a^1000. For a=2, that's 2^1000 ~ 1e300, but 10^1510 is even bigger. But note: the problem says \"the number\" (the base-10 value) won't be greater than 10^1510. \n\n However, the problem also says: \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\".\n\n So, for non-Roman cases, we are dealing with numbers that are at most 10^1510. But wait, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, but our input string is in base a (from 2 to 25) and up to 1000 digits. The base a representation of 10^1510 might be a very long string, but the problem says the input string (in base a) has length at most 1000. \n\n But note: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103\".\n\n So the input string is at most 103 characters. Therefore, even though the base 10 value might be huge (like 10^1510), we cannot convert by first converting to base 10 as a regular integer because 10^1510 is too big for Python's int? Actually, Python ints can handle arbitrary large numbers, but the conversion from base a (with a from 2 to 25) of a string of 1000 digits is going to be a very big number, but 1000 digits in base 25 is 25^1000, which is about 10^(1000*log10(25)) ~ 10^1000*1.4, which is way beyond 10^1510. \n\n However, note the condition: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". So if the base a string is long (like 1000 digits) and a is 2, then the number is at most 2^1000 (about 1e300) which is less than 10^1510. But if a is 25, then 25^1000 is much bigger than 10^1510. \n\n Let me check: \n   log10(25^1000) = 1000 * log10(25) ≈ 1000 * 1.39794 = 1397.94, so 25^1000 is about 10^1398, which is less than 10^1510. \n\n So the condition is that the base-10 value is <= 10^1510, so we can safely convert the entire string (with length up to 103) from base a to an integer (as a Python int) because the maximum value is 10^1510, which is a number with 1511 digits. \n\n However, wait: the problem says the input string has length at most 103. Then the maximum base a (25) number is 25^102 (since 103 digits) which is 25^102, and 25^102 is about 10^(102 * log10(25)) ~ 10^142. That is less than 10^1510. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning the base-10 value is at most 10^1510. So we can use Python's built-in `int` to convert the string from base a (if a is not R) to an integer, because the base-10 value is bounded by 10^1510, which is within Python's integer range (though 10^1510 is a very big integer, but Python can handle it).\n\n However, note: the input string might have leading zeros, but the base a is from 2 to 25, so we can use `int(s, base=a)` for the non-Roman case.\n\n But wait: the problem says the input is in base a and may contain leading zeros. The `int` function in Python can handle leading zeros.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: b is not 'R'\n   Step 1: Convert the given string (which is in base a) to an integer. We can do this by:\n        n = int(c_string, base=a)\n   However, note: the string might contain digits beyond 9? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n   So the input string for base a (if a>10) will use letters for digits above 9. But the `int` function in Python handles base from 2 to 36, and uses digits 0-9 and then letters from 'a' to 'z'. But the problem uses uppercase letters? \n\n   Example: Input '12 13\\nA' -> base 12, so 'A' is 10. Then we convert 10 (base12) to base13. But note: 10 (base12) is 10 in base10, then base13 representation is 'A'.\n\n   However, the example input: '12 13\\nA' -> output 'A'\n\n   But the example input: '5 R\\n4' -> output 'IV'\n\n   The problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n   So the input string for base a (a>=11) will use digits 0-9 and then letters starting from 'A' for 10, then 'B' for 11, etc.\n\n   However, the `int` function in Python expects the string to use digits and letters in lowercase or uppercase? Actually, the `int` function in Python uses the following: \n        For bases up to 36, the digits are case insensitive. But we must use the correct set: from 0 to 35, where 10 is 'a', 11 is 'b', ... 35 is 'z'. But the problem uses uppercase.\n\n   We can use `int(s, base=a)` and the string s is given in the input. The input uses the same letters as the problem: for example, base 12, the digit 10 is represented as 'A'. \n\n   However, the `int` function by default expects digits and letters in the string to be in the range [0-9a-zA-Z]. But wait, the `int` function in base a (when a<=36) expects the digits to be from '0' to '9' and then 'a' to 'z' (case insensitive). \n\n   But note: the example input for base 12 uses 'A'. The `int` function will interpret 'A' as 10 only if the base is at least 11. And indeed, the base is 12, so it will work.\n\n   However, what if the base is 11? Then the digit 'A' (10) is valid.\n\n   But note: the input string might contain letters in uppercase. The `int` function is case insensitive for base conversions (for bases <=36). So we can use:\n\n        n = int(c, base=a)\n\n   Then, we have to convert n to base b. \n\n   How to convert n to base b (an integer base from 2 to 25)? We can do:\n\n        if n == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n        digits = []\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            digits.append(str(r))\n\n        Then reverse digits and join.\n\n   But wait: what if b is greater than 10? Then we need to use letters for digits above 9. The standard way is to map the remainder to a digit: \n        For remainders 0-9: use the digit itself as a character.\n        For remainders 10-24: use letters from 'A' to 'X' (since 25 is the maximum base, so the remainder can be up to 24).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        def convert_base(n, base_b):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, base_b)\n                digits.append(r)\n            # Now, convert each digit to the corresponding symbol\n            s = ''\n            for d in reversed(digits):\n                if d < 10:\n                    s += str(d)\n                else:\n                    s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n            return s\n\n   However, note: the example '12 13\\nA' -> base12 to base13: \n        First, convert 'A' (which is 10 in base12) to base10: 10.\n        Then convert 10 to base13: \n            10 // 13 = 0, remainder 10 -> which is 'A' in base13? But base13 uses digits 0-12, and 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is 'C'. So yes.\n\n   But wait: the example output is 'A'. So that's correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input '10 2\\n1' -> base10 to base2: \n        n = 1 (from base10 string '1')\n        Then convert 1 to base2: \n            1 // 2 = 0 remainder 1 -> so we get '1'\n\n   Another example: '16 R\\n5' -> base16 to Roman: \n        n = int('5', 16) = 5, then convert 5 to Roman -> 'V'\n\n   But wait, the example input: '5 R\\n4' -> base5? Actually, the first part is the base for the given number. The input is \"5 R\", then the next line is \"4\". So we convert \"4\" from base5 to base10? That would be 4 (since 4 < 5). Then we convert 4 to Roman: which is \"IV\".\n\n   However, wait: base5: the digit '4' is valid. So 4 in base5 is 4 in base10.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input is in base a. So we convert the entire string from base a to base10.\n\n   However, there is an issue: the input string might have multiple digits. For example, if a=5 and the string is \"10\", that is 1*5^1 + 0 = 5 in base10.\n\n   So the plan for non-Roman:\n\n        n = int(c, base=a)   # This works for bases 2 to 36, and our a is from 2 to 25, so okay.\n\n        Then convert n to base b (if b is an integer base) by repeatedly dividing by b and collecting remainders.\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n        Then we convert the string from base a to base10 (using the same method) and then convert that base10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n   How to convert a base10 integer (which is at most 300010) to a Roman numeral?\n\n   We have the standard Roman numeral conversion, but note the subtractive principle for 4 and 9, and multiples (like 40, 90, etc.).\n\n   Steps for Roman numeral conversion:\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        But note: the number is at most 300010, so we can use the following mapping:\n\n        M = 1000, CM = 900, D = 500, CD = 400, C = 100, XC = 90, L = 50, XL = 40, X = 10, IX = 9, V = 5, IV = 4, I = 1.\n\n        Since the number is at most 300010, we can do:\n\n        num = n (which is at least 1 and at most 300010)\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900),\n            ('D', 500),\n            ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90),\n            ('L', 50),\n            ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9),\n            ('V', 5),\n            ('IV', 4),\n            ('I', 1)\n        ]\n\n        Then:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                # While n is at least value, subtract value and add numeral\n                count = n // value\n                res += numeral * count\n                n -= value * count\n            return res\n\n        But note: the example 4: \n            n=4: \n                M: 4//1000=0 -> skip\n                ... until IV: 4//5=0, then IV: 4//4=1 -> so add 'IV' and n becomes 0.\n\n        However, the standard way is to use the largest possible numeral first.\n\n        Example: 1994 -> MCMXCIV\n\n        But let's test 4: \n            We go from top: \n                M: 0, CM:0, D:0, CD:0, C:0, XC:0, L:0, XL:0, X:0, IX:0, then V: 4//5=0, then IV: 4//4=1 -> so we get 'IV'. Correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input: '5 R\\n4' -> base5 representation \"4\" is 4 in base10, then to Roman is \"IV\".\n\n        But wait: the example input is \"5 R\\n4\", so base a=5, and the string is \"4\". So we convert \"4\" from base5 to base10: 4 (since 4 < 5). Then convert 4 to Roman: IV.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input string in base a may contain leading zeros. But when converting to base10, leading zeros don't matter.\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 5 and the string is \"0000004\"? Then int(\"0000004\", 5) is still 4.\n\n   So the conversion is safe.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input number is non-negative and may be 0, but in the Roman case, it is guaranteed that the number is not 0 and <=300010.\n\n   However, in the non-Roman case, the number can be 0 (if the input string is all zeros). But the problem says: \"non-negative integer c\", and the Roman case excludes 0.\n\n   But the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning non-Roman case can be 0? Actually, the problem does not specify that the non-Roman case cannot be 0. But note the input says: \"non-negative integer c\", so 0 is allowed.\n\n   However, if we get 0 in non-Roman case, then we must output \"0\" (without leading zeros). Our base conversion function for base b (if b is an integer) must handle 0.\n\n   Similarly, in Roman case, the number is not 0, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read the first line and split into two tokens: a_str and b_str.\n   Read the second line: c_str.\n\n   If b_str is 'R':\n        Convert c_str from base a (given by a_str) to an integer n (if the string is empty, n=0, but the problem says the number isn't 0 in Roman case, so we assume non-empty).\n        Then convert n to Roman numeral using the mapping above.\n\n   Else:\n        Convert c_str from base a (given by a_str) to an integer n.\n        Then convert n to base b (given by b_str) as an integer.\n\n        Note: if n is 0, then the output is \"0\".\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 1? The problem states a>=2, so no.\n\n   However, what if the base a is 10 and the string is \"0\"? Then n=0. Then we have to output base b representation of 0, which is \"0\".\n\n   But the problem says: \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\"\n\n   So for 0, we output \"0\".\n\n   But note: the problem says the input number is non-negative, and the Roman case excludes 0, but the non-Roman case includes 0.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the input string might be negative? The problem says non-negative.\n\n   Steps for converting base10 integer to base b (non-Roman):\n\n        if n == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n        digits = []\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            digits.append(r)\n\n        Then, we have to map the remainders to symbols. But note: the base b is from 2 to 25.\n\n        We can create a list of the digits:\n\n        For base b, the digits are:\n          0: '0'\n          1: '1'\n          ...\n          9: '9'\n          10: 'A'\n          11: 'B'\n          ...\n          up to 24: 'X' (since 10->'A', 11->'B', ..., 24-> 'X' because 'A' is 10, so 24 is 14th letter after 'A'? Actually, we need to map:\n\n        We can do:\n\n        def base_b_representation(n, b):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n            # Now, we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first)\n            s = ''\n            # Traverse the digits from last to first (i.e., from most significant to least)\n            for i in range(len(digits)-1, -1, -1):\n                d = digits[i]\n                if d < 10:\n                    s += str(d)\n                else:\n                    # d from 10 to b-1 (max 24)\n                    # We can use: chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n                    s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n            return s\n\n   But wait: the above function for base conversion doesn't handle the case when the base is 1? But base is at least 2.\n\n   However, note: the example '10 2\\n1' -> base10 to base2: \n        n = 1, base=2: \n            digits = [1] (because 1//2=0, remainder 1)\n            then we map 1 to '1', so returns \"1\".\n\n   Example: '2 2\\n1111001' -> base2 to base2: \n        n = int('1111001', 2) = 128+64+32+16+1 = 241? Actually, let's compute: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121? \n\n        Wait, the example input: '2 2\\n1111001' -> output '1111001'\n\n        So we are just printing the same string? \n\n        But note: the input is already in base2, and we are converting to base2. So we should output the same.\n\n        However, our base conversion function would convert 121 (base10) to base2: \n            We do: \n                121 // 2 = 60, remainder 1\n                60 // 2 = 30, remainder 0\n                30 // 2 = 15, remainder 0\n                15 // 2 = 7, remainder 1\n                7 // 2 = 3, remainder 1\n                3 // 2 = 1, remainder 1\n                1 // 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\n            Then we reverse: [1,0,0,1,1,1,1] -> so the string is \"1111001\", which matches.\n\n   But note: the example input '12 13\\nA' -> base12: \n        n = int('A', 12) = 10 (base10)\n        Then convert 10 to base13: \n            10 // 13 = 0, remainder 10 -> so the digit is 'A' (because 10->'A'). So we output \"A\".\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input '16 R\\n5' -> base16: \n        n = int('5', 16) = 5 (base10)\n        Then convert 5 to Roman: \n            We break down 5: \n                M: 5//1000=0\n                CM:0, D:0, CD:0, C:0, XC:0, L:0, XL:0, X:0, IX:0, then V: 5//5=1 -> so subtract 5, and append 'V'. Then 5-5=0. So output \"V\".\n\n   But wait, the example input is \"16 R\\n5\", and the output is \"V\".\n\n   However, the example input is given as:\n        Input: ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n        Output: ['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n   So everything matches.\n\n   But wait: the example input '5 R\\n4' -> base5: \n        n = int('4', 5) = 4 (base10)\n        Then convert 4 to Roman: \n            We break down 4: \n                M:0, CM:0, D:0, CD:0, C:0, XC:0, L:0, XL:0, X:0, IX:0, then V: 4//5=0, then IV: 4//4=1 -> so subtract 4, append 'IV'. Then n becomes 0.\n\n        Output \"IV\".\n\n   It matches.\n\n   One more corner: base a=10, string=\"0\", then b=10: \n        n = 0, then we output \"0\".\n\n   But if b is 'R': \n        n = 0, but the problem says in Roman case the number is not 0. So we don't have to handle 0 in Roman case.\n\n   However, the problem says the Roman case input number is not 0.\n\n   But note: the input might be provided with leading zeros. Our base conversion for base a (using `int`) will handle leading zeros.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the base a is given as a string. We need to convert the first token to an integer.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   tokens = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n   a_str = tokens[0]\n   b_str = tokens[1]\n\n   Then, the second line: c_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n   Then, if b_str == 'R':\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n        n = int(c_str, base=base_a)   # This works for base_a from 2 to 25 (and we know base_a is in [2,25])\n        Then convert n to Roman.\n\n   Else:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n        n = int(c_str, base=base_a)\n        Then convert n to base_b (if n==0 then output \"0\", else use the base conversion function).\n\n   But note: what if the base conversion for base_a fails? For example, if the string contains a digit that is not valid for base_a? \n        The problem says: \"c is an integer written in base a\", so we assume the string is valid.\n\n   However, we must consider that the base_a is given and the string may contain digits beyond the base? Actually, the problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10\", meaning the digits are from 0 to base_a-1, and represented by digits 0-9 and then letters from 'A' to ... (for base_a-1). \n\n   The `int` function in Python uses the full set of digits for base up to 36. For base 11, the digits are 0-9 and 'a' (for 10). But our string might use uppercase. The `int` function is case insensitive for bases <=36.\n\n   So we can rely on `int(c_str, base_a)`.\n\n   However, note: the input string might have letters in lowercase? The problem does not specify. But the problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10\", so the input should use uppercase. But the problem does not forbid lowercase.\n\n   We can convert the string to uppercase first? Or note: the `int` function is case insensitive for base conversion (for bases <=36). So it doesn't matter.\n\n   Example: int('a', 16) and int('A', 16) are both 10.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input uses A for 10, so we assume uppercase. But to be safe, we can use `c_str.upper()`?\n\n   Actually, the `int` function is case insensitive, so we don't need to.\n\n   Let me test:\n\n        print(int('a', 16))   # 10\n        print(int('A', 16))   # 10\n\n   So we don't need to.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input string may contain leading zeros.\n\n   We are ready to code.\n\n   But wait: the base conversion function for base b (non-Roman) must handle base 1? No, base b is from 2 to 25.\n\n   Code:\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            if not data: \n                return\n            parts = data[0].split()\n            a_str = parts[0]\n            b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n            c_str = data[1].strip()\n\n            base_a = int(a_str)\n\n            try:\n                n = int(c_str, base=base_a)\n            except:\n                # According to the problem, the input is valid, but just in case\n                # But the problem says it's valid, so we can ignore.\n                n = 0\n\n            if b_str == 'R':\n                # Convert n to Roman numeral\n                roman_numerals = [\n                    ('M', 1000),\n                    ('CM', 900),\n                    ('D', 500),\n                    ('CD', 400),\n                    ('C', 100),\n                    ('XC', 90),\n                    ('L', 50),\n                    ('XL', 40),\n                    ('X', 10),\n                    ('IX', 9),\n                    ('V', 5),\n                    ('IV', 4),\n                    ('I', 1)\n                ]\n                roman_str = ''\n                for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                    # Count how many times the numeral occurs\n                    count = n // value\n                    roman_str += numeral * count\n                    n -= value * count\n                    if n <= 0:\n                        break\n                print(roman_str)\n            else:\n                base_b = int(b_str)\n                if n == 0:\n                    print('0')\n                else:\n                    digits = []\n                    num = n\n                    while num:\n                        num, r = divmod(num, base_b)\n                        digits.append(r)\n                    # Now, we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first)\n                    s = ''\n                    # Traverse from last digit to first\n                    for i in range(len(digits)-1, -1, -1):\n                        d = digits[i]\n                        if d < 10:\n                            s += str(d)\n                        else:\n                            # d from 10 to base_b-1 (max 24)\n                            s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n                    print(s)\n\n   But wait, there's a bug: in the Roman conversion, we are modifying the variable `n` and then breaking out of the loop. But in the code above, we are using the same variable `n` and updating it. However, we used `n` from the outer scope, which is the base10 integer. \n\n   Actually, we did:\n\n        roman_str = ''\n        for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n            count = n // value   # Here, n is the original base10 integer (the one we got from converting the string)\n            roman_str += numeral * count\n            n -= value * count   # This overwrites n! \n\n   This is incorrect because we are modifying the outer variable `n` which is used in the next iteration. \n\n   We should use a temporary variable or reassign n inside the function. But we are in a function? Actually, no, we are in the main. Let me fix:\n\n        We should not modify the variable `n` that we got from the base conversion because we need it for the entire process. \n\n   Instead, we should use a temporary variable for the remaining number.\n\n   Let me correct:\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900),\n            ('D', 500),\n            ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90),\n            ('L', 50),\n            ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9),\n            ('V', 5),\n            ('IV', 4),\n            ('I', 1)\n        ]\n\n        roman_str = ''\n        num_remaining = n   # Make a copy\n        for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n            count = num_remaining // value\n            roman_str += numeral * count\n            num_remaining -= value * count\n            if num_remaining <= 0:\n                break\n\n   Then print(roman_str)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different variable.\n\n   Also, note: the base conversion for non-Roman: the variable `num` is defined as `n`, and then we update `num` to be the quotient. But we don't use `n` again. So that's okay.\n\n   Let me test the Roman conversion with 1994:\n\n        n = 1994\n        roman_numerals: \n            M: 1994//1000 = 1 -> add 'M', then 1994-1000=994.\n            CM: 994//900 = 1 -> add 'CM', then 994-900=94.\n            D: 94//500=0, skip.\n            CD: 94//400=0, skip.\n            C: 94//100=0, skip.\n            XC: 94//90=1 -> add 'XC', then 94-90=4.\n            L: 4//50=0, skip.\n            XL: 4//40=0, skip.\n            X: 4//10=0, skip.\n            IX: 4//9=0, skip.\n            V: 4//5=0, skip.\n            IV: 4//4=1 -> add 'IV', then 4-4=0.\n\n        Result: \"MCMXCIV\"\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input '16 R\\n5' gives 5, which is 'V'. Correct.\n\n   But wait: the example input '5 R\\n4' gives 4, which is 'IV'. Correct.\n\n   One more: 40 is 'XL'. Let me test:\n\n        n = 40\n        M:0, CM:0, D:0, CD:0, C:0, XC:0, L:0, XL: 40//40=1 -> add 'XL', then 40-40=0 -> done. So \"XL\"\n\n   So the code should be:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            if not data: \n                return\n            parts = data[0].split()\n            a_str = parts[0]\n            b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) >= 2 else None\n            c_str = data[1].strip()\n\n            base_a = int(a_str)\n\n            try:\n                n = int(c_str, base=base_a)\n            except Exception as e:\n                # According to the problem, the input is valid, but if not, we output 0?\n                n = 0\n\n            if b_str == 'R':\n                # Convert n to Roman numeral\n                roman_numerals = [\n                    ('M', 1000),\n                    ('CM', 900),\n                    ('D', 500),\n                    ('CD', 400),\n                    ('C', 100),\n                    ('XC', 90),\n                    ('L', 50),\n                    ('XL', 40),\n                    ('X', 10),\n                    ('IX', 9),\n                    ('V', 5),\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting this base 10 number to the desired target base, which could be either an integer base or the Roman numeral system.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values, which include the source base (a), the target base (b, which might be 'R' for Roman numerals), and the number (c) in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the given number (c) from the source base (a) to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, considering the base, and summing their values appropriately.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion (if target base is 'R')**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 integer to a Roman numeral by breaking down the number into the largest possible Roman numeral components and appending them in descending order.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: If the target base is an integer between 2 and 25, convert the base 10 number to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9 and A-X for values 10-24).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    base_a = int(a_str)\n\n    try:\n        n = int(c_str, base=base_a)\n    except Exception as e:\n        n = 0\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900),\n            ('D', 500),\n            ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90),\n            ('L', 50),\n            ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9),\n            ('V', 5),\n            ('IV', 4),\n            ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        num_remaining = n\n        roman_str = ''\n        for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n            count = num_remaining // value\n            roman_str += numeral * count\n            num_remaining -= value * count\n            if num_remaining <= 0:\n                break\n        print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n        if n == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num = n\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, base_b)\n                digits.append(r)\n            s = ''\n            for i in range(len(digits)-1, -1, -1):\n                d = digits[i]\n                if d < 10:\n                    s += str(d)\n                else:\n                    s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n            print(s)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input lines, splits them to extract the source base (a), target base (b), and the number (c) in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number (c) is converted from the source base (a) to a base 10 integer using Python's built-in `int` function, which handles both digits and letters (for bases greater than 10).\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to a Roman numeral by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For an integer target base, the base 10 number is converted by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (0-9 and A-X) to form the result string, which is printed in reverse order to ensure correct digit placement.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and the special case of Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
