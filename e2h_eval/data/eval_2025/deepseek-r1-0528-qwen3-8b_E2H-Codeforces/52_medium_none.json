Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Each hour, Vasily uses one candle (which burns for an hour).\n   - When a candle burns out, it becomes a burned candle.\n   - He can collect 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n However, note that the burning process might be thought of as:\n   - Initially, we have `a` new candles. We can burn them all, which takes `a` hours and produces `a` burned candles.\n   - Then, from the burned candles, we can make `a // b` new candles (and have `a % b` leftover).\n   - Then we burn these `a // b` new candles, which takes `a // b` hours, and then we get `a // b` more burned candles, plus the leftovers.\n\n But note: the leftovers from the first cycle (a % b) are still available and should be added to the burned candles from the next cycle.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate until we don't have enough candles to burn for an hour or to form a new candle.\n\n Steps:\n   Let `hours = 0`\n   Let `current_candles = a`\n   Let `burned = 0`\n\n However, there is a simpler way:\n\n   We start with `a` candles. We can burn `a` candles and get `a` burned ones. Then we can make `a // b` new candles and have `r = a % b` burned left over.\n\n   Then the total hours would be the initial `a` (from the first burn) plus the hours from the recycled candles.\n\n   But note: the recycled candles themselves when burned will produce burned candles that can be used again.\n\n   So we can model it as:\n\n     total_hours = 0\n     current = a\n     while current > 0:\n         # Burn as many as we have\n         total_hours += current\n         # Now we have 'current' burned candles (from the current burning)\n         # And we also have any leftovers from previous cycles? Actually, we need to account for the leftovers separately.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n     total = a\n     leftover = a\n     while leftover >= b:\n         # From 'leftover' burned candles, we can make leftover // b new candles, and we have leftover % b leftover burned candles remaining.\n         total += leftover // b\n         leftover = leftover // b + leftover % b\n\n   But wait, let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n     Start: total=4, leftover=4\n        Condition: 4>=2 -> True\n          total = 4 + 4//2 = 4+2 = 6\n          leftover = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2 + 0 = 2\n        Condition: 2>=2 -> True\n          total = 6 + 2//2 = 6+1 = 7\n          leftover = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1+0 = 1\n        Condition: 1<2 -> stop.\n\n     So output 7, which matches.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n\n        total=6, leftover=6\n        Condition: 6>=3 -> True\n          total = 6 + 6//3 = 6+2 = 8\n          leftover = 6//3 + 6%3 = 2+0 = 2\n        Condition: 2<3 -> stop.\n\n        Output 8, which matches.\n\n   However, note: the above simulation does not exactly account for the fact that the burning of the recycled candles adds to the burned count.\n\n   But the idea is that we are counting the hours from every burning. In the first step, we burn the initial 'a' candles (which gives a hours). Then, we use the burned candles to make new ones, which we then burn (so we add the number of new candles to the total hours). Then the burned candles from those new ones are collected and reused.\n\n   This method is efficient because the number of iterations is logarithmic in base b.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that we start with 'a' candles. The above method counts the initial 'a' as the first set of hours, then the next set (from recycling) as the next hours.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n     total_hours = a   # because we burn the initial a candles, which gives a hours.\n     leftover = a       # the burned candles from the initial burn.\n\n     while leftover >= b:\n         # Create new candles from leftover: each b leftovers give 1 candle.\n         new_candles = leftover // b\n         total_hours += new_candles\n         # The leftover becomes: the remainder from dividing by b, plus the new_candles that we are going to burn (which will become burned too) but note: we haven't burned the new_candles yet so they are not burned until we burn them. However, in the next iteration we are going to consider the burned from the new_candles (which are new_candles) and the leftover from the previous step.\n\n         # Actually, after using 'b' * (leftover//b) of the burned candles to make new_candles, the remaining burned candles are leftover % b.\n         # Then, when we burn the new_candles, they will become new burned candles. So the total burned at the beginning of the next cycle is (leftover % b) + new_candles.\n\n         leftover = leftover % b + new_candles\n\n     print(total_hours)\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   But wait, why do we add the new_candles to the leftover? Because the new_candles are going to be burned in the next cycle, so they will eventually become burned. However, in our simulation, we are effectively treating the entire system of burned candles as a single pool. We use the pool to create new candles, and then we use the entire pool (the remaining plus the new ones that just got burned) for the next cycle.\n\n   However, note that the new_candles are burned in the same cycle? Actually, no: the process is:\n\n     Step 1: We have 'a' candles (new). Burn them -> we get 'a' burned candles and 'a' hours.\n     Step 2: From the 'a' burned candles, we make floor(a/b) new candles and have r = a % b burned candles left.\n             Then we burn these floor(a/b) new candles -> we get floor(a/b) hours and floor(a/b) burned candles.\n\n     Then the total burned candles for the next cycle is r + floor(a/b).\n\n   So the above code does:\n\n        total_hours = a   (from step 1)\n        leftover = a\n\n        Then we enter the loop: \n            new_candles = a // b\n            total_hours += new_candles   (so now total_hours = a + a//b)\n            leftover = a % b + new_candles   (this is the burned candles from step 2, which we use in the next iteration)\n\n   Then we burn the new_candles (from step 2) and then we have the leftover from step 2 (which is a % b) and the burned from step 2 (which is new_candles) becomes part of the pool.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's test with a small example: a=1, b=2 -> then we can only burn 1 candle, then we have 1 burned candle which isn't enough for a new one. Output 1.\n\n   Another example: a=3, b=2\n        total_hours = 3\n        leftover = 3\n        Condition: 3>=2 -> True\n            new_candles = 3//2 = 1\n            total_hours = 3+1 = 4\n            leftover = 3%2 + 1 = 1+1 = 2\n        Condition: 2>=2 -> True\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n            total_hours = 4+1 = 5\n            leftover = 2%2 + 1 = 0+1 = 1\n        Condition: 1<2 -> stop.\n\n        Output 5.\n\n   Let's verify manually: \n        Start with 3 candles -> burn 3 candles (3 hours), now we have 3 burned.\n        With 3 burned, we can make 1 new candle (since 3//2=1) and have 1 burned leftover.\n        Then we burn the new candle (1 hour) -> total 4 hours, and now we have 1 (from before) + 1 (from this new candle) = 2 burned.\n        Then we make 2//2 = 1 new candle and burn it (1 hour) -> total 5 hours, and then we have 0 burned from the last cycle (because 1%2 from the last step? Actually, the last step: from 2 burned we make 1, and then we have 0 leftover from the division, then we burn the new one and get 1 burned, which isn't enough.\n\n   So yes, 5 hours.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read a and b from stdin.\n\n        if a == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            total = a\n            leftover = a\n            while leftover >= b:\n                new_candles = leftover // b\n                total += new_candles\n                leftover = leftover % b + new_candles\n            print(total)\n\n   However, note that the input constraints say a>=1, so we don't need the a==0 case.\n\n   Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"4 2\" -> total=4, leftover=4\n            Iteration1: 4//2=2, total=6, leftover=0+2=2\n            Iteration2: 2//2=1, total=7, leftover=0+1=1 -> stop. Output 7.\n\n        Example 2: \"6 3\" -> total=6, leftover=6\n            Iteration1: 6//3=2, total=8, leftover=0+2=2 -> stop. Output 8.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is given in a single line with two integers.\n\n   We can read:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data: \n            print(0)\n        else:\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n\n   But the problem says there are two integers.\n\n   Let's write the complete code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be combined to create new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` initial candles. Each candle provides one hour of light.\n2. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` burned candles. These can be recycled into new candles at a rate of `b` burned candles per new candle. Specifically, `a // b` new candles can be made, and `a % b` burned candles remain unused.\n3. **Iterative Process**: The process repeats with the new candles. Each cycle involves burning the current candles (adding their count to the total hours) and then recycling the resulting burned candles (both from the current cycle and any leftovers from previous cycles) into new candles. This continues until there are not enough burned candles to form a new candle (`leftover < b`).\n\nThe algorithm efficiently calculates the total hours by iteratively processing the candles and their burned counterparts, leveraging integer division and modulus operations to manage the recycling process.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = a\n    leftover = a\n    while leftover >= b:\n        new_candles = leftover // b\n        total += new_candles\n        leftover = leftover % b + new_candles\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `total` and `leftover` are initialized to `a`, representing the initial number of candles and the burned candles after the first burn.\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are enough burned candles (`leftover`) to create at least one new candle (`leftover >= b`).\n3. **Recycling Process**: In each iteration, the number of new candles is calculated as `leftover // b`. The total hours are incremented by this number. The leftover burned candles are updated to the remainder of `leftover % b` plus the new candles (since new candles will also burn and become leftovers later).\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when there are not enough burned candles to form a new candle. The accumulated `total` hours, which includes all burning periods from initial and recycled candles, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum burning time by systematically recycling burned candles into new ones until no more can be formed, ensuring optimal use of available resources.",
