При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it is the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions for error:\n  - The two messages are identical and of length n (so the original transmission would have been s+s without error).\n  - There is an overlap: meaning that the last k characters of the first s match the first k characters of the second s, where 0 < k < n.\n  - Then the resulting string would be s + (the rest of the second s after the overlap) OR more precisely: \n        t = s[0:n-k] + s[n-k:] + s[k:]   ??? Let me reexamine:\n\n Actually, the problem says: the two messages are transmitted. The first one is s, the second one is s. Then due to error, the two s are merged by overlapping at the end of the first and the beginning of the second.\n\n So, if we break the string t into two parts: \n        t = A + B   where A is the first part and B is the second part.\n\n But note: the entire t must be formed by two copies of s that are overlapped. Therefore, t must be of the form:\n\n        t = s[0: n - k] + s[k:] + s[k:]   [This doesn't seem right]\n\n Actually, let's think:\n\n We have two messages: s1 = s and s2 = s.\n Without error, the transmission would be s1 + s2 = s + s.\n\n With error, the transmission merges the end of s1 and the beginning of s2. The condition is that the overlapping part (at least one character) must be the same.\n\n So, if the first message ends with a suffix and the second message starts with a prefix, and these two parts are equal (and the length of the overlap is k, which is between 1 and n-1), then the merged string is:\n\n        t = s[0: n - k] + s[k:]\n\n But wait, that would give: \n        s[0: n-k] is the first n-k characters, then we append the remaining part of the second s (which is s[k:]).\n\n However, note that the entire second s is being merged? Actually, no: the entire second s is not necessarily included. The merging only uses the overlapping part. But actually, the problem says: \"the two messages are merged\" so the entire second message is not necessarily included in the merged string? \n\n Let me read the example: \n        Example: \"abrakadabra\" (length 11) and then when sent twice, we get two possibilities: \n          \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) and \n          \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n How does that work?\n        Without error: s+s = \"abrakadabraabracadabra\" -> wait, that doesn't look like the example.\n\n Actually, the example says: \n        Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n        Option 1: overlap of 1: \n            First part: \"abrakadabra\", then the second part should start with \"a\" (overlapping the last character of the first part). Then the entire second part is \"abrakadabra\", but we only use the part after the overlap? \n\n        Actually, the merged string is: \n            Take the entire first s (without the overlapping part) and then the entire second s (starting from the overlapping part). But wait, that doesn't make sense because then the total length would be (n - k) + n = 2*n - k.\n\n        In the example, the length of \"abrakadabra\" is 11. Then for k=1: 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? But the example string \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" has 21 letters? Let me count:\n\n            abrakadabra -> 11 letters\n            abrakadabraabracadabra (without error) -> 22 letters.\n\n        But the example output is 21 letters: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        Actually, let me write:\n\n            First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Second s: \"abrakadabra\"\n\n        If we overlap the last 1 character of the first s ('a') with the first 1 character of the second s ('a'), then the merged string is:\n\n            \"abrakadabra\" (first s) and then the second s without the first character? -> \"brakadabra\"\n\n            So: \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (21 characters)\n\n        Similarly, for k=4: \n            Overlap the last 4 characters of the first s: \"abra\" with the first 4 characters of the second s: \"abra\".\n\n            Then we take the first s without the last 4: \"abrakad\" and then the entire second s (because we already used the first 4, so we take the rest? Actually, no: we don't drop the first part of the second s, we just merge the overlapping part. But the entire second s is still included, but the overlapping part is counted only once.\n\n            So: first part: \"abrakad\", then the entire second s: \"abrakadabra\". Then we get \"abrakadabrakadabra\", which is 15 characters? \n\n            Let me count: \n                \"abrakad\" (7) + \"abrakadabra\" (11) = 18.\n\n            But wait, the example says: \"abrakadabrakadabra\" is 15? Actually, let me write:\n\n                Original: \"abrakadabra\" (11)\n                After removing the last 4 from the first part: \"abrakad\" (7)\n                Then we append the second s (which is 11 characters) -> 7+11=18.\n\n            But the example says: \"abrakadabrakadabra\" is 15? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n            Let me count: \n                a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> 19? \n\n            Wait, let me write again:\n\n                Example output: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (with k=1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (with k=4)\n\n            Let me count the first example: \n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\": \n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a -> 21\n\n            The second example: \n                \"abrakadabrakadabra\":\n                a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> 16? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \"abrakadabrakadabra\" is 16? \n\n            But wait, the example input was given as: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', ...]\n\n            And the output was: \n                ['YES\\nabrakadabra', ...]\n\n            So we are to output the original s, which is \"abrakadabra\".\n\n        How do we reconstruct s?\n\n        We know that t must be the concatenation of two s's with an overlap of k (0 < k < n). Then:\n\n            t = s[0: n - k] + s   [because the second s starts from the overlap, but we already merged the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s, so we have the first n-k characters of s and then the entire second s?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can also see that:\n\n            t must be such that there exists an integer k (1<=k<n) for which:\n                t[0: n] == s   (the first copy of s) and \n                t[n-k: n] == t[0:k]   (the beginning of the second s must equal the overlapping part, and the overlapping part is the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy)\n\n            Also, the entire string t must be of length 2*n - k.\n\n        But note: the entire string t is fixed. We don't know n and k.\n\n        However, note that the entire string t must be broken into two parts: the first part is the first s (with length n) and the second part is the second s (with length n) but with the first k characters overlapping with the last k of the first s.\n\n        Then, we have:\n\n            t = s + (s[k:])   [but wait, the first s is of length n, then the second s without the first k is appended, so the total length is n + (n - k) = 2*n - k]\n\n        But note: the first s is exactly the first n characters. Then the second part is the next n-k characters? Actually, the entire string t is built from two s's, so:\n\n            Let n be the length of s. Then the length of t is 2*n - k.\n\n        How can we find n and k?\n\n        Since t is given, we can try all possible splits. However, note that the entire string t must be the result of two copies of s with an overlap.\n\n        Conditions for a candidate n (the length of s) and k (the overlap) to be valid:\n\n            Let n be the length of s. Then the length of t must be 2*n - k, and k must be between 1 and n-1.\n\n            Also, the first n characters of t must be s, and then the next part (from index n to the end) must be s without the first k characters? Actually, no:\n\n            Actually, the entire t is built as:\n\n                t = s[0: n-k] + s[k:]   [then what?] \n\n            Alternatively, we can see:\n\n                The first n characters of t must be s, but then the next part must start with the overlapping part (the last k of s). And the entire second s must follow? Actually, no: the entire t is built from the two s's with the overlap.\n\n        Another way:\n\n            We require that t can be written as:\n\n                t = s + s[k:]   but then the first s is of length n, and the second part is s[k:] (so the total length is n + (n - k) = 2*n - k)\n\n            However, note: the first s is the entire s, and then we append the second s without the first k characters. But then how do we know that the first s is exactly the first n characters?\n\n            Actually, the entire string t is built from two s's, so the first n characters must be s, and then the next part (from n to the end) must be the second s without the first k characters, but wait: the second s is s, so the second part is s[k:].\n\n            Therefore, we have:\n\n                t[0:n] = s\n                t[n: ] = s[k:]\n\n            Also, the condition for the overlap is that the last k characters of the first s must equal the first k characters of the second s, i.e., \n\n                s[n-k: n] = s[0:k]\n\n            But note: s is the first n characters, so the last k of s is t[n-k: n] and the first k of s is t[0:k]. Therefore, we require:\n\n                t[n-k: n] == t[0:k]\n\n            And the entire second part (from n to the end) must be s[k:], i.e., the substring starting at index k of s (which is of length n-k) must equal the part from n to the end (which has length n-k). \n\n            But note: the length of the second part is (total length of t) - n = (2*n - k) - n = n - k.\n\n            So we also require:\n\n                t[n: n + (n-k)] = s[k: k + (n-k)]   but note: s[k:] is exactly of length n-k, so that matches.\n\n            Therefore, the conditions for a candidate n and k (with 1<=k<n) are:\n\n                Condition 1: The length of t must be 2*n - k.\n                Condition 2: The substring t[0:n] is s, and then the substring t[n: 2*n - k] must equal s[k:].\n\n            But note: we don't know n and k. However, note that the entire string t must be broken into two parts: the first part of length n and the second part of length n-k. And we know that the second part must be the same as the substring of s from k to the end.\n\n            Also, from condition 2 we have:\n\n                s = t[0:n]\n                and s[k:] = t[n: 2*n - k]\n\n            But note: 2*n - k is the total length, so the second part goes from n to the end (which is 2*n-k) and that is n-k characters.\n\n            Moreover, the condition for the overlap is that the last k of s (i.e., t[n-k:n]) must equal the first k of s (i.e., t[0:k]).\n\n            So, we can iterate over possible n (the length of s) and k (the overlap) such that:\n\n                n must satisfy: n >= ceil((len(t)+1)/2) and n <= len(t)-1? Not exactly.\n\n            Actually, the length of t is L = 2*n - k. Since k>=1, then L <= 2*n-1, and since k<=n-1, then L >= n+1.\n\n            So, n must be at least ceil((L+1)/2) and at most L-1.\n\n            But note: we don't know L (we do, L is the length of t). Then for each candidate n from floor((L+1)/2) to L-1, we can set k = 2*n - L (because L = 2*n - k => k = 2*n - L). Then we require that k is between 1 and n-1.\n\n            Then, for a candidate n:\n\n                k = 2*n - L\n                Conditions: 1 <= k <= n-1.\n\n            Then, we check:\n\n                Condition 1: The substring t[0:n] is s, and then the substring t[n: L] (which is from index n to the end, and has length L-n) must be equal to s[k:] (which has length n-k).\n\n                Condition 2: The substring t[L-n: n] (the last k characters of s) must equal t[0:k] (the first k characters of s).\n\n            Actually, condition 2 is automatically checked by condition 1? Because:\n\n                Condition 1 requires that the second part (of length n-k) is s[k:]. But s[k:] is the substring of s from index k to the end, which is exactly the part that is left after the overlap.\n\n            However, note: condition 2 is about the overlapping part: the last k of s must equal the first k of s. But wait, that is not necessarily true. Actually, the overlapping part condition is: the last k of the first s (which is t[0:n]'s last k) must equal the first k of the second s (which is s[0:k]). But note: the second s is the same as the first s, so the first k of the second s is the same as the first k of s. So condition 2 is: t[n-k: n] == t[0:k].\n\n            However, note: in our candidate, s is t[0:n]. Then condition 2 is: the last k of s (t[n-k:n]) must equal the first k of s (t[0:k]).\n\n            So we must check both:\n\n                (a) The second part (from n to the end) must be s[k:], i.e., t[n:] == s[k:]\n                (b) The last k characters of s (i.e., t[n-k:n]) must equal the first k characters of s (t[0:k])\n\n            But note: condition (b) is independent and necessary.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check:\n\n                Condition 1: The entire string t must be: \n                    t = s[0: n-k] + s   [wait, no: we have two s's with overlap, so the entire t is s (first copy) and then the second s without the overlapping part? Actually, the second s is included entirely except that the overlapping part is already accounted for in the first copy? \n\n            Let me clarify:\n\n                Without error: t0 = s+s (length 2*n)\n                With error (overlap k): t = s + s[k:]   (length n + (n-k) = 2*n - k)\n\n            So the entire t is: the first s (length n) and then the second s without its first k characters (length n-k). \n\n            Then, we can also note that the first n characters of t must be s (condition (a) above). Then the next part (from n to the end) must be s[k:].\n\n            Additionally, the overlapping condition is that the last k characters of the first s must equal the first k of the second s (which is the same as the first k of the entire s). \n\n            So, algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Let L = len(t)\n            Step 2: For candidate n (the length of s) from max(ceil((L+1)/2), ...) to L-1, but note: n must be at least ceil((L+1)/2) because 2*n - k = L and k<=n-1 implies 2*n - (n-1) >= L => n+1 >= L, but wait, that doesn't hold.\n\n            Actually, from L = 2*n - k and 1<=k<=n-1, we have:\n                n must satisfy: n >= ceil((L+1)/2) and n <= L-1.\n\n            Why ceil((L+1)/2)? Because k<=n-1 => L = 2*n - k >= 2*n - (n-1) = n+1, so n <= L-1 (which we already have). And also, k>=1 => L = 2*n - k <= 2*n-1, so n>= ceil((L+1)/2).\n\n            Example: L=21 -> n>= ceil(22/2)=11, and n<=20.\n\n            Now, for a candidate n, we set k = 2*n - L. Then we require 1<=k<=n-1.\n\n            Then, we check:\n\n                (a) The substring t[0:n] is s, and the substring t[n: L] must equal s[k:].\n\n                (b) Additionally, the last k characters of s (i.e., t[n-k: n]) must equal the first k characters of s (t[0:k]).\n\n            However, note: condition (b) is actually implied by the way we defined s? Not exactly: condition (b) is the condition for the error to occur (the overlapping part must match). But condition (a) ensures that the second part is correct, and condition (b) ensures that the two s's are the same and the overlapping part matches.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check condition (a) and condition (b) separately.\n\n            But note: condition (a) requires that the second part is s[k:], and s is t[0:n]. Then condition (a) is:\n\n                t[n: L] == t[k: n]   [because s[k:] is t[k: n]]\n\n            And condition (b) is:\n\n                t[n-k: n] == t[0:k]\n\n            So, for candidate n (with k=2*n-L):\n\n                Check1: t[n-k: n] == t[0:k]   (the overlapping part must match)\n                Check2: t[n: L] == t[k: n]   (the rest of the second s must match)\n\n            However, note: the second part of t (from n to the end) is of length L-n = (2*n - k) - n = n-k, and the substring t[k: n] is of length n-k. So Check2 is comparing two strings of length n-k.\n\n            Then, if both Check1 and Check2 hold, then we have found a candidate.\n\n            Then, we can output:\n\n                \"YES\"\n                s = t[0:n]\n\n            But note: what if there are multiple candidates? The problem says: if there are multiple possible s, output any.\n\n            However, we must also consider: what if the string t is the result of two copies of s without any error? Then we cannot have k=0, and without error the string is two copies of s (so length 2*n). But the problem says: \"Without error, the transmission would be s+s\", and that is not considered an error. So we must not output a candidate for k=0.\n\n            But note: our candidate k is from 1 to n-1. So if we find a candidate with k>=1, then we output YES and the candidate s.\n\n            What if the string t is the result of two copies of s without error? Then the length of t would be 2*n, and we don't consider k=0. But then we don't have a candidate for k=0 because our k must be at least 1. So we won't find a candidate for the case without error.\n\n            However, the problem states: \"if the message t does not contain errors\" then output \"NO\". This includes the case when t is two copies of s (without error) or simple concatenation (without error). \n\n            But note: the problem says: \"simple concatenation without error\" is not considered an error. So if t is two copies of s (without overlap) then we should output \"NO\".\n\n            But wait, what if t is two copies of s without error? Then t = s+s, so length 2*n. Then we would look for n such that 2*n - k = 2*n => k=0, but k must be at least 1. So no candidate n will satisfy the condition for k>=1. So we will output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n            However, what if t is the result of two copies of s with an error? Then we output YES and s.\n\n            Example: t = \"abcabc\"\n\n            This is two copies of \"abc\" without error, so we should output \"NO\".\n\n            But note: can we have an error in \"abcabc\"? \n\n            Let n=3, then k = 2*3 - 6 = 0 -> invalid (k must be at least 1). \n\n            Now, what if n=4? Then k=8-6=2. Then we check:\n\n                Check1: t[0:4] = \"abca\", then the last 2 of \"abca\" is \"ca\", and the first 2 is \"ab\" -> \"ca\" != \"ab\", fails.\n\n            n=5? Then k=10-6=4 -> but k=4 must be <= n-1=4 -> valid. Then:\n\n                Check1: t[0:5] = \"abcab\", last 4: \"caba\", first 4: \"abca\" -> not equal.\n\n            n=6? Then k=12-6=6 -> but k must be <=5 -> invalid.\n\n            So no candidate, so output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n            Example: t = \"acacacaca\"\n\n            According to the example, output is \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n            Let's check:\n\n            Length L=10.\n\n            Candidate n from ceil((10+1)/2)=ceil(5.5)=6 to 9.\n\n            n=6: k=12-10=2 -> valid (1<=2<=5)\n                s = t[0:6] = \"acacac\"\n                Check1: last 2 of s: \"ac\", first 2 of s: \"ac\" -> matches.\n                Check2: t[6:10] = \"aca\" (from index6 to 9) and s[2:6] = \"cac\" -> \"aca\" != \"cac\", fails.\n\n            n=7: k=14-10=4 -> valid (1<=4<=6)\n                s = t[0:7] = \"acacaca\"\n                Check1: last 4 of s: \"caca\", first 4 of s: \"acac\" -> not equal.\n\n            n=8: k=16-10=6 -> valid (1<=6<=7)\n                s = t[0:8] = \"acacacac\"\n                Check1: last 6 of s: \"cacaca\", first 6 of s: \"acacac\" -> not equal.\n\n            n=9: k=18-10=8 -> valid (1<=8<=8)\n                s = t[0:9] = \"acacacaca\"\n                Check1: last 8 of s: \"cacacaca\", first 8 of s: \"acacacaca\"[:8] -> \"acacacac\", not equal.\n\n            That didn't work. \n\n            But wait, the example output is \"acaca\", so n=5. \n\n            However, our candidate n must be at least ceil((10+1)/2)=6. Why did we skip n=5?\n\n            Let me reexamine the equation: L = 2*n - k, and k>=1, so n <= L-1=9, and n>= ceil((L+1)/2)=6. \n\n            But wait, the equation L=2*n-k, so n=(L+k)/2. Since k>=1, then n>= (L+1)/2, which is 5.5 -> ceil to 6. However, n must be an integer and k must be an integer.\n\n            But note: the equation must hold exactly. For n=5, then k=2*5 - 10=0 -> invalid.\n\n            Then how did the example say \"acaca\" is the answer?\n\n            Let me check: s=\"acaca\", then without error: s+s = \"acacacaca\", which is t. But wait, that is without error, so we should output \"NO\". However, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n            Wait, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n            But note: the example says: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\"\n\n            Actually, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"YES\\nacaca\", meaning that they are saying that the original s is \"acaca\", and then the transmission of two copies of \"acaca\" with an error (overlap) produces \"acacacaca\". \n\n            How?\n\n            With s=\"acaca\", n=5.\n\n            Then the total length of t should be 2*5 - k = 10 - k. But we have t of length 10, so k=0. But k must be positive.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the error can happen in the middle? Actually, the problem says: the two messages are the same. So the two messages are both \"acaca\". Then without error, we have \"acacacaca\". With error, we can have an overlap. \n\n            How can we get \"acacacaca\" from two copies of \"acaca\" with an error?\n\n            Let me break t=\"acacacaca\" into two parts: the first s and the second s with overlap.\n\n            Possibility: \n                First s: \"acaca\"\n                Second s: \"acaca\"\n\n            But then the entire t is \"acacacaca\", which is 10. Without error, that's two copies. With error, we must have an overlap. \n\n            The error occurs if the last k of the first s equals the first k of the second s. But if we choose k=0, that's not allowed. \n\n            Alternatively, maybe the error occurred at the boundary? \n\n            The problem says: \"the two messages are transmitted consecutively\", and the error is that they are merged by overlapping. So the entire t must be the first s (without the last k) and then the entire second s? Or the first s and then the second s without the first k? \n\n            Actually, the definition: \n                t = s[0: n-k] + s[k:]\n\n            For s=\"acaca\", n=5, k=2: \n                t = s[0:3] + s[2:5] = \"aca\" + \"aca\" = \"acaca\" -> which is of length 5, but we have t of length 10.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the error happened only once? \n\n            Let me read the problem again: \"При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка\". So two messages. Then the entire string t is the result of two copies.\n\n            But note: the example input \"acacacaca\" is 10 characters. The example output is \"acaca\", which is 5.\n\n            How is 5 the candidate? Then the two copies would be 5+5=10, so without error. But we are allowed to have an error that causes the two copies to merge. \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" -> meaning that if the entire second message is overlapped (k=n) then that is not an error? But k must be less than n. So k=n is not allowed.\n\n            Then how did they get \"acaca\" as the answer? \n\n            Let me reexamine the example: \n\n                Input: \"acacacaca\"\n\n            They say: output \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n            How can two copies of \"acaca\" (which is 5) produce \"acacacaca\" (10) with an error? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\" -> wait, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"acaca\", but the note says: \"Во вторном примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca\" — meaning that there is another possibility: \"acacaca\" (which is 7 characters). \n\n            But the example output is \"acaca\", so we output the candidate s.\n\n            Let me try with s=\"acaca\", n=5. Then the two copies without error: \"acacacaca\" (10). But that is the same as t. So we cannot explain t as two copies of s with an error (because k must be positive and less than 5) because then the length would be 5 + (5-k) = 10-k, which is less than 10. \n\n            Alternatively, perhaps the error can occur in the second copy? Or maybe we can break t differently?\n\n            The problem does not specify that the entire t must be broken into two copies of s with an overlap. It says: \"определите возможное значение s\". \n\n            Let me consider: \n                t = \"acacacaca\"\n\n            How can this be broken into two copies of s with an error?\n\n            One possibility: s=\"acac\" (n=4). Then k=8-10=-2 -> invalid.\n\n            Another: s=\"aca\" (n=3). Then k=6-10=-4 -> invalid.\n\n            Another: s=\"cacaca\" (n=6). Then k=12-10=2 -> valid. Then:\n\n                s = \"cacaca\"\n                Check1: last 2 of s: \"ca\", first 2 of s: \"ca\" -> matches.\n                Check2: t[6:10] = \"caca\", and s[2:6] = \"acac\" -> \"caca\" != \"acac\", fails.\n\n            Another: s=\"acacac\" (n=6). Then k=12-10=2 -> valid.\n                s = \"acacac\"\n                Check1: last 2: \"ac\", first 2: \"ac\" -> matches.\n                Check2: t[6:10] = \"caca\", and s[2:6] = \"cacac\" (from index2 to5) -> \"caca\" vs \"cacac\" -> lengths don't match (4 vs 4? Actually, s[2:6] is 4 characters: \"cacac\" has 5? Actually, s=\"acacac\": indices0-5: \"a\",\"c\",\"a\",\"c\",\"a\",\"c\"\n                s[2:6] = \"acac\" (4 characters) and t[6:10] is 4 characters: \"caca\" -> \"acac\" vs \"caca\": not equal.\n\n            Another: s=\"acacacaca\" (n=9) -> k=18-10=8 -> valid.\n                Check1: last 8: \"cacacaca\", first 8: \"acacacac\" -> not equal.\n\n            I'm confused.\n\n            Let me read the example again: the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"YES\\nacaca\". \n\n            The example says: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca\" — meaning that there is another valid s: \"acacaca\". \n\n            So the example input is \"acacacaca\", and two possible s: \"acaca\" and \"acacaca\"?\n\n            But note: the example output only outputs one candidate: \"acaca\".\n\n            How can \"acaca\" be valid?\n\n            Let me assume that the error occurred in the first copy and the second copy is not fully included? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: the two messages are the same. So the two messages are both s. Then the entire t is built from two copies of s with an error. \n\n            But note: the problem does not require that the entire second copy is included. It only says that the two messages are merged by overlapping.\n\n            Let me consider the definition: \n\n                t = s[0: n-k] + s[k:]\n\n            For s=\"acaca\", n=5, and k=2: \n                t = \"acaca\"[0:3] + \"acaca\"[2:5] = \"aca\" + \"aca\" = \"acaca\" (length 5). \n\n            But our t is 10.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the error can occur twice? The problem only describes one error: during the transmission of two consecutive identical messages. \n\n            Another idea: maybe the string t is the result of two copies of s, but the error occurred in the first copy and the second copy was transmitted without error? \n\n            But the problem states: \"при передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка\", meaning that the error happens during the transmission of the two messages. \n\n            After reading the problem statement again: \"the two messages are transmitted consecutively\", so we have two messages. The entire string t is the result of the two transmissions with an error (if applicable).\n\n            How can we get a string of length 10 from two copies of \"acaca\" (each of length 5) with an error? \n\n            The error condition: the two messages are merged by overlapping. The overlapping part must be positive and less than 5.\n\n            Then the total length is 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k. We need 10 - k = 10 -> k=0, which is not allowed.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the error is not applied to both copies? \n\n            Let me consider: the problem says \"two identical messages\". Then the entire string t should be the result of merging these two. \n\n            The only way to get a string of length 10 from two copies of \"acaca\" is to have no error (concatenation) or an error that results in a length of 10-k (k>=1) which is less than 10.\n\n            Unless the error can occur in a different manner? \n\n            Let me re-read the example: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is produced from \"abrakadabra\" with two possibilities: k=1 and k=4.\n\n            For k=1: length = 11 + 11 - 1 = 21.\n            For k=4: length = 11 + 11 - 4 = 18.\n\n            But our example \"acacacaca\" has length 10. \n\n            How can we get 10? \n\n            We need two copies of s, each of length n, and an overlap of k, so total length = 2*n - k = 10.\n\n            We have two equations: n is the length of s, and k is the overlap (1<=k<n).\n\n            We can also consider: the entire t might be broken into two parts: the first part is the first s, and the second part is the second s, but the second s is not necessarily appended entirely? \n\n            Actually, the definition says: the two messages are merged by overlapping. So the entire second message is not necessarily included. The only requirement is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of at least one character (but less than the length of `s`). If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking two copies of `s` and merging them such that the end of the first `s` overlaps with the start of the second `s`. The overlapping part must be a positive number of characters and less than the length of `s`.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `n` of `s`, we check if `t` can be split into two parts: the first part being `s` (of length `n`) and the second part being the remaining characters of `s` after the overlap. The overlap length `k` is derived from the equation `2*n - k = len(t)`, ensuring `k` is between 1 and `n-1`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `n` of `s` (from `ceil((len(t)+1)/2)` to `len(t)-1`). For each `n`, compute `k = 2*n - len(t)`. If `k` is within the valid range, verify:\n   - The last `k` characters of the first `s` (first `n` characters of `t`) match the first `k` characters of `s`.\n   - The remaining part of `t` (after the first `n` characters) matches the substring of `s` starting from index `k`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible lengths `n` up to `len(t)`, making it efficient for strings up to 100 characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    L = len(t)\n    found = False\n    ans_s = None\n    \n    for n in range((L + 1) // 2, L):\n        k_val = 2 * n - L\n        if k_val < 1 or k_val >= n:\n            continue\n            \n        s_candidate = t[:n]\n        part2 = t[n:]\n        expected_part2 = s_candidate[k_val:]\n        \n        if part2 != expected_part2:\n            continue\n            \n        if s_candidate[-k_val:] == s_candidate[:k_val]:\n            found = True\n            ans_s = s_candidate\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(ans_s)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `found` (to track if a valid `s` is found) and `ans_s` (to store the candidate `s`) are initialized.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `n` of `s` (from `(L+1)//2` to `L-1`):\n   - Calculate `k_val` as `2*n - L`. If `k_val` is not within the valid range (1 to `n-1`), skip to the next iteration.\n   - Extract the first `n` characters of `t` as the candidate `s`.\n   - Check if the remaining part of `t` matches the substring of `s` starting from `k_val`.\n   - Verify the overlapping condition (last `k_val` characters of `s` match the first `k_val` characters).\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways `t` could be formed by merging two copies of `s` with a valid overlap, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
