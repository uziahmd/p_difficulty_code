Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n Since R, B are at most 10, we can use a combinatorial approach.\n\n However, note: We require a perfect matching (so R must equal B? Actually the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\" and \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so it must be that R == B. Otherwise, if R != B, then there's no perfect matching? But wait: the input says \"For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, ...\", and then \"the following B lines\". So we have R rebels and B bases.\n\n But note: the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian\", meaning each base is guarded by one spaceship. And each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. This implies that the number of bases must equal the number of spaceships? Actually, no: the problem does not explicitly say that the assignment is between the same set. However, reading the problem again: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This is a perfect matching from the set of rebels to the set of bases. Therefore, we must have R = B.\n\n But wait: the example input has two examples: \n Example 1: R=3, B=3 -> output 'Yes'\n Example 2: R=2, B=1 -> output 'No'\n\n So in the second example, we cannot have a perfect matching because the numbers don't match. So first check: if R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n However, note the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input format. The problem does not guarantee that R == B. In fact, the input constraints are 1<=R,B<=10, but they can be different.\n\n So step 1: Read R and B. Then read R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n If R != B, then we can immediately output 'No'. But wait, the problem says \"perfect matching\": that requires |R| = |B|. So yes, if R != B, then no.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and the conditions. The condition of having a perfect matching requires that the two sets have the same size. So if R != B, we output 'No'.\n\n But there is an additional constraint: the non-intersecting condition.\n\n Now, what does the non-intersecting condition mean?\n We have to assign each rebel to a base with a straight line (segment). The condition is that any two such segments (from a base to its assigned rebel) do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D)\".\n\n Important: The entire set of points (rebels and bases) is given, and we are going to draw a matching between them. We need to check if there exists a matching (a set of non-intersecting edges) that connects every base to exactly one rebel and vice versa.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n 2. We have two sets: \n      S = list of rebels (size R)\n      T = list of bases (size B, and R==B)\n\n 3. We need to find a bijection f: S -> T such that the straight line segments { (s, f(s)) for all s in S } do not intersect.\n\n Note: The problem does not require the matching to be fixed. We have to decide if there exists at least one matching.\n\n Observation: The non-intersecting condition is similar to non-crossing matching in the plane. However, note that the points are arbitrary and not necessarily in convex position or even sorted.\n\n However, note the following: if we fix an order (say, by x-coordinate) then we might be able to check for crossings.\n\n But wait: the problem does not specify that the bases and rebels are labeled in any particular way. We are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n We can use a recursive backtracking (since R, B <= 10, and R==B, so maximum 10, then the worst-case number of assignments is 10! which is 3.6 million, which is acceptable in Python for small n=10).\n\n However, we must also check for non-intersecting segments during the matching.\n\n But note: the condition is that the entire set of segments (for the matching) must be non-intersecting. We don't allow two segments to cross (even if they are from two different pairs).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a known fact: the non-crossing matching in the plane is possible if and only if the points (both rebels and bases) can be partitioned into pairs such that the chords (segments) do not cross.\n\n However, note: we have two distinct sets: rebels and bases. The entire set of points is the union of the two. But the condition is about the segments connecting the two sets.\n\n Another idea: we can use the concept of planarity for bipartite matching? But note, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two segments (each connecting a base to a rebel) should not intersect.\n\n We can think of the problem as: given two sets of points (S and T) in the plane, is there a perfect matching (each point in S matched to one in T) such that the matching is non-crossing?\n\n However, there is a catch: the matching is between two sets, so the segments are between two sets. We can use the following:\n\n Step 1: Check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n\n Step 2: We can try to sort both sets by x-coordinate (or by some other order) and then try to assign in a way that the matching is non-crossing.\n\n But note: the non-crossing condition for two sets: \n\n Consider the following: \n   Let A = rebels, B = bases.\n\n We want to assign each a in A to b in B without crossing.\n\n There is a known result: if we fix an ordering of the entire set of points (by x-coordinate, and for same x by y-coordinate) then we can consider the following:\n\n However, note: the two sets are distinct. We can try to sort the rebels and bases independently by x, then by y.\n\n Then, we can use a recursive method that tries to assign the leftmost rebel to the leftmost base (or the one that minimizes crossing) but that is complicated.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy method: \n\n We know that if we have two segments (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) that cross, then the condition for crossing is that the points are interleaved in both x and y? Actually, two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) cross if and only if the points p1, p2, q1, q2 are in cyclic order (when sorted by x, then by y) such that they alternate.\n\n However, we can use a simpler idea: \n\n Sort all the points (from both sets) by x (and then by y). Then, we can use dynamic programming or recursion with memo to try all matchings, but the state space is too big.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following observation:\n\n In a non-crossing matching between two sets, if we fix the order of the rebels and the order of the bases (by x-coordinate), then the matching must be order-preserving in the sense of the slopes? Actually, a well-known fact is that the non-crossing matching in the plane for two sets (if we assume general position) is unique up to the order of the endpoints? \n\n But note: we have two sets. We can combine the two sets and then consider the matching as a permutation.\n\n However, there is a known algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching:\n\n  1. Sort the rebels by x (and if tie, by y) and the bases by x (and if tie, by y).\n  2. Then, we can use a recursive function that assigns the leftmost rebel to one of the bases that is available and then checks that the entire matching from the remaining rebels and bases is non-crossing.\n\n But how to check for non-crossing? We can check the current segment against all previously drawn segments. But note: when we assign a rebel to a base, we must ensure that the segment does not cross any existing segment.\n\n However, we can use the following: \n\n When we have two segments (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) (with a1, a2 being rebels and b1, b2 being bases) and a1.x < a2.x, then for non-crossing, we must have b1.x < b2.x OR if the bases are not sorted by x then we have to adjust.\n\n Actually, let us sort the rebels by x-coordinate (and if same x, by y). Similarly, sort the bases by x (and if same x, by y). Then, we can assign the leftmost rebel to a base, but which base?\n\n Theorem: In a non-crossing matching, the leftmost point (smallest x) in one set must be matched to the leftmost point in the other set? Not necessarily.\n\n Example: \n   Rebels: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n   Bases: [ (-1,1), (1,0) ]\n\n If we assign (0,0) to (-1,1) and (2,0) to (1,0): \n   Segment from (0,0) to (-1,1) and from (2,0) to (1,0) do not cross.\n\n But if we assign (0,0) to (1,0) and (2,0) to (-1,1): \n   The segment from (0,0) to (1,0) and from (2,0) to (-1,1) will cross.\n\n So the matching must be such that the order of the bases in x-coordinate is the same as the order of the rebels? \n\n Actually, we can use the following: \n\n Sort the rebels by x (and then by y). Sort the bases by x (and then by y). Then, we can use a recursive backtracking that assigns the next rebel (in increasing x) to a base that is to the right of the last used base? \n\n But wait, we can also assign to a base that is already used? No, we are doing a matching.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n After sorting both sets by x, we can consider that the matching must be such that if we look at the sequence of bases that we pick for the rebels (in the order of increasing x of rebels), then the x-coordinates of the bases must be increasing? \n\n Why? Because if we have two rebels a1, a2 (a1.x < a2.x) and we assign a1 to base b1 and a2 to base b2, then if b1.x > b2.x, then the segments (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) would cross? \n\n Actually, the condition for two segments (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) (with a1.x < a2.x) to not cross is that the bases must be assigned in increasing x order. That is, if a1.x < a2.x, then we must have b1.x < b2.x. \n\n But wait, what if the bases are not aligned in a simple way? Consider:\n\n   a1 = (0,0), a2 = (2,0)\n   b1 = (1,1), b2 = (3,0)\n\n Then, if we assign a1->b1 and a2->b2: \n   The segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(3,0) do not cross.\n\n But now, if we swap: a1->b2 and a2->b1:\n   (0,0)-(3,0) and (2,0)-(1,1): \n   These two segments: one from (0,0) to (3,0) and the other from (2,0) to (1,1). Do they cross?\n   The first segment goes from (0,0) to (3,0) (horizontal). The second from (2,0) to (1,1). They meet at (2,0) but (2,0) is an endpoint. However, the problem says \"paths\" and \"do not intersect\". Typically, endpoints are allowed. But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two distinct segments. At endpoints, the segments meet at the base or the rebel. But note: two segments that share an endpoint (like at a base or a rebel) are allowed? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship\". So two segments that share an endpoint are not considered as crossing? Because they meet at the base or the rebel. So we must allow that.\n\n However, the condition for two segments (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) to cross (without sharing an endpoint) is when the two segments intersect at an interior point.\n\n So the necessary and sufficient condition for two segments (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) (with a1,a2 distinct and b1,b2 distinct) to not cross is that the four endpoints do not form a quadrilateral in which the two segments are the diagonals.\n\n But note: we have two sets: rebels and bases. The segments are from rebels to bases.\n\n Condition for two segments (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) to cross: \n   Without loss of generality, assume a1.x < a2.x.\n   Then, the segments cross if and only if b1.x < a2.x and b2.x > a1.x? \n\n Actually, the standard condition for two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) to cross is:\n\n   (p1.x - p2.x)*(q1.x - q2.x) < 0 and (p1.y - p2.y)*(q1.y - q2.y) < 0\n\n But wait, that's for two segments defined by two points each. However, note our segments are (a1, b1) and (a2, b2). \n\n Actually, we can use the orientation test. \n\n However, note: we are building a matching one by one. We can check the entire matching by testing every pair of edges? But that would be O(n^2) for each candidate matching, and the total number of matchings is factorial, so that would be too slow.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Sort the rebels by x. Then, we must assign the bases in increasing x order as well. Why? Because if we assign a base with a smaller x to a rebel that is later (larger x) then we might get a crossing. Actually, the necessary condition is that the matching must be monotone: if we list the rebels in increasing x and the corresponding bases in increasing x, then the sequence of base x's must be increasing.\n\n But is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: \n   Rebels: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n   Bases: [ (1,1), (3,0) ]\n\n If we assign in increasing x of rebels: \n   First rebel (0,0) must be assigned to the base with the smallest x? \n   Then we have two bases: (1,1) and (3,0). The smallest x is 1, so assign (0,0) to (1,1). Then the next rebel (2,0) must be assigned to (3,0). Then the two segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(3,0). They don't cross.\n\n Now, if we try to assign the first rebel (0,0) to (3,0) and the second to (1,1): \n   Then we have (0,0)-(3,0) and (2,0)-(1,1). Now, these two segments: \n   (0,0)-(3,0) is a horizontal line from (0,0) to (3,0). The segment (2,0)-(1,1) goes from (2,0) to (1,1). They share the point (2,0) (which is an endpoint of the second segment) and the first segment includes (2,0). But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two distinct segments. The two segments share an endpoint? Actually, the endpoints are the rebels and the bases. The rebels are distinct and the bases are distinct. So the two segments (0,0)-(3,0) and (2,0)-(1,1) do not share an endpoint. They do not share a base (because bases are distinct) and do not share a rebel (because rebels are distinct). However, the point (2,0) is a rebel (so the second segment starts at (2,0)) and the first segment goes from (0,0) to (3,0) and passes through (2,0). But (2,0) is an endpoint of the second segment, and the first segment has (2,0) as an interior point? \n\n Wait, the first segment from (0,0) to (3,0) includes (2,0) as an interior point. And the second segment starts at (2,0). So they share the point (2,0). Is that allowed? \n\n The problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". The two paths are from base (3,0) to rebel (0,0) and from base (1,1) to rebel (2,0). The two paths share the point (2,0). But (2,0) is the endpoint of the second path (it's the rebel). The first path (from (3,0) to (0,0)) passes through (2,0). \n\n However, note: the condition is that the paths do not intersect. The first path is the set of points from (3,0) to (0,0). The second path is the set of points from (1,1) to (2,0). The two sets of points have a common point (2,0). \n\n But wait, the problem says \"paths\" meaning the entire straight line? Or just the segment? The problem says \"straight paths\" and then specifies \"from a base to its assigned spaceship\". So we are drawing the segment. The segment from (3,0) to (0,0) is the set of points {(x,0) for x in [0,3]}. The segment from (1,1) to (2,0) is the set of points {(1+t, 1-t) for t in [0,1]} (assuming linear interpolation). \n\n Do they intersect? The first segment is the x-axis from 0 to 3. The second segment goes from (1,1) to (2,0). It crosses the x-axis at (2,0). But (2,0) is the endpoint of the second segment. \n\n According to the problem statement, does the intersection at an endpoint count? \n\n Let me read: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". \n\n Typically, in graph drawing, two edges that share a vertex are not considered to cross. However, note: the two segments share the point (2,0) which is the endpoint of the second segment and an interior point of the first segment. \n\n But the problem says \"paths\" from base to spaceship. The base is (3,0) and the spaceship is (0,0) for the first path. The base is (1,1) and the spaceship is (2,0) for the second path.\n\n The two paths share the point (2,0) which is the spaceship (rebel) of the second path. The first path goes through that point (but that point is not a base nor a spaceship for the first path). \n\n However, note the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning we are considering two distinct paths. The condition is that they do not intersect. The definition of intersection typically includes touching at endpoints. \n\n But wait, the problem says \"do not intersect\". In geometry, two segments that share an endpoint are said to intersect at that endpoint. \n\n Therefore, the example above would be invalid.\n\n So the condition is that the segments must not share any point (even endpoints) except the endpoints that are intended (i.e., the base and the rebel for each segment). But note: the endpoints are distinct: the rebels are distinct and the bases are distinct. However, the two segments might share a base or a rebel? \n\n Actually, no: because the matching is a bijection, each base is used once and each rebel is used once. Therefore, the two segments share a point only if that point is either a base or a rebel that is common to both. But since the bases are distinct and rebels are distinct, the only way two segments share a point is if they share a base or a rebel. But we are using each base and each rebel exactly once, so two distinct segments cannot share a base or a rebel. \n\n However, wait: the rebels and bases are distinct sets. So the two segments are from {rebels} to {bases}. Therefore, the endpoints of the two segments are disjoint? \n\n Actually, the endpoints are: \n   Segment1: (rebel1, base1)\n   Segment2: (rebel2, base2)\n\n Since the rebels are distinct and bases are distinct, the two sets of endpoints are disjoint. Therefore, the two segments can only intersect at an interior point.\n\n Therefore, the condition is that the segments must not intersect at any interior point.\n\n Now, the problem becomes: does there exist a bijection f from rebels to bases such that the set of segments {(r, f(r)) for all r} has no two segments that intersect (at an interior point)?\n\n Now, we can use the following:\n\n Sort the rebels by x (and if tie, by y). Then, we must assign bases in increasing x order (because if two rebels a1, a2 (a1.x < a2.x) are assigned bases b1, b2, then if b1.x > b2.x, the segments (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) might cross). \n\n Actually, we can use the following theorem: \n\n For two sets of points (A and B) in the plane, a non-crossing matching exists if and only if there is a non-crossing matching when we sort A and B by x and then match in order? \n\n But wait, consider:\n\n   A (rebels): [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   B (bases): [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n If we sort by x (both have x=0 and x=1 for bases, but rebels have two x=0). Then we have to assign the two rebels at x=0 to the two bases at x=1. \n\n If we assign (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (1,-1): \n   The two segments: (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,2)-(1,-1). Do they cross? \n\n   The first segment goes from (0,0) to (1,1) (line y=x). The second from (0,2) to (1,-1) (line y = -3x+2). They intersect at (0.4, 0.4) which is an interior point. \n\n But if we assign (0,0) to (1,-1) and (0,2) to (1,1): \n   The two segments: (0,0)-(1,-1) (y=-x) and (0,2)-(1,1) (y=-x+2). They are parallel and never meet.\n\n So the order of assignment matters.\n\n However, note: if we sort the rebels by x and then by y (so (0,0) then (0,2)), and sort the bases by x and then by y (so (1,-1) then (1,1)), then we can assign the smallest x rebel to the smallest x base, and then the next rebel to the next base. \n\n But wait, the rebels are at the same x? Then we break the tie by y.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\"\n\n So the rebels at the same x: we can sort by y. Similarly for bases.\n\n Then, the algorithm:\n\n  1. Check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n  2. Sort the rebels by x (increasing), and for same x by y (increasing).\n  3. Sort the bases by x (increasing), and for same x by y (increasing).\n  4. Then, we can use a greedy matching: assign the i-th rebel (in the sorted order) to the i-th base (in the sorted order). Then, we check if the entire matching is non-crossing.\n\n But wait, the example above: \n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)] -> sorted: first (0,0), then (0,2)\n   Bases: [(1,-1), (1,1)] -> sorted: first (1,-1), then (1,1)\n\n Then the greedy matching: \n   (0,0) -> (1,-1)\n   (0,2) -> (1,1)\n\n And we saw that this matching is non-crossing.\n\n Now, what if we had:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,-1)]   # same bases but sorted differently: by y: (1,-1) then (1,1) -> so same as above.\n\n But if we sort the bases by x and then by y: we get (1,-1) then (1,1). \n\n However, what if we have:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,-1)]   # but if we sort bases by x (then by y) we still get (1,-1) then (1,1).\n\n So the greedy matching (matching sorted rebels to sorted bases) works for the above.\n\n But consider:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2), (0,3)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\n Then, matching: \n   (0,0) -> (1,1)\n   (0,2) -> (1,2)\n   (0,3) -> (1,3)\n\n These segments are vertical and do not cross.\n\n Now, what if we have:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2), (0,1)]   -> sort by x then y: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]     -> sorted: [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)]\n\n Then matching:\n   (0,0) -> (1,1)\n   (0,1) -> (1,2)\n   (0,2) -> (1,3)\n\n These are vertical and do not cross.\n\n But what if we have:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,0), (1,1)]\n\n Then, greedy matching: \n   (0,0) -> (1,0)\n   (0,2) -> (1,1)\n\n Now, check the segments: \n   (0,0)-(1,0): horizontal line at y=0 from x=0 to x=1.\n   (0,2)-(1,1): from (0,2) to (1,1) which is the line y = -x + 2.\n\n They don't cross.\n\n Now, what if we have:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n We already did: greedy matching (by sorted order) gives non-crossing.\n\n But what if we have a case where greedy fails?\n\n Example: \n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,-1)]   -> we saw that the greedy matching (by sorted order) is non-crossing.\n\n Now, consider:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2), (0,4)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (1,3), (1,5)]\n\n Greedy: \n   (0,0)->(1,1); (0,2)->(1,3); (0,4)->(1,5) -> non-crossing.\n\n Another example:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2), (0,4)]\n   Bases: [(1,3), (1,1), (1,5)]   -> sort bases: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5)\n\n Then greedy: (0,0)->(1,1); (0,2)->(1,3); (0,4)->(1,5) -> non-crossing.\n\n Now, what if we have:\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,2), (1,0)]\n\n Then, sort bases: (1,0) then (1,2).

But wait, (1,1) is an endpoint of the first segment and an interior point of the second? \n\n The second segment goes from (0,2) to (2,0). The equation: \n   From (0,2) to (2,0): parametric equations: x=t, y=2-t, for t from 0 to 2.\n   At t=1, we have (1,1). \n\n But (1,1) is the base (1,1) and also the endpoint of the first segment. \n\n However, the bases are distinct and the rebels are distinct. The first segment is from base (1,1) to rebel (0,0). The second segment is from base (2,0) to rebel (0,2). \n\n The two segments share the point (1,1) which is the base (1,1) and also lies on the second segment. But note: (1,1) is not a base for the second segment and not a rebel for the second segment. \n\n However, the condition is that the entire segment (from base to rebel) must not intersect. The two segments share (1,1). \n\n But note: the base (1,1) is an endpoint of the first segment, and the second segment goes from (0,2) to (2,0). The second segment passes through (1,1). \n\n Therefore, they intersect at (1,1). \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two distinct paths. The two paths are from base (1,1) to rebel (0,0) and from base (2,0) to rebel (0,2). The first path ends at (1,1) and the second path goes through (1,1). \n\n But note: the base (1,1) is part of the first path and also lies on the second path. \n\n The problem says: \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two distinct paths. The two paths are distinct. The condition is that they do not intersect. \n\n The definition of intersection: two geometric objects intersect if they have at least one point in common. \n\n So the two segments share (1,1). \n\n Therefore, this matching is invalid.\n\n Now, what if we try the other matching?\n\n   Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n   Bases: [(1,1), (2,0)]\n\n Alternative matching: (0,0) -> (2,0); (0,2) -> (1,1)\n\n Then, segments:\n   (0,0)-(2,0): horizontal at y=0 from x=0 to x=2.\n   (0,2)-(1,1): from (0,2) to (1,1) -> y = -x+2.\n\n Now, do they intersect? \n   The first segment is the x-axis from 0 to 2. The second segment goes from (0,2) to (1,1). It crosses the x-axis at (1,0)? But (1,0) is not on the second segment (because the second segment at x=1 is y=1). \n\n Actually, the second segment is above the x-axis until x=2. The first segment is the x-axis. The second segment does not touch the first segment? \n\n Let me check: \n   The first segment: y=0, x from 0 to 2.\n   The second segment: from (0,2) to (1,1) (and then continues to (2,0) but wait, no: the second segment is only from (0,2) to (1,1). \n\n Actually, the alternative matching uses base (2,0) for the first rebel (0,0) and base (1,1) for the second rebel (0,2). \n\n The two segments: \n   Segment1: (0,0) to (2,0) -> y=0, x from 0 to 2.\n   Segment2: (0,2) to (1,1) -> equation: from (0,2) to (1,1): y = -x+2.\n\n They do not intersect: the second segment is above the x-axis (except at x=2, but x=2 is not in the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and a set of bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking two main conditions: first, the number of spaceships must equal the number of bases for a perfect matching to be possible; second, the matching must be non-crossing.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching Condition**: If the number of spaceships (R) is not equal to the number of bases (B), output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Sorting Points**: Sort both the spaceships and bases by their x-coordinates. If two points have the same x-coordinate, sort them by their y-coordinates to break ties.\n3. **Greedy Matching**: Assign each spaceship to a base in the order they appear after sorting. This greedy approach ensures that the segments connecting spaceships to bases are as non-crossing as possible.\n4. **Non-Crossing Check**: For each segment, verify that it does not intersect with any other segment. This is done by ensuring that for any two segments, the endpoints do not interleave in a way that causes crossing. Specifically, for two segments (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) where a1.x < a2.x, the condition b1.x < b2.x must hold to avoid crossing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef orientation(a, b, c):\n    val = (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - b.x) - (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - b.y)\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef do_segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n    p1, q1 = seg1\n    p2, q2 = seg2\n    \n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n    \n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n        \n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(p1, q1, p2):\n        return True\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(p1, q1, q2):\n        return True\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(p2, q2, p1):\n        return True\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(p2, q2, q1):\n        return True\n        \n    return False\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    if min(a.x, b.x) <= c.x <= max(a.x, b.x) and min(a.y, b.y) <= c.y <= max(a.y, b.y):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    idx = 0\n    R = int(data[idx]); B = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n    rebels = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        x = int(data[idx]); y = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        x = int(data[idx]); y = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels.sort(key=lambda point: (point[0], point[1]))\n    bases.sort(key=lambda point: (point[0], point[1]))\n    \n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        segments.append( (rebels[i], bases[i]) )\n        \n    n = len(segments)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if do_segments_intersect( (segments[i][0], segments[i][1]), (segments[j][0], segments[j][1]) ):\n                print(\"No\")\n                return\n                \n    print(\"Yes\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Perfect Matching Check**: If R and B are not equal, the answer is immediately \"No\" because a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Sorting**: Both the spaceships and bases are sorted by their x-coordinates (and y-coordinates as a secondary key to handle ties).\n4. **Segment Creation**: Segments are created by pairing each spaceship with a base in the order they appear after sorting.\n5. **Intersection Check**: For each pair of segments, the `do_segments_intersect` function checks if they intersect using orientation tests and segment collinearity checks.
