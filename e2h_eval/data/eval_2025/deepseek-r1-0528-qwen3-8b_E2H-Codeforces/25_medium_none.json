При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it is the result of two identical messages `s` being sent with a possible error that causes overlapping.\n\n Conditions:\n - The entire string `t` must be formed by concatenating two copies of `s` (with the second copy overlapping the first one at some positive length, which is less than the length of `s`).\n - However, note that the problem also says that if the entire string is just two copies without any overlap (like \"abcabc\"), that is not considered an error. So we only consider cases where there is an actual overlap (so the string length is more than twice the length of the base string? Actually, note: the example says \"abrakadabrakadabra\" is formed by two \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1. So the total length is 21, and the base string is 11. The condition for the error is that the message is the result of two identical messages with a positive overlap (but not complete).\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are looking for a string s such that:\n   t = s + s[overlap:]   for some overlap in [1, len(s)-1]\n\n But note: the entire string t must be the concatenation of two copies of s with an overlap. This implies that the total length of t is between (if we break it down): \n   Let k = len(s). Then we have: \n        t = s[0: k - overlap] + s   OR actually, wait: \n\n Actually, the process is: \n   First message: s\n   Second message: s, but when sending the second message, the last `overlap` characters of the first message and the first `overlap` of the second message must match. Then the resulting string is: s + s[overlap:]\n\n However, note that the entire string t must be exactly the result of the first s and then the second s without the first `overlap` part? Actually, no: the second s is sent, but because the last `overlap` of the first and the first `overlap` of the second are the same, they are merged. So the total string is: s[0:k] + s[overlap:k] = s + s[overlap:]\n\n Therefore, we have: t = s + s[overlap:], and we know that the length of s must be at least 2 (since overlap is at least 1 and less than k, so k>=2).\n\n But note: the problem says that the error may occur only if the two messages are identical, and the merge happens by matching the end of the first with the beginning of the second.\n\n Also note: the problem says that the entire message t must be explained by this error. And the error can happen only when two identical messages are sent. So we are assuming that the original two messages were both s.\n\n How can we find s?\n\n Observation:\n   Since t is the result of two s's with an overlap, we can think of t as having a prefix that is s and then a suffix that is s[overlap:]. Therefore, the entire string t must be composed from two parts: the first part is s, and the second part is s without the first `overlap` characters.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider splitting t into two parts: the first part is the whole s (which is of length k), and the second part is the remaining (n - k) characters. But note that the second part is actually the tail of s (from index `overlap` to the end) and the first part is the whole s.\n\n Also note: the two s's are identical, so the entire string t must be such that if we take the first k characters (which is s) and then the next (k - overlap) characters, that must equal the last (k - overlap) of s.\n\n However, we don't know k. But note: the entire string t must be built from two copies of s. Therefore, we can also think of t as having a period of k, but with a twist: the second copy starts at position k-overlap.\n\n Actually, note: the total length of t is n. We have two s's, and the second s overlaps the first by `overlap` (which is between 1 and k-1). Then the length of t is k + (k - overlap) = 2*k - overlap.\n\n Therefore, n = 2*k - overlap.\n\n Since overlap is at least 1 and at most k-1, then k must satisfy: k >= ceil(n/2 + 1)? Actually, from n = 2*k - overlap, and since overlap < k, we have:\n   n = 2*k - overlap > 2*k - k = k.\n   Also, since overlap>=1, then n <= 2*k - 1.\n\n But note: we can also consider that the string t must be divisible into two parts: the first part is s (length k), and the second part is s[overlap:] (length k - overlap). Then the total length is k + (k - overlap) = 2*k - overlap = n.\n\n So, k must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1 (because overlap>=1, then 2*k - overlap >= 2*k - (k-1) = k+1, so n>=k+1 -> k<=n-1). But wait, let me correct: n = 2*k - overlap, and overlap is between 1 and k-1, so n is between k+1 and 2*k-1.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over possible k (the length of s). Since k must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) (because n = 2*k - overlap <= 2*k-1, so k >= (n+1)//2) and at most n-1 (because n = 2*k - overlap >= k+1, so k <= n-1). Actually, from n = 2*k - overlap, and overlap>=1, then 2*k - n >= 1 -> k >= (n+1)//2 (ceiling division). And from overlap <= k-1, then n = 2*k - overlap >= 2*k - (k-1) = k+1 -> k <= n-1.\n\n So k must be in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1]. However, note: we can also consider that the first part of t (the first k characters) must be equal to s, and the second part (from index k to the end) must be equal to s[overlap:] (which is the last n-k characters). But note: the second part has length n-k, and we know that n = 2*k - overlap, so n-k = k - overlap. Therefore, the second part is exactly the substring of s starting at index `overlap` and of length k-overlap.\n\n How do we check for a candidate k?\n\n Steps for candidate k (which is the length of s):\n\n  1. Check that n = 2*k - overlap, so we must have n < 2*k (because overlap>=1) and n>=k+1 (because overlap<=k-1). But we already set k in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] so these conditions hold.\n\n  2. The entire string t must be broken as:\n        s = t[0:k]\n        and the second part is t[k:n] which should be equal to s[overlap:] (where overlap = k - (n-k) ???)\n\n Wait, from n = 2*k - overlap, we have: overlap = 2*k - n.\n\n Then the second part (the non-overwritten part of the second message) is s[overlap:].\n\n But note: the second message is s, and we are writing it without the first `overlap` characters (because they merged with the end of the first s). So the second part is s[overlap:].\n\n Therefore, the second part of t (which is of length n-k) must equal s[overlap:].\n\n But note: the first part is s, so the entire string t is:\n        t[0:k] = s\n        t[k:n] = s[overlap:]   (which is s from index `overlap` to the end)\n\n Now, what is the relation between the two parts?\n\n Also, note that the entire string t is built from two s's. But wait, is that all? Actually, the first s is sent entirely, and the second s is sent partially (only from the `overlap`th character to the end). Therefore, the entire string is s + s[overlap:].\n\n Now, note: the first s is the first k characters. The second part (n-k characters) must be s[overlap:].\n\n So we require:\n        t[k:n] == s[overlap:]\n\n But s = t[0:k], and overlap = 2*k - n (from the equation n=2*k-overlap). So:\n\n        t[k:n] == t[0:k][overlap:]\n\n However, note: we can also express the condition differently. The entire string t must be such that the first k characters is s, and the rest of the string (of length n-k) is the tail of s (starting at index `overlap`). But note: the tail of s (starting at index `overlap`) is of length k - overlap. And we have n-k = k - overlap, so that matches.\n\n But wait, there's an alternative: the problem says that the two messages are identical, so s must be such that the entire t is built from two s's with the overlap. However, note that the entire t might not be exactly two s's? Actually, the problem states: \"when two two identical messages are sent\". So we assume that the original two messages were both s.\n\n However, we must also ensure that the entire t is explained by two s's. But note: the length of t is fixed to n = 2*k - overlap.\n\n So the algorithm:\n\n  For a candidate k (from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, but note: k must be such that 2*k - n is between 1 and k-1 (which is guaranteed by our range for k, because k>=ceil((n+1)/2) => 2*k>=n+1 => overlap=2*k-n>=1, and k<=n-1 => overlap=2*k-n <= 2*(n-1)-n = n-2, but wait, we also require that overlap < k, i.e., 2*k-n < k -> k < n. Which is true because k<=n-1.\n\n  Then, for each candidate k:\n\n      Let overlap = 2*k - n\n\n      Condition 1: overlap must be at least 1 and at most k-1. (We get from k in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] that overlap is at least 1 and at most k-1? Let me check:\n\n          Minimum k: ceil((n+1)/2) -> then overlap_min = 2*ceil((n+1)/2) - n. \n          If n is even: ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+2)//2, then 2*((n+2)//2) - n = (n+2) - n = 2, which is >=1 and <= ceil((n+1)/2)-1? Not necessarily, but note: we require overlap < k, and k = ceil((n+1)/2). For example, n=5: ceil(6/2)=3, then overlap=2*3-5=1 -> valid. For n=4: ceil(5/2)=3, then overlap=6-4=2, and k=3 -> 2<3 -> valid. For n=6: ceil(7/2)=4, then overlap=8-6=2, and k=4 -> 2<4 -> valid.\n\n      Condition 2: The first k characters of t (s) and the next n-k characters must equal s[overlap:].\n\n      Additionally, we must check that the entire string t is consistent with two s's: the first s is t[0:k] and the second s is s, and the merged part is the last overlap characters of the first s and the first overlap characters of the second s must be the same. But note: the merged part is already taken care of by the condition that t[k:n] == s[overlap:].\n\n  However, note: the entire string t is built from two s's. But the second s is s, so the part we are comparing (s[overlap:]) is the tail of the second s. But the first s is t[0:k] and the second s is the same s, so we must have that the second s is the same as the first s? \n\n  But wait, how do we know the second s is the same? Actually, we are assuming s is the base. The condition is that the entire t is built from two copies of s. However, note: the entire t might be built from two copies of s, but we are breaking it as:\n\n        t = s + s[overlap:]\n\n  So the second copy of s is truncated by the overlap. Therefore, the entire string t does not contain the full second s. \n\n  But note: we are only required to output one possible s. And s must be of length k.\n\n  However, there is another way to look at it: the entire string t must be periodic with period k, but with the condition that the two copies are merged. Alternatively, we can note that the string t must be equal to s + s[overlap:], and s is the first k characters.\n\n  Therefore, we can set s = t[0:k] and then check if the rest of the string (from k to the end) is equal to s[overlap:].\n\n  But note: the problem says that if the entire string t is just two copies without any overlap (like \"abcabc\") then it's not an error. However, in our candidate k, we are requiring an overlap (overlap>=1). But note: the condition for \"abcabc\" is that if we take k=3, then overlap = 2*3 - 6 = 0, which is not allowed (overlap must be positive). So we don't consider k=3 for n=6 because our k must be at least ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(3.5)=4? Then k=4,5,...,5 (since n-1=5). Then for k=4: overlap=8-6=2, then we check: \n        s = t[0:4] = \"abca\"\n        t[4:6] = \"bc\"\n        s[2:] = \"ca\", which is not \"bc\", so fails.\n\n  Similarly, k=5: overlap=10-6=4, then s = t[0:5]=\"abcab\", and t[5:6]=\"c\", and s[4:]=\"b\", which is not \"c\".\n\n  So \"abcabc\" is correctly rejected.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says that if the entire string is two copies without overlap, we output \"NO\". But note: there might be multiple ways to break the string? Actually, the problem says \"if it is the result of the error\", meaning that there exists at least one s and one overlap (as described) that explains the string.\n\n  Example: \"acacacaca\" (example input) -> output YES, and s can be \"acaca\"\n\n  How?\n\n      n = 9\n      We consider k from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n      k=5: overlap=10-9=1\n          s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n          t[5:9] = \"caca\"\n          s[1:] = \"cac\" -> but \"caca\" vs \"cac\": not the same.\n\n      k=6: overlap=12-9=3\n          s = t[0:6] = \"acacac\"\n          t[6:9] = \"aca\"\n          s[3:] = \"ac\" -> not the same.\n\n      k=7: overlap=14-9=5\n          s = t[0:7] = \"acacaca\"\n          t[7:9] = \"ca\"\n          s[5:] = \"a\" -> not the same.\n\n      k=8: overlap=16-9=7\n          s = t[0:8] = \"acacacac\"\n          t[8:9] = \"a\"\n          s[7:] = \"\" -> not the same.\n\n  This does not work. But wait, the example output is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n  Let me reexamine: the example says \"acacacaca\" is YES, and s=\"acaca\". \n\n  Then, according to the definition: \n        s = \"acaca\", and then the second message is \"acaca\", and the overlap is 2 (because the last 2 of the first and the first 2 of the second are \"ca\", which matches). Then the merged string would be: \"acaca\" + \"caca\" (without the first 2 of the second) -> \"acacacaca\", which is exactly t.\n\n  How does this relate to our formula? \n        n = 9, k = 5, then overlap should be 2*k - n = 10-9=1 -> but we used overlap=2.\n\n  So the formula n=2*k-overlap must hold. In this case, with k=5, we have n=2*5-2=8, but our n is 9. \n\n  Alternatively, maybe the formula is not fixed by the length? \n\n  Let me derive again: \n        The first message: s (length k)\n        The second message: s (length k), but we merge the last `overlap` of the first and the first `overlap` of the second. Then the total length is k + (k - overlap) = 2*k - overlap.\n\n  But wait, the example \"acacacaca\": \n        s = \"acaca\", k=5, overlap=2, then total length = 5 + (5-2)=8, but the string is 9 long.\n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  Let me break down the example:\n\n        s = \"acaca\"\n        First message: \"acaca\"\n        Second message: \"acaca\", but we merge the last 2 of the first (\"ca\") with the first 2 of the second (\"ac\")? \n\n        But wait, the merging condition is that the end of the first and the beginning of the second must be the same. In the example, the end of the first is \"ca\", and the beginning of the second is \"ac\", which are not the same! \n\n  Wait, the example input was ['acacacaca', ...] and the output was 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n  But the example note says: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\" — meaning the example input was \"acacacaca\", and one possible s is \"acaca\". \n\n  However, the merging requires that the last part of the first s and the beginning of the second s must be identical. \n\n  Let me check: \n        First s: \"acaca\"\n        Second s: \"acaca\"\n\n        When merging, we require that the last `overlap` characters of the first s must equal the first `overlap` characters of the second s.\n\n        In the example, the last 2 of \"acaca\" is \"ca\", and the first 2 of \"acaca\" is \"ac\". They are not equal. So why is it valid?\n\n  There must be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"when two two identical messages are sent\". And the example says: \"acacacaca\" is the result of two \"acaca\" with an error. But the error condition is that the two messages are identical and the merge occurs by overlapping. \n\n  However, the example output is YES. \n\n  Let me read the example again: \n      Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n      Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n  So the second example input is \"acacacaca\", and the expected output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n  How can \"acacacaca\" be produced by two \"acaca\" with an error?\n\n  Let me write the two messages:\n\n        Message1: \"acaca\"\n        Message2: \"acaca\"\n\n  The error: the two messages are identical, so they are merged. The merge condition is that the last `overlap` characters of the first must match the first `overlap` of the second. \n\n  What if we choose a different overlap? \n\n  Note: the problem says the overlap must be positive and less than the length of s. \n\n  Let me try with overlap=1: \n        First message: \"acaca\"\n        Second message: \"acaca\", but we merge the last 1 of the first (\"a\") with the first 1 of the second (\"a\"). Then the merged string is: \"acaca\" + \"caca\" (because the second message without the first 1 character is \"caca\") -> \"acacacaca\", which is exactly the string.\n\n  So the example uses overlap=1, not 2.\n\n  Then the total length is 2*5 - 1 = 9, which matches.\n\n  Why did I think the last part of the first and the beginning of the second must be \"ca\" and \"ac\"? That was wrong. The condition is that the last `overlap` of the first (which is 1) is \"a\", and the first `overlap` of the second (which is 1) is \"a\", so they match.\n\n  Therefore, the example works.\n\n  So the algorithm for candidate k:\n\n      Let k be from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (both inclusive).\n      Let overlap = 2*k - n   (this is the amount we are saving from the second message)\n\n      Then, we require:\n          Condition 1: The first k characters form s.\n          Condition 2: The substring of t from index k to the end (length n-k) must equal the substring of s from index `overlap` to the end (which is s[overlap:]).\n\n      But note: the entire string t must be exactly s + s[overlap:].\n\n      However, we must also ensure that the overlapping part (the last `overlap` of the first s and the first `overlap` of the second s) are identical. But wait, the second s is s, so the first `overlap` of the second s is s[0:overlap]. And the last `overlap` of the first s is s[k-overlap:k]. Therefore, we must have s[k-overlap:k] == s[0:overlap].\n\n      But note: the problem does not require that the entire s is such that the beginning and the end overlap arbitrarily. However, from the construction, we have:\n\n          t = s + s[overlap:]\n\n          This implies that the second part of t is s[overlap:], but note: the first part is s, and the second part is s without the first `overlap` characters.\n\n      However, we did not use the condition that the last `overlap` of s (which is s[k-overlap:k]) must equal the first `overlap` of s (which is s[0:overlap]). \n\n      But wait, the second message is s, and the first message is s. The merging condition is that the last `overlap` characters of the first message (which is the last `overlap` of s) must be equal to the first `overlap` characters of the second message (which is the first `overlap` of s). \n\n      Therefore, we have an additional condition:\n\n          s[k-overlap:k] == s[0:overlap]\n\n      But note: k is the length of s, so s[k-overlap:k] is the substring from index k-overlap to the end (length `overlap`). And we require this to be equal to s[0:overlap].\n\n      However, in our candidate, we are setting s = t[0:k]. Then we check that t[k:n] == s[overlap:]. But note: the condition above (the overlapping part) is automatically satisfied if the entire t is built as s + s[overlap:] because the first s is s and the second s is s, and the overlapping part is the last `overlap` of the first s and the first `overlap` of the second s, and they are both part of s. But wait, we have:\n\n          s = t[0:k]   (first part)\n          t[k:n] = s[overlap:]   (second part)\n\n      But the overlapping part is the last `overlap` of the first s (which is s[k-overlap:k]) and the first `overlap` of the second s (which is s[0:overlap]). We require that these two are equal. \n\n      However, note: s[k-overlap:k] is the last `overlap` of s, and s[0:overlap] is the first `overlap` of s. There is no guarantee that these are equal unless we impose that condition.\n\n  Therefore, we must check two things for candidate k:\n\n      1. t[k : k + (k - overlap)] == s[overlap:]   (which is the second part of the string, and we already set s=t[0:k] so we can check that)\n\n      2. Additionally, the overlapping part condition: s[k-overlap:k] == s[0:overlap]\n\n  But wait, condition 1 is actually the same as condition 2? \n\n  Let me see: \n        Condition 1: t[k:n] == s[overlap:]   -> because n = 2*k - overlap, so the second part is from k to the end, which is of length n-k = k-overlap. So we require t[k:n] = s[overlap:].\n\n        Condition 2: s[k-overlap:k] == s[0:overlap]\n\n  But note: s[overlap:] is the substring of s starting at index `overlap` and going to the end. And the second part of t is exactly that.\n\n  However, condition 2 is about the beginning and the end of s. Without condition 2, we might have:\n\n        s = \"abcde\", k=5, overlap=2 (so n=2*5-2=8). Then condition 1: t[5:8] must equal s[2:] which is \"cde\". But if t is \"abcde... something\", the first part is \"abcde\", and the second part is \"cde\" (so the full t is \"abcdecde\"). But now, the overlapping part is the last 2 of the first s (\"de\") and the first 2 of the second s (\"cd\")? They are not the same. \n\n  Therefore, the error condition requires that the overlapping part (the last `overlap` of the first s and the first `overlap` of the second s) must be identical. \n\n  So we must check condition 2 as well.\n\n  Alternatively, note that the entire string t is built by two copies of s with an overlap. Then the condition that the overlapping part is the same is inherent in the fact that the two messages are identical. But wait, the two messages are both s, so the first message is s and the second message is s. Then the overlapping part is the last `overlap` of s and the first `overlap` of s, so they must be the same.\n\n  Therefore, condition 2 is necessary.\n\n  However, note: we are defining s as the first k characters of t. Then we require that the last `overlap` of s (which is known) equals the first `overlap` of s (which is also known). \n\n  So the algorithm for candidate k:\n\n      Let k in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] (both inclusive)\n      Let overlap = 2*k - n   (must be positive and < k, which it is by our k range)\n\n      Step 1: Check that the first k characters of t (s) satisfy: s[k-overlap:k] == s[0:overlap]   (the overlapping part condition)\n\n      Step 2: Check that the next n-k characters (from index k to the end) of t is equal to s[overlap:].\n\n      If both conditions hold, then we have found a candidate s = t[0:k] and we can output \"YES\" and s.\n\n  But note: the problem says that if there are multiple possibilities, we can output any. So we can stop at the first k that satisfies.\n\n  However, what if no k satisfies? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n  Let me test with the examples:\n\n  Example 1: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (n=21)\n      Expected: YES, s=\"abrakadabra\" (k=11)\n\n      Let k=11, then overlap=2*11-21=1.\n      Condition 1: s[11-1:11] = s[10:11] = last 1 char of s -> 'a'\n                s[0:1] = 'a' -> matches.\n\n      Condition 2: t[11:21] = s[1:] -> s[1:] is \"brakadabra\", and t[11:21] is \"brakadabra\" (since the string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", the first 11 is \"abrakadabra\", then the next 10 (21-11=10) is \"brakadabra\", and s[1:] is \"brakadabra\") -> matches.\n\n  Example 2: \"acacacaca\" (n=9)\n      Expected: YES, s=\"acaca\" (k=5)\n\n      k=5, overlap=10-9=1.\n      Condition 1: s[5-1:5] = s[4:5] = last 1 char of s -> 'a'\n                s[0:1] = 'a' -> matches.\n\n      Condition 2: t[5:9] = \"caca\", and s[1:] = \"cac\" -> wait, \"caca\" vs \"cac\": they are not the same.\n\n  Wait, what? There's a discrepancy.\n\n  Let me recalculate: \n        s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n        Condition 2: the second part of t is from index 5 to the end (index 9) -> \"acacacaca\"[5:9] = \"caca\" (because the string is 0-indexed: \n            indices: 0:a,1:c,2:a,3:c,4:a,5:c,6:a,7:c,8:a -> wait, wait, the string is \"acacacaca\", so:\n\n            t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n            t[5:9] = \"caca\" (from index5 to index8)\n\n        Now, s[1:] = \"cac\" (from index1 to the end: \"c\" at index1, then 'a','c','a') -> \"caca\" is 4 characters, but s[1:] is 4 characters: \"caca\" (because s=\"acaca\", so s[1:] is \"caca\").\n\n        Actually, s[1:] is \"caca\", and t[5:9] is \"caca\", so condition 2 holds.\n\n  I made a mistake earlier: s=\"acaca\", then s[1:] is indeed \"caca\". \n\n  Example 4: \"abababab\" (n=8)\n      Expected: YES, s=\"ababab\"\n\n      Let me check: \n          k from ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(4.5)=5 to 7.\n\n      k=5: overlap=10-8=2.\n          s = t[0:5] = \"ababa\"\n          Condition1: s[5-2:5] = s[3:5] = \"ba\", and s[0:2]=\"ab\" -> not equal.\n\n      k=6: overlap=12-8=4.\n          s = t[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n          Condition1: s[6-4:6] = s[2:6] = \"abab\", and s[0:4] = \"abab\" -> equal.\n\n          Condition2: t[6:8] = \"ab\", and s[4:] = \"ab\" -> equal.\n\n      So k=6 works, and s=\"ababab\".\n\n  Example 3: \"abcabc\" (n=6) -> NO\n\n      k from ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(3.5)=4 to 5.\n\n      k=4: overlap=8-6=2\n          s = t[0:4]=\"abcabc\"? No, wait: t=\"abcabc\", so s=\"abca\"\n          Condition1: s[4-2:4] = s[2:4]=\"ca\", and s[0:2]=\"ab\" -> not equal.\n\n      k=5: overlap=10-6=4\n          s = t[0:5]=\"abcab\"\n          Condition1: s[5-4:5]=s[1:5]=\"bcab\", and s[0:4]=\"abca\" -> not equal.\n\n      So no candidate k, output \"NO\".\n\n  Example 5: \"tatbt\" (n=5) -> NO\n\n      k from ceil((5+1)/2)=3 to 4.\n\n      k=3: overlap=6-5=1\n          s = t[0:3]=\"tat\"\n          Condition1: s[3-1:3]=s[2:3]=\"t\", and s[0:1]=\"t\" -> equal.\n          Condition2: t[3:5]=\"bt\", and s[1:]=\"at\" -> \"bt\" vs \"at\": not equal.\n\n      k=4: overlap=8-5=3\n          s = t[0:4]=\"tatb\"\n          Condition1: s[4-3:4]=s[1:4]=\"atb\", and s[0:3]=\"tat\" -> not equal.\n\n      So \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      n = len(t)\n      # If the string length is 0 or 1, then we cannot have an overlap (since overlap must be positive and less than k, and k>=ceil((n+1)/2) which for n=1 is ceil(1)=1, then k in [1,0] -> no k). So we output \"NO\" for n<2? But note: the problem says the length of t is at least 1 (non-empty). \n\n      But note: the minimum k is ceil((n+1)/2). For n=1: ceil(2/2)=1, and then k from 1 to 0 -> no candidate. So we output \"NO\".\n\n      However, note: the problem says the two messages are identical and the overlap is positive and less than the length of s. So s must be at least 2 (because overlap>=1 and <k). Therefore, n=2*k-overlap must be at least 2*2 - (1) = 3. So strings of length 1 or 2 cannot be explained by an error.\n\n      Let me check: \n          n=1: no candidate -> \"NO\"\n          n=2: k from ceil(3/2)=2 to 1 -> no candidate -> \"NO\"\n\n      So we can safely iterate from k_min = (n+1)//2 (using integer ceiling) to n-1.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        k_min = (n+1)//2   # This is the ceiling of (n+1)/2? Actually, (n+1)//2 is the floor division, but for even and odd?\n            For n=5: (5+1)//2 = 6//2=3 -> correct.\n            For n=6: (6+1)//2=7//2=3 (in Python, floor division) but we want ceil((n+1)/2). Actually, ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 for integers? \n\n        Actually, note: ceil(a) for a real number a can be computed as (a-1)//1 + 1, but for integer n, we want the smallest integer k such that k >= (n+1)/2.\n\n        We can compute k_min = (n+1+1)//2? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set k_min = (n+1)//2 if (n+1)%2==0 then (n+1)//2 is the ceiling? Actually, no: \n\n        Example: \n            n=5: (5+1)=6, 6//2=3 -> correct.\n            n=4: (4+1)=5, 5//2=2 (floor) but ceil(5/2)=3 -> so we need ceil.\n\n        How to compute ceil((n+1)/2)? \n            ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 when using floor division? Actually, for integer x, ceil(x/2) = (x+1)//2.\n\n        But here, we have (n+1)/2. Then ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 if (n+1) is odd?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlapping part. The overlap must be a positive number and less than the length of `s`. If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by two copies of `s` where the end of the first `s` overlaps with the beginning of the second `s`. The overlapping part must match exactly, and the total length of `t` should be `2 * len(s) - overlap`, where `overlap` is the length of the overlapping part.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `k` of `s`, we check if `t` can be split into two parts: the first part being `s` (of length `k`) and the second part being the remaining characters (of length `n - k`). The second part must match the substring of `s` starting from the `overlap` position to the end. Additionally, the last `overlap` characters of `s` must match the first `overlap` characters of `s`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `k` of `s` from `ceil((n + 1)/2)` to `n - 1`. For each `k`, compute the `overlap` as `2 * k - n`. Check if the first `k` characters of `t` satisfy the overlapping condition and if the remaining part of `t` matches the substring of `s` starting from the `overlap` position.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible `k` in the range `[ceil((n + 1)/2), n - 1]`, which is O(n). For each `k`, it performs substring operations which are O(n) in the worst case. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n < 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    k_min = (n + 1) // 2\n    found = False\n    for k in range(k_min, n):\n        overlap = 2 * k - n\n        if overlap <= 0 or overlap >= k:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:k]\n        tail = t[k:]\n        \n        if s[-overlap:] != s[:overlap]:\n            continue\n            \n        if tail == s[overlap:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s)\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the length of `t` is less than 3, it's impossible to have a valid overlap, so the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `k` of `s` from `ceil((n + 1)/2)` to `n - 1`, compute the `overlap` as `2 * k - n`.\n4. **Check Overlap Condition**: Ensure the computed `overlap` is positive and less than `k`. Then, verify that the last `overlap` characters of `s` match the first `overlap` characters of `s`.\n5. **Check Substring Match**: The remaining part of `t` (after the first `k` characters) must match the substring of `s` starting from the `overlap` position.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\" after checking all possible lengths.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by two overlapping identical strings `s`, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
