And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we calculate the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of all sleep times in one week? Actually, we have multiple weeks.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   Total_sleep = (sum of all elements in the array, but weighted by the number of weeks they appear in)\n   Number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n But note: an element at position i (0-indexed) will appear in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) [inclusive]?\n Alternatively, the element at index i appears in the first week that starts at max(0, i - k + 1) and ends at the last week that starts at i - k + 1? Actually, the element at index i is included in a week if the week starts from s such that s <= i < s+k. So s from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n-k) ??? \n\n Actually, the week starting at s covers indices [s, s+k-1]. So the condition for the element at index i to be included is: s <= i <= s+k-1, which means s <= i and s >= i - k + 1, and also s must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive).\n\n Therefore, the element at index i is included in the weeks that start from s0 = max(0, i - k + 1) to s1 = min(i, n-k). The number of weeks including this element is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i - k + 1) + 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler approach: \n   The element at index i is included in the first (i+1) weeks (if i < k-1 then the first i+1 weeks) and then in the next (n - i) weeks? Actually, no.\n\n Let me reframe: \n   The week that starts at s must satisfy: s <= i <= s+k-1 -> s <= i and s >= i - k + 1, and s from 0 to n-k.\n\n The smallest s is 0, so if i < k, then the lower bound is 0, and the upper bound is i (since i - k + 1 would be negative, so we take 0) but wait, we have to consider the constraint on s: s must be <= n-k. So the number of weeks including a is: \n   low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   high = min(i, n - k)   [because the last week that includes i must start at most at i (so that i is the last element? actually no, the week must end at i, so the start must be at least i - k + 1 and at most i (if we are counting from 0 to n-k)].\n\n But note: the week starting at s must end at s+k-1. So the condition for i to be included is s <= i and s+k-1 >= i. This gives: s <= i and s >= i - k + 1. Then the valid s are from L = max(0, i-k+1) to R = min(n-k, i). Then the count is R - L + 1.\n\n However, note: the last week that includes i must start at most at i (so that the week ends at i) but actually, the week must end at at least i. So the condition is s <= i and s >= i - k + 1, and s <= n-k (because there are only weeks from 0 to n-k). Also, s must be nonnegative.\n\n So the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n But wait, let's test with k=2, n=3, i=0: \n   L = max(0, 0-2+1) = max(0,-1)=0\n   R = min(0, 3-2) = min(0,1)=0\n   count = 0-0+1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n i=1: \n   L = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n   R = min(1,1)=1\n   count = 1-0+1=2 -> but in the example [3,4,7] with k=2, the element at index1 (which is 4) appears in two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7] -> correct.\n\n i=2:\n   L = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n   R = min(2,1)=1\n   count = 1-1+1=1 -> correct.\n\n But wait, the example has n=3, k=2, so the weeks are:\n   week0: [3,4] -> includes index0 and index1\n   week1: [4,7] -> includes index1 and index2\n\n So the counts are correct.\n\n However, note that we are asked for the average sleep time over all weeks. We can compute:\n\n   total_sum_all_weeks = sum_{each week} (sum of the week)\n\n   But note: each week is k consecutive days. We can also compute:\n\n   total_sum_all_weeks = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (number of weeks that include day i)\n\n   Then divide by (n-k+1) (the total number of weeks) to get the average.\n\n Example: [3,4,7] with k=2, n=3.\n   total_sum_all_weeks = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18\n   Number of weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n   Average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n Another example: [10] with n=1, k=1 -> \n   total_sum_all_weeks = 10 * (min(0,1-1) - max(0,0-1+1)+1) = 10 * (min(0,0)-max(0,0)+1) = 10*(0-0+1)=10\n   Number of weeks = 1-1+1=1\n   Average = 10/1 = 10.0\n\n Third example: [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] with n=8, k=2.\n   We have 7 weeks.\n\n   We can compute the total_sum_all_weeks by iterating and for each element, computing the count.\n\n   But note: n and k can be up to 200000, so we cannot iterate for each element and compute the count by checking the range (because that would be O(n) per element, leading to O(n^2)).\n\n   We need to compute the count for each element without iterating over the entire array.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the count for each index i.\n\n   Count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n   But note: \n        min(i, n-k) = \n          if i <= n-k: then i\n          else: n-k\n\n        max(0, i-k+1) = \n          if i-k+1 <= 0, then 0\n          else i-k+1\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if i < k-1:\n            low = 0\n            high = i\n        else:\n            low = i - k + 1\n            high = n - k   # because i>=k-1, then min(i, n-k) is n-k if i>=n-k? Actually, no: if i>n-k then we use n-k.\n\n        Actually, we have to break it down:\n\n        Let L = max(0, i-k+1)\n        Let R = min(i, n-k)\n\n        Then count_i = R - L + 1\n\n   However, note: the condition for the week to exist is that the week starts from 0 to n-k (inclusive). And the week must cover i, so the start must be from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n   This formula is O(1) per element, so total O(n). Since n can be 200000, that's acceptable.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read n, k and the list a of n integers.\n   2. Compute total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   3. If total_weeks == 0: then we have no week? But k<=n, so n-k+1>=1. So no need to worry about division by zero.\n\n   4. Precompute the total sum over all weeks by:\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            R = min(i, n - k)   # Note: the last week that starts at n-k is the last week, and it ends at n-k+k-1 = n-1, so it's valid.\n\n            count_i = R - L + 1\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n   5. Then average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   6. Format the average to have 10 decimal places (or until the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6)\n\n   But wait, let's test with the third example: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n        n=8, k=2, total_weeks = 7\n\n        We need to compute the total_sum:\n\n        i=0: L = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0; R = min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0; count0=1 -> 1*1\n        i=1: L = max(0,1-2+1)=0; R=min(1,6)=1; count1=2 -> 2*2\n        i=2: L = max(0,2-2+1)=1; R=min(2,6)=2; count2=2 -> 4*2\n        i=3: L = max(0,3-2+1)=2; R=min(3,6)=3; count3=2 -> 100000*2\n        i=4: L = max(0,4-2+1)=3; R=min(4,6)=4; count4=2 -> 123*2\n        i=5: L = max(0,5-2+1)=4; R=min(5,6)=5; count5=2 -> 456*2\n        i=6: L = max(0,6-2+1)=5; R=min(6,6)=6; count6=2 -> 789*2\n        i=7: L = max(0,7-2+1)=6; R=min(7,6)=6; count7=1 -> 1*1\n\n        total_sum = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n\n        Let's add them:\n\n        1 + 4 = 5\n        5 + 8 = 13\n        13 + 200000 = 200013\n        200013 + 246 = 200259\n        200259 + 912 = 201171\n        201171 + 1578 = 202749\n        202749 + 1 = 202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        Which matches the example output.\n\n   However, note: the example input says: ['8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'] and output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n   But wait, the example input string is given as: \n        \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, note that the above method uses two passes (one to read and one to iterate) and is O(n). \n\n   But let me check the edge cases:\n\n   Case 1: n==k\n        Then total_weeks=1, and for each i from 0 to n-1:\n            For i from 0 to n-1 (with n=k): \n                L = max(0, i-k+1) = max(0, i-n+1) [but n=k, so i-k+1 = i-n+1]\n                For i=0: L = max(0,0-n+1)=0 (if n>=1, then 0-n+1 is negative) -> 0\n                R = min(i, n-k)=min(i,0) -> so for i>=1, R=0? \n\n        Actually, when n=k, then the week is the entire array, and there is only one week.\n\n        For i from 0 to n-1 (n=k):\n            i=0: L=0, R=min(0,0)=0 -> count=1\n            i=1: L = max(0,1-n+1)=max(0,1-k+1)=max(0,2-k) but k=n, so if n>1 then k>1, so 2-k might be negative? Actually, k=n, so for i=1, 1-n+1 = 2-n, which is <=0 since n>=1, so L=0, R=min(1,0) -> but wait, n-k=0, so R=0. Then for i=1: count=0-0+1=1? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the week (only one week) should include every element. So the count for each element should be 1.\n\n        But according to our formula: \n            For i in [0, n-1] (n=k), \n            L = max(0, i-k+1) = max(0, i-n+1)\n            R = min(i, n-k)=min(i,0) -> which is 0 for any i>=1? \n\n        This is incorrect. \n\n        Correction: The condition for the week is that the week starts from s=0 (only one week) and the week ends at k-1 = n-1. So the element at index i is included if 0<=i<n (which is always true). So the count for each element should be 1.\n\n        Why did R become 0 for i>=1? Because we set R = min(i, n-k) and n-k=0, so R=0 for i>=1.\n\n        That is wrong.\n\n        Let me reexamine: The week starts at s, and s must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). When n=k, then n-k=0, so s can only be 0.\n\n        The condition for the element at index i to be included: s <= i and s+k-1>=i -> 0<=i and 0+n-1>=i -> i<=n-1. So yes, every element is included. The count for each element is the number of s that satisfy: s<=i and s>=i-k+1 and s<=n-k (which is 0). \n\n        The s must be 0 (the only week). So the condition for the element at index i is: 0<=i and 0+n-1>=i -> which is always true for i in [0, n-1]. \n\n        But the formula for the count is: \n            L = max(0, i-k+1) = max(0, i-n+1)   [since k=n]\n            R = min(i, n-k)=min(i,0)   [which is 0]\n\n        Then count = 0 - max(0, i-n+1) + 1.\n\n        For i=0: count = 0 - max(0,0-n+1) + 1 = 0 - max(0,-n+1) + 1 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1.\n        For i=1: count = 0 - max(0,1-n+1) + 1 = 0 - max(0,2-n) + 1. Since n>=1, and if n==k, then n>=1. For n=1: then k=1, then i=0 already done. For n=2: then k=2, then i=1: 2-n+1=2-2+1=1 -> then max(0,1)=1, so count = 0-1+1=0 -> which is wrong.\n\n        The issue: The condition for s is that s must be <= n-k (which is 0) and also s>=i-k+1. But for i=1 and n=k=2: \n            s must be <=0 and >= 1-2+1=0. So s=0. So the element at i=1 is included in the week starting at 0 (which is the entire array). So the count should be 1.\n\n        The formula for R: min(i, n-k) is incorrect because the week's start must be <= i (to cover i) and also the week's start must be <= n-k (which is 0). But note: the condition from the week covering i is s<=i, but we are also bounded by s<=n-k. However, the condition s<=i is automatically satisfied if s<=n-k and n-k<=i? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the week to cover i is two conditions:\n          s <= i and s >= i-k+1, and s must be in [0, n-k].\n\n        Therefore, the valid s are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) but wait, we must also ensure that s<=n-k and s>=0, but the bounds we set already do that.\n\n        However, in the case n=k, then n-k=0, so the upper bound for s is 0. Then the condition becomes: s must be in [max(0,i-k+1), 0] and also s<=i (but 0<=i is always true). So the interval is [max(0,i-k+1), 0]. \n\n        For i=0: [max(0,-k+1)=0,0] -> [0,0] -> count=1.\n        For i=1: [max(0,1-k+1)=max(0,2-k)=max(0,2-n)=...] and n=k, so if n=2 then 2-2=0 -> [0,0] -> count=1.\n\n        But wait, when n=k=2, then for i=1: i-k+1=1-2+1=0, so L=0, R=0 (because min(i, n-k)=min(1,0)=0) -> then count=0-0+1=1.\n\n        So why did I get confused earlier? I computed R as min(i, n-k) and for i=1 and n=k=2: min(1,0)=0, and L=0, so count=1.\n\n        But then why did I say for i=1: count=0? I must have miscalculated.\n\n        Let me recalculate for n=k=2, i=1:\n            L = max(0, 1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            R = min(1, 2-2)=min(1,0)=0\n            count = 0-0+1=1.\n\n        So the formula works.\n\n        However, note the condition for the week: the week must start at s=0 (only week). And the week [0,1] (indices 0 to 1) covers i=1. So it's correct.\n\n        Another edge: n=2, k=1 (then total_weeks=2). Then for each element, how many weeks?\n\n        For i=0: \n            L = max(0,0-1+1)=0\n            R = min(0,2-1)=min(0,1)=0 -> count=1\n        For i=1:\n            L = max(0,1-1+1)=max(0,1)=1\n            R = min(1,1)=1 -> count=1\n\n        Then total_sum = a0*1 + a1*1, and total_weeks=2, so average = (a0+a1)/2.\n\n        But note: the weeks are [0] and [1], so indeed the average is (a0+a1)/2.\n\n        But wait, the problem states: \"consider k consecutive days as a week\", and k=1. So the weeks are single days. Then the average is (a0+a1)/2.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n        However, note: the formula for R was defined as min(i, n-k). But in the condition, the week start must be <= i (so that the week ends at s+k-1 >= i) and the week start must be <= n-k (because the week must start at or before the last possible week). But note: the week start s must also be at least 0 and at most n-k. The condition for the week to cover i is s<=i and s>=i-k+1. Then the upper bound for s is the minimum of i and n-k (because if n-k < i, then we cannot have a week starting beyond n-k, and if i < n-k, then the week must start at most i). \n\n        But wait, if i < n-k, then the condition s<=i is more restrictive than s<=n-k? No, because n-k is the maximum start index, and i is the current index. So we take the minimum of i and n-k for the upper bound.\n\n        However, consider: \n            We require s <= i (to have the week ending at s+k-1 >= i) and s <= n-k (because the week must start at or before the last week). So the upper bound is the minimum of i and n-k.\n\n        Similarly, the lower bound is the maximum of 0 and i-k+1.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0.0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Calculate the range of week starts that include day i\n            low_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high_bound = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must start at most at n-k (last week starts at n-k) and at most at i (so that the week ends at s+k-1 >= i, but if i is beyond the last week, then we use the last week)\n\n            count_i = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the average to have 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n        i=0: low_bound = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high_bound=min(0,3-2)=0 -> count=1, add 3*1=3\n        i=1: low_bound = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high_bound=min(1,1)=1 -> count=2, add 4*2=8\n        i=2: low_bound = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high_bound=min(2,1)=1 -> count=1, add 7*1=7\n        total_sum=3+8+7=18, average=18/2=9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n        n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n        total_weeks=1\n        i=0: low_bound=max(0,0-1+1)=0, high_bound=min(0,0)=0 -> count=1, total_sum=10, average=10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n   Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        As above, total_sum=202750, average=202750/7=28964.2857142857... -> \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n   However, note: the example output is given as '28964.2857142857' (which is 10 digits after the decimal point). Our formatting will output 10 digits.\n\n   But wait, 202750/7 is exactly 28964.2857142857142857... so we can represent it exactly in floating point? \n\n   But note: the numbers are integers and the divisor is 7, which is not a power of 2. However, the problem requires an absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, and formatting to 10 digits is safe.\n\n   However, sometimes floating point might not give exact representation, but with n,k up to 200000 and a[i] up to 10^5, the total_sum can be as large as 200000 * 10^5 * (at most n-k+1, which is 200000) -> worst-case total_sum is about 200000 * 10^5 * 200000 = 4e15, which is within the range of float (which can handle integers exactly up to 2**53, which is about 9e15). So it's safe.\n\n   But we are using integer arithmetic until the division. However, the multiplication and addition are with integers, but the count_i is integer, and a[i] is integer, so total_sum is integer. Then we divide by an integer (total_weeks) and that might be a float.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   But note: total_sum is integer, total_weeks is integer. In Python, if we use / we get float.\n\n   However, the numbers might be very large (total_sum up to 4e15) and we are dividing by 200000, which is 2e5, so the result is up to 2e10, which is still within float precision.\n\n   But note: 4e15 is less than 2**53 (about 9e15) so the integer total_sum is represented exactly in float.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            low_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high_bound = min(i, n - k)\n            count_i = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   However, note: the problem says the answer must be correct with absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. The above method is exact in integer arithmetic until the division, and then we use floating point. But the total_sum is an integer and total_weeks is an integer, so the division might not be exact. But the problem allows an error of 1e-6, so we can use formatting to 10 digits to ensure we don't lose precision.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_sum / total_weeks))\n\n   This should be safe.\n\n   Let me run the code with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n        Output: 9.0000000000\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n10\"\n        Output: 10.0000000000\n\n   Example 3: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a string in a list, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\", so we are reading the first line and then the second line.\n\n   This code should work.\n\n   One more test: n=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n\n        total_weeks = 3\n        Weeks: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]\n\n        total_sum = 1*(count_0) + 2*(count_1) + 3*(count_2) + 4*(count_3) + 5*(count_4)\n\n        For i=0: L = max(0,0-3+1)=0, R=min(0,5-3)=min(0,2)=0 -> count0=1\n        i=1: L=max(0,1-3+1)=0, R=min(1,2)=1 -> count1=2\n        i=2: L=max(0,2-3+1)=0, R=min(2,2)=2 -> count2=3\n        i=3: L=max(0,3-3+1)=1, R=min(3,2)=2 -> count3=2\n        i=4: L=max(0,4-3+1)=2, R=min(4,2)=2 -> count4=1\n\n        total_sum = 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*2 + 5*1 = 1+4+9+8+5 = 27\n        average = 27/3 = 9.0\n\n        Now, by hand: \n            Week1: 1+2+3=6\n            Week2: 2+3+4=9\n            Week3: 3+4+5=12\n            Total = 6+9+12=27, average=9.0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   We'll submit this.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the week start s must be in [0, n-k] and also s<=i and s>=i-k+1. Our formula for the count is the number of integers s in the interval [L, R] (inclusive). \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the above formula for the count is standard for \"how many contiguous subarrays (of fixed length k) include the i-th element\". \n\n   Therefore, the solution is as above.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   IMPORTANT: The problem constraints are n,k up to 200000, so we must use an efficient algorithm.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in total. The challenge is to efficiently compute the sum of sleep times for all these weeks and then find their average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous subarrays (weeks) of length k in a given array of sleep times. Each element in the array contributes to multiple weeks, specifically those weeks that include the element. The key insight is to determine how many times each element appears in these weeks and then use this information to compute the total sum of sleep times across all weeks.\n2. **Intuition**: For each element at position `i` in the array, the number of weeks that include it is determined by the overlapping weeks. Specifically, the first week that includes `i` starts at `max(0, i - k + 1)` and the last week that includes `i` starts at `min(i, n - k)`. The count of such weeks is `min(i, n - k) - max(0, i - k + 1) + 1`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each element in the array, compute the number of weeks that include it, multiply this count by the sleep time of the element, and accumulate this value to get the total sum of sleep times across all weeks. The average is then obtained by dividing this total sum by the number of weeks (n - k + 1).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of days, because it processes each element exactly once. This is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_weeks = n - k + 1\ntotal_sum = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    low_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n    high_bound = min(i, n - k)\n    count_i = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n    total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\naverage = total_sum / total_weeks\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads two integers, `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week). The second line reads the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the total number of weeks as `n - k + 1` and initialize `total_sum` to zero.\n3. **Processing Each Element**: For each element at index `i`:\n   - Determine the earliest week start (`low_bound`) that includes `i`, which is `max(0, i - k + 1)`.\n   - Determine the latest week start (`high_bound`) that includes `i`, which is `min(i, n - k)`.\n   - The number of weeks including `i` is `count_i = high_bound - low_bound + 1`.\n   - Multiply `count_i` by the sleep time of the element and add to `total_sum`.\n4. **Calculating Average**: Divide `total_sum` by the number of weeks to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Output**: Print the average formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid recalculating sums for overlapping weeks, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
