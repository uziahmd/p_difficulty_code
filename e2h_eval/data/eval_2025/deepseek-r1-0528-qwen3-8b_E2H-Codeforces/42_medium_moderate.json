Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each up to 1000 bytes. The total size is at most 100*1000 = 100000 bytes.\n\n We are to find all integers x in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying process when both progress bars show x.\n\n Conditions:\n   Let the files be a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n   After copying x bytes of file i (which is the current file), the first progress bar shows: floor(100*x / a_i)\n   The second progress bar shows: floor(100 * (total_bytes_copied) / total_size) \n        where total_bytes_copied = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j + x, and total_size = sum(a_1 to a_n)\n\n We note that the same integer x must be shown by both progress bars at some point.\n\n However, note that the entire process is sequential. We can break the process into segments for each file.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total_size = sum(a_i for i in range(n))\n\n 2. We consider two things:\n    - For the first progress bar (current file i): the value must be x, meaning that at some byte count y (0 <= y <= a_i) we have floor(100*y/a_i) = x.\n      This means: \n          x <= (100*y)/a_i < x+1\n          => ceil(x * a_i / 100) <= y <= floor((x+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)   [But careful: we require floor division]\n\n      Actually, the condition for the first progress bar being x is:\n          x <= (100*y)/a_i < x+1\n          => (x * a_i) / 100 <= y < ((x+1)*a_i)/100\n\n      Since y must be an integer, we can define:\n          low_y = max(0, floor(x * a_i / 100))   but note: we require the floor of (100*y/a_i) to be x, so y must be at least ceil((x * a_i)/100) if we were to use real numbers? \n\n      Actually, we have:\n          floor(100*y / a_i) = x   <=>   x <= 100*y / a_i < x+1\n          => (x * a_i) <= 100*y < (x+1)*a_i\n\n      So y must be an integer in the interval [ceil((x * a_i)/100), floor(((x+1)*a_i - 1)/100)] ??? Not exactly.\n\n      But note: we are using integer arithmetic. We can write:\n\n          y_min = ceil((x * a_i) / 100)   if we are solving for y as an integer?\n          Actually, from (x * a_i) <= 100*y, then y >= ceil((x * a_i)/100) doesn't hold because if (x*a_i) is divisible by 100, then y_min = (x*a_i)//100, otherwise we need to round up?\n\n      Alternatively, we can say: the smallest y such that 100*y >= x*a_i is y_min = ceil((x * a_i) / 100). But note: the condition is (x * a_i) <= 100*y, so y_min = ceil((x * a_i) / 100) is correct.\n\n      However, we can compute:\n\n          y_min = (x * a_i + 99) // 100   [this is a way to compute ceiling without floating point?] \n          Actually, ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b, but here we are doing ceil((x*a_i)/100). But note: we are dealing with integers.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          y_min = (x * a_i + 99) // 100   # This gives the smallest integer y such that 100*y >= x*a_i.\n\n      And the maximum y is the largest integer such that 100*y < (x+1)*a_i, i.e., y_max = floor(((x+1)*a_i - 1) / 100) ?\n\n      Actually, we can set: y_max = ((x+1)*a_i - 1) // 100   because we want 100*y < (x+1)*a_i, so y <= floor(((x+1)*a_i - 1)/100) ?\n\n      But note: if (x+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then y_max should be (x+1)*a_i//100 - 1? Actually, no: because we require 100*y < (x+1)*a_i, so the maximum y is floor(((x+1)*a_i - 1)/100). \n\n      Alternatively, we can set:\n          y_min = (x * a_i + 99) // 100\n          y_max = ((x+1)*a_i - 1) // 100\n\n      However, note: we also have the constraint that y must be between 0 and a_i.\n\n      So for the current file i and a given x, the first progress bar will show x if there exists an integer y in [y_min, y_max] ∩ [0, a_i].\n\n 3. Now, for the second progress bar: at the same moment, the total bytes copied is S = (sum of previous files) + y, and we require:\n        floor(100*S / total_size) = x\n\n      This means: \n          x <= (100*S)/total_size < x+1\n          => x * total_size <= 100*S < (x+1)*total_size\n\n      Here, S = prefix_sum[i] + y, where prefix_sum[i] = a_1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n\n      So we require: \n          x * total_size <= 100*(prefix_sum[i] + y) < (x+1)*total_size\n\n      Rearranged for y (for the current file i and given x):\n          Lower bound: y >= ceil( (x * total_size - 100 * prefix_sum[i]) / 100 )   [if positive]\n          Upper bound: y < ( (x+1)*total_size - 100 * prefix_sum[i] ) / 100\n\n      But note: we are only allowed y in [0, a_i] and also from the first condition [y_min, y_max] for the current file.\n\n 4. Therefore, for a fixed x and file i, we require that there exists an integer y such that:\n        y_low1 = max(0, ceil((x * a_i) / 100))   [from the first condition, actually we used y_min above which is (x*a_i+99)//100, which is the ceiling]\n        y_high1 = min(a_i, floor(((x+1)*a_i - 1) / 100))   [from the first condition]\n\n        and\n\n        y_low2 = max(0, ceil( (x * total_size - 100 * prefix_sum[i]) / 100 ))\n        y_high2 = min(a_i, floor( ( (x+1)*total_size - 100 * prefix_sum[i] - 1) / 100 ))   [But wait, the condition is 100*(prefix_sum[i]+y) < (x+1)*total_size, so y < ( (x+1)*total_size - 100*prefix_sum[i] )/100 ]\n\n      However, note: the second condition is on the total, and the total includes the current file's y. Also note that the second condition is independent of the order of bytes? \n\n 5. But note: the second condition must hold at the same moment (same y) and the same file i. So we need to check for file i and for a particular y (in the range of the current file) that satisfies both conditions.\n\n 6. However, we cannot iterate over all x from 0 to 100 and all files and then all y in [0, a_i] because n<=100, a_i<=1000, and x from 0 to 100 -> about 100*100*1000 = 10e6, which is acceptable in Python if done carefully.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    Let total = sum(a)\n    Let prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n    Then for each x in range(0,101):\n        Let found = False\n        For each file index i (from 0 to n-1):\n            Let S_prev = prefix[i]   [the total of the previous i files]\n            Let current_file_size = a[i]\n\n            Condition for the first progress bar: \n                y_min1 = (x * current_file_size + 99) // 100   [ceiling of (x * current_file_size)/100]\n                y_max1 = ((x+1)*current_file_size) // 100       [because we require 100*y < (x+1)*current_file_size, so y <= floor((x+1)*current_file_size/100 - epsilon) but note: integer condition]\n\n            Actually, note: the condition for the first bar is:\n                floor(100*y/current_file_size) = x   <=>   x <= 100*y/current_file_size < x+1\n                => y >= ceil((x * current_file_size) / 100) and y <= floor(((x+1)*current_file_size - 1) / 100) ?\n\n            Let me check with an example: \n                x=0, current_file_size=100: then y_min1 = ceil(0)=0, y_max1 = floor( (1*100-1)/100 ) = floor(99/100)=0. So only y=0 is allowed. Correct.\n\n            Another: x=1, current_file_size=100: \n                y_min1 = ceil(100/100)=ceil(1)=1\n                y_max1 = floor((2*100-1)/100)=floor(199/100)=1. So y=1. \n                Then floor(100*1/100)=1 -> correct.\n\n            Another: x=2, current_file_size=100: \n                y_min1 = ceil(200/100)=ceil(2)=2\n                y_max1 = floor((3*100-1)/100)=floor(299/100)=2. So y=2.\n\n            Another: x=1, current_file_size=101: \n                y_min1 = ceil(101/100)=ceil(1.01)=2? Actually, wait: \n                Condition: 1 <= (100*y)/101 < 2\n                => 101 <= 100*y < 202\n                => y_min = ceil(101/100)=ceil(1.01)=2, and y_max = floor(201/100)=2. \n                Then y=2: 100*2/101 = 200/101 ≈ 1.98 -> floor is 1. Correct.\n\n            But wait, what about y=1? 100*1/101 ≈ 0.99 -> floor is 0, so indeed not. So the method is correct.\n\n            So we can define:\n                y_min1 = (x * current_file_size + 99) // 100   [ceiling of (x*current_file_size)/100]\n                y_max1 = (x+1)*current_file_size // 100   [because floor((x+1)*current_file_size/100) is the maximum y? But note: our condition is 100*y < (x+1)*current_file_size, so y < (x+1)*current_file_size/100. Then the maximum integer y is floor((x+1)*current_file_size/100 - 1e-9). However, if we use floor((x+1)*current_file_size/100) then note:\n\n            Actually, the condition is: 100*y < (x+1)*current_file_size -> y < (x+1)*current_file_size/100. Then the maximum integer y is floor((x+1)*current_file_size/100 - 1e-9). But we can also write: y <= floor(((x+1)*current_file_size - 1)/100) ?\n\n            Alternatively, we can use: \n                y_min1 = (x * current_file_size + 99) // 100\n                y_max1 = min(current_file_size, (x+1)*current_file_size // 100)   [but wait, let's test with x=1, current_file_size=100: (2*100)//100 = 2, but then y_max1=2, but our condition requires y< (x+1)*current_file_size/100, which is 2, so y=2 is not allowed because 100*2=200 which is equal to 200 (the upper bound is 200, but the condition is < 200). So we must use:\n\n                y_max1 = (x+1)*current_file_size // 100   would give the floor, but note that the condition is strict inequality: 100*y < (x+1)*current_file_size.\n\n            How to express y_max1? \n                We require 100*y < (x+1)*current_file_size  => y < (x+1)*current_file_size/100.\n\n            Then the maximum integer y is floor((x+1)*current_file_size/100 - 1e-9) or equivalently floor(( (x+1)*current_file_size - 1 ) / 100).\n\n            Example: x=1, current_file_size=100: (2*100-1)//100 = 199//100 = 1 -> then y_max1=1, but then y=1 is allowed? \n                Condition: 100*1 < 200 -> true. But wait, our condition for the first bar for x=1: \n                    floor(100*y/100) = floor(y) = 1 -> so y>=1 and y<2. So y=1 is the only one. \n\n            However, if we use y_min1 = ceil(100/100)=ceil(1)=1, and y_max1 = (200-1)//100 = 1, then we get y=1.\n\n            Similarly, for x=0, current_file_size=100: \n                y_min1 = ceil(0)=0, y_max1 = (100-1)//100 = 99//100=0.\n\n            So we can define:\n                y_min1 = (x * current_file_size + 99) // 100\n                y_max1 = ( (x+1)*current_file_size - 1 ) // 100\n\n            But note: if (x+1)*current_file_size is 0 then we have division by zero? No, because x>=0 and current_file_size>=1.\n\n            However, we must clamp y_min1 and y_max1 to [0, current_file_size].\n\n        Now, the second condition: \n            We require: x * total <= 100*(S_prev + y) < (x+1)*total\n            => (x * total - 100 * S_prev) <= 100*y < (x+1)*total - 100 * S_prev\n\n            Let A = x * total - 100 * S_prev\n            Let B = (x+1)*total - 100 * S_prev\n\n            Then we require A <= 100*y < B.\n\n            Note: y must be an integer between 0 and current_file_size.\n\n            So y must satisfy:\n                y_min2 = ceil(A / 100) if A>0, else 0 (but if A is negative, then y_min2=0). However, we can write:\n                y_min2 = max(0, (A + 99) // 100)   [if A is negative, (A+99)//100 might be negative, then we take 0]\n\n            But wait: if A is negative, then the condition A<=100*y is automatically satisfied for y>=0, so we can set y_min2=0.\n\n            Similarly, y_max2: we require 100*y < B, so y < B/100 -> y_max2 = floor((B-1)/100) if B>=1, but if B==0 then no solution? \n\n            Actually, we can define:\n                y_min2 = max(0, (A + 99) // 100)   if A is negative, then (A+99)//100 might be negative, then we take 0. But note: if A is negative, then we don't need any lower bound from A, so we set y_min2=0.\n\n            However, note: if A is negative, then the condition is automatically satisfied for all y, so we only care about the upper bound.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n                y_min2 = max(0, (A + 99) // 100)   [if A is negative, then (A+99)//100 is negative, so we take 0]\n\n            But wait: if A is negative, then we don't require a minimum y? Actually, the condition is A <= 100*y, which is automatically true for y>=0. So we set y_min2 = 0.\n\n            Similarly, for the upper bound: \n                y_max2 = min(current_file_size, (B - 1) // 100)   [because 100*y < B  => y <= floor((B-1)/100)]\n\n            However, note: if B is negative, then no solution. But since total is positive, and S_prev is fixed, and x>=0, then B = (x+1)*total - 100*S_prev. \n            But note: S_prev is the sum of previous files, and total = S_prev + current_file_size, so (x+1)*total = (x+1)*(S_prev+current_file_size) >= (x+1)*S_prev, so B = (x+1)*total - 100*S_prev = (x+1)*(S_prev+current_file_size) - 100*S_prev = (x+1)*S_prev + (x+1)*current_file_size - 100*S_prev = (x+1)*current_file_size + (x+1 - 100)*S_prev.\n\n            It is possible that B is negative if (x+1)*current_file_size < (100-x)*S_prev? But note: the second condition is on the entire transfer, so it must hold that the total amount copied (S_prev+y) is at least (x * total)/100. \n\n            Actually, the condition must be satisfied for the moment we are considering. Since the entire transfer hasn't necessarily finished, but we are in the middle, we must consider that the total amount copied (S_prev+y) must be at least (x * total)/100 and less than (x+1)*total/100.\n\n            However, note: the entire transfer is n files, and the second progress bar is the overall percentage. \n\n            But note: the overall percentage must be at least x% and less than x+1%. \n\n            However, we are in the middle of the i-th file, so the total amount copied is S_prev+y, and the total is total.\n\n            The condition is: x * total <= 100*(S_prev+y) < (x+1)*total.\n\n            Therefore, the second condition is independent of the first condition, but they must hold simultaneously for the same y.\n\n 8. Then, for a fixed x and file i, we have two intervals for y:\n        Interval1: [y_min1, y_max1]   (from the first condition, and note y must be between 0 and current_file_size)\n        Interval2: [y_min2, y_max2]   (from the second condition, and y must be between 0 and current_file_size)\n\n    Then we need to check if there exists an integer y in the intersection of Interval1 and Interval2, and also in [0, current_file_size].\n\n 9. However, note: the second condition uses the entire total, and the current file is being copied, so the total is fixed (total = S_prev + current_file_size). \n\n 10. But note: the second condition is defined with the entire transfer, so the total is known.\n\n 11.

However, note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", so we only need one file and one y for a given x.\n\n 13. But wait: what if the same x appears in multiple files? Then we don't need to break, but we can break after the first occurrence to avoid redundant checks.\n\n 14. But note: we are iterating over x from 0 to 100, and for each x we iterate over files until we find one that works.\n\n 15. However, there is a caveat: the second condition uses the entire total (which is fixed) and the prefix sum (which depends on the file index). \n\n 16. Let's test with the first example: \n        Input: ['1\\n6']\n        Then n=1, a=[6], total=6.\n\n        Consider x=0: \n            For file0: \n                S_prev=0, current_file_size=6.\n\n                First condition: \n                    y_min1 = (0*6+99)//100 = 0\n                    y_max1 = (1*6-1)//100 = 5//100 = 0\n                    So y in [0,0] -> y=0.\n\n                Second condition:\n                    A = 0*6 - 100*0 = 0\n                    B = 1*6 - 0 = 6\n                    Then y_low2 = (0+99)//100 = 0\n                    y_high2 = (6-1)//100 = 5//100=0\n\n                    So y in [0,0] -> y=0.\n\n                Intersection is [0,0] -> exists.\n\n            So x=0 is included.\n\n        Now x=1:\n            First condition: \n                y_min1 = (1*6+99)//100 = 105//100 = 1\n                y_max1 = (2*6-1)//100 = 11//100=0 -> wait, 11//100=0, then [1,0] -> empty.\n\n            So x=1 fails.\n\n        But wait, the example output for the first test is:\n            Input: 1\\n6\n            Output: 0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\n\n        That does not match. \n\n        Let me reexamine: the example input in the problem is given as:\n\n            Input: \n                ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n            Output: \n                ['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n        The first example is \"1\\n6\", and the expected output is a list of numbers: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\n        Why does x=16 work?\n\n        Let me check x=16 for the first example (one file of size 6):\n\n            First condition for file0: \n                y_min1 = (16*6 + 99) // 100 = (96+99)//100 = 195//100 = 1\n                y_max1 = (17*6 - 1) // 100 = (102-1)//100 = 101//100 = 1\n\n                So y must be 1.\n\n            Second condition: \n                total=6, S_prev=0, x=16\n                A = 16*6 - 0 = 96\n                B = 17*6 - 0 = 102\n\n                Then we require 96 <= 100*y < 102 -> y must be 1 (since 100*1=100 is in [96,102))\n\n            So y=1 is valid.\n\n        Why did x=1 fail? Because the first condition for x=1 required y>=1 and the second condition required y>= ceil(6/100)=ceil(0.06)=1, but the second condition also requires 100*y < 7 (because (x+1)*total=2*6=12, so 100*y<12 -> y<0.12, so y=0). \n\n        Actually, for x=1, the second condition: \n            A = 1*6 - 0 = 6\n            B = 2*6 - 0 = 12\n\n            Then we require 6 <= 100*y < 12 -> y must be 0 (because 100*0=0 < 6 -> not satisfied) or 1? 100*1=100 -> 100>=12? no. \n\n        So the condition for the second bar for x=1 is: \n            floor(100*(0+y)/6) = 1  => 1 <= (100*y)/6 < 2\n            => 6 <= 100*y < 12\n            => y must be at least 0.06, so y>=1 (from integer) but then 100*1=100 which is >=12 -> fails.\n\n        So x=1 is not achieved.\n\n        But why is x=16 achieved? Because 16 is more than the entire file (which is 6) would give 100%? Actually, 16% of 6 is 0.96, so the first bar requires floor(0.96)=0, but wait:\n\n        Let me recalculate the first condition for x=16 and file of size 6: \n            We require floor(100*y/6)=16.\n            => 16 <= (100*y)/6 < 17\n            => 96 <= 100*y < 102\n            => y must be at least 1 (since 100*0=0 <96, 100*1=100 is in [96,102)).\n\n        Then the second condition: \n            total=6, so the entire transfer is 6. We require floor(100*(0+y)/6)=16? \n            => 16 <= (100*y)/6 < 17\n            => same as above: y must be 1.\n\n        Then the second bar: floor(100*1/6)=floor(16.66...)=16. So it matches.\n\n        However, the entire file is 6 bytes, so after 1 byte, the first bar is 16, and the second bar is also 16.\n\n        Now, why is 16 included? It is because we are in the first file and we are at the 1st byte.\n\n        But then why is 0 included? We saw that.\n\n        Why is 100 included? \n            For x=100: \n                First condition: \n                    y_min1 = (100*6+99)//100 = (600+99)//100 = 699//100=6\n                    y_max1 = (101*6-1)//100 = (606-1)//100=605//100=6\n\n                Second condition:\n                    A = 100*6 - 0 = 600\n                    B = 101*6 - 0 = 606\n                    Then we require 600 <= 100*y < 606 -> y=6.\n\n                Then the second bar: floor(100*6/6)=floor(100)=100.\n\n            So yes.\n\n        Why are the other numbers (16,33,50,66,83) appearing? \n\n        Let me check x=33:\n            First condition: \n                y_min1 = (33*6+99)//100 = (198+99)//100=297//100=2\n                y_max1 = (34*6-1)//100=203//100=2\n\n                So y=2.\n\n            Second condition: \n                A = 33*6 = 198\n                B = 34*6 = 204\n                Then 198 <= 100*y <204 -> y=2 (since 100*2=200 is in [198,204))\n\n            Then the second bar: floor(200/6)=floor(33.33...) -> 33.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Similarly, x=50: \n            First condition: y_min1 = (50*6+99)//100=(300+99)//100=399//100=3\n            y_max1 = (51*6-1)//100=305//100=3\n\n            Second condition: A=50*6=300, B=51*6=306 -> 300<=100*y<306 -> y=3 (300<=300<306) -> floor(300/6)=50.\n\n        Similarly, x=66: y=4 -> 66<= (100*4)/6=66.66 -> floor=66; and 66*6=396<=400<402 (66*6+6=402) -> wait, let me check the second condition for x=66:\n\n            Condition: floor(100*(0+4)/6)=floor(400/6)=floor(66.66)=66 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, the second condition formula: \n            x * total <= 100*(S_prev+y) < (x+1)*total\n            => 66*6 <= 100*(0+4) < 67*6\n            => 396 <= 400 < 402 -> yes.\n\n        Similarly, x=83: y=5 -> 83<= (100*5)/6=83.33 -> floor=83; and 83*6=498<=500<510 (84*6=504? Actually, (83+1)*6=84*6",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive that can be displayed simultaneously on both progress bars at some point during the copying process of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing each file sequentially and checking for each possible percentage (0 to 100) if there exists a moment during the copying of any file where both progress bars display the same percentage. The key insight is that for a given percentage `x` and a specific file, we need to find a byte count `y` within the current file such that:\n   - The first progress bar condition: `floor(100 * y / current_file_size) = x`\n   - The second progress bar condition: `floor(100 * (sum of previous files + y) / total_file_size) = x`\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each percentage `x` (0 to 100), and for each file, we calculate the range of bytes `y` in the current file that would satisfy the first progress bar condition. Then, we check if any of these `y` values also satisfy the second progress bar condition using the cumulative bytes copied up to that point.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Compute the cumulative sizes of files up to each point to efficiently determine the total bytes copied before starting the current file.\n   - **Range Calculation**: For each `x` and file, compute the valid range of `y` values that satisfy the first condition. Then, compute the valid range of `y` values that satisfy the second condition. The intersection of these ranges must be non-empty for `x` to be a valid solution.\n   - **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks each `x` (0 to 100) against each file (up to 100 files) with each file size up to 1000 bytes, resulting in a manageable number of operations (100 * 100 * 1000 = 10 million operations).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_size = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    candidates = set()\n    \n    for x in range(0, 101):\n        found = False\n        for i in range(n):\n            S_prev = prefix[i]\n            current_file_size = a[i]\n            \n            y_min1 = (x * current_file_size + 99) // 100\n            y_max1 = ((x+1) * current_file_size - 1) // 100\n            \n            low_bound1 = max(0, y_min1)\n            high_bound1 = min(current_file_size, y_max1)\n            if low_bound1 > high_bound1:\n                continue\n                \n            A_val = x * total_size - 100 * S_prev\n            B_val = (x+1) * total_size - 100 * S_prev\n            \n            if A_val < 0:\n                y_low2 = 0\n            else:\n                y_low2 = (A_val + 99) // 100\n                \n            if B_val <= 0:\n                y_high2 = -1\n            else:\n                y_high2 = (B_val - 1) // 100\n                \n            low_bound2 = max(0, y_low2)\n            high_bound2 = min(current_file_size, y_high2)\n            if low_bound2 > high_bound2:\n                continue\n                \n            if high_bound1 < low_bound2 or high_bound2 < low_bound1:\n                continue\n                \n            candidates.add(x)\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    result = sorted(candidates)\n    print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix array is computed to store cumulative file sizes, enabling efficient calculation of the total bytes copied before each file starts.\n3. **Checking Valid Percentages**: For each percentage `x` from 0 to 100, the algorithm checks each file to see if there exists a byte count `y` within the current file that satisfies both progress bar conditions. The valid ranges for `y` are derived from the floor division conditions for both progress bars.\n4. **Output**: The valid percentages are collected in a set to avoid duplicates, sorted, and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible percentages by leveraging mathematical bounds derived from the problem's conditions, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
