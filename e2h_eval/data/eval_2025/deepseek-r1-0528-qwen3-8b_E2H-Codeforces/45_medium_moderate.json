There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament grid is arranged such that two players can only play if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's denote by f(n) the maximum number of games the winner can have in a tournament starting with n players.\n\n We can think of building the tournament in rounds. The key is to arrange the matches so that the winner can play as many games as possible.\n\n Consider:\n\n If n = 2: \n   Only one game. Winner plays 1 game.\n\n If n = 3:\n   We can have two games: first between two players, then the winner against the third.\n   But wait: the rule says two players can play only if the difference in their games is at most one.\n   In the first game, both have 0. Then the winner has 1 and the loser leaves. Now for the next game, the winner (with 1 game) and the third player (with 0) have a difference of 1 -> allowed.\n   So the winner (who started the tournament) will have 2 games.\n\n If n = 4:\n   One way: \n     Round 1: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4)\n     Then the winner of round1 (say 1) plays the winner of round2 (say 3). Now, at the start of this final, player 1 has played 1 game and player 3 has played 1 game -> allowed.\n     Then the winner (say 1) has played 2 games.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try to make the winner play more?\n   Suppose we want the winner to play 3 games. Then the tournament would require that the winner must beat three opponents. However, note that in a knockout tournament, the total number of games is fixed (n-1). But the arrangement must satisfy the condition.\n\n   Another idea: we can model the tournament as having two halves (like two groups) and then the winners meet. But how to maximize the winner's games?\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let the winner play k games. Then he must have beaten k opponents. But note that the tournament structure must be such that the winner's path is built with conditions on the number of games.\n\n However, note that the condition is about the number of games each player has when they are scheduled to play. We can arrange the matches arbitrarily (as long as the condition holds) to maximize the winner's games.\n\n How to build the tournament?\n\n We can think of the tournament as being divided into two types of rounds: one where the winner plays, and other rounds.\n\n We note that the entire tournament is a binary tree (if we consider the winner as root) but the condition is about the depth (in terms of games) of the players.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to arranging a single elimination tournament but with the possibility of having byes? Or maybe we can use a balanced binary tree.\n\n However, note that the example n=4: the winner plays 2 games. For n=3, the winner plays 2 games.\n\n How about n=5?\n   We want the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n   Let the winner play k games. Then the tournament must have at least 2^k players (because each game halves the number of remaining players). However, wait: we don't necessarily have a full binary tree.\n\n   But note: the condition allows two players to play if their previous games differ by at most one. This suggests that the tournament might be built in a way that the bracket is as balanced as possible.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think in terms of \"levels\":\n\n   Let the winner be in a chain of wins. In the first game, he plays one opponent (so the opponent must have 0 games, and the winner now has 1). Then the next game, the winner must play someone who has at most 1 game (so they can be either a fresh player or a player who just won one game). \n\n   We can also consider the entire tournament as a complete binary tree, but the winner must go from the first round until the last, and we want to maximize the depth (number of wins) for the winner.\n\n   However, note: the total number of players is n. The maximum number of wins for the winner is the maximum k such that the total number of players required to set up a tournament where the winner plays k games is at least n.\n\n   In a standard single elimination tournament, the winner plays ceil(log2(n)) games. But that is the minimum number of games the winner must play? Actually, no: in a balanced tournament, the winner plays exactly floor(log2(n)) or ceil(log2(n))? Actually, the minimum number of games the winner must play is ceil(log2(n+1))-1? \n\n   But note: we are trying to maximize the number of games the winner can play. However, there is a constraint: the tournament must have n players. The winner must defeat k opponents, and each opponent must come from a distinct part of the bracket? \n\n   Actually, the problem is asking for the maximum k (number of wins) such that the tournament can be arranged so that the winner (player 1) plays k games.\n\n   Conditions for the winner to play k games:\n\n   - The first k rounds must have the winner progressing.\n\n   - In the first round, the winner plays one game. Then in the second, two, etc.\n\n   But note: the condition on the number of games: when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has already played k-1 games, and the opponent must have at most k-1 games (so the opponent can be someone who has just won k-1 games, meaning that opponent must have come from a branch of the tournament that also requires k-1 wins for that opponent).\n\n   Therefore, the entire tournament must have at least (2^k - 1) players? Not exactly, because the bracket might not be full.\n\n   However, consider:\n\n   To have the winner play k games, we need at least k rounds. In round 1, the winner defeats one player (that's one loss). Then the next round, the winner defeats another, etc. But also, the opponents in the later rounds must have won their respective matches.\n\n   Actually, the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games is:\n\n   - In the first round: the winner and one opponent. Then the opponent must have been the sole survivor of a subtree of size 1 (but wait, no: the opponent must have won his own preliminary matches).\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n   To have the winner play k games, the tournament must have at least:\n\n   - The winner's path: k wins, so k opponents, but each of these opponents must have won some games.\n\n   Specifically, the j-th opponent (the one the winner faces in the j-th game) must have won j-1 games (because when the winner is at j-1 games, the opponent must have at most j-1 games). Moreover, the opponent must have come from a subtree that has at least 2^(j-1) players? \n\n   Actually, the entire tournament must have enough players to supply the winner's opponents and the opponents' opponents.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use recursion. Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\n   Then, for k=0: 1 player (the winner alone).\n   For k=1: the winner must play one game, so we need 2 players (the winner and one opponent).\n   For k=2: the winner must have played one game and then play again. The second game requires an opponent that has played one game. That opponent must have come from a match that had 2 players (the opponent and one other). So total players: 1 (the winner) + 2 (for the first opponent's side) + 1 (the first opponent) = 4? Actually, let's count:\n\n   - The winner's first opponent must have won one game. That means that the first opponent must have been the winner of a match between 2 players (so two players feed into the first opponent). Then the winner and the two others (the first opponent and the two from his side) plus the two from the first opponent's side: total 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (his two defeated players) = 4.\n\n   Similarly, for k=3: the winner's second opponent must have won two games. That requires 4 players for that opponent's side (since two wins: minimal 4 players). Then the total is 1 + (the first opponent's side: 4) + (the second opponent's side: 4) ??? Wait, no.\n\n   Actually, the tournament structure:\n\n   - The first round: the winner plays one opponent (from a group of 2 players: A and B, so A beats B, and then the winner (player1) beats A). Then the second round: the winner (player1) must play an opponent that has played one game. This opponent must have won one game from a group of 2 players (C and D: C beats D, then the opponent E (from the second branch) has one win). Then the third round: the winner (player1) must play an opponent that has played two games. But wait, in our current setup, the opponent E only has one game. How do we get an opponent with two games?\n\n   Actually, the condition requires that the opponent has at most one game (because the winner has one game, so the difference is at most one) for the second round, and for the third round the winner has two games, so the opponent must have at most two games.\n\n   But to get an opponent that has two games, we need a subtree that has 3 players (minimal): F, G, H. Then F beats G, then F beats H. Then F has two wins. Then the second opponent (E) must have beaten F? But wait, then E would have two wins (one against D and one against F) and the winner (player1) has two wins (against B and against A) and then against E (which would be his third win). But then the total players: \n        First branch (for the first two wins of the winner): 3 (A, B, and the winner is separate) -> actually the winner is separate, then the first branch is the two players A and B (so the winner plays A, who came from beating B). Then the second branch for the second opponent (E) must have 3 players: D, F, and G? Actually, E is the opponent, so E must have two wins. The two wins for E: E must have beaten two players. But wait, the two wins for E are from the second branch. Then the entire second branch must have at least 4 players: D, F, G, and E? Actually, no: the minimal structure for E to have two wins is that E beats two players (say D and F) and then F must have beaten someone (say G). So the second branch has E, D, F, G: 4 players.\n\n   Then the entire tournament: \n        First branch: the winner's first win: 2 players (A and B).\n        Second branch: the winner's second opponent (E) must have two wins: which requires 4 players (D, F, G, and E).\n        And the winner himself.\n\n        Total: 1 (winner) + 2 (first branch) + 4 (second branch) = 7.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the recurrence:\n\n   Let f(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\n   Then, to play k games, the winner must face k opponents, each of which must have been the winner of a sub-tournament. The condition is that the opponent faced in the j-th game must have played j-1 games (so that the difference is at most 1). Therefore, the j-th opponent must have been produced by a sub-tournament that requires the winner of that sub-tournament to play j-1 games. The minimal size for a sub-tournament that produces a winner with j-1 wins is f(j-1).\n\n   However, note: the entire tournament is the winner (1) plus the k opponents, but each opponent comes from a sub-tournament of size f(j-1) (where j is the round index). But wait, the sub-tournaments are independent and the minimal size for the j-th opponent's sub-tournament is f(j-1). Then:\n\n   f(0) = 1 (only the winner)\n   f(1) = 1 + f(0) = 1+1 = 2? But wait, the first opponent must come from a sub-tournament of size at least 1 (the minimal tournament to produce an opponent that has 0 wins is 1? Actually, no: to have an opponent that has 0 wins, we need two players: the opponent and someone else that the opponent beats? No, wait: the opponent must have played 0 games? Then the opponent hasn't played any game. Then the minimal sub-tournament for the first opponent is 1? But then the first opponent must have 0 wins. Then the entire tournament for k=1: the winner and the first opponent, so 2 players.\n\n   But then for k=2: \n        The winner must have two wins. The second opponent must have been the winner of a sub-tournament that requires the opponent to have 1 win. The minimal sub-tournament for 1 win is 2 players (because the opponent must have one win, so that opponent must have beaten someone). Then the entire tournament: 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent's sub-tournament: which has 2 players) + 1 (second opponent's sub-tournament: which has 2 players) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n   But wait, our earlier calculation for k=2 was 4. Why the discrepancy?\n\n   Actually, the two sub-tournaments (for the two opponents) are independent. The first opponent is from a sub-tournament of 2 players (so the opponent is the winner of that sub-tournament). Then the second opponent is from a sub-tournament of 2 players (so the opponent is the winner of that). Then the entire tournament has the winner and the two sub-tournaments: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But wait, we know from the example n=4 that the winner can play 2 games. So what's the catch?\n\n   The catch is that the two sub-tournaments (each of 2 players) can be arranged without overlapping with the winner's initial opponent. However, the entire tournament must include the winner and all the players in the two sub-tournaments. So for k=2, we need at least 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 players? But then n=4 is not enough for the winner to play 2 games? \n\n   However, we did have a tournament with 4 players: two initial matches and then the winner of the first match (the winner of the tournament) and the winner of the second match. So the two opponents that the winner faces in the second round are the two winners of the two initial matches. Each of those initial matches is a sub-tournament of 2 players (so 2 players per sub-tournament). Then the total is 1 (winner) + 2 (first match) + 2 (second match) = 5, but wait, we have only 4 players. \n\n   This indicates that the same two players cannot be used twice. Actually, the two sub-tournaments are disjoint and each uses 2 players, so together they use 4 players, and then the winner is the fifth? But wait, the winner is one of the players? \n\n   Let me clarify: in the example n=4, the four players are: the winner (player1) and three others (players2,3,4). \n\n   The tournament is arranged as:\n        Match1: player2 vs player3 -> winner say player2\n        Match2: player4 vs ... wait, no: actually, we have four players: we must assign the matches.\n\n   Actually, the four players are: the winner (player1) and three others. But then the two matches must be:\n        Match1: player1 vs player2 -> winner1 (player1)\n        Match2: player3 vs player4 -> winner2 (say player3)\n\n   Then the final: player1 vs player3.\n\n   So the two opponents that player1 faces are player2 and player3. The opponent in the first round (player2) has 0 wins (so the sub-tournament for player2 was just one player: player2, but wait, no: the match1 was between player1 and player2. Then player2 has 0 wins (because he lost one game). \n\n   Alternatively, we can think that the condition does not require the opponent to have the same number of wins, but at most one difference. In the first game, the winner has 0 games and the opponent has 0 games -> allowed. Then the winner has 1 and the opponent has 0. Then the next game: the winner has 1 and the opponent (from the other branch) has 0 (if we put the fourth player in the second match) -> then the difference is 1, allowed.\n\n   But wait, in the example n=4, the second opponent (player3) has 0 wins (because he just played one game against player4 and won). So the second opponent has 1 win? Actually, no: in the second match, player3 and player4 play. Then player3 wins, so player3 has 1 win. Then the winner (player1) has 1 win and the second opponent (player3) has 1 win. Then the difference is 0, which is allowed.\n\n   So the minimal sub-tournament for the first opponent (player2) is 1 (because the match is just between the winner and player2). Then the minimal sub-tournament for the second opponent (player3) is 2 (because player3 must have one win, so there must be at least two players: player3 and player4). \n\n   Then the total players: 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (second opponent's sub-tournament) = 4.\n\n   Therefore, the recurrence should be:\n\n   f(k) = 1 + f(k-1) [the winner] + the minimal players for the k-th opponent's sub-tournament.\n\n   But note: the j-th opponent (for the j-th game) must have played j-1 wins. The minimal number of players for a sub-tournament that produces a winner with j-1 wins is f(j-1). However, wait: the sub-tournament for the j-th opponent must have at least f(j-1) players.\n\n   Then the total players for the entire tournament (to have the winner play k games) is:\n\n        total_players = 1 + sum_{j=1}^{k} f(j-1)\n\n   But note: the winner is one player, and then for each of the k games, we need a sub-tournament (with f(j-1) players) to provide the opponent for the j-th game.\n\n   However, we must check:\n\n   k=0: total_players = 1 -> correct.\n\n   k=1: total_players = 1 + f(0) = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   k=2: total_players = 1 + f(0) + f(1) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 -> correct.\n\n   k=3: total_players = 1 + f(0)+f(1)+f(2) = 1 + 1 + 2 + (minimal for f(2)=4) -> wait, what is f(2)? \n\n   We defined f(k) as the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Then we have:\n\n        f(0) = 1\n        f(1) = 2\n        f(2) = 4\n\n   Then for k=3: total_players = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8.\n\n   But wait, is that the minimal for k=3? Actually, the recurrence above is for the entire tournament to have the winner play k games, and we are adding the minimal sub-tournaments for each opponent. However, note that the sub-tournaments themselves are built recursively.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        Let g(k) = minimal number of players to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n        Then, to have a tournament where the winner plays k games, the tournament must have:\n          - The winner (1 player)\n          - k opponents, each coming from a sub-tournament that requires g(j) players for the j-th opponent (but wait, the j-th opponent must have j-1 wins, so the minimal sub-tournament for the j-th opponent is g(j-1)).\n\n        Then: g(k) = 1 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} g(i)\n\n   With base: g(0)=1.\n\n   Then:\n        g(0)=1\n        g(1)=1 + g(0)=2\n        g(2)=1 + g(0)+g(1)=1+1+2=4\n        g(3)=1 + g(0)+g(1)+g(2)=1+1+2+4=8\n        g(4)=1 + g(0)+g(1)+g(2)+g(3)=1+1+2+4+8=16\n\n   This looks familiar: g(k) = 2^k.\n\n   Let's check:\n\n        k=0: 2^0=1 -> correct.\n        k=1: 2^1=2 -> correct.\n        k=2: 2^2=4 -> correct.\n        k=3: 2^3=8 -> correct.\n\n   So the minimal number of players for the winner to play k games is 2^k.\n\n   Now, given n (the total number of players), we want the maximum k such that 2^k <= n? \n\n   But wait: in our recurrence, g(k) = 2^k. Then the minimal tournament requiring the winner to play k games is 2^k players.\n\n   However, note that n can be any integer (from 2 to 10^18). We are to find the maximum k (number of games the winner can play) such that there exists an arrangement.\n\n   But note: if we have n=5, then 2^2=4<=5, and 2^3=8>5, so k=2.\n\n   However, can the winner play 2 games with 5 players? Yes, because the minimal requirement for 2 games is 4 players, and we have 5 (so we can add an extra player somewhere). But the condition is that the tournament must be arranged so that the winner can play 2 games.\n\n   Actually, the condition is that the entire tournament must have at least g(k) players (which is 2^k). So the maximum k is the largest integer such that 2^k <= n.\n\n   But wait, in the example n=3: \n        According to this, 2^1=2<=3, 2^2=4>3 -> k=1. But the example output for n=3 is 2.\n\n   So this is not matching.\n\n   Let me reexamine:\n\n   We said that for the winner to play k games, the minimal number of players is 2^k. Then for k=2, minimal players is 4. But we have n=3, so k=2 would require 4 players, but we only have 3. However, the example says the answer for n=3 is 2.\n\n   This implies that the minimal tournament for 2 games is 3 players? \n\n   Let's simulate n=3:\n\n        We have three players: W (winner), A, B.\n\n        The winner must play two games. \n\n        First game: W vs A -> W wins. Now W has 1 game, A is out.\n        Second game: W vs B -> W wins. Now W has 2 games.\n\n        Condition: \n            First game: W has 0, A has 0 -> allowed.\n            Second game: W has 1, B has 0 -> allowed (difference 1).\n\n        So yes, with 3 players the winner can play 2 games.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of players for k=2 is not 4, it is 3.\n\n   What's the pattern then?\n\n   Let me compute the minimal players for k games:\n\n        k=0: 1\n        k=1: 2\n        k=2: 3\n        k=3: ?\n\n        For k=3: \n            The winner must play three games.\n\n            We need:\n                First game: W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n                Second game: W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B:1) -> but wait, B must have played one game (so B must have beaten someone). Then we need a fourth player for B to beat? Actually, we can't use the same players.\n\n            Alternatively, we can structure:\n\n            We need to have two opponents for the second game and third game.\n\n            The first opponent (A) can be from a single player (so no sub-tournament beyond the direct match).\n            The second opponent (B) must have one win. So B must have beaten someone. That someone must be a new player, say C.\n\n            Then the third opponent (D) must have two wins. So D must have beaten two players. But wait, we have only four players so far: W, A, B, C.\n\n            How do we get D? We don't have a fifth player. \n\n            Alternatively, can we use the same players? \n\n            Actually, the entire tournament must be arranged without reusing players.\n\n            Steps for k=3:\n\n            We need to have three wins for W. The three opponents (A, B, C) must be distinct.\n\n            Additionally, the second opponent (B) must have one win. So B must have beaten someone. The only candidate is A? But A has already been eliminated by W. \n\n            Or we can have a different structure: \n\n            Round 1: \n                Game1: A vs B -> winner B (then B has 1 win)\n                Game2: C vs D -> winner D (then D has 1 win)\n\n            Then the winner W (who hasn't played yet) must face two opponents: but wait, the tournament is arranged arbitrarily. \n\n            Actually, the problem states that the tournament is knockout and the grid is arranged arbitrarily (satisfying the condition). \n\n            Let me try:\n\n            We have 5 players: W, A, B, C, D.\n\n            We want W to play 3 games.\n\n            Possibility:\n\n            Round1:\n                W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n                B vs C -> B wins (B:1, C:0)\n                D must wait.\n\n            Round2:\n                W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B:1) -> condition: W has 1, B has 1 -> ok.\n                Then the winner W must face D (who hasn't played) -> Round3: W vs D -> W wins.\n\n            Now, how many players: W, A, B, C, D -> 5.\n\n            Alternatively, can we do it with 4 players?\n\n            Let n=4: W, A, B, C.\n\n            Round1:\n                W vs A -> W wins (W:1, A:0)\n                B vs C -> B wins (B:1, C:0)\n\n            Round2:\n                W vs B -> W wins (W:2, B:1) -> condition: W has 1, B has 1 -> ok.\n\n            Then the winner W has 2 wins. We don't have a third game because there's no one left.\n\n            So to have 3 wins, we need at least 5 players.\n\n            Now, what is the minimal number of players for k=3? 5.\n\n            Then the sequence: \n                k=0: 1\n                k=1: 2\n                k=2: 3\n                k=3: 5\n\n            This looks like the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n            Actually, we can define:\n\n                g(0) = 1\n                g(1) = 2\n                g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2)   [because the k-th game requires one opponent from a sub-tournament of g(k-1) and the other from a sub-tournament of g(k-2)?]\n\n            But wait, let me explain:\n\n            To have a tournament where the winner plays k games, the last two games (the (k-1)-th and k-th) must be against two opponents, one of which must have been built from a tournament that took g(k-1) players (the one that has k-2 wins) and the other from g(k-2) players (the one that has k-3 wins)? \n\n            Actually, the condition: the k-th game: the winner has k-1 wins, and the opponent must have at most k-1 wins. The opponent must have exactly k-2 wins (if we are to minimize the total players) because if the opponent has fewer than k-2 wins, we could have included more players from the opponent's side.\n\n            However, the minimal way is to have the opponent in the k-th game having k-1 wins? Actually no: the condition only says at most k-1, but the opponent must have exactly k-2 wins (because if the opponent has k-1 wins, then that opponent would have played k-1 games, and then the total players would be even more).\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n                Let h(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\n                Then, the tournament has two parts: the winner and the two halves (left and right). The last two games (the two finals) are the two biggest subtrees.\n\n                The winner must have played k-1 games to get to the last game. The opponent in the last game must have played k-1 games? Not necessarily, but to minimize the total players we assume the opponent has as few games as possible (but still satisfying the condition: the difference is at most one). The winner has k-1, so the opponent must have at least k-2 and at most k-1.\n\n                However, we are minimizing the total players, so we choose the opponent that has k-2 wins (so we don't require an extra win for the opponent). Then the opponent must have been produced by a tournament that requires h(k-2) players (for k-2 wins). \n\n                Then the entire tournament is: the winner, plus the two sub-tournaments (one for the last opponent and one for the rest). But note: the rest of the tournament (excluding the last two games) is actually the entire tournament for k-1 games? Not exactly.\n\n                Alternatively, consider:\n\n                The tournament can be split into two subtrees (for the two halves) that meet at the last two games. The winner must have won one of the halves (the left half) and then the opponent from the right half. \n\n                The left half: the winner must have played k-1 games, so the left half requires h(k-1) players (including the winner and the left half's champion). The right half: the opponent must have played k-2 games (since the winner has k-1, so the opponent can have k-2). Then the right half requires h(k-2) players.\n\n                Then the total players: h(k) = 1 + h(k-1) + h(k-2)\n\n                But wait, the winner is already counted in h(k-1) (the left half) and the right half is separate. However, the definition of h(k) is the minimal number of players for the entire tournament.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    h(0) = 1\n                    h(1) = 2\n\n                For k=2: h(2) = 1 + h(1) + h(0) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. But we saw that k=2 can be done with 3 players.\n\n                This doesn't match.\n\n            Let me try a different recurrence:\n\n                The tournament has the winner and then two subtrees: one for the last game (opponent) and one for the rest of the games the winner played.\n\n                Actually, the winner's k-1 wins before the last game must have been fought in a sub-tournament that requires h(k-1) players (including the winner). Then the last game is against an opponent from a sub-tournament of h(k-2) players (because the opponent must have k-2 wins). Then the total players is h(k) = h(k-1) + h(k-2)\n\n                But then:\n\n                    h(0) = 1\n                    h(1) = 2\n                    h(2) = h(1) + h(0) = 2+1=3 -> matches our n=3 for k=2.\n                    h(3) = h(2)+h(1)=3+2=5 -> matches our n=5 for k=3.\n\n                Then the recurrence is:\n\n                    h(0) = 1\n                    h(1) = 2\n                    h(k) = h(k-1) + h(k-2)   for k>=2.\n\n                This is the Fibonacci sequence (but shifted).\n\n                We can write:\n\n                    h(0) = 1\n                    h(1) = 2\n                    h(2) = 3\n                    h(3) = 5\n                    h(4) = 8\n                    h(5) = 13\n\n                Then the maximum number of games the winner can play is the maximum k such that h(k) <= n.\n\n                Example:\n\n                    n=2: k=1 -> h(1)=2<=2 -> answer=1.\n                    n=3: k=2 -> h(2)=3<=3 -> answer=2.\n                    n=4: k=2 -> h(2)=3<=4, but h(3)=5>4 -> answer=2.\n                    n=10: \n                        h(0)=1, h(1)=2, h(2)=3, h(3)=5, h(4)=8, h(5)=13 -> so k=4 because h(4)=8<=10, h(5)=13>10 -> answer=4.\n\n                The sample input ['2','3','4','10'] gives output ['1','2','2','4'].\n\n                So this matches.\n\n            Therefore, the solution is:\n\n                We are given n (number of players).\n\n                We want the maximum k such that h(k) <= n, where h(0)=1, h(1)=2, and h(k)=h(k-1)+h(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n                Then output k.\n\n            However, note: k is the number of games the winner plays, and k starts at 0 for the winner not playing any game (n=1, but n>=2). \n\n            Steps:\n\n                Precompute the Fibonacci-like sequence h(k) until the value exceeds n.\n\n                But n can be up to 10^18, so we cannot iterate k from 0 until we exceed n (because k is logarithmic in n, but the sequence grows exponentially, so k is about log_phi(n) which is around 50 for n=1e18).\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n                Let k = 0, a = 1, b = 2.\n                While b <= n:\n                    k = 1   # because we are counting the last k for which h(k)<=n, but we are updating k at the beginning of the loop?\n                    Actually, we want to store the last k for which h(k)<=n.\n\n                Alternatively:\n\n                Let k = 0\n                h0 = 1\n                h1 = 2\n                if n < h0: then k=0 (but n>=2, so skip)\n                if n >= h0 and n < h1: then k=0 -> but the winner must play at least one game? Actually, for n=1, k=0, but n>=2.\n\n                We want the maximum k such that h(k) <= n.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  k0 = 0, h0 = 1\n                  k1 = 1, h1 = 2\n                  k2 = 2, h2 = 3\n                  ...\n\n                We can iterate:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a = 1   # h0\n                  b = 2   # h1\n                  while b <= n:\n                      a, b = b, a+b\n                      k += 1\n\n                  Then the answer is k (the last k for which h(k)=b <= n) OR we break when b>n, then the previous k is the answer.\n\n                But wait, we are updating k at every iteration. Let me simulate for n=2:\n\n                  Initially: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n                  Check: b<=2 -> true.\n                  Then: a becomes 2, b becomes 1+2=3, k becomes 1.\n                  Then check: 3<=2? false, so break.\n                  Then we return k=1. Correct.\n\n                For n=3:\n\n                  Initially: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n                  Iteration1: ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each term represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that the winner must defeat opponents in each round, and the number of games each opponent has played must differ by at most one from the winner's current games. This constraint leads us to model the solution using a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Sequence Definition**: Define a sequence `h(k)` where `h(0) = 1` (no games played), `h(1) = 2` (one game played), and for `k >= 2`, `h(k) = h(k-1) + h(k-2)`. This sequence gives the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\n3. **Binary Search**: Given the exponential growth of the sequence, we can efficiently find the maximum `k` such that `h(k) <= n` by iterating through the sequence until the value exceeds `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    k = 0\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input `n` is read, representing the number of players. If `n` is 1, the winner plays 0 games, so we print 0 and exit.\n2. **Sequence Generation**: We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 1 and 2, representing `h(0)` and `h(1)`. We then iterate, updating `a` and `b` to the next terms in the sequence (`b` becomes `a + b`), and incrementing `k` (the count of games) with each iteration.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` (the current term in the sequence) is less than or equal to `n`. Once `b` exceeds `n`, the loop exits, and the last value of `k` is printed, which is the maximum number of games the winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` (up to 10^18).",
