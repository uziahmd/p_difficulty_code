Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n  We want the minimum number of cards. So we want to use as few cards as possible to get a total of -S.\n\n 4. Consider:\n    - If S == 0, then we don't need any additional cards -> answer 0.\n\n 5. Otherwise, we have to make up the difference D = -S (so we need to cover D with the sum of the new cards).\n\n 6. But note: we can use negative and positive numbers. However, to minimize the number of cards, we would like to use the largest absolute value per card.\n\n 7. Actually, we can think greedily:\n    - The best we can do in one card is to use a card of value either x (if D is positive) or -x (if D is negative). \n      But note: we can also use negative and positive together, but since we are minimizing the count, we would prefer to use the maximum absolute value.\n\n 8. However, note: if we have to cover a deficit (say D is negative, meaning we need to add negative numbers) then we can use negative cards.\n\n 9. Actually, we can reframe: we need to cover the deficit D (which is -S) with a set of numbers each in [-x, x]. We want the minimum number of cards.\n\n 10. This is similar to: how to represent D as a sum of k integers, each between -x and x, and we want the smallest k.\n\n 11. But note: we can also use positive and negative arbitrarily. However, the problem is symmetric.\n\n 12. Alternatively, note that the maximum absolute value we can cover with k cards is k*x. But we have to consider both positive and negative.\n\n 13. Actually, we can break it down:\n\n     Let D = -S (the amount we need to add)\n\n     We can use k cards. The maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x, and the maximum negative is -k*x.\n\n     So we require: |D| <= k*x   [because the total added must be at least |D| in absolute value? Actually, we need the total added to be exactly D, which might be positive or negative]\n\n     But wait: we can also mix. However, we are not limited to only one sign. The condition is: the total added must be D.\n\n     However, note: we can use any combination. The key is: what is the minimum k such that we can form D?\n\n     Conditions for k:\n        - The total must be D, so the sum of k numbers (each in [-x, x]) must equal D.\n\n     What are the constraints?\n        - The maximum absolute value we can achieve with k cards is k*x. Therefore, we must have |D| <= k*x.\n\n     But is that sufficient? \n\n        Example: D=1, x=1, k=1 -> yes, because 1 is in [-1,1].\n        Example: D=2, x=1, k=2 -> yes, because 1+1=2.\n        Example: D=2, x=1, k=1 -> no, because maximum is 1.\n\n     However, note: we can also use negative numbers. But if D is positive, we can use positive numbers. Similarly, if D is negative, we use negative.\n\n     But wait: what if D is positive? Then we can only use positive numbers? Not necessarily: we could use negative numbers and then compensate with more positive? \n        However, we are trying to minimize the number of cards. So we don't want to use negative numbers if we are going to overshoot and then correct? \n\n     Actually, the minimal k must satisfy two conditions:\n        Condition 1: |D| <= k*x   (because we cannot exceed k*x in absolute value)\n        Condition 2: Additionally, note that the parity condition? Actually, no parity condition because we can use any integers.\n\n     But wait: what if D is 3, x=2, k=2? \n        Maximum absolute value for two cards is 4, but can we form 3? \n            We can use 2 and 1? But wait, the available numbers are from -2 to 2. 1 is allowed, so yes: 2+1=3.\n\n     However, note: the available numbers are integers from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range.\n\n     Now, note that the problem is: we can use any integer from -x to x. Therefore, we can adjust the sum by any integer step as long as the total doesn't exceed k*x in absolute value.\n\n     But actually, we can also use non-consecutive steps? Since we have every integer in the range, we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x and T has the same parity as k*x? \n\n     Wait, that's not true. For example, with k=1, x=2: we can form any integer from -2 to 2. That includes both even and odd.\n\n     Actually, the set of sums we can form with k cards is all integers T such that |T| <= k*x and T ≡ k mod 2? \n\n     Let me check: \n        k=1: T from -x to x -> no parity constraint (unless x is fixed, but the set is symmetric and consecutive, so no parity constraint on T).\n        k=2: T from -2*x to 2*x, and since we can use two numbers, the sum of two integers (each in [-x,x]) can be any integer in that range? \n\n        Example: x=2, k=2: \n          We can form 0: (0,0) or (1,-1) etc.\n          We can form 1: (2,-1) -> 1, but wait: 2 is allowed (since x=2) and -1 is allowed, so yes.\n\n        Actually, the set of integers we can form with k cards is all integers T such that |T| <= k*x. Why?\n\n        Because the minimal step is 1 (we have consecutive integers). We can use the following:\n\n        We can form any integer between -k*x and k*x. Why?\n          Base: k=1 -> [-x, x] which is contiguous (if x>=1) but note: we don't necessarily have consecutive integers? \n          Actually, we have every integer from -x to x. So for k=1, we have all integers from -x to x.\n\n        For k=2: \n          The minimal sum is -2*x, then -2*x+1, ... until 2*x.\n\n        But wait, let me check: \n          We can form 0, then 1: we can use (x, 1-x) but wait, 1-x might be negative if x>=1? \n          Actually, we can use (x, 0) to get x, then (x,1) to get x+1, but wait, we have to use two cards.\n\n        Actually, the set of sums for k cards is the Minkowski sum of k copies of the interval [-x, x]. And the Minkowski sum of intervals [-x, x] k times is [-k*x, k*x] and since the set is symmetric and contains consecutive integers, the sum will contain every integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n        Why? By the following: \n          We can adjust the two largest cards to change the sum by 1. For instance, if we have two cards, we can start from (x, x) and then replace one card by x-1 to get 2*x-1, then x-2 to get 2*x-2, etc. But we can also use negative steps.\n\n        Actually, the set of sums for two cards is: {a+b : a,b in [-x,x]} = [-2*x, 2*x] and since we can change the two cards independently and the step is 1, the entire interval is filled.\n\n        Similarly, for k cards, the set of sums is [-k*x, k*x] and every integer in between.\n\n     Therefore, the condition for k is: |D| <= k*x.\n\n     Then the minimum k is ceil(|D| / x). \n\n     But wait, let me test with examples:\n\n        Example 1: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2'] \n          n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> current sum = (-1+1+2)=2, so D = -2.\n          Then k_min = ceil(|-2|/2) = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. -> matches the sample.\n\n        Example 2: ['2 3\\n-2 -2']\n          n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> current sum = -4, so D=4.\n          Then k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2. -> matches.\n\n     But wait, let me test another: \n        D=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. \n        With two cards, we can form 3? Yes: 2+1=3, and 1 and 2 are in [-2,2].\n\n     However, note: what if D=0? Then k_min=0. That's correct.\n\n     But wait, what if D=1, x=10? Then k_min=ceil(1/10)=1. Correct.\n\n     What if D=0? Then we don't need any cards -> 0.\n\n     However, what if D=0? Our formula gives ceil(0/x)=0. So that's fine.\n\n     But note: the above reasoning holds only if we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x]. We have established that we can.\n\n     Therefore, the answer is: \n        Let S = sum(found_cards)\n        Let D = -S\n        Then we need the smallest integer k such that |D| <= k*x.\n\n        k_min = ceil(|D| / x)   [if |D|>0, then we need at least ceil(|D|/x) cards]\n\n     However, note: if D=0, then k_min=0.\n\n     But wait: what if D is negative? We use |D|, so that's okay.\n\n     But wait: what if D is positive? Then |D|=D, so condition is D <= k*x.\n\n     However, note: the condition is |D| <= k*x, so the same for positive and negative.\n\n     But wait: is there any case where |D| <= k*x is necessary and sufficient? \n\n        Necessary: yes, because the maximum absolute sum we can get with k cards is k*x.\n        Sufficient: yes, because we can form any integer in [-k*x, k*x].\n\n     Therefore, the answer is the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that k*x >= |D|.\n\n        k_min = ceil(|D| / x)\n\n     But note: if |D| is 0, then k_min=0.\n\n     However, what if |D| is not divisible by x? Then we round up.\n\n     Example: |D|=3, x=2 -> 3/2=1.5 -> ceil(1.5)=2.\n\n     But wait, what if |D|=0? Then 0/x=0 -> ceil(0)=0.\n\n     But note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So if we need to form D, we don't require the same sign. \n\n     However, there is an alternative: sometimes we can use a mix of positive and negative? But wait, if D is positive, we want to use positive numbers? Actually, we can use negative numbers to reduce the positive ones, but that would require more cards? \n\n     Actually, the above reasoning does not require the same sign. We can use negative numbers to offset a positive one, but then we are effectively moving the total closer to zero. However, we want to achieve a positive D? Then we want to avoid negative numbers if we are going to use the minimal number of cards.\n\n     But note: the problem does not restrict the sign. However, if we are going to cover a positive D, we can use positive numbers and that is the most efficient. Similarly, for negative D, we use negative numbers.\n\n     However, the above condition (|D| <= k*x) is independent of sign. \n\n     But wait: what if we need to cover a positive D? Then we can use k cards of value x, and the total is k*x. We require k*x >= D. Similarly, for negative D, we use k cards of value -x, and the total is -k*x, and we require |D| <= k*x.\n\n     However, what if we are allowed to use both positive and negative? Then we might be able to form D with fewer cards? \n\n     Example: D=1, x=2. We can use one card: 1 is in [-2,2] -> so one card. But if we use two cards, we can also form 1 (for example, 2 and -1). However, one card is enough.\n\n     But wait, our condition was |D| <= k*x. For k=1: |1|<=2 -> true, so k=1 is the minimal.\n\n     Another example: D=3, x=2. \n        k=1: 3<=2? no.\n        k=2: 3<=4 -> yes, so k=2. And indeed, we can form 3 with two cards (2+1).\n\n     But wait, what if D=0? Then k=0.\n\n     However, consider a different scenario: sometimes we might be able to use a mix to form D with fewer cards than ceil(|D|/x)? \n\n     Actually, the condition |D| <= k*x is necessary, and the sufficiency comes from the fact that we can form any integer in the range. So the minimal k is indeed ceil(|D|/x).\n\n     But wait: consider D=2, x=3. Then ceil(2/3)=1. And indeed, we can use one card with 2.\n\n     So the algorithm:\n\n        Read n and x.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n\n        total_sum = sum(list)\n        D = -total_sum\n\n        if D == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # We need the smallest k such that k*x >= abs(D)\n            k = abs(D) // x\n            if abs(D) % x != 0:\n                k += 1\n            print(k)\n\n     However, wait: what if D is negative? Then abs(D) is positive, so same.\n\n     But wait, let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2'] \n            n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> total_sum = 2, D=-2 -> abs(D)=2.\n            k = 2//2 = 1, and 2%2==0 -> so k=1. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: ['2 3\\n-2 -2']\n            n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> total_sum=-4, D=4 -> abs(D)=4.\n            k = 4//3 = 1, then 4%3 !=0 -> k=2. Correct.\n\n     However, wait: what if D is negative? Example: \n        Input: \"2 5\\n1 1\" -> total_sum=2, D=-2, abs(D)=2, then k=ceil(2/5)=1.\n\n     But wait, is there a catch?\n\n     Let me consider: what if D=5, x=5 -> ceil(5/5)=1 -> correct.\n\n     What if D=6, x=5 -> ceil(6/5)=2 -> correct.\n\n     But wait, consider D=0. We handled that separately.\n\n     However, note: the above code for D!=0 uses absolute value. But what if D is negative? The absolute value is positive.\n\n     But wait, what if the deficit is very large? \n\n     However, note: the problem says the initial cards have numbers with absolute value <= x, and we are given n (at most 1000) and x (at most 1000). So the total_sum can be as large as 1000*x (if all are x) or as low as -1000*x. Then D can be as large as 1000*x (in absolute value). \n\n     Then k = ceil(|D|/x) = ceil((1000*x)/x) = 1000. But wait, we are only adding cards, and we can use any card in [-x,x]. \n\n     However, the minimal k is ceil(|D|/x). \n\n     But wait, there is a catch: what if the deficit D is zero? Then we don't need any cards.\n\n     However, what if the deficit D is not zero? Then we need at least ceil(|D|/x) cards.\n\n     But wait: consider the possibility of using both positive and negative cards to cancel out? \n\n        Example: D=3, x=2. We said k=2. But what if we use two cards: one 2 and one 1, then total added is 3. \n\n        Alternatively, could we use three cards? But we are looking for the minimum.\n\n     However, note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So the above reasoning holds.\n\n     But wait: there's an alternative view. Sometimes, we might be able to use a card with a negative value to fix the sum even if the deficit is positive? \n\n        Example: D=1, x=2. We can use one card: 1. Or we can use two cards: 2 and -1, but that gives 1 as well. However, one card is better.\n\n        Example: D=0, x=2. We can use two cards: 1 and -1, but we don't need to because we already have 0.\n\n     However, the above reasoning does not require mixing because the condition |D| <= k*x is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a representation.\n\n     But wait: what if we have to cover a deficit that is not aligned with the step of x? \n\n        Example: D=1, x=2. We can use one card (value 1) and that is within [-2,2]. So one card is enough.\n\n        Example: D=3, x=2. We need two cards because one card can only give at most 2 (if positive) or at least -2 (if negative). So two cards.\n\n     Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n     However, note: the problem statement says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range.\n\n     But wait: what if the deficit D is 0? Then we don't need any cards.\n\n     There's one more edge: what if the deficit D is very small, say 1, and x is 1000? Then we still need only one card.\n\n     Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        deficit = -total\n\n        if deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Take absolute value of deficit\n            abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n            # How many cards do we need? \n            # k_min = ceil(abs_deficit / x)\n            # We can compute: \n            #   If abs_deficit % x == 0: k = abs_deficit // x\n            #   Else: k = abs_deficit // x + 1\n\n            k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x   # This is a common way to compute ceiling division without floats\n\n            print(k)\n\n     However, note: the ceiling division formula: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b when a and b are positive.\n\n     But in our case, deficit might be negative, but we take absolute value so abs_deficit is positive.\n\n     But wait, what if deficit is negative? We use absolute value, so it's positive.\n\n     Let me test the ceiling division:\n\n        a=3, b=2: (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n        a=4, b=2: (4+2-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> but 4/2=2, so ceil(2)=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait, 5//2 in integer floor division is 2, which is correct.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        import math\n        k = math.ceil(abs_deficit / x)\n\n     But the problem constraints are small (x and abs_deficit up to 1000*1000 = 1000000, but actually n<=1000 and x<=1000, so abs_deficit <= 1000*1000 = 1000000) so we can use integer arithmetic or math.ceil.\n\n     However, the problem says x>=1, so we can use integer arithmetic.\n\n     But note: if deficit is negative, we take absolute value. So abs_deficit is positive.\n\n     But wait: what if deficit is negative and very large? Then abs_deficit is positive and large.\n\n     However, the above formula (using ceiling) is standard.\n\n     But wait, there is a caveat: the problem says the deficit must be achieved by the sum of the cards. But note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x,x] for each card.\n\n     The above reasoning holds because we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] with k cards.\n\n     However, wait: what if the deficit D is not an integer? \n\n        But note: the deficit D is the negative of the sum of integers, so D is an integer.\n\n     Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        d = -s\n        if d == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Compute the absolute value of d\n            abs_d = abs(d)\n            # Ceiling division: (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n     But wait, let me test with the example: \n        Input: \"1 10\\n5\"\n            n=1, x=10, cards=[5] -> s=5, d=-5 -> abs_d=5, k=(5+10-1)//10 = (14)//10=1 -> correct.\n\n     However, wait: the example \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> d=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n     But wait, what if the deficit is 0? Then we skip the else and print 0.\n\n     However, there is an alternative: we can handle deficit=0 without a separate condition by the ceiling formula? \n        If d=0, then abs_d=0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 when x>=1 (since x-1 < x, so floor division gives 0). \n\n        Example: x=10, (0+10-1)//10 = 9//10=0.\n\n     So we can simplify:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        d = -s\n        abs_d = abs(d)\n        k = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n        # But wait: what if d is negative? We took absolute value.\n\n        However, note: if d is negative, then abs_d is positive. And if d is positive, then we need to cover a positive deficit.\n\n        But wait: if d is positive, then we need to add a positive amount. Each card can be at most x, so we need at least ceil(d/x) cards.\n\n        However, note: d is defined as -s, so if s is negative, then d is positive. \n\n        Example: s=-4 -> d=4 (positive). Then we need to cover 4.\n\n        But wait, our formula uses abs_d, so that's the same.\n\n     Therefore, we can write without the if:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        d = -s\n        abs_d = abs(d)\n        if abs_d == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n     Or even without the if:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        d = -s\n        abs_d = abs(d)\n        # When abs_d is 0, (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, so x-1 < x -> floor division by x is 0)\n        k = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n     But wait, if abs_d=0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0, because x-1 < x, so integer floor division is 0. So we can just print k.\n\n     Therefore, the code can be simplified to:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        d = -s\n        abs_d = abs(d)\n        k = (abs_d + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n     However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? We use abs_d, so that's positive.\n\n     But wait: what if the deficit is negative? Then we are covering a negative deficit, which means we need to add negative numbers. The same formula applies because we are using absolute value.\n\n     Example: deficit=-5 (meaning we need to add -5, so the total added must be -5) -> then abs_d=5, and we need ceil(5/x) cards. Correct.\n\n     Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n     But wait, let me test with a negative deficit:\n\n        Input: \"1 10\\n5\" -> s=5, d=-5, abs_d=5, k=(5+10-1)//10 = 14//10=1 -> correct.\n\n        Input: \"2 10\\n5 5\" -> s=10, d=-10, abs_d=10, k=(10+10-1)//10 = 19//10=1 (since 19//10=1 in floor division) -> but wait, 19//10=1? Actually, 19//10 is 1 in integer floor division? No, 19//10 is 1? \n\n        Let me compute: 19//10 = 1 (because floor division rounds down). But (10+10-1)=19, and 19//10=1, but we need 1 card? Actually, we need 1 card of -10? But wait, 10 is the absolute value, so we can use one card of -10 to make the total 0. Correct.\n\n        Actually, we need to cover a deficit of 10, and one card of -10 is allowed because x=10 (so -10 is in [-10,10]). So one card is enough.\n\n     But wait, what if the deficit is 11, x=10? \n        k = (11+10-1)//10 = (20)//10=2 -> correct.\n\n     However, wait: what if the deficit is 10, x=10? \n        k = (10+10-1)//10 = 19//10=1 -> correct.\n\n     But wait: the formula for ceiling division: \n        ceil(a/b) = (a-1)//b + 1   [for positive a and b] \n        But we did (a+b-1)//b.\n\n        Example: a=10, b=10 -> (10+10-1)//10 = 19//10=1 -> but ceil(10/10)=1, so correct.\n\n        Example: a=11, b=10 -> (11+10-1)//10=20//10=2 -> ceil(11/10)=2, correct.\n\n     So the formula is correct.\n\n     However, note: the problem constraints say that the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, but the deficit D might be larger than x (in absolute value). \n\n     Example: n=1000, x=1000, and all cards are 1000 -> total_sum=1000000, deficit=-1000000, then k=(1000000+1000-1)//1000 = 1000999//1000=1000 (since 1000999//1000 is 1000 with remainder 999). But wait, 1000999//1000 is 1000? \n\n        1000 * 1000 = 1000000, which is less than 1000000? Actually, no: 1000000 is the deficit. The formula: \n            k = ceil(1000000/1000) = ceil(1000) = 1000.\n\n        But (1000000+1000-1)//1000 = (1000999)//1000 = 1000 (because 1000*1000=1000000, and 1000999 is 1000*1000+999, so floor division by 1000 is 1000).\n\n        But wait, 1000*1000 = 1000000, so we need 1000 cards of -1000 to get -1000000. So 1000 is correct.\n\n     Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -s\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n\n        # If deficit is 0, then abs_deficit is 0 -> k=0.\n        # Otherwise, k = ceil(abs_deficit / x)\n\n        # Using integer arithmetic for ceiling division for positive numbers\n        if abs_deficit == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n     But we can combine:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -s\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n        k = 0 if abs_deficit == 0 else (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n     Or even:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -s\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n        # Using the formula: if deficit is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, then x-1 < x, so floor division by x is 0)\n        k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n     Let me test with deficit=0: \n        abs_deficit=0, then k = (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> for x=5: (4)//5=0 -> correct.\n\n     So we can simply do:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -s\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n        k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n     This should work.\n\n     However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? We use absolute value, so that's positive.\n\n     But wait: the deficit is defined as -s, so if s is negative, deficit is positive. And if s is positive, deficit is negative. But then we take absolute value, so it's positive.\n\n     So the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_sum = sum(arr)\n        deficit = -total_sum\n        abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n        k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n     Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> total_sum=2, deficit=-2, abs_deficit=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> total_sum=-4, deficit=4, abs_deficit=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n     Therefore, we output the code.\n\n     However, wait: the problem says that the initial set has cards from -x to x. We are assuming that we can use any integer in that range. \n\n     But note: the above reasoning about forming any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] relies on the fact that the set of available numbers is the entire set of integers from -x to x. \n\n     This is correct.\n\n     Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the numbers on the found cards must be zero. If the current sum of the found cards is `S`, then the sum of the additional cards must be `-S`. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards (each with a value between -x and x) that can sum up to `-S`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the absolute value of the deficit (`-S`). Specifically, the minimal number of cards `k` is the ceiling of the absolute deficit divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` (or `-x`) towards covering the deficit. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the total sum of the found cards, determining the deficit needed to make this sum zero, and then computing the minimal number of cards required using ceiling division. The ceiling division is efficiently computed using integer arithmetic: `(abs(deficit) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves summing `n` integers, which takes O(n) time, and then performing constant-time arithmetic operations. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    deficit = -total_sum\n    abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n    \n    if abs_deficit == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = (abs_deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x` for any card, and the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The total sum of the found cards is computed. The deficit needed to make this sum zero is simply the negative of this total sum.\n3. **Deficit Handling**: If the deficit is zero, no additional cards are needed, and the answer is 0. Otherwise, the minimal number of cards required is calculated using ceiling division of the absolute deficit by `x`.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to achieve a zero sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insights to solve the problem with optimal performance.",
