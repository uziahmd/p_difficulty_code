He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b.\n The second line is a string representing a number in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the given number (which is in base a) to an integer (base 10) first, then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    However, note: the input number is given in base a. We must first convert it to base 10 (or decimal) and then if b is R, we convert from base 10 to Roman.\n\n 2. But wait: the problem says the second part is either an integer b or the letter 'R'. So we have two cases.\n\n Approach:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (so we can convert a and b to integers)\n   - Convert the given string (which is in base a) to a base 10 integer.\n   - Then convert that base 10 integer to base b (with digits above 9 represented by letters starting from 'A' for 10).\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n   - Convert the given string (base a) to base 10 integer.\n   - Then convert that base 10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n However, note the guarantee: if we have Roman numerals included the number would be <= 300010 and not zero. Also, the input string might have leading zeros.\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n For converting the input string (which is in base a) to a base 10 integer:\n   - We traverse each digit of the string. Since the base a can be up to 25, the digits can be represented by:\n        '0' to '9' for values 0-9, and for values 10 to a-1, we use letters? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but note the input is given as a string.\n\n   But note: the input string is non-negative and may contain leading zeros. The length can be up to 1000, so we must be careful with large numbers.\n\n   However, the problem states: In any other case (if not Roman) the number won't be greater than 10^15^10? Actually, wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\", meaning 10^1510? That is a very big number. But note: the base a is at most 25, and the string length is at most 1000. So the maximum value in base a (base 25) with 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is astronomically huge. But the problem says \"if we have Roman numerals\" then the number is <= 300010 and not zero, and in any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510. \n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\". And then: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\n   This seems contradictory because if we don't use Roman numerals, the base b is an integer, and the number is at most 10^1510. But 10^1510 is a very big number and converting from base a (which is at most 25) to base b (which is at most 25) might be done by converting to base 10 first? But base 10 representation of 10^1510 is a 1 followed by 1510 zeros, which is too big to handle directly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid converting to base 10 by doing the conversion in two steps: first convert the base a string to a base 10 integer (but note: 10^1510 is way beyond what Python can handle as an integer without arbitrary precision? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the problem says the number is non-negative and the length is up to 1000, and base a up to 25. So the maximum number is 25^1000, which is about 10^(1000*log10(25)) ~ 10^(1000*1.4) = 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510? Actually, the problem says for non-Roman the number is <= 10^1510, but our base a string might be up to 1000 digits in base 25, which is 25^1000 ~ 10^1400, which is acceptable because 10^1510 is bigger than 10^1400? Actually, 10^1510 is 1e1510, which is much larger. But wait, the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", so we are safe because our base a number (with base<=25 and length<=1000) is at most 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, and 10^1400 < 10^1510.\n\n   However, we cannot convert a base a string (with base up to 25) of length 1000 to an integer if we use base 10 representation because the number might be too big to represent as a string (but Python integers are arbitrary precision, so we can do it). But we must be cautious because the problem says the number in non-Roman case is at most 10^1510, and 10^1510 has 1511 digits, but our base a string is only 1000 digits. So we can convert the base a string to a base 10 integer by:\n\n        n = 0\n        for digit in s:\n            # Convert each character to a digit in base a\n            if '0' <= digit <= '9':\n                d = ord(digit) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(digit) - ord('A') + 10   # But wait: the problem says for bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the digits are from '0' to ... and then letters for 10 and above.\n\n            However, note: the base a might be as low as 2, so we cannot have digits above base a-1.\n\n        But the problem says: \"a non-negative integer c in base a\", so the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. And the representation uses digits from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' onward for digits above 9. But the base a might be 11, then we don't need letters beyond 'A'. However, the input string might have a digit that is a letter even if the base is small? Actually, no: the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be valid for base a. Therefore, the digits in the string must be between '0' and the digit representing a-1. \n\n        Example: if a=11, then digits are 0-10, and 10 is represented by 'A'. So if we see a digit 'A' in the input, then base a must be at least 11.\n\n        How to map the characters?\n          - For digits 0-9: use the character '0' to '9'\n          - For digits 10 and above: use the letters starting from 'A'\n\n        But note: the problem says \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n        However, the input string might have a digit that is a letter, and we must know the base a to validate. But the problem does not require validation, so we assume the input is correct.\n\n        Steps for converting the base a string to an integer (base 10):\n\n            num = 0\n            power = 1\n            for i from last character to first (or iterate from left to right, but then we need to multiply by base appropriately):\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in s:\n                # Map char to digit d\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # Check if d is within [0, a-1]? The problem says the input is valid, so skip.\n\n                n = n * a + d\n\n        However, note: the base a can be as high as 25, and the string length is up to 1000. The number n might be very large (like 25^1000), but we are told that in non-Roman cases, the number is <= 10^1510, and 25^1000 is about 10^1400, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the number in non-Roman case is at most 10^1510, but actually the base a representation of 10^1510 in base a (with a<=25) would be a very long string. However, we are given the string and the base a, so we are just converting the given string.\n\n Case 2: converting base 10 integer to base b (if b is an integer) or to Roman (if b is 'R').\n\n For base b (integer) conversion:\n\n   We have the base 10 integer n, and we want to convert to base b (with digits: 0 to b-1). Digits above 9 are represented by letters: 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, etc.\n\n   Steps:\n      if n == 0: then output \"0\"\n      else:\n          digits = []\n          while n:\n              r = n % b\n              n = n // b\n              digits.append(r)\n\n          Then reverse the digits and map each digit to:\n             if digit < 10: str(digit)\n             else: chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n\n   However, note: the problem says to omit leading zeros, and this method naturally produces no leading zeros.\n\n For Roman numeral conversion:\n\n   We are guaranteed that the base 10 integer n is between 1 and 300010 (inclusive).\n\n   We can use the standard method of mapping:\n\n   M, CM, D, C, XC, L, XL, X, IX, V, IV, I\n\n   But note: the Roman numeral system subtractive rules.\n\n   Let's define a list of tuples for the Roman numerals:\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400), ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40), ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                # While n is at least value, subtract value and add numeral to the result.\n                count = n // value\n                res += numeral * count\n                n -= value * count\n                if n == 0:\n                    break\n            return res\n\n   However, note: the problem says the number is at least 1 and at most 300010.\n\n   But wait: the example inputs: \n        Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> Output: \"V\"\n        Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> Output: \"IV\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input for Roman is non-zero and <= 300010.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read the first line: split into tokens.\n        tokens = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n        a_str = tokens[0]\n        b_str = tokens[1]\n\n   Then read the next line: s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n   Then:\n\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            # Convert the string s (base a) to base 10 integer n.\n            n = convert_base_a_to_int(s, int(a_str))\n            # Then convert n to Roman numeral.\n            print(convert_to_roman(n))\n\n        else:\n            # b_str is an integer string\n            b_int = int(b_str)\n            n = convert_base_a_to_int(s, int(a_str))\n            # Convert n to base b_int\n            if n == 0:\n                print(\"0\")\n            else:\n                digits = []\n                num = n\n                while num:\n                    num, r = divmod(num, b_int)\n                    digits.append(r)\n                # Now, we have the digits in reverse order.\n                s_digits = []\n                for d in digits[::-1]:\n                    if d < 10:\n                        s_digits.append(str(d))\n                    else:\n                        s_digits.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n                print(''.join(s_digits))\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is given as a string? Yes, we use int(a_str) for the base.\n\n   However, note: the input a is an integer in the range [2,25] (inclusive) or if there are two integers then both are in that range. But if the second token is 'R', then the first token is an integer.\n\n   One more thing: the base a conversion function:\n\n        def convert_base_a_to_int(s, base):\n            n = 0\n            for char in s:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                # Check if d is valid? The problem says the input is valid, so we assume d < base.\n                n = n * base + d\n            return n\n\n   But wait: what if the base is 11 and we have a digit 'A'? Then d = 10, which is valid. Similarly, if base is 10, then we cannot have a digit 'A'.\n\n   However, the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be in the range [0, base-1]. The representation uses digits from '0' to '9' and then 'A' for 10, etc. But if base is 11, then the digits go from 0 to 10, and we use '0'-'9' and 'A'. Similarly, base 16 would use 0-9 and A-F, but here base is at most 25, so we use up to 'Y'? Actually, for base 25, we need digits from 0 to 24. The letters go from 'A' to 'O' (because 10 is A, 11 is B, ... 24 is O).\n\n   However, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But note: the input string might contain digits that are not valid for the given base? The problem says the input is valid, so we don't have to check.\n\n   However, one edge case: when the input string is \"0\", then we get n=0. Then if b is not 'R', we output \"0\". But the problem says for Roman numerals the number is not zero, but for non-Roman, the input could be zero? Actually, the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", so zero is allowed. But then the condition for Roman: \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\". So if the input is zero and b is 'R', that situation is not covered (since the guarantee says it won't be 0). So we don't have to handle zero in Roman.\n\n   But note: the input for non-Roman can be zero. Then we output \"0\".\n\n   However, the example: \n        Input: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> Output: \"1111001\"\n\n   Let's test with base a=2 and the string \"1111001\": \n        n = 0\n        for each char: \n            '1': d=1 -> n = 1\n            '1': d=1 -> n = 1*2+1 = 3\n            '1': 3*2+1 = 7\n            '1': 7*2+1 = 15\n            '0': 15*2+0 = 30\n            '0': 30*2+0 = 60\n            '0': 60*2+0 = 120\n            '1': 120*2+1 = 241\n\n        Then convert 241 to base 2: \n            We do: \n                241 // 2 = 120, remainder 1\n                120 // 2 = 60, remainder 0\n                60 // 2 = 30, remainder 0\n                30 // 2 = 15, remainder 0\n                15 // 2 = 7, remainder 1\n                7 // 2 = 3, remainder 1\n                3 // 2 = 1, remainder 1\n                1 // 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\n            Then the digits in reverse: 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 -> \"1111001\", which matches.\n\n   Another example: \"5 R\\n4\"\n        Convert base 5 string \"4\" to base 10: \n            base=5, string \"4\": n = 4 (since 4 < 5, so valid)\n        Then convert 4 to Roman: \"IV\"\n\n   Example: \"16 R\\n5\"\n        base=16, string \"5\": n=5\n        Then convert 5 to Roman: \"V\"\n\n   Example: \"12 13\\nA\"\n        base=12, string \"A\": which is 10 in base 12.\n        Then convert 10 to base 13: \n            10 < 13 -> so the digit is 10, which is 'A'\n\n   But wait: how do we convert 10 from base 12 to base 13? \n        The input is base 12, so the string \"A\" represents 10 in base 12. Then we convert that 10 (base10) to base 13. Since 10 is less than 13, we write 'A'. So output \"A\".\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input for non-Roman is at most 10^1510, but our example is small.\n\n   But what if the base b is 1? The problem says a,b in [2,25] so base b>=2.\n\n   Also, note: the base conversion from base a to base 10 might be inefficient for very long strings (length 1000) but base a is at most 25, and 25^1000 is a number with about 1400 digits, which is acceptable in Python for integer arithmetic.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input string length doesn't exceed 1000, so we are doing 1000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 1? The problem says a>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Code structure:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            if not data: \n                return\n            first_line = data[0].split()\n            a_str = first_line[0]\n            b_str = first_line[1]\n            s = data[1].strip()\n\n            base_a = int(a_str)\n\n            # Define the conversion function from base a string to base10 integer\n            def convert_base_a_to_int(s, base):\n                num = 0\n                for char in s:\n                    if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                        d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                    else:\n                        d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                    if d >= base:\n                        # According to the problem, the input is valid, but still, we'll break or continue? \n                        # But the problem says valid input, so we assume d < base.\n                        # However, let's not do anything and just use d as is. But if d>=base, then it's invalid. But the problem says valid input, so skip.\n                        pass\n                    num = num * base + d\n                return num\n\n            n = convert_base_a_to_int(s, base_a)\n\n            if b_str == 'R':\n                # Convert n to Roman numeral\n                roman_numerals = [\n                    ('M', 1000), ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                    ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                    ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n                ]\n\n                def convert_to_roman(num):\n                    res = ''\n                    for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                        # Count how many times 'value' fits into num\n                        count = num // value\n                        res += numeral * count\n                        num -= value * count\n                        if num == 0:\n                            break\n                    return res\n\n                print(convert_to_roman(n))\n\n            else:\n                base_b = int(b_str)\n                # If n is 0, then output \"0\"\n                if n == 0:\n                    print(\"0\")\n                else:\n                    digits = []\n                    num_val = n\n                    while num_val:\n                        num_val, r = divmod(num_val, base_b)\n                        digits.append(r)\n\n                    # Now, we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first)\n                    # Convert each digit to the corresponding character\n                    res_str = []\n                    for d in digits[::-1]:\n                        if d < 10:\n                            res_str.append(str(d))\n                        else:\n                            res_str.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n                    print(''.join(res_str))\n\n   However, note: the example \"2 2\\n1111001\" worked, but what if we have a negative number? The problem says non-negative, so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the problem says non-negative, so we don't handle negatives.\n\n   One more edge: if the input string is empty? The problem says length doesn't exceed 1000, but minimum length is 1 (unless the number is 0, but then the string would be \"0\"). The example includes \"1\", so we are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input for Roman is non-zero and <=300010, so we don't have to worry about n=0 in the Roman branch.\n\n   But in the non-Roman branch, n can be 0, so we output \"0\".\n\n   Let me test with a small example: base 10, string \"0\", then base_b is say 10, then output \"0\".\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input string may contain leading zeros. Our conversion function will handle leading zeros correctly because:\n\n        s = \"00\"\n        base = 10\n        First digit: '0' -> 0, then n=0, then next digit: 0 -> n = 0*10+0 = 0.\n\n   Then in non-Roman: n=0 -> output \"0\".\n\n   But the problem says to omit leading zeros. Our conversion for base_b doesn't produce leading zeros because we stop when the quotient becomes zero. However, note that if the original number is zero, then we output \"0\". But if the original number is non-zero, then we don't produce leading zeros.\n\n   However, what if the base_b conversion produces a number that has leading zeros? Our algorithm does not: we build the digits from least significant to most, and we don't include leading zeros because we stop when the number becomes zero.\n\n   But wait: what if the base_b is 1? The problem says base_b>=2, so no.\n\n   One more thing: the base_b conversion: we use repeated division. This works for positive integers.\n\n   We are ready to code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input number for non-Roman is at most 10^1510, which is a very big integer. But our conversion from base a to base10 might be inefficient in terms of memory? But the base a is at most 25 and the string length is 1000, so the base10 integer has at most 1400 digits (each digit being base10). But 10^1510 has 1511 digits, but wait: our base a string is at most 1000 digits, and base a is at most 25, so the maximum value is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, so 1400 digits. This is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the non-Roman case the number is at most 10^1510. 10^1510 is 1 followed by 1510 zeros, which is a 1511-digit number. However, our base a string is 1000 digits, and base a is at most 25, so the maximum number we can represent is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510. So we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", so the base a representation is given, and we are converting it. The base a representation might represent a number that is at most 10^1510? Actually, no: the base a representation with base 25 and 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, and the problem says the non-Roman case the number is at most 10^1510, so 10^1510 is bigger than 10^1400, so our base a string might represent a number that is less than 10^1510.\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 10 and the string is a number with 1511 digits? The problem says the length doesn't exceed 1000. So the string is at most 1000 characters. Therefore, the maximum value is:\n\n        base a: 25 -> maximum number: (25^1000) - 1, which is about 10^1400.\n\n   And 10^1400 < 10^1510, so we are safe.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: ['10 2\\n1'] -> base a=10, base b=2, string \"1\"\n            n = 1\n            Convert 1 to base 2: \"1\"\n\n        Example 2: ['16 R\\n5'] -> base a=16, base b='R', string \"5\"\n            n = 5\n            Convert 5 to Roman: \"V\"\n\n        Example 3: ['5 R\\n4'] -> base a=5, base b='R', string \"4\"\n            n = 4\n            Convert 4 to Roman: \"IV\"\n\n        Example 4: ['2 2\\n1111001'] -> base a=2, base b=2, string \"1111001\"\n            n = 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^0? Wait, actually we did:\n\n            We did: \n                n = 0\n                for char in \"1111001\":\n                    n = n*2 + (digit)\n\n            This is the same as base conversion: \n                Start: 0\n                Then: 0*2+1 = 1\n                Then: 1*2+1 = 3\n                Then: 3*2+1 = 7\n                Then: 7*2+1 = 15\n                Then: 15*2+0 = 30\n                Then: 30*2+0 = 60\n                Then: 60*2+0 = 120\n                Then: 120*2+1 = 241\n\n            Then convert 241 to base2: \n                241 //2 = 120 rem 1\n                120//2 = 60 rem 0\n                60//2 = 30 rem 0\n                30//2 = 15 rem 0\n                15//2 = 7 rem 1\n                7//2 = 3 rem 1\n                3//2 = 1 rem 1\n                1//2 = 0 rem 1\n\n            Then the digits (from last to first): 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 -> \"1111001\"\n\n        Example 5: ['12 13\\nA'] -> base a=12, base b=13, string \"A\"\n            n = 10 (because 'A' is 10 in base12)\n            Convert 10 to base13: \n                10 //13 = 0, remainder 10 -> so digit is 10, which is 'A'\n\n   All examples work.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is given as a list of strings, but in the problem the input comes from stdin.\n\n   We are reading from stdin.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the example input has multiple lines, but the first line is two tokens and the second line is the string.\n\n   We are using:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   Then first_line = data[0].split(), and s = data[1].strip()\n\n   But what if there are more than two lines?

It should work.\n\n   Let me test with a small example: base a=10, base_b=16, string \"10\"\n        n = 10\n        Then convert 10 to base16: \n            digits: \n                10 //16 = 0, remainder 10 -> so digit is 'A'\n\n        Output: \"A\"\n\n   But the example input was \"12 13\\nA\", which we handled.\n\n   Another example: base a=10, base_b=16, string \"15\" -> n=15, then 15//16=0, remainder 15 -> 'F'\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input string for base a might have leading zeros. Our conversion function handles that.\n\n   However, there's a catch: the base a conversion function currently only handles digits that are either digits or uppercase letters. The problem does not specify lowercase, but the examples are uppercase.\n\n   The problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" and the example inputs are uppercase.\n\n   But what if the input has lowercase? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n   Since the problem statement uses uppercase letters in examples, we assume the input is in uppercase.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can convert the character to uppercase first?\n\n   But the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", so we assume the input is as described.\n\n   We'll leave as is.\n\n   But note: the example input",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting this base 10 number to the desired target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number is provided as a string in a specific base `a`. We first convert this string into a decimal (base 10) integer. Each character in the string is processed to determine its numerical value, considering whether it's a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z for values 10 and above). The conversion is done by iterating through each character, multiplying the accumulated value by the base, and adding the current digit's value.\n\n2. **Conversion to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the decimal number to this base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (0-9 or A-Z for values 10 and above) and combined in reverse order to form the result.\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols. This involves checking the largest possible Roman numeral values that fit into the current number and appending the corresponding symbols until the number is reduced to zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    if len(parts) < 2:\n        return\n    \n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1]\n    \n    s = data[1].strip() if len(data) >= 2 else ''\n    \n    try:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    def convert_base_a_to_int(s, base):\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            else:\n                d = 0\n            if d >= base:\n                continue\n            num = num * base + d\n        return num\n\n    n = convert_base_a_to_int(s, base_a)\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000), ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        \n        def convert_to_roman(num):\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                count = num // value\n                res += numeral * count\n                num -= value * count\n                if num == 0:\n                    break\n            return res\n        \n        print(convert_to_roman(n))\n        \n    else:\n        try:\n            base_b = int(b_str)\n        except:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num_val = n\n            while num_val:\n                num_val, r = divmod(num_val, base_b)\n                digits.append(r)\n                \n            res_str = []\n            for d in digits[::-1]:\n                if d < 10:\n                    res_str.append(str(d))\n                else:\n                    res_str.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n            print(''.join(res_str))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, with the first line containing the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which can be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `convert_base_a_to_int` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value and accumulating the total value in base 10.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For a standard base target, the decimal number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders collected. These remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (0-9 or A-Z) and combined in reverse order to form the result string.\n5. **Edge Handling**: Special cases such as zero input or invalid bases are handled gracefully, ensuring robustness and correctness.",
