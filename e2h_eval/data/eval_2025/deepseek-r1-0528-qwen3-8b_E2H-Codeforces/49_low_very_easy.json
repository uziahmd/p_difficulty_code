They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge (u, v) gives two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n Conditions for an edge (a, b):\n   Let x = number of mushrooms on lawn u, y = on lawn v.\n   Then, gcd(x,y) must be the given gcd and lcm(x,y) must be the given lcm.\n\n We know that for any two positive integers x and y:\n   gcd(x,y) * lcm(x,y) = x * y.\n\n Also, note that x and y must be multiples of gcd(x,y). So, we can write:\n   x = g * a, y = g * b, where g = gcd(x,y), and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n Then, the LCM is given by: \n   lcm(x,y) = g * a * b   [since gcd(a,b)=1, then lcm(a,b)=a*b]\n\n Therefore, from the edge (g, l): we have g * a * b = l  => a * b = l // g.\n\n But note: it's necessary that l % g == 0, otherwise the edge is invalid.\n\n However, we don't know a and b individually, but we know their product and that they are coprime.\n\n Moreover, the entire graph must be consistent. We can use the following idea:\n\n 1. Check that for every edge (u, v) with given gcd = g and lcm = l, we have l % g == 0. If not, output \"NO\".\n\n 2. For each edge, the pair (x, y) must be such that if we assign a value to node u (say, g_u) and node v (g_v),\n    then we must have that the gcd of g_u and g_v is g, and the lcm is l.\n\n But note: the entire assignment must be consistent for all edges.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let d_i be the value at node i. Then for each edge (i, j) with gcd = g and lcm = l, we require:\n   gcd(d_i, d_j) = g and lcm(d_i, d_j) = l.\n\n Important: Since the LCM must be divisible by the GCD, we already check that.\n\n How can we assign?\n\n Idea: Let us consider that for each edge, the values d_i and d_j must be multiples of g, and the ratio d_i/d_j must be such that when we take the gcd and lcm we get the given numbers.\n\n However, note that the same node might appear in multiple edges.\n\n We can set up equations:\n\n   Let d_i = g_i, then for edge (i, j): \n        gcd(g_i, g_j) = g\n        lcm(g_i, g_j) = l\n\n And we know that g_i * g_j = g * l.\n\n But wait, that equation is from the identity: gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b.\n\n However, note that this identity holds for the entire product, so for the edge (i,j): \n        g_i * g_j = g * l.\n\n But that would imply that the product of the two numbers is fixed. However, there are many pairs (g_i, g_j) that multiply to g*l and have gcd g.\n\n Actually, if we factorize g and l, we can reconstruct the prime factors for each node.\n\n But note: the problem does not require a unique solution, just one arrangement.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check for each edge (u, v): \n        if l % g != 0 -> invalid.\n\n 2. Then, note that the value of a node must be the same across all edges incident to it. So, we can set up a system:\n\n    For edge (u, v): \n        d_u * d_v = g * l   [from the identity] \n        and also, d_u and d_v must be multiples of g, and the gcd(d_u, d_v) is g.\n\n    However, the product condition alone does not uniquely determine the two numbers. But note: the entire graph must have consistent assignments.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n    We can fix one node arbitrarily (say, node 0) and then propagate the values.\n\n    However, note: the product of two adjacent nodes is fixed. But the graph might not be connected? \n\n    Actually, the problem does not specify connectivity. We have n lawns and m roads.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    a) Build an undirected graph.\n\n    b) For each connected component, we need to assign numbers.\n\n    c) In each edge, we have a constraint: d_u * d_v = g * l.\n\n    But note: the constraint is not linear. However, we can use the following:\n\n        Let A = d_u, B = d_v. Then A = g * a, B = g * b, and a and b must be copr",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values for the roads connecting them. The solution involves checking the consistency of these values across all edges and ensuring that the constraints derived from the GCD and LCM properties are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product of their GCD and LCM equals the product of the numbers themselves, i.e., \\( \\text{GCD}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b \\). This property must hold for every edge in the graph.\n2. **Graph Construction**: We construct an undirected graph where each node represents a lawn, and each edge represents a road with given GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Edge Validation**: For each edge, check if the LCM is divisible by the GCD. If not, the arrangement is impossible.\n4. **Component-wise Processing**: The graph might be disconnected, so we process each connected component separately.\n5. **Value Assignment**: For each connected component, we fix a starting node's value (using the product condition) and propagate values to adjacent nodes while ensuring the GCD and LCM conditions are met for all edges.\n6. **Consistency Check**: During propagation, if any inconsistency is found (e.g., a node receiving conflicting values), the arrangement is deemed impossible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); m = int(next(it))\n    \n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(next(it)) -

Each edge is stored with its GCD and LCM values.\n2. **Graph Construction**: An adjacency list is built where each node points to its connected neighbors along with the GCD and LCM values of the connecting edge.\n3. **Component Processing**: The graph is processed by connected components. For each unvisited node, a BFS is performed to explore all reachable nodes.\n4. **Value Assignment**: For each component, a base product (GCD * LCM) is determined. Starting from an arbitrary node, values are assigned to other nodes ensuring the product condition holds for all edges.\n5. **Validation**: During assignment, if any inconsistency is detected (e.g., a node cannot satisfy multiple edge conditions), the solution is deemed impossible.\n6. **Output**: If all components are processed successfully, the assigned values are printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed indicating no valid arrangement exists. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the feasibility of the mushroom arrangement and constructs a valid solution if possible, leveraging graph traversal and arithmetic properties of GCD and LCM.",
