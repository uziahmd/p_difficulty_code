    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000). We need to:\n 1. Find the minimum number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with n nodes that is p-reachable.\n    - Definition: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable (i.e., they form a strongly connected component).\n\n 2. Among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we want to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Observation:\n\n Let's denote by k the number of strongly connected components (SCCs) that are non-trivial (i.e., having at least two nodes) or single-node trivial SCCs? \n But note: the condition for mutual reachability is that u and v must be in the same SCC and u < v. However, in a single-node SCC, the condition u < v fails (since u=v). So only SCCs with at least two nodes can contribute.\n\n Actually, note: the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\". \n In a strongly connected component of size s, the number of such pairs (u, v) with u < v is C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2.\n\n However, note: the entire graph might have multiple SCCs. The mutual reachability condition requires that u and v are in the same SCC and u < v. Therefore, the total p is the sum over all SCCs (with size >=2) of C(s_i, 2).\n\n Also, the graph must be p-reachable. We can arrange the graph as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of these SCCs, but note: the definition of p-reachable only counts the mutual pairs within the same SCC.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are to find the minimum n (number of nodes) such that there exists a decomposition of n nodes into several SCCs (each being a maximal strongly connected subgraph) and the sum of C(s_i, 2) for each SCC (with s_i>=2) is exactly p.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to have single-node SCCs (which do not contribute to p). The entire graph must have exactly p mutual pairs (from the condition). \n\n But wait: the problem does not require that the graph is connected. We can break the graph arbitrarily.\n\n How to minimize the number of nodes?\n\n We can think of building the graph by having some complete strongly connected components (cliques) and then arrange them in a DAG so that there are no extra mutual pairs.\n\n However, note: we can also use single-node components. The goal is to represent p as the sum of combinations of integers (each integer >=2) and then the total nodes is the sum of these integers (each component's size) plus the single-node components (if any) but we don't have to use single-node components if they don't help.\n\n But note: the condition is exactly p. So we must form p as the sum of C(s_i,2) for some integers s_i (each >=2). And we want the minimal total nodes (which is the sum of the s_i's) such that the sum of C(s_i,2) is at least p? Actually, we need exactly p.\n\n However, we can choose the sizes arbitrarily (and even include single-node components, but they don't add to p). But note: the problem requires the graph to be p-reachable, meaning the total number of mutual pairs (u < v and u and v mutually reachable) is exactly p.\n\n Therefore, we must have:\n   p = sum_{i} [ C(s_i, 2) ]\n\n and we want to minimize n = sum_{i} s_i.\n\n Now, how to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number is C(s_i,2))? Note that we can use as many components as we want.\n\n We are to minimize the total nodes. Notice that using one component of size s gives T(s) = s*(s-1)//2 and uses s nodes. Alternatively, we can break a large component into smaller ones.\n\n But note: we cannot break a component arbitrarily because the graph structure must be such that the entire graph is a DAG on top of the SCCs. However, the problem does not specify the graph structure beyond the requirement of having exactly p mutual pairs (within the same SCC). \n\n Since we are free to design the graph (we just need the SCCs to have the required sizes and then connect them appropriately to form a DAG without introducing mutual pairs between different SCCs), the main constraint is that the set of SCCs must have sizes s_1, s_2,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is exactly p-reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachability**: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable. This means we need to decompose the graph into strongly connected components (SCCs) such that the sum of combinations of sizes of these SCCs (each combination being C(s_i, 2) for an SCC of size s_i) equals p.\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we should use the largest possible SCCs because larger SCCs contribute more to the sum p with fewer nodes. Specifically, for a given p, we find the smallest integer n such that the sum of C(s_i, 2) for some integers s_i (each >= 2) equals p, and the sum of s_i is minimized.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal node count is determined, we maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) where there is a path from u to v but not from v to u. This involves structuring the graph such that within each SCC, all possible edges are present, and between different SCCs, edges are directed in a way that maximizes unidirectional pairs without forming mutual reachability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    total_nodes = 0\n    remaining_p = p\n    components = []\n    \n    while remaining_p > 0:\n        s = 1\n        while True:\n            if s * (s - 1) // 2 <= remaining_p:\n                remaining_p -= s * (s - 1) // 2\n                total_nodes += s\n                components.append(s)\n                break\n            s += 1\n            \n    n = total_nodes\n    \n    # Now, compute the maximum unidirectional pairs in a graph with n nodes and exactly p mutual pairs.\n    # The total possible ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1).\n    # The mutual pairs (both directions exist) are exactly p, but note: in our decomposition, the mutual pairs are only within the SCCs.\n    # However, in the entire graph, the mutual pairs are only counted once per pair (u, v) with u < v. But for unidirectional pairs, we consider both (u, v) and (v, u) separately.\n    # In our graph, within an SCC of size s, we have all edges, so no unidirectional pairs within the same SCC. \n    # Between two different SCCs, say of sizes s_i and s_j, the edges can be directed from one to another or vice versa. To maximize unidirectional pairs, we direct all edges from one SCC to another, ensuring no mutual reachability between them.\n    # Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is the sum over all pairs of distinct SCCs (i, j) of the product of their sizes, but only in one direction (either from i to j or j to i). Since we can choose the direction, the maximum for each pair (i, j) is s_i * s_j (if we direct all edges from i to j). However, note that if we have multiple SCCs, the total number of edges between them can be arranged to maximize unidirectional pairs by directing all edges from smaller to larger components or vice versa, but the maximum is achieved when we consider all pairs of distinct SCCs and take the product of their sizes.\n\n    # But wait: the problem states that the graph must be p-reachable, meaning the mutual pairs (within SCCs) are fixed. The rest of the edges (between SCCs) should be directed to form a DAG, and to maximize unidirectional pairs, we can have all edges from one SCC to another, making all inter-component edges unidirectional (since there's no path back).\n\n    # So the total unidirectional pairs is the sum for every unordered pair (i, j) of distinct SCCs of (size_i * size_j). However, note that in a DAG, we don't necessarily connect every pair of SCCs; but to maximize unidirectional pairs, we would connect every pair with edges in one direction only. Thus, the total number of unidirectional pairs is the sum of products of sizes for all unordered pairs of distinct SCCs.\n\n    # Alternatively, note: the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). The mutual pairs are p (but note: p is defined as the number of pairs with u < v, which is exactly half of the mutual pairs if we consider both orders? Actually, no: mutual reachability implies both (u, v) and (v, u) are paths, but the problem counts only (u, v) with u < v. However, in our graph, the mutual pairs (both directions) are not counted in the unidirectional pairs. The unidirectional pairs are pairs where only one direction exists.\n\n    # Actually, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). These are partitioned into:\n    #   - Mutual pairs (both directions): but note, the mutual pairs are counted only once in p (for u < v). However, for the entire graph, the mutual pairs in terms of edges would be 2*p (each (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability corresponds to two directed edges). But wait, the problem doesn't require that both directions are edges, just that there is a path in both directions. However, in our construction, we made each SCC a complete graph (all edges present) so that within an SCC, there are indeed bidirectional edges (or paths). \n\n    # But note: the definition of unidirectional pair requires that there exists a path from u to v but not from v to u. In our complete SCC, there is a path in both directions, so no unidirectional pairs within the same SCC. Between two different SCCs, we direct all edges from one to the other, so for every pair (u in SCC i, v in SCC j), if we direct edges from i to j, then (u, v) is present and (v, u) is absent (assuming no edges back). \n\n    # Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is the sum over all ordered pairs (u, v) with u and v in different SCCs, and we direct the edges such that all such pairs are unidirectional. However, we can choose the direction for each pair of SCCs. To maximize unidirectional pairs, we direct edges from smaller SCCs to larger ones (or vice versa) but actually, the total number of unidirectional pairs is fixed once the SCC sizes are fixed: for two distinct SCCs of sizes a and b, the maximum unidirectional pairs contributed by pairs between them is a*b (by directing all edges from one to the other). \n\n    # Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is the sum_{i < j} (s_i * s_j). \n\n    # We can compute this as:\n    #   (sum_{i} s_i)^2 - sum_{i} s_i^2) // 2\n    # Because (sum s_i)^2 = sum s_i^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j.\n\n    # So, let S = total_nodes = sum(components). Then:\n    #   sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j = (S^2 - sum(s_i^2)) // 2\n\n    S = n\n    sum_sq = 0\n    for comp in components:\n        sum_sq += comp * comp\n        \n    total_unidirectional = (S*S - sum_sq) // 2\n\n    print(f\"{n} {total_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is a single integer p, which represents the number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v that must be mutually reachable.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the solution is 0 nodes and 0 unidirectional pairs since no nodes are needed.\n3. **Finding Minimal Nodes**: The algorithm decomposes p into a sum of triangular numbers (C(s_i, 2)) where each s_i is the size of an SCC. The goal is to minimize the total number of nodes (sum of s_i) while achieving exactly p mutual pairs.\n4. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: For the minimal node count, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is computed by considering all ordered pairs of nodes from different SCCs, directed such that only one path exists between them. This is calculated using the formula derived from the sum of products of SCC sizes.\n5. **Output**: The solution outputs the minimal number of nodes and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs for that node count. \n\nThis approach efficiently addresses the problem by leveraging mathematical insights to decompose p into SCC sizes and then computing the desired unidirectional pairs based on these sizes.",
