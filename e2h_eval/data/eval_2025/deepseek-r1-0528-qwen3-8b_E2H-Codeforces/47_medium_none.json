    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find a non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized, and if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n Let d = (a+k) and e = (b+k). Then note that d - e = a - b (constant). Without loss of generality, assume a >= b. Then we can let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then note that g must divide (a-b). Also, we have:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / g\n\n But note: (a+k) = (b+k) + (a-b). So the difference between the two numbers is fixed (a-b). However, we can also consider symmetry: if a < b, then we can swap the roles.\n\n Alternatively, we can set d = |a-b| (the absolute difference) and consider divisors of d? \n\n However, note that k is non-negative, so the two numbers become a+k and b+k. The difference is fixed: |a+k - (b+k)| = |a-b|.\n\n Let d0 = |a-b|. Then for a given divisor g of d0, we can set:\n   Let x = a+k, y = b+k, then we require that g divides both x and y, so g divides x-y = d0.\n\n But note: the condition is stronger because x and y must be divisible by g. And also note that k must be chosen so that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). Since (a+k) mod g = 0 and (b+k) mod g = 0, then (a-b) mod g = 0, which is true because g divides d0.\n\n However, we cannot arbitrarily assign g. We can consider that the condition is equivalent to k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. But since a ≡ b mod g (because g divides a-b), then the system has a solution.\n\n Actually, we can think: we want to choose k such that (a+k) and (b+k) have a common divisor g (which must divide d0). Moreover, the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k) / g. But note that the product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing with k? Not necessarily, because as k increases the numbers increase, but the LCM might sometimes decrease due to factors? However, note that the LCM is at least max(a+k, b+k) and we are increasing both numbers, so the LCM generally increases with k, except that when k is chosen appropriately we can get a common factor and then the product divided by that factor might be smaller.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let d = a-b. Without loss of generality, assume a>=b. Then d>=0. Then we have:\n   a+k = b+k + d\n\n Then, the gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(b+k+d, b+k) = gcd(d, b+k). \n\n Therefore, the gcd is a divisor of d. So we can iterate over the divisors of d (if d>0). If d==0, then a==b, then we have two same numbers, and LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k, which is minimized at k=0.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: a == b -> then answer k=0.\n\n Case 2: a != b. Without loss of generality, we can let d = abs(a-b). Then, we know that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) is a divisor of d. Therefore, the candidate k's are the ones such that (b+k) is divisible by some divisor g of d. But note: k must be chosen so that (b+k) mod g == 0, i.e., k ≡ (-b) mod g. The smallest non-negative k for a divisor g is k0 = (g - b % g) % g.\n\n However, note: we can also consider negative k? No, k>=0.\n\n But wait: the problem says non-negative k, so k>=0.\n\n However, note: we are iterating over divisors of d. But note: d = |a-b|, and the divisors are positive. We can consider all divisors g of d (positive) and then for each divisor g, compute the smallest k such that g divides (b+k) (and hence also (a+k)). \n\n But note: the same k might be obtained from multiple divisors? We need to collect candidate k's and then evaluate the LCM at these k's.\n\n However, note: the LCM is determined by the gcd and the product. Specifically, for a candidate k, let:\n   x = a+k, y = b+k, then LCM(x,y) = x*y // gcd(x,y)\n\n But note: we can also consider that the gcd is g, and we have x = g * x1, y = g * y1, and gcd(x1,y1)=1. Then LCM(x,y) = g*x1*y1 = (x*y)//g.\n\n But note: we don't know g exactly, we only know that g divides d. Actually, the gcd is exactly g0 = gcd(d, b+k). But note: we are free to choose k such that g divides (b+k). However, the actual gcd might be any multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd is the greatest common divisor, which must be a divisor of d, but when we fix g as a divisor of d, then the condition is that (b+k) is divisible by g, but the gcd might be larger than g? \n\n Let me clarify: \n   Let g0 = gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(d, b+k). Then g0 divides d, and also g0 divides (b+k). Now, if we choose k such that g divides (b+k) (where g is a divisor of d), then the gcd g0 might be a divisor of d that is at least g? Actually, no: the gcd is determined by the common divisors. But note: if we choose k so that (b+k) is divisible by g, then the gcd will be at least g? Not necessarily: the gcd must divide d, but it might be any divisor of d that divides both (a+k) and (b+k). However, note that (a+k) = (b+k)+d, so the gcd is gcd(d, b+k). \n\n So for a given divisor g of d, the condition is that g divides (b+k). Then the gcd will be a divisor of d that is at least g? Actually, the gcd is the greatest common divisor, so it could be any divisor of d that divides (b+k). But note: we are not forcing the gcd to be exactly g. \n\n However, we can use the following: for each divisor g of d, we can set k0 = (g - (b % g)) % g (which is the smallest non-negative k such that (b+k) is divisible by g). Then, for this k0, we have:\n   gcd(a+k0, b+k0) = gcd(d, b+k0) \n\n But note: since g divides (b+k0) and d, then the gcd is at least g. But it might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd is the greatest common divisor, so it is the gcd of d and (b+k0). Since g divides d and (b+k0), then the gcd must be a multiple of g? Actually, yes: the gcd must be a multiple of g because g divides both. But wait, the gcd is defined as the greatest common divisor, and we know that g divides the gcd? Then the gcd is a multiple of g? \n\n However, note: the gcd is a divisor of d, and also divides (b+k0). Since g is a divisor of d and (b+k0), then the gcd must be the gcd of d and (b+k0). But note: d is fixed and (b+k0) is fixed. \n\n But here is an important point: we are going to consider every divisor g of d. Then the candidate k0 for divisor g is the smallest k (non-negative) such that g divides (b+k0). Then the gcd at k0 is gcd(d, b+k0). \n\n However, note: we are not required to consider only divisors g of d, but note that the gcd must divide d. So the candidate k's are exactly the solutions to k ≡ (-b) mod g for every divisor g of d. \n\n But note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors? Then we don't want to duplicate. \n\n However, we can do: \n   For each divisor g of d, compute candidate_k = (g - b % g) % g, then for that candidate_k, compute the LCM of (a+candidate_k) and (b+candidate_k). Then take the candidate_k that minimizes the LCM, and if multiple then choose the smallest candidate_k.\n\n But note: the LCM for a candidate_k is (a+k)*(b+k) // gcd(a+k, b+k). And the gcd is gcd(d, b+k) (because gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(d, b+k)).\n\n However, is that always true? \n   Yes, because a+k = (b+k) + (a-b) [if a>=b] or (b+k) + (b-a) [if b>=a]. In general, let d = a-b, then gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(b+k+d, b+k) = gcd(d, b+k).\n\n Therefore, we can compute for each divisor g of d, the candidate k0 = (g - b % g) % g, then the gcd at k0 is gcd(d, b+k0). But note: we don't know the gcd without computing it. However, note that since g divides (b+k0) and d, then the gcd must be at least g. But actually, the gcd is the gcd(d, b+k0). \n\n But we can compute the gcd from d and (b+k0) easily.\n\n However, note: we are iterating over divisors of d, so the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), and d can be up to 10^9, which is acceptable (about 1000 divisors worst-case).\n\n But wait: what if d is very large? The number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), and sqrt(10^9) is about 31622, so worst-case 10^9 might have around 1344 divisors (like 931170240 has 1344 divisors). This is acceptable in Python if we do it carefully.\n\n However, note: we must consider the case when a == b separately.\n\n Steps:\n\n   if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   Let d = abs(a-b)\n\n   Find all divisors of d.\n\n   Then, for each divisor g (positive) of d:\n        k0 = (g - b % g) % g   [This gives the smallest k>=0 such that (b+k) % g == 0]\n\n        Then, we have two numbers: \n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n\n        But note: we can also consider negative divisors? No, divisors are positive.\n\n        However, note: the gcd is gcd(d, y) = gcd(d, b+k0). We can compute that.\n\n        Then, LCM = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)   [But note: we have gcd(x,y)=gcd(d, y)]\n\n        We store (LCM, k0) and then we want to minimize LCM, and then choose the smallest k0 in case of tie.\n\n   But wait: is it possible that for two different divisors g1 and g2, we get the same k0? Then we would compute the same LCM twice. But that's okay because we can use a set of k0's? However, note: we are iterating over divisors and each divisor gives one candidate k0. But the same k0 might come from multiple divisors. Then we are duplicating work. We can avoid that by storing the k0's we've seen and skip duplicates? Or we can just compute the LCM for each candidate k0 and then at the end we choose the best.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if there is a k that is not generated by any divisor? Remember: the gcd must divide d, so the condition for k is that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) is a divisor of d. But note: the gcd is the greatest common divisor, and it must divide d. However, the candidate k0 we are generating for each divisor g is the smallest k such that (b+k) is divisible by g. But note: the actual gcd might be a divisor of d that is greater than g? Then we would miss that k0? \n\n   Let me think: consider d=12, and let g=3, then k0 = (3 - b%3) % 3. Then the gcd at that k0 is gcd(12, b+k0). This gcd might be 12, 6, 4, etc., but note that 3 divides 12, so the gcd is at least 3. But what if the gcd is 6? Then we would have generated the same k0 from the divisor 6 as well? Because for divisor 6, we require (b+k0) divisible by 6. But note: we have (b+k0) divisible by 3, but not necessarily by 6. So if (b+k0) is divisible by 3 but not by 6, then the divisor 6 would generate a different k0 (unless the residue modulo 6 is the same as modulo 3, but note: the condition for divisor 6 requires the residue modulo 6). \n\n   Actually, the candidate k0 for divisor g is the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (b+k). Then the gcd at that k0 is the gcd of d and (b+k0). This gcd might be any divisor of d that is a multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd is the gcd of d and (b+k0). It is not necessarily a multiple of g, but note: g divides d and g divides (b+k0), so the gcd must be at least g? Actually, no: the gcd is the greatest common divisor, and it must be a divisor of d, and it must divide (b+k0). But g divides d and (b+k0), so the gcd must be a multiple of g? \n\n   Let me clarify: the gcd of d and (b+k0) must be divisible by g? Yes, because g divides d and g divides (b+k0), so g divides the gcd(d, b+k0). Therefore, the gcd is a multiple of g. But wait, that's not how gcd works. Actually, the gcd is the product of the common prime factors with the minimum exponent. But if g divides both d and (b+k0), then g divides the gcd. So yes, the gcd is a multiple of g. \n\n   However, note: we are iterating over all divisors g of d, so the candidate k0 for each divisor g will yield a gcd that is a multiple of g. But then, the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors (all divisors that divide the gcd). \n\n   Example: d=12, b=5, and consider g=3 and g=6. \n        For g=3: k0 = (3 - 5%3) % 3 = (3-2)%3 = 1.\n        Then at k0=1, the numbers are (a+1, b+1) = (a+1, 6). The gcd is gcd(12,6)=6. \n        Now, for g=6: k0 = (6 - 5%6) % 6 = (6-5)%6 = 1. Same k0.\n\n   So we are going to compute the same k0 twice. To avoid duplication, we can record the k0's we have already considered.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the set of candidate k0's is the set of residues modulo the divisors? Actually, the candidate k0's are the numbers that are congruent to (-b) modulo g for every divisor g of d. But note: the set of divisors is the divisors of d, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem does not necessarily apply because the divisors are not coprime.\n\n   However, we can simply collect the candidate k0's from each divisor, and then remove duplicates, and then also consider k0=0? Actually, k0=0 is included when g divides b (then k0=0) or when g divides (b mod g) in a way that k0=0.\n\n   But note: we must also consider k0 that are generated from divisors, and we must not forget k0=0 if d==0, but we handled d==0 separately.\n\n   However, there is another issue: the above candidate k0 generation only considers divisors of d. But note: the gcd must divide d, so the condition on k is that the gcd divides d. Therefore, the set of candidate k's is exactly the set { k0 } for every divisor g of d. \n\n   But wait: what if the gcd is 1? Then we must consider k0 = (1 - b % 1) % 1. But note: modulo 1, the remainder is 0, so k0 = 0. So k0=0 is included.\n\n   However, we must also consider: what if k0 is negative? Our formula (g - b % g) % g ensures k0 is non-negative.\n\n   But note: the problem says non-negative k, so k>=0.\n\n   However, there's a catch: what if the divisor g is greater than d? Actually, divisors are factors of d, so they are <= d.\n\n   Another catch: what if d=0? We handled a==b.\n\n   But wait: what if we consider negative divisors? The divisors are positive by definition.\n\n   However, note: the divisors of d are positive. So we are good.\n\n   But there's a more fundamental issue: the above reasoning is for the case when a>=b (then d=a-b) or when a<b (then d=b-a). The formula for gcd still holds because gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(|a-b|, b+k). \n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        if d == 0:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        divisors = all positive divisors of d.\n\n        candidate_k = set()\n        best_lcm = None\n        best_k = None\n\n        for g in divisors:\n            # Compute k0: smallest k>=0 such that (b+k) % g == 0.\n            # Note: if b % g == 0, then k0=0, else k0 = g - (b % g)\n            k0 = (g - (b % g)) % g\n            candidate_k.add(k0)\n\n        # But wait: is that all? Actually, note that the gcd condition is that the gcd must divide d, but the candidate k0 we generated are the minimal k for each divisor. However, we must also consider that for a divisor g, there might be k that is larger than the minimal one but still yields a gcd that is a multiple of g? \n\n        # However, note: we are trying to minimize the LCM. The LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)//gcd(a+k,b+k). As k increases, the product (a+k)*(b+k) increases. However, the gcd might change and become larger, which reduces the LCM. \n\n        # But note: the minimal k for divisor g is the first k where (b+k) becomes divisible by g. However, there might be a k that is larger than k0 (from divisor g) but from divisor h (another divisor) that gives a smaller LCM. \n\n        # However, we are iterating over all divisors. But note: the candidate k0 for divisor g is the minimal k that satisfies the condition for g. But the condition for the gcd being a multiple of g is satisfied at k0, and the LCM at k0 is (a+k0)*(b+k0)//gcd_value. \n\n        # Why is it safe to only consider the minimal k for each divisor? \n\n        # Consider: for divisor g, the condition is that (b+k) is divisible by g. The next k that satisfies the condition is k0 + g, then k0+2g, etc. The LCM at k0+i*g is (a+k0+i*g)*(b+k0+i*g)//gcd_value'. But note: the gcd_value' might be larger than g (if we are lucky) and the product is increasing. \n\n        # However, we cannot guarantee that the minimal k (k0) for divisor g gives the minimal LCM for that particular divisor condition. But note: the LCM is the product divided by the gcd. The gcd is increasing as we take larger multiples (because the gcd must be at least g, and might be more). However, the product is increasing. \n\n        # But note: sometimes, even though the product is increasing, the gcd might jump to a much larger divisor and reduce the LCM. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we will eventually consider the larger divisors. \n\n        # However, note: the condition for a divisor g is independent. But we must consider: what if the minimal k for divisor g gives a gcd that is a multiple of g, but then a larger k (for the same divisor g) might give a larger gcd? Then we would have already considered the candidate k0 from the divisor that is the actual gcd (which is the multiple). \n\n        # Example: d=12, b=5, and divisor g=3. k0=1, then gcd(12,6)=6. Then the candidate k0=1 was already generated by divisor g=6 (because for divisor 6, k0 = (6-5%6)%6 = (6-5)%6=1). \n\n        # Therefore, we are effectively covering all divisors. But note: we are generating the same k0 for divisors that are divisors of the same modulus? \n\n        # However, the set of divisors we are iterating over is the divisors of d. The gcd at k0 is a divisor of d, and we are generating k0 for every divisor. But note: the candidate k0 for divisor g is the same as the candidate k0 for divisor h if and only if g and h are divisors of d and the residue of b modulo g and modulo h are such that the minimal k is the same. \n\n        # But the key point is: we are collecting candidate k0's from every divisor, and then we will compute the LCM for each distinct candidate k0. \n\n        # However, note: there might be other k values that are not generated by any divisor? \n\n        # Actually, the condition for k is that the gcd(a+k, b+k) divides d. Therefore, the gcd must be one of the divisors of d. Then, the condition is that (b+k) must be divisible by that divisor. But note: the minimal k for a divisor g is the one we computed. However, if we don't consider a divisor g, then we don't consider k0 for that g. But we are considering all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        # But note: we must consider k0 from all divisors. Then we are done.\n\n        # However, there is one more thing: what if k0 is negative? Our formula (g - b%g) % g ensures non-negativity.\n\n        # Now, we must also consider k0=0? Our method includes k0=0 because when g divides b, then k0=0.\n\n        # But wait: what if d=0? We handled that.\n\n        # Now, we have a set candidate_k. Then we must compute for each candidate k (each distinct candidate k) the LCM and then choose the best.\n\n        # However, note: the set candidate_k might be large (at most the number of divisors, which is about O(sqrt(d))). Then we can iterate over the distinct candidate k's.\n\n        # But wait: is there an upper bound on k? The problem says k>=0, but k0 from divisors g of d: the maximum k0 is at most d (because modulo g, so k0 < g <= d). However, note: d can be up to 10^9, and the divisors g are factors of d, so the maximum k0 is the maximum divisor minus something? Actually, no: k0 = (g - b%g) % g, so k0 is in [0, g-1]. And g is at most d, so k0 can be up to d-1. But d is 10^9, so we cannot iterate from 0 to d. \n\n        # But we are only iterating over the divisors, and then the candidate k0's are distinct and bounded by the divisors (so at most about 1344 distinct k0's). \n\n        # However, there is a catch: the above candidate k0's are for divisors of d. But note: the problem asks for the minimal LCM and then the smallest k. \n\n        # But wait: is it possible that a k not in candidate_k (i.e., not generated by any divisor) gives a lower LCM? \n\n        # Let me think: the gcd must divide d. So for any k, let g0 = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then g0 divides d. Then, the condition for k is that (b+k) must be divisible by g0. Then, the minimal k for divisor g0 is k0 = (g0 - b%g0)%g0. But note: we are iterating over all divisors g (including g0). So we would have generated k0 for divisor g0. Therefore, we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        # Therefore, we can do:\n\n        #   candidates = set()\n        #   for each divisor g of d:\n        #       k0 = (g - b%g) % g\n        #       candidates.add(k0)\n\n        #   Then, we must also consider that k0 might be 0, and we have to check k0 from the divisors.\n\n        # However, wait: what if we consider the divisor g0 (the actual gcd) and we get k0, then we are computing the LCM at that k0. But note: the LCM at k0 is (a+k0)*(b+k0)//g0, and g0 is the gcd. \n\n        # But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, but that's okay because we use a set.\n\n        # Now, we must compute the LCM for each candidate k0 and choose the best.\n\n        # However, note: the LCM might be very large (since a and b can be up to 10^9, and k0 is up to 10^9, so the numbers a+k0 and b+k0 can be up to 2e9, and their product is 4e18, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we care about performance and memory? \n\n        # But note: the problem constraints say a,b up to 10^9, and k0 is at most d (which is <= 10^9). Then a+k0 and b+k0 are at most 2e9, and the product is 4e18, which is acceptable in Python (integers in Python can handle that, but we must be cautious for speed).\n\n        # However, we are iterating over about 1344 divisors, so we do 1344 computations of LCM. Each LCM computation is two numbers (each up to 2e9) multiplied and then divided by the gcd (which is at most d, so 10^9).

But we don't know the exact value, so we compute it.\n\n        #   However, we can compute the gcd by Euclidean algorithm for numbers up to 10^9, which is efficient (O(log n)).\n\n        #   But we are doing this for up to 1344 candidates, so 1344 * log(10^9) is acceptable.\n\n        # However, note: we must consider that d is fixed (abs(a-b)), so we can compute gcd(d, b+k) for each candidate k.\n\n        # But note: d is fixed, and k is in candidate_k (which are the minimal k for divisors). \n\n        # There's one more catch: what if the candidate k is very large?

Then b+k can be up to 10^9 + 10^9 = 2e9, which is acceptable for math.gcd.\n\n        # But note: the Euclidean algorithm for numbers up to 2e9 is about 60 iterations (log2(2e9) is about 31, but the Euclidean algorithm uses modulus and the number of steps is logarithmic).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is constant (\\( |a - b| \\)). The LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can be expressed as \\( \\frac{x \\times y}{\\text{gcd}(x, y)} \\). To minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), while keeping the product \\( x \\times y \\) as small as possible.\n\n2. **Insight**: The gcd of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of the absolute difference \\( d = |a - b| \\). Therefore, for each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we can compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( k = (g - (b \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( a + k \\) is minimized when \\( k = 0 \\).\n   - Otherwise, compute all divisors of \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the corresponding \\( k \\) value.\n   - For each computed \\( k \\), calculate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - Track the \\( k \\) that yields the smallest LCM. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of divisors of \\( d \\) is \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\). For \\( d \\) up to \\( 10^9 \\), this results in approximately 1344 divisors in the worst case. For each divisor, we perform constant-time operations (modulo, gcd, and LCM calculations), making the overall complexity manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd as math_gcd\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n        i += 1\n    return divisors\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    candidate_k = set()\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = b % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n        candidate_k.add(k0)\n        \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for k in candidate_k:\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        g_val = math_gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n        \n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is immediately \\( 0 \\) because the LCM of two identical numbers is minimized at \\( k = 0 \\).\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: For \\( d = |a - b| \\), compute all its divisors. These divisors help in determining potential values of \\( k \\) that could maximize the gcd of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n4. **Candidate \\( k \\) Generation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). This \\( k \\) is derived using modulo arithmetic.\n5. **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Track the \\( k \\) that yields the smallest LCM.\n6. **Output**: Print the smallest \\( k \\) that minimizes the LCM. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same minimal LCM, the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the candidates for \\( k \\) by leveraging the divisors of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
