    "thought": "\n We are to remove exactly one element from the array and minimize the instability (max-min) of the resulting array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` with `n` elements. After removing one element, the instability is the max of the remaining array minus the min of the remaining array.\n\n Note: The entire array's min and max might change if we remove an occurrence that is the minimum or maximum.\n\n Let M1 = min(a), M2 = max(a). Then the instability of the entire array is M2 - M1.\n\n However, when we remove one element, there are three possibilities:\n  1. Remove an element that is not the minimum and not the maximum.\n  2. Remove one of the minimums.\n  3. Remove one of the maximums.\n\n But note: There might be multiple minimums and maximums.\n\n How can we approach?\n We can consider the following:\n\n Option 1: Removing an element that is the minimum. Then the new minimum becomes the next smallest number (if there are duplicates, then the minimum might still be present, but if we remove all the minimums? Actually, we remove one element so the minimum might drop only if we remove the last occurrence of the minimum? Actually, no: if there are multiple minima, then even if we remove one, the minimum remains the same.\n\n Actually, let's break it down:\n\n Case 1: Removing an element that is the minimum value (but there are at least two minima, so after removal the minimum is still the same as before).\n Case 2: Removing the last (and only) occurrence of the minimum, then the minimum increases to the next smallest number.\n\n Similarly for the maximum.\n\n Therefore, the instability after removal can be:\n\n Option A: Remove an element that is the minimum and there is more than one minimum -> then the min remains M1, and the max remains M2, so instability remains M2 - M1? \n   Actually, no: because if we remove a minimum that is duplicated, then the array still has M1, so the min is still M1, and the max is still M2. So the instability is unchanged.\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is the maximum and there are multiple maxima? Then the max remains M2 and the min remains M1, so the instability is unchanged.\n\n However, we are allowed to remove only one element. So we have to consider:\n\n Possibilities:\n  - Remove an element that is the minimum: then the new min becomes the next smallest number (which is the next distinct minimum) if there was only one occurrence of the minimum, otherwise the min remains M1.\n  - Similarly, remove an element that is the maximum: then the new max becomes the next largest number if there was only one occurrence of the maximum, otherwise the max remains M2.\n\n But note: we can also remove an element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum. Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains M2-M1.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum between:\n  1. The instability when we remove one occurrence of the minimum (if there is only one minimum, then the new min is the next smallest; if there are multiple, then the min remains M1, and we are effectively comparing two cases)\n  2. The instability when we remove one occurrence of the maximum (if there is only one maximum, then the new max is the next largest; if there are multiple, then the max remains M2)\n\n However, note: we can also remove an element in the middle, but that doesn't help because the min and max are still M1 and M2. So the minimal instability must be at most the original instability (M2-M1) and possibly lower.\n\n Actually, the minimal instability will be the minimum of:\n  - (M2 - (the next smallest number)) [if we remove the minimum and there's only one minimum, then the next smallest is the second smallest]\n  - ((the next largest number) - M1) [if we remove the maximum and there's only one maximum, then the next largest is the second largest]\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the minimum or maximum? Then the instability is M2-M1, which is the original. But sometimes we might get a lower instability by removing an interior element? \n\n Actually, no: if we remove an interior element, the min and max remain the same. So the instability doesn't change.\n\n Therefore, we have two main candidates for reduction:\n\n Candidate 1: Removing the minimum (if there is only one minimum, then the instability becomes M2 - next_min; if there are multiple, then the instability remains M2 - M1, but note: we might also consider removing the maximum independently).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. We don't have to remove a min or max. But if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially reduce the instability if the removed element is either the current minimum or maximum of the array. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum or maximum, removing one occurrence does not change the min or max values, so the instability remains the same. However, if there's only one occurrence of the minimum or maximum, removing it will adjust the min or max value, respectively, leading to a possible reduction in instability.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal instability after removal can be derived by considering three scenarios:\n   - Removing the only occurrence of the minimum element.\n   - Removing the only occurrence of the maximum element.\n   - Removing any other element (which leaves the min and max unchanged).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - First, find the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values in the array.\n   - Determine the next smallest value (`next_min`) if the minimum occurs only once, and the next largest value (`next_max`) if the maximum occurs only once.\n   - The minimal instability will be the smallest among:\n     - The instability after removing the minimum (if it's unique): `max_val - next_min`.\n     - The instability after removing the maximum (if it's unique): `next_max - min_val`.\n     - The original instability (if no unique min or max is found): `max_val - min_val`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves a linear scan of the array to find the min, max, and their next values, resulting in an O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    min_val = min(a)\n    max_val = max(a)\n    \n    if min_val == max_val:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    next_min = float('inf')\n    next_max = float('-inf')\n    min_count = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    \n    for num in a:\n        if num == min_val:\n            min_count += 1\n        if num == max_val:\n            max_count += 1\n        if num > min_val and num < next_min:\n            next_min = num\n        if num < max_val and num > next_max:\n            next_max = num\n            \n    candidate1 = float('inf')\n    candidate2 = float('inf')\n    \n    if min_count == 1:\n        candidate1 = max_val - next_min\n    else:\n        candidate1 = 0\n        \n    if max_count == 1:\n        candidate2 = next_max - min_val\n    else:\n        candidate2 = 0\n        \n    ans = min(candidate1, candidate2, max_val - min_val)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the array has only one element, the instability is trivially zero. If all elements are the same, the instability remains zero after any removal.\n3. **Finding Min and Max**: The minimum and maximum values in the array are identified.\n4. **Counting Occurrences**: The code counts how many times the minimum and maximum values appear in the array. It also finds the next smallest and largest values if the min or max is unique.\n5. **Calculating Candidates**: The potential instability values after removing the unique min or max (if they exist) are computed. If these values are not unique, the instability remains the same as the original.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The minimal instability is determined by comparing the original instability with the computed candidates from removing unique min or max values.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking a few critical scenarios, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
