Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The block containing a point can be described by the side of each line (either positive or negative). \n\n However, note that we are allowed to cross a road only at a common border (which is the entire line? but actually the problem says: move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero. Since the roads are infinite lines, the common border between two adjacent blocks is exactly a segment of one of the roads? Actually, no: two blocks are adjacent if they share a common segment (so the entire road is the border between two opposite sides). But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that if two blocks share an entire road (so the common border is the entire road, which has infinite length) then they are adjacent. However, note that two blocks might share only a part of a road? Actually, the roads are infinite, so the common border between two blocks is either the entire road (if they are on opposite sides) or nothing (if they are on the same side). \n\n But wait: the problem also states: \"if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step\". So actually, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common road segment (i.e., they lie on opposite sides of that road). Therefore, crossing one road moves you from one block to an adjacent one.\n\n However, note: the entire set of roads divides the plane. Each block is defined by a set of inequalities (each road gives two possibilities). The entire plane is divided by n lines, and the number of blocks is at most 2^n (but could be less because some lines might be redundant? Actually, the problem does not assume general position, but the input condition says no two roads are the same, but they might be parallel).\n\n The main idea: \n We can model the problem as a graph where each node is a block (a region defined by the signs of all the linear equations). Two nodes (blocks) are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road (so they are separated by one line). Then the problem reduces to: we start at home (which is in a particular block) and end at university (another block). We wish to find the minimum number of steps (edges) to go from the start block to the target block.\n\n However, note: we cannot have more than 2^n blocks, and n <= 300, so 2^300 is too many to enumerate.\n\n Alternate insight:\n\n Each road (line) is defined by aix + biy + ci = 0. For a given point (x, y), we can compute the sign of the expression: a*x + b*y + c. Let's define for each road i, a function f_i(x, y) = a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i. Then the home and the university have fixed sign patterns for all the roads.\n\n Now, note: when moving from home to university, we must cross a road if and only if the sign pattern of the home and the university differs in the corresponding road. Moreover, we can only cross one road at a time (each step crosses one road). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which the sign of the function at home and at university differ.\n\n But wait: is that really the case? Consider: if two roads are crossed, then the path must cross both. However, note that the regions are divided by multiple roads. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads to cross to get from the home block to the university block.\n\n However, observe: when we cross a road, we flip the sign for that road. Therefore, the minimal number of roads to cross is the number of roads for which the two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides. But note: if two points are in the same block, then they are on the same side of every road. If they are in two different blocks, then there is a minimal set of roads that separate them. And that set is exactly the set of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, here's a catch: what if two roads are such that crossing one road and then the other might allow a shortcut? Actually, no: because each road is independent and the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. But wait: sometimes a single road might not be crossed independently? \n\n Let me explain with the example: \n Example 1:\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1),",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university in Crazy Town. The roads in Crazy Town are infinite lines that divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). Each step involves crossing a road (line) if the blocks share a common border of nonzero length. The key insight is that the minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to checking for each road whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the road. A point lies on one side of a line if the value of the line equation (a*x + b*y + c) at the point is positive, and on the other side if it is negative. If both points are on the same side, crossing that road is not necessary.\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate the two blocks. Each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, increment the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road once, performing constant-time operations for each. With n roads (n ≤ 300), the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    steps = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        side1 = 1 if val1 > 0 else (-1 if val1 < 0 else 0)\n        side2 = 1 if val2 > 0 else (-1 if val2 < 0 else 0)\n        \n        if side1 != side2:\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the line equation (a*x + b*y + c) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Determining Sides**: The sign of the evaluated expression determines which side of the line each point lies. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points, and a step is counted.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of separating roads is printed, which is the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging the geometric properties of lines to determine the minimal path without explicitly modeling all blocks, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
