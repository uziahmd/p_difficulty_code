The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. The president wants to remove k districts (so we keep n-k districts) such that the remaining graph is connected (i.e., forms a connected tree) and the total fan count (which is 2^district_number) is maximized.\n\n Observation:\n Since the graph is a tree, the remaining set of districts must form a connected subgraph. In a tree, a connected subgraph is just a subtree (or a set of nodes that includes all the edges between them). However, note that we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily, but the condition is that the remaining nodes form a connected component.\n\n How to maximize the total fans?\n The fan count for district i is 2^i. Since 2^i grows exponentially, we would prefer to keep districts with higher numbers (because 2^6 > 2^5 > ...). But note: we cannot arbitrarily choose the highest n-k districts because the connectivity condition must hold.\n\n However, note that the districts are labeled from 1 to n, but the edges do not necessarily connect in increasing order. The problem states that the nation has n districts and each district has exactly one path to every other, so it's a tree.\n\n Important: The president removes k districts, so we keep n-k districts. The remaining districts must form a connected component.\n\n We can think of the problem as: which n-k districts to keep so that they are connected and the sum of 2^i is as large as possible.\n\n Since 2^i is exponential, the best way to maximize the sum is to keep the largest (in terms of district number) districts possible, but we must ensure that the kept districts form a connected component.\n\n However, note: the connectivity condition in a tree is that the kept nodes must include a set of nodes that forms a connected subtree. In trees, a connected subgraph is defined by a set of nodes that are connected via the original edges.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's consider: we want to keep the largest (highest numbered) districts. But if we keep a district, we must keep all the districts that lie on the simple path between any two kept districts? Actually, no. We only require that the entire kept set is connected. The minimal connected set containing a set of nodes in a tree is the union of all the simple paths between every pair of nodes. However, we don't have to keep the entire minimal connected set if we are allowed to remove some? But note: we are removing k districts, so we are keeping n-k. We must choose a connected set of n-k nodes.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire set of kept nodes is the entire connected component (there might be more nodes in the connected component than kept? Actually, no: we are only keeping the chosen n-k nodes, and the condition is that these n-k nodes form a connected component. In a tree, a set S of nodes forms a connected component if and only if the induced subgraph is connected. However, when we remove k nodes, the remaining graph may break into several components, and we require that the kept nodes form exactly one connected component.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Step 1: Realize that the problem is equivalent to: remove k districts (so keep n-k) such that the kept set is connected and the sum of 2^i for kept districts is maximized.\n\n Since the fan counts are powers of two, we want to keep the highest numbered districts (because 2^i is larger for larger i). Therefore, we want to keep the n-k districts with the highest numbers, but we must check if they form a connected component.\n\n However, the kept set must be connected. So we cannot simply take the n-k largest districts arbitrarily.\n\n Another idea: the connected component in a tree is determined by a set of nodes. We can think of the problem as: we wish to choose a connected subtree (with n-k nodes) that contains the largest possible set of high-numbered districts.\n\n But note: the entire set of kept districts must be connected. The largest n-k districts (by district number) might not be connected. So we need to find the smallest connected set that covers at least the top n-k districts? Actually, we want to maximize the sum, so we want to include as many high-value districts as possible.\n\n However, note: if we take the largest n-k districts, and they are not connected, then we must include some additional districts to connect them? But wait: we are only keeping n-k districts. If we take a connected set of n-k nodes, we cannot exceed that.\n\n So the problem becomes: select a connected set S of n-k nodes (from the tree) such that the sum_{i in S} 2^i is maximized.\n\n Since the exponential weights are very large for high i, we want to include as many high i as possible. Therefore, the optimal set will be a connected set that contains the largest n-k districts (if they form a connected set) or if not, then we have to drop some of the lower ones and include some necessary ones to connect the high ones.\n\n But note: we are forced to remove exactly k = n - |S|, so |S| = n-k.\n\n How to choose the connected set? \n\n Observation: In a tree, the connected set of n-k nodes must contain a set of edges that form a spanning tree for those n-k nodes. Moreover, the entire set is connected if and only if the set of nodes is contained in one connected component after removal of the k nodes? Actually, we are removing k nodes, and the remaining nodes must be connected.\n\n Another observation: The entire original graph is a tree, so the kept set must form a connected subgraph. The minimal connected subgraph that includes a set of nodes is the smallest subtree that contains all the nodes.\n\n However, we are not required to take the minimal connected set. We are allowed to take any connected set (with n-k nodes). But note: we cannot change the fact that the tree structure is fixed.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what is the maximum-weight connected subgraph of size n-k? \n\n But note: the weight of node i is 2^i, which is exponential. And the entire set of nodes we keep must be connected.\n\n Since the exponential growth is very steep, the optimal solution will likely be to keep the largest n-k districts (by district number) if they are connected, otherwise we must drop the smallest ones that are not necessary to connect the rest.\n\n However, the problem is that the kept set must be connected. So we can use the following greedy idea:\n\n 1. Sort the districts by their fan count descending (i.e., by district number descending). Then the best candidate set is the top n-k districts (largest n-k by number). But if these n-k districts are connected, then we are done.\n\n 2. But if they are not connected, then we must replace some of the smallest ones (lowest number) in this set with some other nodes to make the set connected? Actually, no: because we are forced to keep exactly n-k nodes. So we must choose a connected set of n-k nodes that has the maximum total fan count.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"maximize the total number of fans\", and the fan count is 2^i. Since 2^i is so large, we want to include the largest i's. But if the top n-k are not connected, we might have to drop a few large ones and include some smaller ones to connect the graph? Actually, that seems counterintuitive because including a smaller one (with lower 2^i) would reduce the total. So perhaps we should try to keep the largest n-k districts even if they are not connected, but then we must connect them by including some other nodes? But wait: we are only keeping n-k nodes. So if the top n-k are not connected, then we cannot keep all of them and have a connected graph.\n\n Therefore, we must drop some of the top n-k and include some other nodes to connect the graph. However, note: we are allowed to remove any k districts. So we are choosing which k to remove. The condition is that the remaining n-k must be connected.\n\n We can also think: we wish to remove k districts such that the remaining n-k are connected and the total fan count is maximized.\n\n Since the fan count is higher for higher numbers, we want to remove the smallest (lowest numbers) as much as possible, but sometimes we must remove a high-numbered district to keep the connectivity.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n - We know that the entire set of districts is a tree. We wish to choose a connected set of n-k nodes.\n\n - The complement is k nodes. We are going to remove k nodes. The condition is that the removal of these k nodes leaves the graph connected.\n\n - This is equivalent to: the set of removed nodes must not disconnect the graph? Actually, no: we are allowed to remove k nodes and the remaining must be connected. But note: the removal of nodes from a tree might break the tree into multiple connected components. However, we require that the remaining set is connected.\n\n In graph theory, the remaining set is connected if and only if the removed set does not include any edge that would disconnect the graph? Actually, no: we remove vertices, and the remaining graph is connected if there is a path between every two remaining vertices that uses only remaining vertices.\n\n How to choose which k nodes to remove? \n\n We wish to maximize the fan count of the remaining set, which is equivalent to minimizing the fan count of the removed set (since the total fan count is fixed: sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^i minus the sum of the removed ones). But wait: the total fan count is not fixed because we are only considering the kept set. However, we can reframe: we want to remove k districts such that the kept set is connected and the kept set has maximum fan count. Alternatively, we want to remove k districts with minimum fan count (so that the kept set has maximum) but under the constraint that the kept set is connected.\n\n But note: we are not forced to remove the k smallest. Because if we remove a small one, we might break the connectivity and then have to remove more? Or if we remove a large one, we might avoid having to remove a lot of small ones.\n\n However, the key is: the kept set must be connected.\n\n Another known concept: the connected subgraph with maximum total weight (here weight is 2^i) of size n-k.\n\n We can use a two-step method:\n\n 1. Find the minimal connected set that contains the top n-k districts (by district number). Then we can compare the total fan count of that set with the top n-k? But wait, we are forced to keep exactly n-k.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy algorithm that starts from the highest district and then adds the next highest until we have a connected set of size n-k. But how do we check connectivity? And we are constrained by the tree structure.\n\n However, note that the tree structure is arbitrary. We can use the following:\n\n Since the exponential weights are so large, the optimal set must be as high as possible. Therefore, we can try to take the largest n-k districts and then check if they are connected. If not, we must remove some of the smaller ones (that are not necessary) and add some that are necessary to connect the set.\n\n But note: we are only allowed to remove k, so we are keeping n-k. The minimal connected set that contains the top n-k districts must be a connected set that includes all the top n-k. However, we cannot exceed n-k nodes.\n\n Actually, we are forced to keep exactly n-k nodes, so we cannot add nodes arbitrarily. Therefore, we must choose a connected set of n-k nodes that has the maximum possible sum.\n\n This is a classic problem: maximum weight connected subgraph of fixed size. But note the weights are positive and the graph is a tree.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1).\n\n 2. We wish to keep n-k nodes. We can use a DFS to compute the maximum weight subtree of size n-k? But n and k up to 10^6.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n Since the exponential weights are very large, we want to keep the largest nodes (by district number). Therefore, we can start by marking the nodes we wish to keep: initially, we mark the n-k largest nodes (by district number). Then, we check if the marked nodes form a connected set. If not, we must unmark (remove) some of the smallest marked nodes and mark (add) some unmarked nodes that are necessary for connectivity.\n\n However, we cannot arbitrarily swap because the goal is to maximize the total fan count. Since 2^i is decreasing as i decreases, we want to avoid removing a large node and adding a small node if possible.\n\n But note: if the set of the n-k largest nodes is disconnected, then we must break it down and connect the components by including some nodes that are not in the top n-k. However, the problem is that we are forced to keep exactly n-k nodes.\n\n How to fix the connectivity? We can use a strategy similar to building a spanning tree for the set of kept nodes.\n\n However, note: the entire set of kept nodes must form a connected subgraph. The minimal connected set containing a set of nodes is the minimal subtree that spans these nodes.\n\n We can compute the minimal subtree that spans the top n-k nodes. Then, we can see if the minimal subtree has more than n-k nodes. If so, then we must remove the extra nodes. But wait, we are only keeping n-k nodes. So we cannot keep more than n-k.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a connected set of n-k nodes that includes as many of the top n-k as possible.\n\n This is complex.\n\n Insight from known problems (like \"remove k vertices to leave a connected graph\" and \"maximum weight connected subgraph\"):\n\n In trees, we can use the following:\n\n - The kept set must be connected, so it must contain a set of edges that form a tree on the kept nodes.\n\n - We can use a technique of \"pruning\" the tree from the leaves inward. Since the exponential weights favor high numbers, we would prefer to keep the high-numbered nodes.\n\n Another known idea: the connected subgraph with maximum total weight of fixed size can be solved by starting from leaves and moving inward, but that is complicated.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Step 1: The entire set of districts is a tree. We wish to remove k districts (and we wish to minimize the fan count of the removed ones) such that the remaining set is connected.\n\n Since the fan count of a node is 2^i, and 2^i is increasing with i, the cost of removing a node is 2^i (if we think in terms of minimizing the removed fan count, then maximizing kept is the same as minimizing removed). However, we are forced to remove k nodes and the kept set must be connected.\n\n We can use a dynamic programming on trees, but n and k are up to 10^6.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following greedy:\n\n  - We know that the kept set must be connected. The entire tree is connected. We can consider the following: the kept set must include a set of nodes that forms a connected component. The minimal connected component that we can form is a single node. To maximize the kept fan count, we want to keep as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\n  - Consider: if we remove a set R of k nodes, then the remaining set is connected. The condition for the remaining set to be connected is that the set R does not separate the graph. In a tree, the removal of a set of nodes breaks the tree into several connected components. We require that there is only one connected component.\n\n  - The removal of a node might disconnect the graph. We can use the concept of \"percolation\" or \"breaking points\". However, we wish to minimize the fan count of the removed set.\n\n  - Since the fan count is higher for higher numbers, we want to remove the smallest (lowest numbers) nodes first, but sometimes we have to remove a high-numbered node to avoid breaking the connectivity in a way that requires removing even more high-numbered nodes.\n\n However, note: we are removing exactly k nodes, so we can simulate by trying to remove the smallest k nodes and then check if the remaining is connected. But checking connectivity for n nodes and k removals is expensive.\n\n Another idea: we can use the fact that in a tree, the removal of a set of nodes leaves the graph connected if and only if no connected component (after removal) is disconnected from the rest. The critical thing is that the kept set must be connected.\n\n We can use a two-sweep method (like a greedy removal):\n\n 1. We note that the entire set of nodes is a tree. We wish to remove k nodes. We want to maximize the kept fan count (minimize the removed fan count).\n\n 2. We can use a DFS to compute the importance of each node: the node with the smallest fan count (smallest district number) is the cheapest to remove. But we must ensure that after removing k nodes, the remaining is connected.\n\n 3. We can use a strategy of iteratively removing the smallest node that is not a bridge for connectivity? Or we can use a method of \"core\" nodes.\n\n Alternatively, consider the following:\n\n - The kept set must be connected. Therefore, we can think of the kept set as being the entire tree except for k nodes. The removal of k nodes must not disconnect the graph. In fact, the removal of k nodes from a tree will break the tree into at most k+1 connected components. We require that the kept set is connected, meaning we must not break the graph into multiple components. Actually, the kept set is the entire graph minus the removed set, and we require that the kept set is connected. So the removal of k nodes must not disconnect the graph? Actually, no: the kept set is connected, but the entire graph without the kept set (the removed set) might break the graph. However, the condition is that the kept set is connected.\n\n But note: the kept set is the set of nodes that are not removed, and the edges between them. The connectivity is defined by the edges that remain. The removal of a node also removes all incident edges.\n\n We can use the following: the kept set is connected if and only if the removed set does not include any articulation point that would split the kept set? Actually, no: the removal of an internal node can break the tree.\n\n Known: In a tree, the removal of a set S of nodes leaves the graph connected if and only if S does not contain any node that is adjacent to two (or more) different connected components of the remaining graph. But we don't know the remaining graph.\n\n Another known fact: the kept set is connected if and only if the removed set does not include any node that lies on every path between two nodes in the kept set.\n\n How about: we start by assuming we remove the k smallest nodes (by district number). Then we check if the remaining set is connected. If yes, then we output the list of removed nodes (the k smallest). If not, then we must remove a larger node and keep a smaller one.\n\n However, we want to minimize the fan count of the removed set. The fan count is 2^i, so removing a node with a smaller i is better (less reduction in fan count). Therefore, we want to remove the smallest nodes (by i) as long as the remaining set is connected.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Remove the smallest k nodes (by district number) and check if the remaining set is connected.\n\n  Step 2: If it is, then we output the removed set.\n\n  Step 3: If it is not, then we must remove one more large node and keep one more small node? But wait, we are removing exactly k nodes. Actually, we removed k nodes and the remaining set is disconnected. Then we cannot use that removal set.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to choose any set of k removals. We wish to minimize the fan count of the removed set.\n\n  We can use a greedy iterative removal:\n\n    Let R be the set of removed nodes, initially empty.\n    We wish to remove k nodes.\n\n    We start by considering the nodes in increasing order of fan count (i.e., by district number). We try to remove a node if its removal does not disconnect the kept set? But we are building the removal set.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a reverse approach: we wish to keep a connected set of n-k nodes. We start by keeping all nodes, then we remove k nodes. But we want to maximize the kept fan count (so minimize the removed fan count). We can use a priority queue (min-heap) of nodes by fan count (ascending) and remove the smallest fan count nodes one by one, and check if the removal disconnects the graph. However, if the removal disconnects the graph, we cannot remove that node.\n\n  But note: we are forced to remove k nodes. We want to remove the k smallest fan count nodes, but we must ensure that the kept set remains connected.\n\n  We can use the following:\n\n    Let's denote:\n        kept_set = set(range(1, n+1))\n        removed_set = []\n\n    We are going to remove k nodes. We consider candidate removals in increasing order of fan count (so smallest first). For each candidate node u (starting from the smallest), we consider removing u. But if we remove u, we must check if the kept_set \\ {u} is still connected.\n\n    How to check connectivity? We can use union-find or DFS, but n is 10^6 and we have k removals, so we cannot check each time.\n\n  We need an efficient way to check connectivity after removal of a node.\n\n  In a tree, the removal of a node u breaks the graph into several connected components (specifically, deg(u) components). The kept_set without u is connected if and only if all the remaining nodes are in the same connected component after removing u. But note: we are removing multiple nodes.\n\n  We need to maintain the connectivity of the kept_set. We can use a union-find structure for the current kept_set? But we are removing one node at a time.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the concept of \"bridge\" and \"articulation points\", but we are removing nodes.\n\n  Idea: we can precompute the diameter or something else? Not directly.\n\n  We can use a method of \"two-pass\" BFS/DFS to mark the connected components after removals, but k can be up to 10^6 and n up to 10^6, so we cannot do BFS for each removal.\n\n  Another idea: since the graph is a tree, we can use a method of \"peeling\" the tree by starting from leaves. We can use a bottom-up approach:\n\n    We know that a leaf node (degree 1) that is the smallest (by fan count) can be removed without disconnecting the graph (unless it is the only node, but n>=2). But if we remove a leaf, the graph remains connected (if there are at least two nodes). \n\n    However, if we remove a non-leaf node, we break the graph.\n\n    But wait: if we remove a node that is not a leaf, then the graph breaks into multiple components. But if we are going to remove multiple nodes, we have to consider the entire set.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following theorem for trees: the minimal set of nodes whose removal disconnects the graph is the set of articulation points. But we are not looking for minimal removal sets.\n\n  We wish to remove k nodes (k is fixed) and we wish to remove the ones with smallest fan count, but we must ensure that the kept set is connected.\n\n  Steps for efficient removal:\n\n    We can use a two-step method:\n\n      1. Mark all nodes as present.\n      2. Use a queue to process leaves (nodes with degree 1). These leaves can be removed without disconnecting the graph (as long as there is more than one node). But note: if we remove a leaf, then its parent's degree decreases.\n\n    However, we wish to remove the smallest fan count nodes. So we can do:\n\n      - Start by counting the degree of each node.\n      - Then, use a priority queue (min-heap) for the leaves (nodes with degree 1) ordered by fan count (ascending).\n\n    But note: removing a leaf might create a new leaf. We can simulate the removal of leaves until we have removed k nodes.\n\n    However, what if we remove a leaf and then the parent becomes a leaf? Then we can continue.\n\n    But wait: what if the graph has multiple leaves? We want to remove the smallest leaves first.\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n      Let degree[] be the degree of each node (for the current graph).\n      Let heap be a min-heap of nodes (by fan count) that have degree 1.\n\n      Also, we need to represent the current graph (which nodes are still present).\n\n      Steps:\n\n        1. Build the graph and compute initial degrees.\n        2. Push all leaves (degree 1) into the heap, along with their fan count (which is 2^node, but we only care about node number for ordering).\n        3. We are going to remove k nodes. We'll remove the smallest fan count leaves first.\n\n        However, we must ensure that the removal of a leaf doesn't disconnect the graph? Actually, removing a leaf from a tree (with at least two nodes) doesn't disconnect the graph. Then we can remove as many leaves as we want (until k removals or until no leaves left).\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove exactly k nodes. We want to remove the smallest fan count nodes (by node number) and we want the kept set to be connected. Removing leaves (if we remove them) doesn't break connectivity.\n\n        However, what if we remove a leaf and then the parent becomes a leaf? Then we can remove the parent (if it is the smallest available) next.\n\n        But wait: the parent's degree might become 1 (if it originally had degree 2 and we remove one child). Then we can remove it.\n\n        This is the standard \"tree peeling\" from leaves.\n\n        However, there is a catch: we must remove exactly k nodes. We are allowed to remove any k nodes, but we wish to minimize the fan count of the removed set.\n\n        The above method (removing smallest leaves first) will remove the smallest fan count nodes (because leaves are the smallest by node number? Not necessarily: node number and degree are independent). But we are ordering by fan count (which is node number, because fan count is 2^node, so comparing node numbers is the same as comparing fan counts). So we put leaves in a min-heap by node number.\n\n        Then:\n\n          while k > 0 and heap is not empty:\n            pop the smallest node u from the heap (if it is still present).\n            Remove u: \n              decrease the degree of its neighbor(s) (only one neighbor, since it was a leaf, unless we removed some edges already).\n              if the neighbor's degree becomes 1, push it into the heap.\n\n            Then, we remove u and mark it as removed.\n\n            Decrement k.\n\n        However, what if there are no leaves left? Then we have to remove non-leaf nodes. But removing a non-leaf node (with degree>=2) will break the graph. So we cannot remove it arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove exactly k nodes. We wish to remove the smallest fan count nodes, but we must stop at leaves because non-leaves break connectivity.\n\n        However, what if we haven't removed k nodes but the entire graph is reduced to a connected component (a tree) and we cannot remove any more leaves? Then we have to remove some non-leaves. But then we break connectivity.\n\n        Therefore, we must not break connectivity. The above method only removes leaves, and leaves can be removed without disconnecting the graph. But if we remove a non-leaf, then we break the graph.\n\n        But wait: the condition is that the kept set is connected. Removing a non-leaf will break the graph into multiple components. Therefore, we cannot remove any non-leaf.\n\n        However, we must remove k nodes. If we run out of leaves to remove, then we cannot remove any more nodes without breaking connectivity. Then we must remove fewer than k nodes? That contradicts the requirement.\n\n        So what is the catch?\n\n        Actually, the above method only removes leaves. But we are allowed to remove any k nodes, as long as the kept set is connected. We do not necessarily have to remove leaves.\n\n        Example: consider a star graph: one central node connected to many leaves. We wish to remove k nodes. We can remove leaves arbitrarily. But if we wish to remove a non-leaf (the center), then we break the graph. But we are forced to remove k nodes. \n\n        However, if we remove k leaves, then the kept set (which is the center and n-k-1 leaves) is connected. So we can remove leaves arbitrarily.\n\n        But what if we wish to remove a leaf that is not the smallest? We are always removing the smallest (by node number) first.\n\n        However, the problem: we are to output the removed set in increasing order of district number.\n\n        But note: the above method does not guarantee that we remove the smallest k nodes overall. It only removes the smallest leaves. What if there is a leaf that is large, and a non-leaf that is small? We cannot remove the non-leaf because it breaks the graph, so we have to remove the large leaf and keep the small non-leaf? But wait, the problem requires that the kept set is connected.\n\n        Example: n=3, k=1. Graph: 1-2-3.\n\n        Leaves are nodes 1 and 3. The smallest leaf is 1. We remove node 1. Then the kept set is {2,3} which is connected. So that's valid.\n\n        Now, if we remove node 3 (the other leaf) then kept set {1,2} is connected. But if we remove node 2 (the middle), then kept set {1,3} is disconnected.\n\n        So we cannot remove node 2.\n\n        But what if we wish to remove node 2? We are forced to remove k=1 node, and the kept set must be connected. We cannot remove node 2 because it disconnects the graph.\n\n        Therefore, the only removable nodes are the leaves.\n\n        But wait, what if the tree is a chain of 4 nodes: 1-2-3-4. We wish to remove k=1 node. The leaves are 1 and 4. We can remove either. But we cannot remove node 2 or 3 because that would break the chain into two parts.\n\n        Therefore, the set of removable nodes (without disconnecting the graph) is exactly the set of leaves? No, because if a node is not a leaf, removing it might break the graph, but if the graph remains connected? Actually, no: in a tree, removing a non-leaf node always breaks the graph into multiple components (at least two) if the node has degree>=2.\n\n        But wait, consider a node with two children: removing it breaks the graph into three components (its children and their subtrees). So the kept set would be disconnected.\n\n        Therefore, we can only remove leaves.\n\n        However, what if we remove multiple leaves at once? Consider: n=4, k=2, chain 1-2-3-4. Leaves are 1 and 4. We remove both leaves. Then the kept set is {2,3} which is connected. So we can remove leaves.\n\n        But what if we remove a leaf and then another leaf that is not adjacent to the first? In the chain, after removing 1, the graph becomes 2-3-4, and now 4 becomes a leaf. Then we can remove 4.\n\n        So we can remove leaves one by one, and after each removal, new leaves appear.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          Let deg[i] be the degree of node i.\n          Let q be a min-heap (priority queue) for node i with deg[i]==1.\n\n          removed = [False]*(n+1)\n          count = 0\n\n          While count < k and q is not empty:\n            pop the smallest node u from q.\n            If u is already removed, skip.\n            Else, mark u as removed, and increment count.\n\n            For each neighbor v of u:\n                if not removed[v]:\n                    deg[v] -= 1\n                    if deg[v] == 1:\n                        heapq.heappush(q, v)\n\n          Then, output the removed nodes (but note: we only removed leaves, and we did so in increasing order of node number).\n\n        However, what if we cannot remove k nodes? Then we must remove fewer than k. But the problem states that we must remove exactly k. And the input guarantees that k < n.\n\n        But note: the above method removes k leaves if available. But what if the tree has fewer than k leaves? Then we cannot remove k nodes without breaking connectivity.\n\n        However, wait: the entire tree has n nodes. The number of leaves can be more than k? Actually, the tree has at least 2 leaves (unless n==1). But we are allowed to remove leaves repeatedly, and each removal might create new leaves.\n\n        Example: a star graph with center c and leaves l1, l2, ..., lm (m = n-1). Initially, leaves are the m leaves. After removing one leaf, the center becomes a leaf (if m>=2). Then we can remove the center (if we wish) but wait: the center is not a leaf anymore? Actually, after removing one leaf, the center has degree m-1. If m-1==1, then the center becomes a leaf. Otherwise, if m-1>=2, then the center is not a leaf.\n\n        But our algorithm only removes leaves (nodes with degree 1). So in the star graph, we can remove all the leaves (m leaves) and then the center becomes a leaf (if m>=2) and we can remove the center too. But wait, the center has degree m-1. After removing m leaves, the center has degree 0 -> then it is not considered a leaf (degree 1)? Actually, we stop at degree 1.\n\n        Correction: we update the degree of the neighbor. When we remove a leaf u, we reduce the degree of its neighbor v by 1. In the star graph, the neighbor v is the center. Then the center's degree becomes (n-1)-1 = n-2.\n\n        Then, the center is a leaf only if n-2 == 1, i.e., n=3. For n>=4, the center is not a leaf.\n\n        So in a star graph with n>=4, we can only remove the n-1 leaves (the outer nodes). Then we cannot remove the center because its degree is n-2 (>=2) and not 1.\n\n        But wait, we are only allowed to remove k nodes. So if k <= n-1, we can remove k leaves (the smallest ones). If k > n-1, then we cannot remove k nodes without breaking connectivity.\n\n        However, the problem states: k < n. But note: we can remove up to n-1 nodes (leaves) and keep one node (the center) which is connected (trivially). But if k = n-1, then we remove n-1 leaves and the kept set is the center (one node) which is connected.\n\n        But wait, the condition is that the kept set is connected. A single node is connected.\n\n        So the above algorithm works for k <= (n-1) ? \n\n        However, consider a chain: 1-2-3-4. n=4, k=3. We wish to remove 3 nodes. The leaves are 1 and 4. We remove 1, then the graph becomes 2-3-4, and now 4 becomes a leaf (if we remove 1, then node2 has degree 1 (only connected to 3) and node4 has degree 1 (only connected to 3). Then we remove 4, then the graph becomes 2-3, and node2 has degree 1 (only connected to 3) and node3 has degree 1 (only connected to 2). Then we remove 2 or 3? But wait, we are removing k=3, so we must remove one more. We can remove node2 or node3. But note: after removing node4, the graph is 2-3, and both are leaves. We remove the smallest: node2. Then the kept set is {3}. That is connected.\n\n        So the above algorithm would work for k=3 in the chain of 4.\n\n        How does the algorithm handle the chain of 4?\n\n          Initial degrees: \n            node1: 1 (leaf)\n            node2: 2\n            node3: 2\n            node4: 1 (leaf)\n\n          We push nodes 1 and 4 (min-heap: [1,4])\n\n          Step1: remove node1 (smallest). Update node2: degree becomes 1. Push node2.\n          Step2: remove node4 (next smallest). Update node3: degree becomes 1. Push node3.\n          Step3: remove node2 (now smallest). Update node3: degree becomes 0. Then we don't push anything.\n\n          Then we stop. The removed nodes are [1,4,2]. But note: the problem requires output in increasing order: [1,2,4]. However, the kept set is {3} which is connected.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: remove k=3 districts. The example input says: n=6, k=3 -> output [1,3,4]. \n\n        In our chain example, we removed [1,2,4] (which are the smallest three nodes). But the example input's answer is [1,3,4] for n=6, k=3.\n\n        Why is that?\n\n        Let me reexamine the example: \n\n          Input: \"6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3\"\n\n          The tree has 6 nodes. The edges:\n            2-1, 2-6,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts to remove from a tree-structured graph such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected component and the total fan count of the remaining districts is maximized. The fan count for each district i is given by 2^i, which grows exponentially with the district number. Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node represents a district. The task is to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected subgraph (i.e., a tree) and the sum of their fan counts (2^i) is maximized. Since the fan count increases with the district number, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution involves removing the smallest possible district numbers (to maximize the fan count of the remaining districts) while maintaining connectivity. In a tree, removing a leaf node (a node with degree 1) does not disconnect the graph. Thus, we can iteratively remove the smallest leaf nodes first until we have removed k nodes or no more leaves are left.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a min-heap to process nodes in increasing order of their district numbers. Nodes with degree 1 (leaves) are candidates for removal. For each removal, we update the degrees of adjacent nodes. If an adjacent node's degree becomes 1 after removal, it is added to the heap. This ensures we always remove the smallest available leaf nodes first.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each node and edge once, with heap operations taking O(log n) time per operation. The overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    \n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n        \n    deg = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        deg[i] = len(graph[i])\n        \n    heap = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if deg[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, i)\n            \n    removed = [False] * (n+1)\n    count = 0\n    result = []\n    \n    while count < k and heap:\n        u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if removed[u]:\n            continue\n        removed[u] = True\n        result.append(u)\n        count += 1\n        \n        for v in graph[u]:\n            if not removed[v]:\n                deg[v] -= 1\n                if deg[v] == 1:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, v)\n                    \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of removals (k). The tree structure is then built using adjacency lists.\n2. **Degree Calculation**: The degree of each node (number of connected edges) is calculated to identify leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1).\n3. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is initialized with all leaf nodes to prioritize removing the smallest district numbers first.\n4. **Removal Process**: The algorithm repeatedly removes the smallest leaf node from the heap, updates the degrees of its neighbors, and adds any neighbor that becomes a leaf to the heap. This continues until k nodes are removed or no more leaves are left.\n5. **Output**: The removed nodes are printed in increasing order, ensuring the solution meets the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures the remaining districts form a connected component while maximizing the total fan count by leveraging heap operations to prioritize high-value districts.",
