Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings combined, and nothing extra.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and remove any extraneous characters like newline (if present).\n 2. Combine the first two strings and compare their letter counts with the third string.\n    - We can count the frequency of each letter in the first two strings and compare with the third string.\n 3. If the total counts of each letter in the combined string (guest + host) is equal to that in the pile, then output \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> but note: the example output uses \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is the same multiset as the combined one?\n   Actually, let's break down the example:\n\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> letters: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> wait, let's count properly: \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1.\n\n   Combined: \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1.\n\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> \n        Let's break it down: \n          S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   Wait, there's an issue: In the pile we have two 'O's (from MOROZ) and the host only has one 'O'. But wait, the example input says:\n\n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   Actually, the example input is given as a list of strings. Let me parse the example correctly.\n\n   The example input is provided as:\n\n     \"SANTACLAUS\"\n     \"DEDMOROZ\"\n     \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the example says: \"In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\"\n\n   However, the example input is given in a confusing way. Let me clarify:\n\n   The problem states that the input consists of three lines.\n\n   The example input is:\n\n      Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n      Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n      Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, let's count the letters for the combined names:\n\n      Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> \n          S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, A: already counted, so total: \n          S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n      Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\" ->\n          D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1.\n\n      Combined: \n          S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1.\n\n   Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" (without spaces) -> \n\n      Let's break it down:\n\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   So we see that the combined names require 1 'O' but the pile has 2 'O's. \n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   Let me check the example again: the example input string is given as:\n\n      ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   Actually, the example input is provided in the problem statement as:\n\n        Input: \n          SANTACLAUS\n          DEDMOROZ\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   And the expected output is \"YES\".\n\n   There must be a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n   The problem says: \"Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.\"\n\n   The pile is the third line. The names to form are the first two lines.\n\n   The example input is:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   How many letters are in the first two lines?\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10 letters\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8 letters\n        Total: 18 letters.\n\n   The pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 16 letters? \n\n   Let me count the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S? \n\n   Actually, let me write it without confusion: \n\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> Wait, that would be 18 letters.\n\n   But wait, the string \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has 18 characters. \n\n   Let me count:\n\n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18.\n\n   Now, let's count the letters in the pile:\n\n        S: appears at index0 and index17 -> 2\n        A: index1, index4, index15 -> 3\n        N: index2 -> 1\n        T: index3 -> 1\n        M: index5 -> 1\n        O: index6 and index7? -> wait, actually: \n            index6: O, index8: O -> so two O's.\n\n        But wait, in the combined names (guest and host) we have only one O (from host: DEDMOROZ has one O). \n\n   However, looking at the guest name \"SANTACLAUS\": there is no O. The host name \"DEDMOROZ\" has one O.\n\n   Therefore, the combined should have one O. But the pile has two O's.\n\n   This discrepancy suggests that the example might have been miswritten. \n\n   Alternatively, the example input might be different. \n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   That means the third string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which indeed has two O's.\n\n   However, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Let me recalc the expected letters for the combined names:\n\n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> wait, wait! \n\n        Actually, the host name is \"DEDMOROZ\": \n            D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> so two O's? \n\n        But wait, the host name is written as \"DEDMOROZ\", which has two O's? \n\n        Let me spell: D-E-D-M-O-R-O-Z -> that's two O's.\n\n        So the host name has two O's.\n\n        Then the combined names: \n            Guest: S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n            Host: D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n        Total: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n        The pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> \n            Let's break it down:\n\n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n        Now they match.\n\n   So the confusion was: the host name \"DEDMOROZ\" actually has two O's. \n\n   Therefore, the solution is to count the frequency of each letter in the combined string (first two lines) and the third string.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Option 1: \n        s1 = first line\n        s2 = second line\n        s3 = third line\n\n        total_letters = s1 + s2\n        if sorted(total_letters) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the total_letters string will be at most 200, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also use a Counter from collections.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        c1 = Counter(s1 + s2)\n        c2 = Counter(s3)\n\n        if c1 == c2:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is efficient and clear.\n\n   Let's test with the example:\n\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        c1 = Counter(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n        c2 = Counter(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n        They should be the same.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Expected: NO.\n\n        Let's break down:\n\n        Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> letters: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n        Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\n        Combined: \n            P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:2, K:2.\n\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> \n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, A: already counted, I:2, E:1, L: already, U: already, P: already, O: already, K:2.\n\n        Wait, the pile has two P's, but combined requires 3 P's (from guest: two P's, host: one P). \n\n        So the pile has only two P's, so it's missing one P.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Count the letters in the pile: \n\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Let me count the P's: \n            Positions: \n                J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> \n            P appears twice.\n\n        So the combined needs 3 P's (from \"PAPAINOEL\" has two P's and \"JOULUPUKKI\" has one P) -> 3.\n\n        The pile has 2, so it's missing one.\n\n        Therefore, we output \"NO\", which matches the expected output.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Expected: \"NO\"\n\n        Let's break down:\n\n        Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> B:2, A:2, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, L:1.\n        Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H: already, R: already, I:1, S:1, M:1, A: already.\n\n        Combined: \n            B:2, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:2, L:1, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:1, M:1.\n\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> \n\n        Let me count the letters:\n\n            B:2, A:3, B: already, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A: already, S: already, B: already, O:1, N:1, A: already, T:2, A: already, L:2, E:2, F:1, A: already, T: already, H:2, E:2, R: already.\n\n        Wait, let me do it systematically:\n\n            B: 2 (from the two B's at the beginning and then one more in the middle? Actually: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n            B at index0, index1, and then one more in the middle? Actually, the word \"BAB\" has two B's, then later \"BON\" has one B, so total B:3.\n\n            So the pile has 3 B's, but the combined only requires 2.\n\n        Therefore, there's an extra B (or perhaps the example is different). \n\n        Alternatively, let me check the example input: \n\n            Input: \"BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        The pile is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Counting B: \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n            First two letters: 'B','A','B' -> two B's, then later: ...B... -> so at least three B's.\n\n        But the guest \"BABBONATALE\" has two B's and the host doesn't have any B, so total two B's.\n\n        So the pile has three B's, which is one extra. Therefore, we should output \"NO\".\n\n        However, the example output is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   So the code using Counter is:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines, and we are reading from stdin.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        Counter(s1+s2) = Counter('SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ') \n        Counter(s3) = Counter('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS')\n\n        They are the same -> YES.\n\n   Example 2:\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n        Counter(s1+s2) != Counter(s3) -> NO.\n\n   Example 3:\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n        Counter(s1+s2) != Counter(s3) -> NO.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note that the example input was provided as a list of strings, but in reality we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We'll assume standard input.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        # Read the three lines\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, what if the pile has extra spaces or newlines? We use strip() to remove any trailing newline or spaces.\n\n   The problem says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So we don't have to worry about spaces.\n\n   However, the input might have newline characters. Using strip() will remove any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use .replace('\\n', '') but strip() is safe because the problem says only uppercase letters.\n\n   But note: the input is three lines. The first two lines are the guest and host, the third is the pile. \n\n   Since the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, we can rely on strip().\n\n   However, sometimes input() may return a string with a newline at the end. We want to remove that.\n\n   But note: the example input is given with '\\n' in the list representation, meaning the actual input line for the third string would include a newline? \n\n   Actually, when reading from stdin, the input() function returns the line without the trailing newline by default. However, if the input is coming from a file with explicit newlines, then the input() function will read until the newline and then stop, so the string returned does not include the newline.\n\n   But to be safe, we use strip() to remove any potential extraneous whitespace (though the problem says only uppercase letters).\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        guest = input().replace('\\n', '').replace('\\r', '')\n        ...\n\n   But the problem says the input is from a file with three lines, and each line is not empty. So we can simply use:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n   This will work.\n\n   Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\n   However, note: the example input is provided as a list of strings. In practice, we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We'll submit the above code.\n\n   Edge: if the combined string is longer than the pile, then the Counter comparison will fail (because some letter will be missing). Similarly, if the pile is longer, then there will be a letter that is extra.\n\n   This is handled by the Counter equality.\n\n   We are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of each letter in the combined names match exactly the counts in the pile, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter frequencies between the combined names and the pile, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three strings from standard input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string to form the combined letters required.\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: The counts from the combined names and the pile are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile contains all the necessary letters without any extras, so \"YES\" is printed. Otherwise, \"NO\" is printed, indicating the pile does not meet the required criteria.\n\nThis method efficiently checks the problem's conditions by leveraging the `Counter` class for accurate and quick comparison of letter frequencies.",
