Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the target string (since we need to form both names).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the third string.\n    - If they are the same, then we can rearrange the pile to form the two names (so output \"YES\").\n    - Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says there should be no extra letters and we shouldn't need to cut more. So the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Here, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". But wait, let's count:\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n     target = guest_name + host_name\n     pile_letters = third_line\n\n   Then, we can compare the sorted(target) and sorted(pile_letters). They must be identical.\n\n Let's test with the example:\n\n   Example 1:\n     guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n     target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n     pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, note: the example input provided in the sample is actually given as a string that includes all three lines, but the example input format is three separate lines.\n\n   However, the sample input example is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But wait, the example input has three lines. Actually, the example input is:\n\n        Line1: 'SANTACLAUS'\n        Line2: 'DEDMOROZ'\n        Line3: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   So, we are going to read three lines.\n\n   Let me break down the example:\n\n        Guest name: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Host name: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". \n\n   Let's sort the combined string and the pile string:\n\n        Combined: sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\")\n        Pile: sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n   But wait, note that the pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" which is the same as \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" when rearranged? \n\n   Actually, let's write out the letters:\n\n        Combined: S A N T A C L A U S D E D M O R O Z\n        Pile:      S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n   Wait, the combined string has two 'A's (from SANTACLAUS: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> 3 A's) and the pile string has 4 A's? \n\n   Actually, let's count the letters:\n\n        Guest \"SANTACLAUS\": \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        Host \"DEDMOROZ\":\n            D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Total for guest and host:\n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Why did I initially think the pile had 4 A's? Because I wrote it as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" and let me count:\n\n        S: positions 0, then 8 -> 2\n        A: positions 1, 2, 9 -> wait, no: \n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n        Let me index:\n            S(0), A(1), N(2), T(3), A(4), M(5), O(6), R(7), O(8), Z(9), D(10), E(11), D(12), C(13), L(14), A(15), U(16), S(17)\n\n        So A appears at indices 1,4,15 -> 3 times.\n\n   So the method is correct.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n        target = line1 + line2\n        pile = line3\n\n        if sorted(target) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the second example:\n\n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        target = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n        pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count the letters in target:\n\n            P: 2 (from PAPA) + 0? -> Actually, P in PAPAINOEL: 2, and in JOULUPUKKI: 1 -> total 3.\n            A: in PAPAINOEL: 2 (PAPA) and then an A in NOEL? Actually, PAPAINOEL: P A P A I N O E L -> A:2, then J... so total A:2.\n\n        Now, pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let me count the letters in the pile:\n\n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        But target:\n\n            P:3, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:1, K:2\n\n        There's a mismatch: target has 3 P's, pile has only 1 P. Also, target has 2 A's, pile has 2 A's, but target has 3 P's and pile has 1 P -> so sorted will not match.\n\n        The example output is \"NO\", so this method works.\n\n   Third example:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        target = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Count the letters in target:\n\n            B: 2 (from BABBONATALE) + 1 (from FATHERCHRISTMAS? no B in FATHERCHRISTMAS) -> 2\n            A: 2 (from BABBONATALE: B A BB ONA TALE -> A:2) + 1 (from FATHERCHRISTMAS: A in CHRISTMAS? yes, one A) -> 3\n\n        Now, the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count the letters in the pile:\n\n            B: 2 (BAB) + 1 (in CHRISTMAS? no) + 1 (in BONATALLE? no) -> 2\n            A: 2 (BAB) + 1 (CHRISTMAS) + 2 (BONATALLE: two A's?) -> Actually, BONATALLE: B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E -> two A's -> total A: 2+1+2 = 5\n\n        So clearly the pile has more A's. \n\n        Therefore, the example output is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   However, note that the example input is given as:\n\n        ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        But wait, the third line is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", and the target is \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\".\n\n        The target has 2 B's, and the pile has 2 B's (from BAB and the rest doesn't have B). But the A's: target has 3, pile has 5.\n\n        So the sorted lists will differ.\n\n   Therefore, the code below implements the above logic.\n\n   But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so using sorted is efficient enough (max 200 letters for target and 100 for pile? Actually, the third line can be up to 100, but the target is two strings of up to 100 each, so 200. But wait, the third line is given as the pile and the length of each line <=100, so the pile is at most 100. And the target is two strings of up to 100, so 200. However, the condition is that the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names. But note: the two names together might be longer than the pile? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\" \n\n   This means the pile must have exactly the same multiset of letters as the two names combined.\n\n   Therefore, we require that the length of the pile equals the length of the target (otherwise, we can immediately say \"NO\"). \n\n   However, our sorted comparison would also catch that because if the lengths differ, the sorted lists will have different lengths and hence not equal.\n\n   But note: the problem states that the third line (pile) may contain any letters, but the condition is that we can form the two names (so the pile must have the exact letters and nothing more or less).\n\n   We don't need to check the length separately because if the sorted lists are the same, the lengths are the same.\n\n   However, if the lengths are different, the sorted lists will be of different lengths and the condition fails.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, what if the pile has the same letters but in different counts? The sorted method will catch that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        c1 = Counter(s1)\n        c2 = Counter(s2)\n        c3 = Counter(s3)\n\n        # The pile should have the same multiset as c1+c2\n        if c1 + c2 == c3 and len(s3) == len(s1)+len(s2):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the Counter addition and comparison checks for every letter. But the condition on length is redundant because if the total counts are the same, the length must be the same.\n\n   But the problem says the pile might have the same letters but in different counts? Then the length condition is already covered by the Counter.\n\n   However, the problem constraints are small (each line <=100), so we can use either method.\n\n   Let me choose the Counter method for clarity and because it is more direct.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input contains only uppercase letters. So we can use:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the Counter addition is the multiset union. But the Counter for s3 must have at least the counts of each letter as in s1+s2, and no extra? Actually, the Counter equality will check that the counts for every letter in s1+s2 are the same as in s3, and also that there are no extra keys in s3. \n\n   Example: if s3 has a letter that is not in s1+s2, then the Counter(s1+s2) doesn't have that key, and the addition of Counters for s1+s2 will have 0 for that letter, while Counter(s3) has a positive value. Then the equality fails.\n\n   So this condition is sufficient.\n\n   However, what about performance? The strings are at most 200 and 100, so building Counters for strings of length 200 and 100 is efficient.\n\n   But note: the problem says the third line (pile) is found at the door and its length is at most 100. The two names together are at most 200, so the pile is 100, which is less than 200. Then the condition Counter(s1+s2)==Counter(s3) requires that the multiset of the two names (200 letters) is the same as the pile (100 letters). That can't happen if the pile is shorter. \n\n   Actually, wait: the problem says the length of each line (including the pile) does not exceed 100. So the pile is at most 100, and the two names together are two strings each <=100, so the total is <=200. But the pile is 100, so if the two names together are 200, then the pile (100) is less than 200, so the condition will fail because the counts for the letters in the two names (which are 200) cannot be matched by a pile of 100.\n\n   Therefore, we must also check the length. Alternatively, the Counter method will work because if the pile is shorter, then for some letter the count in the pile will be less than the required count (from s1+s2) and the Counter equality will fail.\n\n   However, the Counter method does not explicitly check the length, but the counts for each letter must add up. The total number of letters is the sum of the counts. So if the pile has fewer letters, then at least one letter's count in the pile is less than the total required. Then the Counter(s1+s2) and Counter(s3) will be different.\n\n   But note: the two names together have length = len(s1)+len(s2). The pile has length=len(s3). The Counter method doesn't require the lengths to be the same, but the counts for each letter must be the same. \n\n   Example: if s1+s2 has a letter 'A' with count 5, and s3 has count 3 for 'A', then the Counter(s1+s2) has 5 and Counter(s3) has 3, so they are not equal.\n\n   However, if the two names have a total of 200 letters, and the pile has 100, then the Counter(s3) cannot have the same counts for all letters (because the sum of the counts in s3 is 100, and the sum for s1+s2 is 200). But wait, the Counter(s1+s2) is built from 200 letters, and the Counter(s3) from 100, so the total counts (the sum of counts) is 200 vs 100, but the Counter equality compares per letter. \n\n   Actually, the Counter(s1+s2) has a dictionary with counts for each letter, and Counter(s3) has counts for each letter. The equality requires that for every letter, the count in s1+s2 equals the count in s3. \n\n   But if the two names have 200 letters, then the sum of the counts in the Counter(s1+s2) is 200. The sum of the counts in Counter(s3) is 100. However, the Counter equality does not compare the total counts, it compares each letter individually. \n\n   Example: \n        s1+s2 = \"AAAAA\" (5 A's) and s3 = \"AAA\" (3 A's). \n        Then Counter(s1+s2) = {'A':5} and Counter(s3) = {'A':3} -> not equal.\n\n   But note: the two names together have 5 letters, and the pile has 3. The problem requires that the pile has exactly the letters (so the two names). So the pile must have the same multiset, meaning same counts for each letter. \n\n   However, if the two names have 200 letters and the pile has 100, then the counts for each letter in the pile must be half of the two names? Not necessarily, but the problem requires the pile to have the exact letters (so the same multiset). \n\n   Therefore, the pile must have the same multiset, so the length must be the same. \n\n   So we can rely on the Counter method to catch the case when the pile is too short or too long (by letter counts) but not by total length? Actually, the Counter method does not require the total length to be the same, but the per-letter counts must be the same. And the total length is the sum of the counts, so if the per-letter counts are the same, then the total length is the same.\n\n   However, wait: the Counter method does not consider letters that are not present. For example, if the two names have letters only 'A' and 'B', and the pile has only 'A' (with the same count as in the two names) but missing 'B', then the Counter for the two names has 'B' with count, say, 5, and the pile has no 'B'. Then the Counter(s1+s2) has 'B':5 and Counter(s3) has no 'B' (or 0? actually, Counter(s3) will have 'B':0 if we build it from the pile? No, Counter(s3) only includes letters that are in the pile. \n\n   How does Counter handle missing keys? In the equality, if a key is missing in one of the Counters, then they are considered different.\n\n   Example: \n        Counter1 = Counter('AAB')\n        Counter2 = Counter('AA')\n\n        Counter1 has {'A':2, 'B':1}\n        Counter2 has {'A':2}\n\n        Then Counter1 != Counter2 because the key 'B' is missing in Counter2.\n\n   So the Counter method automatically checks that the set of letters is the same.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply use:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: the Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) is a Counter that adds the counts. And then we compare with Counter(s3). This is the same as checking that the multiset of s1+s2 is the same as s3.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names. The Counter method checks that.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) = \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n        Counter(s3) = \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        These are the same.\n\n   Example 2:\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Counter(s1+s2) = \n            P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n        Counter(s3) = \n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2   [Wait, I previously counted P:1 in the pile, but the target has P:3. So they are different.]\n\n        Actually, the target (s1+s2) has 3 P's, but the pile has 1 P. So the Counter comparison will fail.\n\n   Example 3:\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Target: \n            B:2, A:3, B:2 (wait, let me recount the target: \n                s1: BABBONATALE -> B:2, A:2 (from BA and then A in ATALE? Actually, BABBONATALE: \n                    B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E -> B:3, A:3, ... \n                Actually, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\n            s1: \"BABBONATALE\": \n                B:3 (positions 0,2,3) \n                A:3 (positions 1,7,8) \n                O:1, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1\n\n            s2: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\":\n                F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1 (wait, two H's?), S:1, I:1, M:1, A:1 -> A:2, H:2, etc.\n\n            Actually, let me break down s2: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n                F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1 (so two H's), R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1 -> \n                A:2, H:2, T:2, ... \n\n            Then the target has:\n                B:3, A: (3 from s1 + 2 from s2 = 5), ... \n\n            The pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Count the pile for A: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n                A: \n                    In \"BAB\": 0\n                    \"CHRISTMAS\": 1 (the A in CHRISTMAS)\n                    \"BONATALLE\": 2 (A in BONATALLE: there are two A's? Let's see: BONATALLE -> B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E -> two A's)\n                    \"FATHER\": 1 (A in FATHER)\n                So total A: 1+2+1 = 4.\n\n            The target has 5 A's, so the Counter method will show they are not equal.\n\n   Therefore, the Counter method works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the pile is the third line, and the two names are the first two. We are assuming that the pile must have the same multiset as the two names combined.\n\n   Since the problem says \"there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more\", meaning the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names (so no extra and no missing).\n\n   We'll use the Counter method.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the two names together are at most 200, and the pile is at most 100. However, if the two names together are 200, and the pile is 100, then the Counter method will fail because the total counts (the sum of the counts) is 200 in the two names and 100 in the pile. But wait, the Counter method does not require the total length to be the same, but the per-letter counts must be the same. \n\n   Example: if two names together have 200 letters, and the pile has 100, then unless the counts for every letter are half (which they aren't necessarily) the condition fails. But note, the pile must have the same multiset. The multiset is defined by the counts of each letter. So if the two names have a letter 'X' with count 10, then the pile must have 'X' with count 10. Therefore, the pile must have the same total length as the two names.\n\n   However, the problem states that the pile is found at the door, and the two names were hung. The pile is the available letters. The problem does not specify that the pile must be the same length as the two names, but logically, if there are no extra letters and no missing, then the pile must have the same multiset, hence the same length.\n\n   But the problem says the length of the third line (pile) does not exceed 100. So if the two names together have 200, then the pile cannot have 200 letters (because 200>100). Then we know immediately that the answer is \"NO\", because the pile doesn't have enough letters.\n\n   However, the problem does not say that the pile must have at least the letters of the two names. It says: \"verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\" \n\n   This means:\n     - There should be no extra letters (so the pile must not have any letter not needed)\n     - There should be no missing letters (so the pile must have all the letters needed)\n\n   The pile must have exactly the multiset of the two names.\n\n   But if the two names have 200 letters and the pile has 100, then the pile is missing 100 letters. So it fails.\n\n   Therefore, the condition of having the same multiset implies the same length.\n\n   We can rely on the Counter method.\n\n   However, the problem says the length of the pile is at most 100, so if the two names together have more than 100 letters, then the pile (being <=100) cannot have the same multiset (because the multiset requires more letters). \n\n   Therefore, the Counter method is safe.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        def main():\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n\n            # Check if the multiset of s1+s2 equals the multiset of s3\n            if Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: the Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) is a Counter that adds the counts, and then we compare with Counter(s3). This is correct.\n\n   But note: the Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) is the same as Counter(s1+s2) because addition of Counters is element-wise by letter.\n\n   But wait, what if there are overlapping letters? Yes, that's how Counters work.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples with this code.\n\n   Example 1: YES\n   Example 2: NO\n   Example 3: NO\n\n   However, the sample input provided in the problem is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But note: the sample input is given as a list of three strings, each containing three lines. Actually, the example input is three lines.\n\n   Our code reads three lines, so it's correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n        Input:\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   And the second example:\n\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   And the third example:\n\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the third line is the pile. In the example, the third line is provided as the entire string, so we read the third line and use it as s3.\n\n   But wait, the example input format: the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So we are reading three lines.\n\n   One more edge: what if the two names are empty? But the problem says all lines are not empty.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let me run the code with the sample inputs.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines. We are reading three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a string that has the three lines. We are using input().strip(), so we read from stdin.\n\n   We assume standard input.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let me test with a small example:\n\n        Example: \n            Input: \n                A\n                A\n                AA\n\n            This should be YES.\n\n        Example:\n            Input:\n                A\n                A\n                A\n\n            This should be NO (because we need two A's, but only one is provided).\n\n   But wait, the two names together: \"A\"+\"A\" = \"AA\", so the pile must be \"AA\". \n\n        Counter(\"AA\") == Counter(\"AA\") -> True.\n\n        For the second: \n            Counter(\"AA\") (which is {'A':2}) and Counter(\"A\") (which is {'A':1}) -> False.\n\n   So the code works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, but the two names together can be up to 200, and the pile up to 100. So if the two names together are 200, and the pile is 100, the Counter method will still compare and fail because the counts per letter must be the same, and the total length is different (so some letter must have a lower count in the pile).\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n   But note: the problem says the third line (pile) is found at the door. The two names are hung. The pile is the letters found. The problem does not specify that the pile is the same length as the two names, but logically, if the two names have more letters than the pile, then the pile is missing letters.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100. The two names are two separate lines, each up to 100, so the two names together can be up to 200. The pile is one line, up to 100. \n\n   Therefore, if the two names together have more than 100 letters, then the pile (at most 100) cannot have the same multiset (because the multiset requires 200 letters, but the pile only has 100). \n\n   But wait, the Counter method does not require the total length to be the same, but the per-letter counts. However, the total length is the sum of the counts, so if the two names have 200 letters, the pile must have 200 letters to have the same multiset. But the pile is limited to 100, so it's impossible.\n\n   Therefore, the Counter method will correctly return \"NO\" for such cases.\n\n   We'll write the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the length of the third line (pile) is at most 100, and the two names are two lines each at most 100. \n\n   The code uses the Counter method. This is acceptable.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile (third input line) can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name (first two input lines). The solution involves checking if the multiset (count of each letter) of the combined names matches the multiset of the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to verify if the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names of the guest and host, with no extra or missing letters. This means the counts of each letter in the pile must match those in the combined names.\n2. **Intuition**: By comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names (guest + host) with the frequency of each letter in the pile, we can determine if the pile can be rearranged to form the names.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using a counter (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile allows for an efficient comparison. If the counters match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves processing each character in the three input strings. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of characters across all three strings, which is efficient given the constraints (each string length ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    if Counter(s1) + Counter(s2) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Counter Comparison**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in the guest's name (`s1`), host's name (`s2`), and the pile (`s3`). The counts from `s1` and `s2` are added together (since `Counter` addition combines counts).\n3. **Decision Making**: If the combined counts of letters from the guest and host match the counts from the pile, the output is \"YES\", indicating the pile can be rearranged to form the names. Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter counts between the combined names and the pile, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
