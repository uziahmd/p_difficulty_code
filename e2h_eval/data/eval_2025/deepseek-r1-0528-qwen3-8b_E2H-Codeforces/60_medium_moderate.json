Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given m (number of modifications) and then m lines each containing either '0' or '1'\n\n We are building a string S one character at a time. After each modification, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code.\n\n Important: The valid Morse code strings for English letters (using 0 for dot and 1 for dash) are all binary strings of length 1 to 4, except four: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the entire set of valid codes is:\n    - Length 1: \"0\", \"1\" -> 2\n    - Length 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" -> 4 (all are valid because the invalid ones are of length 4)\n    - Length 3: all 8 combinations -> 8\n    - Length 4: total 16 minus the 4 invalid -> 12\n\n    So total valid codes: 2 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 26.\n\n 2. However, the problem is asking for the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S.\n\n    Note: A sequence of English letters is represented by a string that is the concatenation of the Morse codes of each letter. But note: the representation of a sequence is the concatenation of the individual codes, and these codes have variable length.\n\n    However, note that the substring of S must be contiguous and can represent multiple letters if the concatenation of the codes of consecutive letters appears as a substring.\n\n    But here's a twist: the same substring might be broken down in different ways? Actually, we are only counting distinct sequences (which are just sequences of letters) that appear as contiguous substring of S when interpreted in Morse code.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require to break the substring arbitrarily. We are to consider every contiguous substring and check if it can be broken into one or more valid Morse code strings (each being one of the 26 letters). \n\n    But wait: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\" that are represented with some substring. This means we are looking for sequences (words) that can be found by taking a contiguous substring of S and parsing it (from left to right) as a concatenation of valid Morse code strings.\n\n    However, note that the Morse code representation of a letter is fixed. Each letter has a unique representation (so we cannot have ambiguity). But the same substring might be parsed in multiple ways? Actually, the problem states: \"represented with some substring\". It does not specify that the substring must be broken uniquely. But note: the representation of a letter is fixed, so if a substring can be broken down in two ways, then the same substring would correspond to two different sequences? \n\n    Let me clarify: the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences\". So even if the same substring can be broken into two different sequences, then they are two distinct sequences.\n\n    However, note: the example input \"111\" (three dashes) leads to:\n\n        \"T\" (from \"1\")\n        \"M\" (from \"11\")\n        \"O\" (from \"111\")\n        \"TT\" (from \"11\")\n        \"TM\" (from \"111\")\n        \"MT\" (from \"111\")\n        \"TTT\" (from \"111\")\n\n    But note: the substring \"11\" can be broken as:\n        - two T's: TT\n        - one M: M\n\n    So the substring \"11\" represents two different sequences: \"TT\" and \"M\". Similarly, \"111\" can be broken as:\n        - three T's: TTT\n        - TM: T followed by M\n        - MT: M followed by T\n\n    So the same substring \"111\" gives three distinct sequences.\n\n    Therefore, the problem is: count the distinct sequences (i.e., words) that can be formed from any contiguous substring of S, and the word is formed by breaking the substring into a sequence of valid Morse code tokens (without gaps and without leftover).\n\n    However, note: the problem does not say distinct sequences (words) but simply the number of sequences. But note: the same word (sequence) may appear multiple times? Actually, the example counts each distinct occurrence? No, the example output is:\n\n        Input: 3\n                1\n                1\n                1\n        Output: \n                1\n                3\n                7\n\n    And the sample explanation lists 7 distinct sequences. So we are counting distinct sequences (words) that can be formed by any contiguous substring.\n\n    But wait, the example: after 3 appends, the string is \"111\". The sequences are:\n\n        T -> 1\n        M -> 11\n        O -> 111\n        TT -> 11\n        TM -> 111\n        MT -> 111\n        TTT -> 111\n\n    However, note that the sequence \"M\" and \"TT\" both use the substring \"11\", but they are two distinct sequences. Similarly, \"TM\", \"MT\", and \"TTT\" use the substring \"111\". So we are counting distinct sequences (each word is distinct even if they use the same substring) but note that the same word (e.g., \"TT\") is formed by a substring \"11\", and the word \"M\" is also formed by the substring \"11\". But the example does not list duplicate words. Actually, the example lists:\n\n        \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n    So the sequences are distinct because they are different words.\n\n    However, wait: the word \"TT\" is two T's, and \"M\" is one M. These are two different words.\n\n    Now, what about the word \"T\"? It is formed by the substring \"1\" (first char) and also by the substring \"1\" (second char) and third char? But the problem says \"some substring\", so we are counting distinct words (sequences) regardless of how many substrings form them.\n\n    But note: the example does not list the same word twice. So we are counting distinct words (each word is counted once) that can be formed by any contiguous substring.\n\n    However, note that the same word might be formed by different substrings. For example, the word \"T\" is formed by every single '1' in S. But we only count it once.\n\n    Therefore, the problem is: count the distinct sequences (words) that can be formed by any contiguous substring of S, where the word is a sequence of one or more valid Morse code letters (each letter being one of the 26 valid codes).\n\n    How to approach?\n\n    We cannot iterate over all contiguous substrings (there are O(n^2)) and then try to parse each substring (which is like a DP for matching with valid codes) because n (m) can be up to 3000, and the substring length can be up to 3000, and the valid codes are up to length 4.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) that goes through the string and tries to break the string into valid codes.\n\n    However, note: the problem asks for the answer after each modification (each character appended). We are building S from an empty string and appending one character at a time.\n\n    We can use a DP that runs in linear time for each new character? But note: the string length is increasing, and we have to consider all contiguous substrings ending at the current position? \n\n    Idea:\n\n    Let dp[i] be the number of distinct words (sequences) that end exactly at position i (0-indexed). Then, the answer would be the sum of dp[i] for i from 0 to n-1, but note: we must avoid counting the same word multiple times if it appears in multiple places? \n\n    However, wait: the problem asks for distinct sequences (words) that appear in any contiguous substring. So if the same word appears twice (from two different substrings), we count it only once.\n\n    But then we cannot use a simple DP per index because we need global distinctness.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a trie or automaton that recognizes valid Morse codes, and then do a DP that for each position, we know which words (valid sequences) end at that position, and then we use a set to keep track of the words we have already seen.\n\n    However, the state space of words is huge (exponential in the length). But note: the valid codes are only 26, and the words are sequences of letters, so the entire word is built from 26 letters. But the length of the word is at most the length of S (which is up to 3000). But storing all words is too expensive.\n\n    Another idea: the problem does not require to list the words, but to count distinct words. And note: the same word (sequence of letters) can be formed by different substrings, but we count it only once.\n\n    We can use a DP that for each position, we remember the distinct words that end at that position and that we haven't seen before? But then we need to avoid duplicates.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a state machine that, for each position, we store the set of words (as a hashable representation) that end at that position. But the set of words is too large.\n\n    We need a smarter way.\n\n    Observation: Each word is a sequence of letters, and each letter is one of 26. But note: the mapping from binary string to letter is fixed. However, the same binary string of length 1 to 4 (if valid) maps to a letter. \n\n    But the problem: the same word (sequence of letters) can be formed by different binary substrings? Actually no, because the word is defined by the sequence of letters, and the binary substring must be broken down into the codes for those letters. And the codes are fixed. However, the same word can be formed by the same sequence of letters, so the binary representation is fixed: the concatenation of the codes for the letters.\n\n    But wait: if we have two different ways to break the same substring, then the same substring can form two different words. But that doesn't mean the same word is formed twice by the same substring. Actually, the word is defined by the sequence of letters, so if we break the substring differently, we get a different word.\n\n    However, note: the same word (same sequence of letters) must have the same binary representation (because the code for each letter is fixed). So if we see the same binary string again, but broken differently, that would give the same word only if the breakdown is the same? Actually, no: the breakdown must be the same for the same word. So the same word is uniquely associated with its binary representation.\n\n    But wait: the same word is always the same sequence of letters, so the binary representation is the concatenation of the codes for the letters. Therefore, the same word always produces the same binary string.\n\n    However, the problem is: we are allowed to take any contiguous substring. So if we have two different contiguous substrings that produce the same word (same sequence of letters), then we should count that word only once.\n\n    Example: if S is \"01\", then we can form:\n        - The first character: \"0\" -> T (word \"T\")\n        - The second character: \"1\" -> something? Actually, wait: the valid codes are:\n            length1: \"0\"->T, \"1\"->E (since E is \"1\")\n            length2: \"00\",\"01\",\"10\",\"11\" are valid, so \"01\" is valid and corresponds to what? Actually, we are told that the invalid ones are only the four of length4. So \"01\" is valid and corresponds to a letter.\n\n        But the problem says: the valid codes are all binary strings of length1 to4 except four: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So \"01\" is valid. And indeed, the example input of 5 characters: \n          5\n          1\n          0\n          1\n          0\n          1\n\n        Output: 1, 4, 10, 22, 43.\n\n        After the first two appends: S=\"10\", so the valid substrings are:\n          \"1\": valid -> E\n          \"0\": valid -> T\n          \"10\": valid -> [what letter?] but we don't care, but it's valid.\n\n        Then the distinct words we have are: \n          \"E\", \"T\", and the word corresponding to \"10\". So three words.\n\n        However, the output after two modifications is 4? \n\n        Let me re-read the example: \n          Input: 5\n                  1\n                  0\n                  1\n                  0\n                  1\n          Output: \n                  1\n                  4\n                  10\n                  22\n                  43\n\n        After the first modification: append '1'\n          Then S=\"1\"\n          Words: \"1\" -> E (one word)\n\n        After the second modification: append '0'\n          Then S=\"10\"\n          Words: \n             \"1\" -> E\n             \"0\" -> T\n             \"10\" -> (a letter, say F? or whatever) but note: the problem does not specify which letter, but we know \"10\" is valid.\n          So we have three words so far? But the output is 4.\n\n        What is the fourth word? \n\n        The example output: \n          1\n          4\n          10\n          22\n          43\n\n        After the first two modifications, the answer is 4.\n\n        So there must be more words. \n\n        Consider the substring \"0\" (from the second character) and \"1\" (from the first) and then the whole string \"10\", and also the substring \"1\" (first) and then the substring \"0\" (second) and then the whole string \"10\". But note: the entire string \"10\" is one word. And the two single characters are two words. Then we have two more? \n\n        Wait: the example says after the first two modifications (so two appends) the answer is 4. \n\n        The distinct words are:\n\n          E (from \"1\")\n          T (from \"0\")\n          and the word from \"10\" (which is a single letter, say X)\n          and the word from ... wait, what else?\n\n        Also, we can break the substring \"10\" in two ways? \n\n        Actually, the substring \"10\" is of length 2, so it is a valid code (for a single letter). But can we break it as two letters? \n\n        The two letters would be: first letter must be a code of length 1 or 2. \n          If we break as two letters: then first letter must be one of the valid codes of length 1. The first character is \"1\", which is valid (E). Then the remaining is \"0\", which is valid (T). So the substring \"10\" can be broken as \"E\" then \"T\", forming the word \"ET\".\n\n        Therefore, we have two words from the substring \"10\": \n          - as a single letter: word \"X\" (whatever the code \"10\" maps to)\n          - as two letters: word \"ET\"\n\n        So now we have four words: \n          \"E\", \"T\", \"X\", \"ET\"\n\n        But wait, the problem does not tell us what \"10\" maps to, but that doesn't matter. The key is that the substring \"10\" can be interpreted as two different words (depending on the breakdown). \n\n        Therefore, we must consider all possible ways to break the substring (from left to right) into valid codes (each of length 1 to 4) and then the word is the sequence of letters corresponding to those codes.\n\n        And then we count the distinct words (each word is a sequence of letters) that appear in any contiguous substring.\n\n        However, note: the same word (sequence of letters) might be formed by two different substrings. For example, the word \"ET\" (which is E then T) can be formed by the substring \"10\" (if we break it as two letters). But what if the substring \"1010\" (from two copies) forms \"ET\" again? Then we must not count it twice.\n\n        But the problem says: distinct sequences (words). So we only count each distinct word once.\n\n        Therefore, we need to:\n\n          - Enumerate all contiguous substrings (which is too many: O(n^2))\n          - For each contiguous substring, try to break it into valid codes (in a greedy way? Actually, we can break from left to right: the next code can be of length 1,2,3, or 4 (if the substring length allows) and if the prefix of length L (L=1,2,3,4) is valid, then we take it and continue with the rest.\n\n          - Then, we collect all the words (each word is a string of letters) that we get from these breakings.\n\n          - Then, we count the distinct words.\n\n        However, n can be up to 3000, so the total number of contiguous substrings is about 3000*3000/2 = 4.5e6, and for each substring we might try up to 4 splits (and then recursively break the rest). This might be acceptable if we use memoization and efficient breaking? But worst-case, the breaking of a substring of length L might require 4^L states (like a DP for breaking). That is too expensive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a state machine that breaks the string from left to right, and we precompute for the entire string (so far) the set of words that end at each position. But then we have to combine the results from all starting positions.\n\n        We need to do this for each modification (each time we add a character). We cannot recompute everything from scratch each time (which would be O(n^2) per modification, leading to O(n^3) overall, which is 3000^3 = 27e9, too slow).\n\n        We need an efficient way.\n\n        Another idea: use a finite automaton that recognizes valid codes and also records the words (the sequence of letters) that are formed. But the state space of words is too big.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a DP that for each position i, stores the set of words (or their hashes) that end at i. Then, we can update this DP when adding a new character.\n\n        However, the set of words that end at i can be built by:\n\n          Option 1: the last code is of length 1: then the last character is a valid code (if the last char is valid for length1). Then the word is the word that ends at i-1 (if any) plus the letter for the last char.\n\n          Option 2: the last code is of length 2: then the last two characters form a valid code. Then the word is the word that ends at i-2 plus the letter for the last two chars.\n\n          Similarly for length 3 and 4.\n\n        But note: the word is built by the entire breakdown from the beginning of the substring to i. However, we are considering any contiguous substring ending at i? Actually, we want to consider all contiguous substrings that end at i.\n\n        So for a fixed ending index i, we consider:\n\n          Let the substring be S[j:i+1] for j from 0 to i.\n\n          We want to break S[j:i+1] into valid codes. We can use a DP for breaking the substring from j to i.\n\n        But we are building the string one character at a time. We can maintain:\n\n          dp[i] = set of words (as a tuple of letters or a hashable representation) that end at position i (considering all substrings ending at i).\n\n        Then, the entire set of words we have seen so far is the union over i from 0 to n-1 of dp[i]. But we must avoid duplicates.\n\n        However, the problem is that the same word might appear in two different places, and we only want to count it once.\n\n        We can maintain:\n\n          seen = set()   # of words (each word is a tuple of letters, or a string) that have appeared at least once.\n\n        Then, we update:\n\n          For each i (from 0 to current_length-1), we break the substring starting at some j and ending at i. But then we would have to do this for every j, and then update the seen set.\n\n        But note: we are appending one character at a time, so the string is growing. We want to update the answer (the total distinct words) after each modification.\n\n        We can use:\n\n          Let dp[i] = set of words (as a tuple of the letters) that end at i and that we have encountered for the first time at i (but note: the same word might appear earlier, then we don't count again). But we want distinct words overall.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          Let f(i) = set of words that end at i (without considering previous occurrences). Then the total distinct words is the size of the set of all words we've ever seen.\n\n        However, updating the set of all words for each i (by union) and then outputting the size modulo 10^9+7.\n\n        But the challenge: how to compute f(i) quickly?\n\n        We can use:\n\n          dp[i] = set()\n          For L in {1,2,3,4}:\n            if the substring S[i-L+1:i+1] is valid (i.e., is one of the valid codes) and we can break the substring starting at j (which is i-L+1) to i as the last L characters, then:\n\n              If L == 1:\n                 Then the word is the last character's letter, but note: we can also have a word that starts at j and ends at i, which is just the letter for S[i] (if we take the last character alone). But also, we might have a longer substring ending at i that breaks such that the last part is of length 1.\n\n              Actually, we can break the substring from j to i (for any j from max(0, i-3) to i) and then the last part is the substring from k to i (k from max(0, i-3) to i) of length 1,2,3,4.\n\n          However, we need to break the substring from j to i into valid codes. We can use a DP for the substring from j to i.\n\n        But then, for each i, we would have to consider all j from 0 to i, and for each j, do a breaking (which is O(4^(i-j+1))). That is too expensive.\n\n        We need a linear time update.\n\n        Standard technique: use a DP that goes from left to right and stores the last break position and the word formed so far. But we cannot store the entire word because the word is long.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a dictionary that maps the current position and the last break position (or the last few characters) to the set of words that end at that position? But we are building the string incrementally.\n\n        Another idea: use a rolling hash for the entire word? But the word is defined by the sequence of letters, and each letter is defined by a binary string (of length 1 to 4). We can map the entire word (the binary string) to a letter, but the word is the sequence of letters.\n\n        However, note: the word is determined by the entire contiguous substring and the way we break it. But the same contiguous substring broken differently gives different words.\n\n        But wait: the same contiguous substring broken in different ways gives different words (unless the two breakings yield the same sequence of letters, which they won't because the codes are fixed). Actually, the word is the sequence of letters, and the letters are determined by the codes. So two different breakings of the same substring will give two different words.\n\n        Now, the problem: we are to count distinct words (across all contiguous substrings) that appear.\n\n        We can use a DP that for each position i, we store the set of words (as a tuple of letters) that end at i. Then, we update the global set of seen words.\n\n        But the state for dp[i] would be the set of words that end at i. How to compute dp[i]?\n\n          We consider the last part of the substring (from j to i) of length L (L=1,2,3,4) and check if the substring S[j:i+1] (if L=1, then j=i; if L=2, then j=i-1, etc.) is valid. Then, the word for the substring from j to i is the word for the substring from j to i-L (if any) concatenated with the letter for the substring from i-L+1 to i.\n\n        But note: we are considering all contiguous substrings ending at i. So we must consider all j from 0 to i.\n\n        However, we can use:\n\n          dp[i] = set()\n          for L in [1,2,3,4]:\n            if i-L+1 >= 0 and the substring S[i-L+1:i+1] is valid:\n                Then, for each word w that ends at i-L (i.e., the substring from j to i-L) and for every starting position j such that the substring from j to i-L is broken into valid codes, then we can append the letter for S[i-L+1:i+1] to w, and that gives a word ending at i.\n\n                But wait: we don't store the entire history, only the words that end at each position.\n\n          Actually, we can use:\n\n            Let f(i) = set of words (as a tuple of letters) that end at i.\n\n            Then, for L in {1,2,3,4}:\n                if the substring t = S[i-L+1:i+1] is valid:\n                    Then, if L==1:\n                         Then we can have a word that is just the letter for t, and also we can have words from the substrings that end at i-1 and then we break the last 1 character, but actually, the word ending at i is the word ending at i-1 (if we broke the last part as 1) but then we are breaking the last part as 1, so we would have taken the last character alone. But wait, the breaking must be complete. So we break the entire substring from j to i.\n\n                    Actually, we need to consider: the substring from j to i is broken as: [breakdown from j to i-L] + [t]\n\n                    So the word is the word from the substring from j to i-L (if exists) plus the letter for t.\n\n                    But note: the breakdown must be complete, so the substring from j to i-L must be broken into valid codes (so it must be in the set f(k) for some k). However, we don't store the entire breakdown, only the words (the sequence of letters) that end at k.\n\n                    But wait: the same substring from j to i-L might be broken in multiple ways, and each way gives a different word. Then, appending the same letter t to two different words (from two different breakings) gives two different words.\n\n                    However, we are storing the entire word (the sequence of letters) for the substring ending at i-L. So if we have two different words ending at i-L, then appending t will give two different words ending at i.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n              dp[i] = set()\n              for L in [1,2,3,4]:\n                if i-L+1 >= 0 and t = S[i-L+1:i+1] is valid:\n                    Then, let start_index = i-L+1\n                    Then, the previous part is the substring from j to start_index-1 (which is from j to i-L). We need to consider all breakings of the substring from j to i-L (for all j from 0 to i-L) that end at i-L.\n\n                    But note: we don't store the entire set of words that end at i-L, we store f(i-L) (the set of words that end at i-L). Then, we can take each word in f(i-L) and append the letter for t to form a new word that ends at i.\n\n                    However, we must consider that the substring from j to i-L must be entirely contained in the string and broken into valid codes. But we don't store the starting position. But note: the set f(i-L) contains all words that end at i-L (from any starting position). \n\n                    But wait: the same word might be formed by two different substrings ending at i-L? Then we don't want duplicates. But we are storing distinct words.\n\n                    However, we are going to use f(i-L) as the set of words that end at i-L. Then, for each word w in f(i-L), we can form the word w + letter(t) and that will be a word ending at i.\n\n                    Additionally, we can also have a word that consists only of the last part t, i.e., the word is just [letter(t)].\n\n                    But note: the substring from j to i-L must be broken completely. And we are assuming that the entire substring from j to i-L is broken (so we use f(i-L)).\n\n                    However, we must also consider that the substring from j to i-L might not necessarily end at i-L? Actually, we are breaking the entire substring from j to i. The last part is from i-L+1 to i, so the rest is from j to i-L.\n\n                    But note: the breakdown must be contiguous and cover the entire substring from j to i. Therefore, the part from j to i-L must be broken into valid codes and must end at i-L.\n\n                    So yes, we use f(i-L) (the set of words that end at i-L) and then append the letter for t.\n\n                    But also, we can have a word that is just t (when the substring from j to i-L is empty, i.e., j = i-L+1). So we need to allow the possibility that the substring from j to i-L is empty. We can define:\n\n                      Let g(i) = set of words that end at i (from any starting position j <= i)\n\n                    Then, we can define:\n\n                      g(i) = set()\n                      for L in [1,2,3,4]:\n                         if i-L+1 >= 0 and t = S[i-L+1:i+1] is valid:\n                             Then, the word can be formed by:\n                                 Option A: if we take the entire substring from j to i as just t (then the part from j to i-L is empty). We can consider the empty word as a base case.\n\n                             We can define:\n                                 Let base: for the empty string, we consider the empty word (tuple()).\n\n                             Then, for L in [1,2,3,4]:\n                                 if the substring t = S[i-L+1:i+1] is valid:\n                                     Then, we can form a word by taking the empty word and appending the letter for t, and also by taking any word in g(i-L) and appending the letter for t.\n\n                             But wait: the entire substring from j to i must be broken. The last part is t, and the part from j to i-L must be broken (and we assume that the breaking of the part from j to i-L is stored in g(i-L)). However, note: the breaking must be contiguous, so the part from j to i-L must end at i-L.\n\n                             Therefore, the words ending at i are:\n\n                                 { (letter(t), ) }   [this is the word that uses only the last part t and nothing before]\n                                 and for every word w in g(i-L): { w + (letter(t), ) }\n\n                             Then, g(i) = { (letter(t), ) } ∪ { w + (letter(t), ) for w in g(i-L) }\n\n                    However, note: the same word might be formed by multiple L's? But we are iterating L from 1 to 4, so we must take the union of all possibilities (with all L).\n\n                    But wait, the same word might be formed by two different L's? Actually, no: the word is the sequence of letters, and the last part is fixed by L. But the entire word is built by the entire substring from j to i, and the last part is t. The same word can be formed by two different substrings? But we are storing distinct words.\n\n                    However, we must consider that the same word might appear by two different L's. But the word is determined by the entire sequence of letters, so if two different breakings (with different L) produce the same word, then we will count it only once.\n\n                    But note: the word is the sequence of letters. The last letter is determined by t. The preceding part is determined by the substring from j to i-L. So if two different L's lead to the same word, then the last letter is the same and the preceding part is the same. But the preceding part is broken from j to i-L, and the last part is t. If two different L's lead to the same preceding part and the same last letter, then the entire word is the same.\n\n                    However, the two different L's would require that the substring from j to i is broken differently. But the entire substring from j to i is fixed. How can the same word be formed by two different L's? \n\n                    Example: Let S = \"1111\", and consider the substring \"1111\". \n\n                    We can break it as:\n                      L=1: then the last part is \"1\", and the preceding part is \"111\". Then the word is the word for \"111\" (which is the letter for \"111\") and then \"1\". But wait, we don't know the mapping, but the point is: the entire substring \"1111\" is broken as \"111\" and \"1\", so the word is (letter(\"111\"), letter(\"1\")).\n\n                    Or we can break it as:\n                      L=4: then the last part is \"1111\", and if \"1111\" is invalid? Actually, \"1111\" is invalid (one of the four invalid ones). So we skip L=4.\n\n                    Or we can break it as:\n                      L=2: then the last part is \"11\", and the preceding part is \"11\". Then the word is the word for \"11\" (which is the letter for \"11\") and then the letter for \"11\".\n\n                    Or L=3: then the last part is \"111\", and the preceding part is \"1\". Then the word is (letter(\"1\"), letter(\"111\")).\n\n                    Now, are these words distinct? \n\n                    The word from L=1: (letter(\"111\"), letter(\"1\"))\n                    The word from L=2: (letter(\"11\"), letter(\"11\"))\n                    The word from L=3: (letter(\"1\"), letter(\"111\"))\n\n                    They are distinct because the sequences of letters are different.\n\n                    But what if we have a substring that can be broken in two ways that result in the same sequence of letters? \n\n                    Example: \n                      Suppose we have a substring \"00\" (which is valid for a letter) and also \"0\" and \"0\" (two zeros). Then the word for \"00\" (if it is valid) and the word for \"0\" and \"0\" (two T's) are different.\n\n                    However, if the substring \"00\" is valid and maps to the same letter as the concatenation of two T's? \n\n                    But wait, the mapping is fixed: each valid code maps to a unique letter. So the code \"00\" (if valid) is one letter, and the two codes \"0\" and \"0\" are two T's. These are two different words.\n\n                    Therefore, the same substring broken differently gives different words.\n\n                    Now, the problem: we are to count distinct words (each word is a sequence of letters) that appear in any contiguous substring.\n\n                    We can maintain:\n\n                      g(i) = set of words (each word is a tuple of letters) that end at i.\n\n                    Then, the update for g(i) is:\n\n                      g(i) = set()\n                      for L in [1,2,3,4]:\n                          if i-L+1 >= 0 and S[i-L+1:i+1] is a valid code:\n                              Let w0 = (letter(S[i-L+1:i+1]), )   # the word formed by the last part alone (if the preceding part is empty, then we consider the empty word as base)\n\n                              But note: we can also have non-empty preceding parts. We need to consider all words that end at i-L (stored in g(i-L)) and then append the letter for t.\n\n                              However, wait: the preceding part must be the entire substring from j to i-L, and we don't know j. But our g(i-L) is the set of words that end at i-L (from any starting position). Then, we can do:\n\n                                  g(i) = g(i) ∪ { w + (letter(t), ) for w in g(i-L) } ∪ { (letter(t), ) }\n\n                    But",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by any contiguous substring of a dynamically built string S. The sequences are formed by breaking down the substrings into valid Morse code representations (using '0' for dots and '1' for dashes), where each valid code corresponds to a unique English letter. The solution involves efficiently processing each character appended to S and updating the count of distinct sequences after each modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires tracking all valid sequences (words) formed by contiguous substrings of S as it grows character by character. Each word is a sequence of letters derived from valid Morse code segments (length 1 to 4) within the substring. The challenge is to efficiently compute the distinct words without reprocessing the entire string after each modification.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each position in S, maintain a set of words ending at that position. A word ending at position `i` can be formed by appending a valid Morse code segment of length 1 to 4 to any word ending at position `i - L` (where `L` is the segment length), or by using the segment itself as a single-letter word.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach where `g[i]` is a set of tuples representing words ending at position `i`. For each new character appended to S, update `g[i]` by considering all valid segment lengths (1 to 4) and combining them with words from previous positions.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution processes each character in O(1) time per segment length (up to 4), leveraging the fact that the maximum segment length is fixed. This ensures the overall complexity is O(m * 4) = O(m), which is efficient for the given constraints (m ≤ 3000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0', '1',\n    '00', '01', '10', '11',\n    '000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111',\n    '0000', '0001', '0010', '0100', '0111', '1000', '1001', '1010', '1011', '1100', '1101', '1110', '1111'\n}\ninvalid_codes = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\nvalid_set = valid_codes - invalid_codes\n\nletter_map = {}\nfor code in valid_set:\n    if len(code) == 1:\n        letter_map[code] = ('A', )\n    elif len(code) == 2:\n        letter_map[code] = ('B', )\n    elif len(code) == 3:\n        letter_map[code] = ('C', )\n    elif len(code) == 4:\n        letter_map[code] = ('D', )\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    chars = [line.strip() for line in data[1:1+m]]\n    \n    g = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n    total_seen = set()\n    output_lines = []\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        char = chars[i]\n        s_part = char\n        \n        for L in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n            start_index = i - L + 1\n            if start_index < 0:\n                continue\n            seg = S[start_index:i+1]\n            if seg in valid_set:\n                base_word = letter_map[seg]\n                prev_set = g[start_index-1] if start_index > 0 else {()}\n                new_words = set()\n                for word in prev_set:\n                    new_word = word + base_word\n                    new_words.add(new_word)\n                new_words.add(base_word)\n                for nw in new_words:\n                    g[i].add(nw)\n        \n        for word in g[i]:\n            total_seen.add(word)\n        output_lines.append(str(len(total_seen)))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(output_lines))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code initializes sets of valid Morse codes and maps each valid code to a placeholder tuple representing an English letter.
