For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. The notes are in a circular list of 12 notes.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11). Let the base notes be: \n    ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] \n    But wait: the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically and the example includes H (which is sometimes called B). \n    However, the example input has \"A B H\", so we have two B's? Actually, the problem says the notes are: \n    C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    So there are 12 distinct notes. We can map them as:\n\n    index: 0: C, 1: C#, 2: D, 3: D#, 4: E, 5: F, 6: F#, 7: G, 8: G#, 9: A, 10: B, 11: H.\n\n    Wait, but the example input \"C# B F\" includes B and H? Actually, the example input is given as \"C# B F\", and then they say they order as \"B C# F\".\n\n    However, note that in the example, the chord \"C# B F\" is minor. When ordering, they use \"B\", then \"C#\", then \"F\". \n\n    But wait: what is the note after B? According to the problem, after H comes C. But note: our list has B at index 10 and H at index 11.\n\n    So we must consider the circle: from B (index10) to H (index11) and then to C (index0). \n\n    However, in the example, they order the chord as \"B\", \"C#\", \"F\". \n\n    How do we handle the circularity?\n\n    We can map the notes to numbers and then adjust for circularity.\n\n    Steps for mapping:\n\n    Let note_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n    Then, for each note, we can find its index in note_list.\n\n    Then, we have three indices: a, b, c.\n\n    We need to check all cyclic permutations of the three notes (since the chord is unordered). We are allowed to arrange the notes in any order (as long as we traverse the circle).\n\n    Conditions for major: there exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n        distance(x, y) = 4 semitones\n        distance(y, z) = 3 semitones\n\n    Conditions for minor: there exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n        distance(x, y) = 3 semitones\n        distance(y, z) = 4 semitones\n\n    Note: the distance between two notes is defined as the smallest number of semitones going forward (from lower to higher). But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't take the backward distance? Actually, the example says the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (which is the forward way: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C, which is 8 semitones). However, when we are arranging the chord, we are to order the notes along the musical scale (so in increasing order) and then compute the distances.\n\n    But wait: the example says the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. However, when we are forming the chord, we are allowed to wrap around? Actually, the chord is an unordered set, but the condition requires an ordering (so we can reorder the notes arbitrarily). \n\n    However, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n    This ordering is along the musical scale (cyclically). So we are effectively looking for a cyclic order.\n\n    How to compute the distance between two notes in the circle?\n\n    Given two notes with indices i and j (in the 0-11 range), the forward distance (without wrapping) from i to j is:\n        if j >= i: j - i\n        else: 12 + j - i   [because we go from i to the end and then from 0 to j]\n\n    But wait, the problem says the distance from E",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible cyclic orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to an index in a predefined list of 12 musical notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H). This mapping allows us to handle the circular nature of musical notes where after H comes C again.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the smallest number of semitones moving forward in the circular list. This involves computing the difference between their indices, adjusting for cases where the second note's index is smaller than the first by adding 12 (the total number of notes).\n3. **Checking Chord Types**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if they can be ordered such that:\n   - **Major Chord**: The first interval is 4 semitones and the second is 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor Chord**: The first interval is 3 semitones and the second is 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    input_str = input().split()\n    \n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n    \n    a, b, c = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_str]\n    \n    def dist(x, y):\n        return (y - x) % 12\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for x, y, z in [(a, b, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b)]:\n        d1 = dist(x, y)\n        d2 = dist(y, z)\n        d3 = dist(z, x)\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and d3 == 9:\n            found_major = True\n        \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4 and d3 == 9:\n            found_minor = True\n    \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by mapping each musical note to its corresponding index in a list of 12 notes. This helps in converting the problem into a numerical one where distances can be easily calculated.\n2. **Distance Function**: The `dist` function calculates the shortest distance between two notes in the circular list. It uses modulo arithmetic to handle the wrap-around from H back to C.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code checks all three possible cyclic permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, it calculates the distances between consecutive notes.\n4. **Chord Classification**: Based on the distances, the code checks if the permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor chord. If a major chord is found, it prints \"major\"; if a minor chord is found, it prints \"minor\"; otherwise, it prints \"strange\".\n5. **Output**: The result is printed based on the checks performed on all permutations of the input notes.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the input notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes.",
