Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Each hour, Vasily uses one candle (either initially or made from burned ones) to light up the room for an hour.\n   - After burning, the candle becomes a burned candle (so we have one more burned candle).\n   - Also, from every 'b' burned candles, we can create one new candle.\n\n Steps:\n   Let's denote:\n     total_hours = 0\n     current_candles = a\n     current_recycled = 0   # this will track the number of burned candles we have\n\n   However, note that the process can be thought of as:\n\n   Initially, we have 'a' new candles. We use them and they become burned. Then we can recycle the burned ones.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   total_candles_used = 0\n   current = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   While current > 0:\n      Use all current candles (each gives one hour) -> so add current to total_candles_used (or total_hours)\n      Now, these current candles become burned, so burned += current\n      Then, we can convert some burned candles into new ones: new_candles = burned // b\n      And then update burned = burned % b\n      Then set current = new_candles\n\n   But note: the problem is that when we use the current candles, we are effectively using them and then they become burned.\n\n   However, let me think with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n   Step 1: current = 4, burned = 0.\n      Use 4 candles -> hours = 4, then burned becomes 4.\n      Then we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and remaining burned = 0.\n      Then current becomes 2.\n\n   Step 2: current = 2, burned = 0 (from the remainder) but wait, we just set burned to 0 from the previous step? Actually, in the first step after burning we set burned = 4 % 2 = 0, then we make 2 new candles.\n\n   Then Step 2: use 2 candles -> hours becomes 6, then burned becomes 2 (from these 2). Then we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and burned becomes 0.\n\n   Step 3: current = 1, use 1 candle -> hours becomes 7, then burned becomes 1. Then 1//2 = 0, so we stop.\n\n   So total_hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n   But note: the example output is 7.\n\n   However, note that the recycling process happens at the end of each batch of candles. The above simulation does exactly that.\n\n   But wait, what if we don't have to wait until we finish the current candles to recycle? Actually, the problem states that we can only make a new candle from 'b' burned ones, and we do that after the current batch is used.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n   total = a\n   while a >= b:\n        recycled = a // b\n        remainder = a % b\n        total += recycled\n        a = recycled + remainder\n\n   But wait, is that correct?\n\n   Let me test with (4,2):\n        a = 4, b=2\n        recycled = 4//2 = 2, remainder = 0\n        total = 4+2 = 6\n        then a = 2+0 = 2\n\n        Then a=2, which is >=2:\n            recycled = 2//2=1, remainder=0\n            total = 6+1=7\n            a=1 -> stops.\n\n   That gives 7.\n\n   Another example: (6,3)\n        a=6, b=3\n        recycled = 6//3=2, remainder=0\n        total=6+2=8\n        a=2 -> 2<3, so stop.\n\n        Output 8.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait, why is the above method working? Because each time we use the current candles (which are 'a'), then we get 'a' burned candles. Then we make as many new candles as possible from the burned ones (which is a//b), and the leftover burned candles are a % b. Then we set a to the number of new candles plus the leftover burned candles (because we can use those leftovers again later).\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Read a and b from input.\n\n   total = a\n   current = a\n   while current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        total += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + remainder\n        # Then we continue until current < b\n\n   Print total.\n\n   However, note: the initial 'a' is used without any burned candles initially, but the process of using a candle and then recycling the burned ones is captured by the loop.\n\n   But wait, in the first iteration, we use the initial 'a' candles (which gives a hours) and then we get a burned candles, which we convert to new ones. Then we use the new ones and so on.\n\n   However, there's a nuance: the above method does not explicitly account for the fact that the burned candles from the initial set are used to form the next set. But note that in the first step, we are adding the recycled candles (new_candles) to the total hours. Then we set current to the number of candles we have for the next round (which are the recycled ones plus the remainder). Then we use those in the next round.\n\n   But wait, actually the above code doesn't account for the fact that the initial 'a' candles are already used. Then the loop condition is on the current value (which starts as a) being at least b. Then we break when current < b, meaning that we can't form a new candle from the current stock (current being the available candles, which are either new or from recycling).\n\n   However, note that in the example, the initial 'a' is 4, and we enter the loop because 4>=2. Then we add 2 (recycled from 4) to total (which was 4) making 6. Then current becomes 2 (from 4//2=2, and remainder 0). Then we check 2>=2 -> yes, so we do another iteration: add 2//2=1, so total becomes 7, and current becomes 1. Then 1<2 -> break.\n\n   But wait, is the initial 4 already accounted for? Yes, because we started with total = a (which is 4). Then the loop adds the recycled ones.\n\n   But note: the first use of the initial 4 candles is accounted for by the initial total = a, and then we are only adding the candles we get from recycling. This is correct.\n\n   However, consider the process: \n        We use 4 candles (first 4 hours) -> then we get 4 burned, which makes 2 new candles (to be used for 2 more hours) -> then we get 2 burned, which makes 1 new candle (for 1 more hour) -> total 7.\n\n   So the total hours are 4 (from initial) + 2 (from first recycling) + 1 (from second recycling) = 7.\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n   total = a\n   current = a\n   while current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        total += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + remainder\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let me test with edge cases.\n\n   Case 1: a=1, b=2 -> then we don't enter the loop. Output 1. Correct.\n\n   Case 2: a=10, b=5 -> \n        total=10\n        current=10 -> 10//5=2, remainder=0 -> total=12, current=2 -> stop. Output 12.\n\n   How?\n        First 10 hours from initial 10.\n        Then from 10 burned, we make 2 new candles (which give 2 more hours) -> total 12.\n        Then from 2 burned (from the 2 candles we just used) we cannot make a new one (since 2<5) -> so stop.\n\n   But wait, actually after the first 10 hours, we have 10 burned candles. Then we make 2 new candles. Then we use those 2 for 2 hours, so total 12. Then we have 2 burned from the last 2 candles. Then we try to make a new candle: 2//5=0, so we stop.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that we can make b went out candles into a new candle. So when we have 10 burned, we can make 2 new candles (because 10 / 5 = 2). Then when we use those 2, we get 2 burned, which is not enough to make a new one.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, there's a more efficient way to compute this without a loop? We could use a formula, but the constraints are small (a and b between 1 and 1000) so the loop won't run too many times.\n\n   However, let me see: the worst-case scenario is when b is 2, then we keep recycling until current becomes 1. The number of iterations would be logarithmic base 2 of a, which for a=1000 is about 10 iterations. So safe.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read input, then use the while loop.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as two integers in a single line.\n\n   Example input format: \"4 2\" or \"6 3\"\n\n   We'll read the input and split.\n\n   Code:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   if not data:\n        # but the problem says two integers, so we assume there are two\n        pass\n   else:\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The single line contains two integers\", so we can rely on that.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is:\n\n   Input: ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n   But in the problem statement, it says \"The single line contains two integers\", meaning one line with two numbers.\n\n   In competitive programming, we read from stdin. The input is one line.\n\n   So:\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n   Then the rest.\n\n   However, the example input is shown as a list of strings, but in the actual input, it's one line.\n\n   So I'll write:\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n   Then the code.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n   total = a\n   current = a\n   while current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        total += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + remainder\n\n   print(total)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. From every `b` burned candles, Vasily can create a new candle, which can then be used again. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` initial candles and set `total_hours` to `a` because each initial candle provides one hour of light.\n2. **Recycling Process**: While there are enough burned candles (i.e., `current_candles >= b`), convert them into new candles. The number of new candles is given by `current_candles // b`, and any remaining burned candles after conversion are stored as `current_candles % b`.\n3. **Update Total Hours**: For each iteration, add the number of new candles created to `total_hours` since each new candle provides an additional hour of light.\n4. **Update Current Candles**: Set `current_candles` to the sum of the new candles created and any remaining burned candles from the previous step.\n5. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when there are not enough burned candles to form a new candle (`current_candles < b`).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning candles and recycling the burned ones until no more new candles can be made, ensuring optimal use of available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = a\n    current = a\n    while current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        total += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + remainder\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to create a new one).\n2. **Initial Setup**: The initial total hours is set to `a` because each initial candle provides one hour of light.\n3. **Loop for Recycling**: The loop continues as long as there are enough burned candles (`current`) to create at least one new candle (`current >= b`). In each iteration:\n   - **Calculate New Candles**: The number of new candles is the integer division of `current` by `b`.\n   - **Remaining Burned Candles**: The remainder from the division gives the number of burned candles left after creating new ones.\n   - **Update Total Hours**: The total hours increase by the number of new candles created.\n   - **Update Current Candles**: The current number of candles is updated to the sum of new candles and remaining burned candles.\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, the total hours, which now includes all initial and recycled candles, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
