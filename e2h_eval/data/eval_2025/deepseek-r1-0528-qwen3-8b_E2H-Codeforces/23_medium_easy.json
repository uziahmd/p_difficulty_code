In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, s).\n We have to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu (which can be a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that initially there are 3 tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (each one we can choose arbitrarily) and we want the minimum draws to form at least one mentsu.\n\n Cases to consider:\n\n Case 0: Already has a mentsu -> then answer 0.\n\n How to check for existing mentsu?\n   - Check for koutsu: three identical tiles? (same digit and same suit)\n   - Check for shuntsu: three consecutive digits (in increasing order, but note: [5s,7s,6s] is valid so sorted must be consecutive) and same suit.\n\n But note: the hand has exactly three tiles. So if they form a koutsu, that's one mentsu. Similarly, if they form a shuntsu, that's one mentsu.\n\n However, what about having two pairs? Actually, with three tiles, we can only form a mentsu if:\n   Option 1: Three identical -> koutsu.\n   Option 2: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit -> shuntsu.\n\n But note: the example [5p,4p,6p] is a shuntsu (when sorted: [4,5,6]). Also, [9m,1m,2m] is not valid because after sorting [1,2,9] is not consecutive.\n\n However, wait: the problem says that [5s,7s,6s] is valid. So we can sort the three numbers and check if they form consecutive numbers.\n\n But note: the hand might have more than three tiles after drawing, but initially we have three. We are allowed to draw extra tiles arbitrarily (and we can choose which ones). The goal is to get at least one mentsu (three tiles that form either a triplet or a sequence) from the entire set (which will be the original three plus the drawn ones). However, note that we don't need to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu (three tiles) in the hand.\n\n However, the problem says: \"minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win\", meaning that we must have at least one mentsu (a set of three tiles) in the entire hand.\n\n But note: we start with three tiles. We can draw up to n tiles (n being the answer) and then from the total hand (3+n) we can pick three to form a mentsu.\n\n Since we can choose arbitrarily which tiles to draw, we can also choose to complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n However, note that the hand might be used for multiple melds, but the problem only requires at least one mentsu.\n\n Let me re-read: \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". So we only need one.\n\n Since we can draw any tile (any number of times, as many as needed), we can consider:\n\n Possibility 0: 0 draws -> already have a mentsu.\n\n Possibility 1: 1 draw -> we add one tile, then we have four tiles. Then we can check if there is a mentsu (any three tiles) in these four.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose the tile to draw arbitrarily. So we can try to complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n However, the problem is asking the minimum number of draws.\n\n We have to consider:\n\n 0 draws: check if the three tiles form a mentsu.\n\n 1 draw: can we form a mentsu by drawing one tile?\n\n 2 draws: can we form a mentsu by drawing two tiles?\n\n 3 draws: sometimes even three draws might be required? Actually, note that with three tiles, if we draw three more, then we have six tiles. But we only need three for a mentsu. However, we are allowed to choose arbitrarily, so we can always form a triplet by drawing two more copies of the same tile (if we have one or two of a kind) or for a sequence we might need to complete a run.\n\n However, note: the problem doesn't require to use the existing tiles necessarily. But we are starting with three, and we can only draw, so we cannot remove. We must use the existing tiles and the drawn ones.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"she can draw any tiles she wants\", including those already in her hand.\n\n However, we are looking for the minimum number of draws.\n\n Let me break down:\n\n Step 1: Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu.\n\n Step 2: If not, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n\n Step 3: If not, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n Step 4: Otherwise, we need three draws? Actually, let's think:\n\n Example: ['1m', '1m', '2m'] -> we have two 1m and one 2m. \n   To form a koutsu: we need three 1m, so we need to draw two 1m -> that would be two draws.\n   To form a shuntsu: we have 1,1,2. We can form a shuntsu [1,2,3] by drawing one 3m. But wait, we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we can use one 1m and the 2m and the 3m to form [1,2,3]. So one draw.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any three tiles. In this hand, we have two 1m and one 2m. We can use one 1m, the 2m, and a 3m to form [1,2,3]. So one draw is sufficient.\n\n But wait, how do we know? \n\n Alternatively, consider: ['1m','1m','4m'] -> \n   For koutsu: we need two more 1m -> two draws.\n   For shuntsu: we don't have consecutive numbers. We can form a shuntsu by drawing two more tiles? Actually, we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles? \n\n Wait, but note: we can form a shuntsu by having three consecutive. We have two 1m. We can draw two tiles: one 0m? But there is no 0m. Or we can draw 2m and 3m? Then we have [1,1,2,3,4] and we can form [1,2,3] (using one 1m, 2m, 3m). But wait, we have two 1m. We can use one 1m, then the 2m and 3m to form [1,2,3]. So two draws.\n\n Alternatively, we might form a koutsu: draw two 1m -> then we have four 1m, which gives a koutsu. So two draws.\n\n So in this case, two draws.\n\n However, is there a way to form a mentsu in one draw? \n   Drawing one tile: \n      If we draw 1m: then we have three 1m -> koutsu -> valid. So actually one draw is enough.\n\n So we must account for both possibilities.\n\n Therefore, we need to consider:\n\n After 0 draws: if the three tiles form a mentsu -> 0.\n\n Otherwise, check for 1 draw: \n   We can consider completing a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu) with one tile.\n\n For triplet: \n   We need three of a kind. Count the frequency of each distinct tile.\n\n   Let the hand be represented as a list of tiles.\n\n   We can group by tile (both digit and suit). For each tile type, count the frequency.\n\n   Then for each tile type that appears at least twice, we can consider: \n        if count == 2: then drawing one more of that tile makes a triplet.\n        if count == 1: then we need two more, so two draws.\n\n   But wait, we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can fix one tile to complete a triplet only for the tiles that currently have two copies.\n\n   However, note: we might have two different tiles that are the same? No, because the tile is represented by two characters. So we consider distinct tiles.\n\n   So if there exists a tile with two copies, then one draw of that tile completes a triplet.\n\n   Additionally, we might form a shuntsu with one draw.\n\n   How to check for shuntsu with one draw?\n        We need to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n        We can look for existing sequences that are missing one tile.\n\n        Steps for shuntsu with one draw:\n            Group by suit first.\n\n            For each suit, consider the distinct numbers present (with at least one occurrence) and also note the counts (but for forming a sequence, we only need one copy per number).\n\n            For a given suit, we can consider all possible consecutive triplets that are missing one tile.\n\n            For example, in suit 'm': \n                We have numbers {1,2} and we are missing 3 to form [1,2,3]. Or we have {2,3} and missing 1 or 4? Actually, the consecutive triplet must be three consecutive numbers. \n\n            Actually, the sequence must be of the form [n, n+1, n+2]. We have three consecutive numbers.\n\n            Conditions for a shuntsu with one draw:\n                There exists a suit and a number n (from 1 to 7) such that:\n                    We have at least two of the following conditions met for the triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in that suit?\n                But wait: we can use one tile from the hand and one drawn tile. However, we are drawing one tile. So we can complete the triplet by having two of the three numbers already.\n\n            Specifically, for a given triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in a suit, we require that at least two of these three numbers are present in the hand (in that suit). Then drawing the missing one (if it is not already present) would complete the sequence.\n\n            However, note: we can also have duplicates. For example, if we have [1m, 1m, 2m], then we have two 1m and one 2m. We can use two 1m and one 2m to form [1,2,?] but wait, we need consecutive. Actually, the consecutive triplet must be [1,2,3] or [2,3,4] etc. But [1,1,2] does not form [1,2,3] because we have two 1s and one 2. We can use one 1, the 2, and a 3 to form [1,2,3]. So we are missing 3.\n\n            So algorithm for shuntsu with one draw:\n                For each suit (m, p, s):\n                    Let S be the set of distinct numbers in that suit (ignoring duplicates for the purpose of checking consecutive, but we must note the counts? Actually, we can use at most one tile per number per sequence.)\n\n                    We are going to look for a triplet [n, n+1, n+2] such that:\n                        At least two numbers in {n, n+1, n+2} are present in the hand (in that suit).\n\n                    Then, we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n                    However, note: we might have two copies of a number. Then we can use two copies? Actually, no: a sequence requires three distinct numbers. So we need one copy of each. \n\n                    But wait: if we have two copies of the same number, then we can use one copy for the sequence and leave the other for something else? Actually, no: the problem is that we are only forming one mentsu. We don't have to use all the tiles. However, we are drawing one tile and then we have four tiles. Then we can form a mentsu (the three consecutive) and the remaining tile doesn't matter.\n\n                    However, the condition is: we have to have three tiles that form a sequence. So we need one of each of the three consecutive numbers.\n\n                    Therefore, for a triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in suit s, we require that we have at least one occurrence of two distinct numbers from {n, n+1, n+2} (and we can use the drawn tile for the third). But note: if we have two copies of the same number, say two 1m, then we can use one 1m for the sequence and the other 1m is left. But the sequence must have distinct numbers. So having two 1m doesn't help for the sequence [1,2,3] because we still need a 2 and a 3.\n\n                    Actually, we can use one tile per number. So if we have two 1m, we can use one 1m and then we still need 2m and 3m. So the two 1m don't help for the sequence [1,2,3] because we need one 1m, one 2m, one 3m.\n\n                    Therefore, we need to check for each triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in a suit s, whether the hand has at least one occurrence of two distinct numbers in that triplet.\n\n                    Example: \n                      Hand: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> already a sequence, so 0 draws.\n                      Hand: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> for the triplet [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, so we can complete by drawing 3m -> one draw.\n\n                    But wait, what if we have duplicates in the sequence? Actually, the sequence requires distinct numbers. So if we have two 1m, we cannot use two 1m in the sequence [1,2,3] because the sequence requires distinct numbers.\n\n                    Therefore, for a given triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in suit s, we require:\n                        The hand (in suit s) has at least one occurrence of two distinct numbers from {n, n+1, n+2}. \n\n                    However, note: we might have two copies of the same number, but that same number is part of two different triplets? Actually, for one triplet, we only need one copy.\n\n                    So for a triplet [n, n+1, n+2]:\n                        We require:\n                            count(n, s) >= 1 and count(n+1, s) >= 1 OR\n                            count(n, s) >= 1 and count(n+2, s) >= 1 OR\n                            count(n+1, s) >= 1 and count(n+2, s) >= 1\n\n                    Then, we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n                    However, note: what if the missing tile is already present in the hand but we don't have three? Actually, we are counting by distinct numbers. We need one copy of each distinct number.\n\n                    But wait: we are allowed to have duplicates. However, if we have two copies of the same number, then we have that number available. But we only need one copy for the sequence.\n\n                    So the above condition is correct.\n\n 3. If neither 0 nor 1 draws work, then we check for 2 draws.\n\n    With two draws, we can complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n    For triplet: \n        We can complete a triplet by drawing two more of a tile that has one copy (then we have three). So if there is at least one tile with one copy, then two draws (of that tile) will complete a triplet.\n\n    For sequence:\n        We can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles to complete two gaps.\n\n        Consider: we have two distinct tiles in a suit that are part of a consecutive triplet, but missing two numbers.\n\n        Example: ['1m','2m','4m']: \n            We have [1,2,4] in suit 'm'. \n            The consecutive triplets that include some of these are:\n                [1,2,3]: we have 1,2 -> missing 3.\n                [2,3,4]: we have 2,4 -> missing 3.\n                [1,2,3] and [2,3,4] are the same triplet? Actually, they are overlapping.\n\n        Actually, we can consider: we need a consecutive triplet [n, n+1, n+2] such that at least one number is present, and we can cover the rest by drawing two.\n\n        But note: we can also form a triplet by two draws (if we have one copy of a tile, then two draws of that tile) but that is already covered by the triplet condition.\n\n        Alternatively, we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles. We need to have two numbers of a triplet already, then we draw two? Actually, no: if we have one number, then we need to draw two more to complete the triplet? That would be two draws for a triplet? But wait, two draws for a triplet is the same as the above: we have one copy, then we draw two more.\n\n        However, we are trying to see if two draws are sufficient. It could be either:\n\n          Option A: Complete a triplet (by drawing two of a kind that we have one of).\n          Option B: Complete a sequence (by drawing two tiles to complete two gaps in a consecutive triplet).\n\n        So for Option B: \n            We need to find a triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in a suit s such that the hand (in that suit) has at least one of the three numbers. Then we can draw the two missing ones.\n\n        However, note: we might have two gaps, but sometimes we can use existing duplicates to cover more than one gap? Actually, we are limited by the fact that we can only use one copy per number in the sequence.\n\n        Example: ['1m','1m','4m'] -> \n            Triplet [1,2,3]: we have two 1m, so we have 1. Then we need to draw 2m and 3m -> two draws.\n            Triplet [2,3,4]: we have 4m, then we need to draw 2m and 3m -> two draws.\n            Triplet [3,4,5]: we have 4m, then we need to draw 3m and 5m -> two draws.\n\n        But wait: is there a possibility that one of the drawn tiles can serve two purposes? No, because we are drawing two separate tiles.\n\n        However, note: we might have two different suits. But the sequence must be in the same suit.\n\n        Another example: ['1m','4m','5m'] -> \n            We have 1,4,5. \n            We can form [1,2,3] by drawing 2 and 3 -> two draws.\n            Or [3,4,5] by drawing 3 -> but wait, we have 4 and 5, so we only need 3. But wait, we are drawing two tiles? Actually, no: we are drawing two tiles? This example requires only one draw for the sequence [3,4,5]. But wait, we already checked one draw and found nothing? \n\n        Let me check the example ['1m','4m','5m'] for one draw:\n            For koutsu: no tile repeated, so no.\n            For shuntsu: \n                In suit 'm': we have numbers 1,4,5.\n                Check triplets: \n                    [1,2,3]: missing 2,3 -> need two draws? Actually, we can only complete one gap with one draw. But we are considering one draw: we can draw one tile, so we can complete one gap. However, we need two gaps. So one draw is not enough for [1,2,3].\n                    [2,3,4]: we have 4, but we don't have 2 and 3 -> two draws needed.\n                    [3,4,5]: we have 4 and 5, so we need 3. So we can complete [3,4,5] by drawing 3 -> one draw.\n\n            So the example ['1m','4m','5m'] should be solved by one draw.\n\n        Therefore, in our one-draw check for shuntsu, we must consider that we can complete a sequence by drawing one tile if we have two numbers of a triplet (which is what we did). \n\n        Now, why didn't we catch that in the example above? We did: we considered the triplet [3,4,5] and we had 4 and 5 (two numbers) so we can complete by drawing 3.\n\n        So the example ['1m','4m','5m'] was caught by the one-draw shuntsu check.\n\n        Then what about two-draw? We are now considering two draws when one draw is not enough.\n\n        So after checking 0, 1, we go to two draws.\n\n        Two draws can be achieved in two ways:\n\n          A. Complete a triplet: we have one copy of a tile, then we draw two copies of that tile -> two draws.\n\n          B. Complete a sequence: we have one copy of a tile in a suit, and we need two more numbers for a consecutive triplet. So we draw two tiles.\n\n        Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> \n            We have two distinct numbers in the same suit (1,2,4) and we are missing two numbers to complete a consecutive triplet? Actually, we can complete two different triplets:\n\n            For [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, so we need 3 -> that would be one draw (so one draw is enough, but wait: we already checked one draw and found that [1,2,3] is completed by drawing 3? Then why is this example requiring two draws? \n\n            Actually, we have two copies? No, we have one copy of 1, one copy of 2, and one copy of 4. Then for [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2 (two numbers) so we can complete by drawing 3 -> one draw.\n\n            So that example is already caught by one draw.\n\n        Another example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> already a triplet (0 draws) or ['1m','1m','2m'] -> one draw for the sequence [1,2,3].\n\n        What if we have two different suits? \n\n        Example: ['1m','1p','1s'] -> \n            Check 0 draws: no triplet (because they are different suits) and no sequence (different suits) -> 0 draws fails.\n\n            Check one draw: \n                Triplet: we have three 1's but different suits -> not a triplet. We can draw two more of the same tile to complete a triplet? Actually, we can draw two 1m to complete [1m,1m,1m] -> two draws? But wait, we can also draw one tile to complete a sequence? \n\n                For sequence: we need same suit. We have three different suits. So we can consider one suit at a time.\n\n                For suit 'm': we have [1m] -> we can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m? But wait, we are allowed to draw one tile. We can draw 2m, then we have [1m,2m] and then we need 3m for a sequence? But we don't have 3m. Similarly, we can draw 3m, then we have [1m,3m] which is not consecutive. \n\n                Alternatively, we can draw a tile that is not 1m? But then we have two 1m and one other tile? Then we have two 1m and one other tile. We can form a triplet for 1m by drawing two 1m (so two draws) or we can form a sequence in the suit of the drawn tile? \n\n                Actually, we can also consider: drawing a tile that is part of a sequence in a suit we have one tile. But we have one tile in three different suits.\n\n                Let's break down:\n\n                Possibilities for one draw:\n\n                  Option 1: Draw a tile that completes a triplet: \n                    We have one 1m, one 1p, one 1s. We can draw a 1m, then we have two 1m and one 1p and one 1s. Then we can form a triplet for 1m if we draw two more 1m? No, we only drew one. Then we have two 1m, but we need three. So not a triplet.\n\n                    Similarly, we can draw 1p: then we have two 1p, but we need three for a triplet.\n\n                  Option 2: Draw a tile that forms a sequence in one suit.\n\n                    Consider suit 'm': we have 1m. We can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing two tiles (one 2m and one 3m) but we are only drawing one.\n\n                    Similarly for 'p' and 's'.\n\n                So one draw is not enough.\n\n                Then two draws:\n\n                  Option 1: Complete a triplet: we can draw two 1m -> then we have three 1m -> triplet. So two draws.\n\n                  Option 2: Complete a sequence: \n                    For suit 'm': we have 1m, then we draw two more: 2m and 3m -> then we have [1m,2m,3m] -> sequence. So two draws.\n\n                So two draws is sufficient.\n\n        Therefore, two draws are sufficient.\n\n        How to check for two draws?\n\n          A. Triplet: there exists a tile (with representation t) that appears at least once. Then we can draw two copies of t to complete a triplet. So if there is at least one tile (any tile) that appears at least once, then two draws (for that tile) will complete a triplet. But wait: if we have two copies of a tile, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one more. But we already checked one draw for triplet (if there's a tile with two copies, then one draw is enough). So for two draws, we are considering tiles that appear only once.\n\n          Actually, the condition for two draws for triplet is: we have a tile that appears at least once (could be one or zero? But we have it) and we draw two copies. But note: if we have a tile that appears once, then we need two more. If we have a tile that appears zero times? Then we don't have it. But we have three tiles, so each tile is present at least once? Actually, no: we might have three distinct tiles.\n\n          So condition for two-draw triplet: there exists a tile (represented by two characters) that appears one time (or two times? no: if it appears two times, then one draw is enough). So we require that there exists a tile that appears exactly one time. Then two draws of that tile will make it three.\n\n          But note: we can also have a tile that appears zero times? But we are starting with three tiles. So each tile in our hand is represented by its two-character string. The tiles we have are given. We don't have any tile not in the hand. So we can only consider the tiles that are present.\n\n          However, we can draw any tile. So we can choose a tile that is not present? Then we would have one copy (the drawn one) and we need two more? That would require drawing three of the same. So that's three draws.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal two-draw triplet condition is: there exists a tile (any tile) that appears at least once (so we have at least one) and we can draw two more of that tile. But if we have one copy, then we draw two more -> total three copies. If we have two copies, then we can complete with one draw. So for two draws, we require that we have at least one copy of a tile and we are allowed to draw two more. But note: we might have two copies of a tile, then one draw is enough (so we don't need two draws). Therefore, two-draw triplet is only necessary if we have exactly one copy of a tile and no triplet can be formed by one draw.\n\n          But wait: we might have two different tiles that are the same? Actually, no: the tiles are distinct by their representation.\n\n          Actually, we can also consider: two-draw triplet: we can draw two of a tile that we have one copy, then we have three. So the condition is: there exists at least one tile that appears exactly once.\n\n          However, note: if we have a tile that appears two times, then we don't need two draws for triplet. So we are only concerned with tiles that appear once.\n\n          But note: the hand has three tiles. The maximum frequency for a tile is 3 (if all three are the same) or 2 (if two are the same) or 1 (if all distinct).\n\n          So:\n\n          If the hand has three distinct tiles, then every tile appears once. Then we can complete a triplet by drawing two of any one of them. So two draws.\n\n          But wait: what if we have two distinct tiles: say two copies of tile A and one copy of tile B. Then we don't have a triplet (unless we draw two A's, which would be two draws) and we don't have a sequence (unless we draw appropriately). But we already checked one draw: one draw for triplet (if we have two A's, then one A completes the triplet) -> so one draw is enough for triplet.\n\n          Therefore, the two-draw triplet condition is: if there is at least one tile that appears exactly once (which is the case if the hand has at least two distinct tiles, and at least one tile appears once) and we haven't completed a triplet by one draw (which we already checked). But note: we are at two draws, so we assume one draw didn't work.\n\n          However, we can simplify: two-draw triplet is always possible if there is at least one tile in the hand (because we can draw two copies of that tile). But wait: if the hand has three distinct tiles, then we can choose any one and draw two copies. So two draws.\n\n          But what if the hand has two distinct tiles: two A and one B. Then we can complete a triplet by drawing two A's (if we don't have three A's already) or two B's. But wait, we have only one B. Then we can draw two B's to complete a triplet of B. But that requires two draws.\n\n          However, we already considered one draw for triplet: we can complete A by one draw (if we have two A's) so one draw is enough. So we don't get to two draws.\n\n          Therefore, the two-draw triplet condition is: if there is at least one tile that appears exactly once, and we cannot complete a triplet by one draw (meaning we don't have a tile that appears two times) then two draws are needed for triplet.\n\n          Actually, no: we can complete a triplet by drawing two of a tile that we have one of, regardless of whether we have two of another. But we are allowed to draw arbitrarily.\n\n          So the minimal draws for a triplet is:\n            If there is a tile with three copies: 0\n            Else if there is a tile with two copies: 1 (draw one more)\n            Else (all tiles are distinct): 2 (draw two of one of the tiles)\n\n          But wait: if we have three distinct tiles, then we can draw two of one tile (say tile1) to complete a triplet. Then we have three tile1 and one tile2 and one tile3. So that's two draws.\n\n          However, note: we might form a sequence with two draws? We don't know. But we are checking independently.\n\n          Similarly, for sequence:\n\n          Two-draw sequence: \n            We need to complete a consecutive triplet [n, n+1, n+2] in a suit.\n\n            We can break it down:\n\n              Case 1: We have one number in the triplet. Then we need to draw the other two -> two draws.\n\n              Case 2: We have zero numbers? Then we need to draw three -> but that would be three draws, which is worse.\n\n            But note: we can also have the same number appearing multiple times? Actually, we only need one copy per number.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','2m']: \n                For the triplet [1,2,3]: we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we need to draw 3m. That is one draw (already considered).\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m']: \n                For [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2 -> then we need 3 -> one draw (already considered).\n\n            Example: ['1m','3m','4m']: \n                For [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3 -> then we need 2 -> one draw (already considered).\n\n            Example: ['1m','4m','5m']: \n                For [3,4,5]: we have 4 and 5 -> need 3 -> one draw (already considered).\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','3m']: 0 draws.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','3m']: \n                For [1,2,3]: we have two 1m and one 3m -> we are missing 2. So one draw (already considered).\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m']: already considered.\n\n            Example: ['1m','3m','5m']: \n                We have three distinct numbers: 1,3,5 (suit 'm').\n                Check triplets:\n                  [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3 -> missing 2 -> one draw (already considered).\n                  [2,3,4]: we have 3 -> missing 2 and 4 -> two draws.\n                  [3,4,5]: we have 3 and 5 -> missing 4 -> one draw (already considered).\n\n                So we already considered one draw.\n\n            Example: ['1m','4m','6m']: \n                [1,2,3]: missing 2,3 -> two draws (if we draw 2 and 3) but wait, we don't have any of them. Actually, we have none. Then we need three draws? But wait, we can form a triplet by drawing two of the same? \n\n            However, we are only concerned with sequences. For sequences, we need consecutive numbers.\n\n            In this example, we can form [4,5,6] by drawing 5 -> one draw (if we consider the triplet [4,5,6]: we have 4 and 6, so we need 5 -> one draw).\n\n            So we must check for one-draw sequences: we look for any triplet [n, n+1, n+2] such that two of the three numbers are present.\n\n            In ['1m','4m','6m']: \n                [1,2,3]: no\n                [2,3,4]: we have 4 -> only one number -> not two\n                [3,4,5]: we have 4 -> only one\n                [4,5,6]: we have 4 and 6 -> two -> so one draw.\n\n            Therefore, the example ['1m','4m','6m'] is caught by one draw.\n\n            Then what example requires two draws for a sequence?\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m']: already caught by one draw.\n\n            Example: ['1m','3m','4m']: caught by one draw.\n\n            Example: ['2m','4m','5m']: \n                [1,2,3]: no\n                [2,3,4]: we have 2 and 4 -> two numbers -> one draw (draw 3)\n                [3,4,5]: we have 4 and 5 -> two numbers -> one draw (draw 3)\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','5m']: \n                [1,2,3]: two numbers (1,2) -> one draw (3)\n                [2,3,4]: two numbers (2) -> not two, so no\n                [3,4,5]: two numbers (5) -> no\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','5m']: one draw.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','6m']: \n                [1,2,3]: two numbers -> one draw (3)\n                [2,3,4]: one number (2) -> no\n                [3,4,5]: none\n                [4,5,6]: one number (6) -> no\n\n            So one draw.\n\n            Example: ['3m','4m','5m']: 0 draws.\n\n            Example: ['1m','3m','5m']: already considered.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','1m']: 0 draws.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','2m']: one draw.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','4m']: one draw (if we consider triplet: two 1m -> one draw; but also sequence: [1,2,3] -> two numbers (1) -> wait, no: we have two 1m and one 4m.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her hand. The solution involves checking various scenarios based on the initial three tiles she has.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the three tiles already form a mentsu. This can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: All three tiles are identical (same digit and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: The three tiles have consecutive numbers (like 1m, 2m, 3m) and the same suit.\n\n2. **One Draw Check**: If no mentsu exists initially, we check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If any tile appears twice in the hand, drawing one more of that tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: If there are two tiles in the same suit with consecutive numbers (like 1m and 2m), drawing the third consecutive tile (3m) completes a sequence.\n\n3. **Two Draws Check**: If one draw is insufficient, we check if two draws can form a mentsu:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: Drawing two more of a tile that appears once in the hand completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: If there are two tiles in the same suit that are part of a consecutive sequence (but missing one or two numbers), drawing the missing tiles completes the sequence.\n\n4. **Three Draws as Fallback**: In all other cases, three draws are required to form a mentsu, typically by completing a triplet or sequence with additional tiles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = [tile for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing mentsu (0 draws)\n    if is_koutsu(tiles) or is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one draw\n    if one_draw_possible(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for two draws\n    if two_draws_possible(tiles):\n        print(2)\n        return\n        \n    # Otherwise, three draws are needed\n    print(3)\n\ndef is_koutsu(tiles):\n    return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n\ndef is_shuntsu(tiles):\n    if tiles[0][1] != tiles[1][1] or tiles[1][1] != tiles[2][1]:\n        return False\n    nums = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles]\n    nums.sort()\n    return nums[2] - nums[1] == 1 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1\n\ndef one_draw_possible(tiles):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_dict[tile] += 1\n        \n    # Check for triplet: any tile with two copies\n    for tile, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count >= 2:\n            return True\n            \n    # Check for shuntsu: any suit with two distinct numbers forming a consecutive triplet\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n        \n    for suit, nums_list in suits.items():\n        unique_nums = set(nums_list)\n        for n in range(1, 8):  # n from 1 to 7 for triplets [n, n+1, n+2]\n            triplet = {n, n+1, n+2}\n            if len(triplet.intersection(unique_nums)) == 2:\n                return True\n                \n    return False\n\ndef two_draws_possible(tiles):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_dict[tile] += 1\n        \n    # Check for triplet: any tile with at least one copy (even if not two)\n    for tile, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            return True\n            \n    # Check for shuntsu: any suit with at least one number present and needing two more to complete a triplet\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        suits[suit].append(num)\n        \n    for suit, nums_list in suits.items():\n        unique_nums = set(nums_list)\n        for n in range(1, 8):\n            triplet = {n, n+1, n+2}\n            if len(triplet.intersection(unique_nums)) >= 1:\n                return True\n                \n    return False\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **is_koutsu(tiles)**: Checks if all three tiles are identical, forming a triplet.\n2. **is_shuntsu(tiles)**: Checks if the three tiles have consecutive numbers and the same suit, forming a sequence.\n3. **one_draw_possible(tiles)**: Determines if drawing one tile can complete a triplet (by having two identical tiles) or a sequence (by having two consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n4. **two_draws_possible(tiles)**: Checks if drawing two tiles can complete a triplet (any tile with at least one copy) or a sequence (having at least one number in a potential triplet).\n5. **Main Function**: Reads input, checks for existing mentsu, then sequentially checks for solutions requiring 0, 1, or 2 draws, defaulting to 3 draws if necessary. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by systematically checking each possible scenario for forming a mentsu with minimal draws.",
