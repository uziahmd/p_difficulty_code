Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given an integer n and then a list of n integers.\n We have to remove exactly one element and minimize the instability (which is max - min).\n Observation: Removing an element can only affect the min or the max (or both) of the array.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. The original instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n 3. When we remove one element, we can consider removing one of the endpoints or an inner element.\n    But note: if we remove an endpoint, then the next min or max becomes the adjacent element.\n\n Actually, we can consider two main cases for removal:\n   Case 1: Remove the minimum element. Then the new min is the next smallest (if there are duplicates, then the first occurrence of the minimum might be removed, but then the next min is still the same value? Actually, we sort so duplicates are together).\n   Case 2: Remove the maximum element. Similarly, then the new max is the next largest.\n\n However, note that sometimes the best solution is to remove an element that is not the global min or max?\n But observe: The instability is defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum. Removing an element that is not the current min or max does not change the min or the max. Therefore, the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n So we only need to consider removals at the ends (min and max) because:\n   If we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain unchanged, so the instability is the same as the original.\n\n However, wait: what if the array has duplicate values? For example, [1, 1, 2, 3]. \n   Original instability: 3-1 = 2.\n   If we remove a 1 (but leave another 1), then the new min is 1 (because there's still a 1) and the max is 3 -> instability 2.\n   If we remove a 3, then the array becomes [1,1,2] -> instability 1.\n   So in this case, removing a non-min element (the max) reduces the instability.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. So we can also consider removing an element that is not the global min or max, but that doesn't change the min and max? Actually, no. The min and max are determined by the entire set. Removing an element that is not the unique min or max doesn't change the min and max.\n\n However, consider: [1, 2, 3, 4]. \n   Original instability: 3.\n   Removing 1: [2,3,4] -> instability 2.\n   Removing 2: [1,3,4] -> instability 3 (same as original).\n   Removing 3: [1,2,4] -> instability 3.\n   Removing 4: [1,2,3] -> instability 2.\n\n So the key is: we can only get a reduction by removing an element that is either the min or the max (if they are unique). But if the min is repeated, then removing one occurrence of the min doesn't change the min, but it changes the max? Actually, no: the max is still the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n However, let's think about the effect of removing an element:\n\n Let the sorted array be b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1].\n\n The instability after removing an element at index i (0-indexed) is:\n   If i == 0: then new array is b[1..n-1] -> instability = b[n-1] - b[1]\n   If i == n-1: then new array is b[0..n-2] -> instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n   For any other i: the min is still b[0] and the max is still b[n-1] (unless we remove an element that is the min or max? Actually, if we remove an element that is the min, then the next min is the next smallest, which might be the same if there are duplicates). \n\n Actually, the above two cases (removing the first or the last) are the only ones that can change the min or the max.\n\n But wait: if the array has multiple mins, then removing one min doesn't change the min? Example: [1,1,2,3]. \n   Removing the first element (a 1): the array becomes [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n   Removing the second element (another 1): the array becomes [1,2,3] -> same.\n\n So the instability when removing an element that is the min (even if repeated) is: \n   If we remove a min, then the new min is the smallest value",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential changes in the min and max values when an element is removed.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: After sorting, the first and last elements are the current min and max. Removing these elements can potentially reduce the instability.\n3. **Evaluate Possible Instabilities**: For each possible removal (considering the first and last elements), compute the new instability:\n   - **Remove the first element**: The new instability is the difference between the last and second elements.\n   - **Remove the last element**: The new instability is the difference between the second last and first elements.\n   - **Remove any other element**: The instability remains the same as the original since the min and max do not change.\n4. **Select the Minimum Instability**: Among all possible instabilities obtained by removing each element, choose the smallest one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    arr.sort()\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        original_instability = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n        candidates = set()\n        candidates.add(original_instability)\n        candidates.add(arr[-1] - arr[1])\n        candidates.add(arr[-2] - arr[0])\n        min_instability = min(candidates)\n        print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the min and max elements.\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in a zero instability array.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: The code calculates three potential instabilities:\n   - The original instability (if no element is removed).\n   - The instability after removing the first element (min).\n   - The instability after removing the last element (max).\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the computed instabilities is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the critical elements (the first and last) in the sorted array, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
