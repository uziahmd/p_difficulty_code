Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines with (l, r, cost)\n Conditions:\n  - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n  - The two vouchers must not intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1) be the duration of voucher i.\n    Then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n 2. We want to minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n 3. The non-intersection condition: \n      Condition 1: r_i < l_j   => voucher i ends before voucher j starts.\n      Condition 2: r_j < l_i   => voucher j ends before voucher i starts.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    Since the total duration is fixed (x), we can group the vouchers by their duration.\n\n    For each voucher i, we can consider a complementary duration: comp = x - d_i.\n\n    However, note: we have two conditions (the non-intersection) and also we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n 5. We can do:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute for each voucher the duration and store the voucher's (l, r, cost).\n\n    Step 2: Create a dictionary (or list of lists) that maps a duration to a list of tuples (l, r, cost) for all vouchers with that duration.\n\n    But note: the total number of distinct durations might be up to 200000, but we have at most 200000 vouchers.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use an array for each duration from 1 to max_duration (which is 200000) and store the vouchers.\n\n    However, we need to check non-intersection. So for two vouchers (i and j) with durations d_i and d_j (d_i+d_j=x) we must check if they don't intersect.\n\n 6. How to efficiently check non-intersection for two vouchers?\n\n    We have two cases: \n        Case 1: i and j are such that r_i < l_j (so the first one ends before the second starts)\n        Case 2: j and i are such that r_j < l_i (so the second one ends before the first starts)\n\n    But note: we don't know which one is first. We have two separate cases.\n\n 7. Alternate idea:\n\n    Instead of grouping by duration, we can try to fix the two vouchers by their durations. But then we have to check the non-intersection condition.\n\n    However, the total distinct durations might be large, so we need to avoid checking every pair.\n\n 8. We can do:\n\n    Let's create an array `vouchers` for each duration d (from 1 to maybe max_d = 200000) that contains the list of (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n    Then for each duration d, we look for the complementary duration x-d. \n\n    Now, for each voucher in the group d and each voucher in the group x-d, we check if they don't intersect. But that would be O(n^2) if we do for every d and x-d.\n\n    We need to optimize.\n\n 9. Observation:\n\n    The non-intersection condition is about the intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j]. \n\n    Two intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] do not intersect if either:\n        r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n    This is equivalent to: the entire interval of the first is before the entire interval of the second, or vice versa.\n\n    But note: we are free to choose which one is first. Actually, the condition is symmetric: if we take two intervals, then they do not overlap if one is entirely to the left of the other.\n\n    However, when we have two different durations, we can fix one and then look for the other.\n\n    Specifically, if we take a voucher i (duration d) and a voucher j (duration x-d), then they do not intersect if:\n        r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n    But note: if d != x-d, then we have two distinct groups. However, if d == x-d, then we have to choose two distinct vouchers from the same group? But wait, the problem says two distinct vouchers, so even if d==x-d, we must pick two different ones.\n\n    But wait: what if x is odd? Then d != x-d for all d (unless d=x/2, but x is integer). Actually, if x is even and d = x/2, then we need two vouchers from the same group",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: We first group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to efficiently look up vouchers that, when combined with a given voucher, meet the total duration requirement of `x`.\n\n2. **Check Complementary Durations**: For each voucher with duration `d`, we look for another voucher with duration `x - d`. If such a voucher exists, we then check if the two vouchers do not overlap in time.\n\n3. **Efficient Overlap Check**: To avoid checking every pair of vouchers directly, which would be computationally expensive, we use a strategy where we keep track of the minimum cost voucher for each duration. Additionally, we maintain lists of intervals (start and end days) for each duration to facilitate quick overlap checks.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Special consideration is given to cases where the complementary duration does not exist or no non-overlapping pairs are found. In such cases, we return `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n    \n    max_day = 400000\n    min_cost_dict = {}\n    intervals_by_duration = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        if duration not in min_cost_dict:\n            min_cost_dict[duration] = cost_val\n            intervals_by_duration[duration].append((l, r))\n        else:\n            if cost_val < min_cost_dict[duration]:\n                min_cost_dict[duration] = cost_val\n            intervals_by_duration[duration].append((l, r))\n    \n    comp_duration = x - duration\n    \n    best_total = float('inf')\n    found = False\n    \n    for dur, min_cost in min_cost_dict.items():\n        comp = x - dur\n        if comp not in min_cost_dict:\n            continue\n        \n        list_intervals = intervals_by_duration[dur]\n        comp_list = intervals_by_duration.get(comp, [])\n        \n        if dur == comp:\n            used = set()\n            for interval1 in list_intervals:\n                if interval1[0] in used:\n                    continue\n                for interval2 in comp_list:\n                    if interval2[0] in used:\n                        continue\n                    if interval1[0] == interval2[0] and interval1[1] == interval2[1]:\n                        used.add(interval1[0])\n                        continue\n                    if interval1[1] < interval2[0] or interval2[1] < interval1[0]:\n                        total_cost = min_cost_dict[dur] * 2\n                        if total_cost < best_total:\n                            best_total = total_cost\n                        found = True\n                used.add(interval2[0])\n        else:\n            for interval1 in list_intervals:\n                for interval2 in comp_list:\n                    if interval1[1] < interval2[0] or interval2[1] < interval1[0]:\n                        total_cost = min_cost_dict[dur] + min_cost_dict[comp]\n                        if total_cost < best_total:\n                            best_total = total_cost\n                        found = True\n                break\n    \n    if not found:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(best_total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are `n` (number of vouchers) and `x` (required total duration).\n\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration. For each duration, we store the minimum cost and all intervals (start and end days) of vouchers with that duration.\n\n3. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, we check if there exists a complementary duration `x - d`. If found, we then verify if any voucher from `d` and any voucher from `x - d` do not overlap in time.\n\n4. **Overlap Check**: Two vouchers do not overlap if one ends before the other starts. This is checked by comparing the end day of one voucher with the start day of the other.\n\n5. **Output Result**: The minimum total cost of valid pairs is printed. If no valid pair is found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
