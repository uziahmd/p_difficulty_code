Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x (the total desired duration) and then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Each voucher has duration = r - l + 1.\n\n Conditions:\n We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n   (duration_i + duration_j == x) and the two intervals [li, ri] and [lj, rj] do not intersect (at least one condition: ri < lj or rj < li).\n\n We want the minimal total cost.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since x can be up to 200,000 and the number of vouchers is up to 200,000, we cannot try all pairs.\n\n Idea:\n Let d = duration of a voucher = r-l+1.\n\n We are looking for two durations d1 and d2 such that d1+d2 = x.\n\n Then we need to consider two types of non-overlapping conditions:\n   Condition 1: [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] with r1 < l2 (voucher1 ends before voucher2 starts)\n   Condition 2: [l2, r2] and [l1, r1] with r2 < l1 (voucher2 ends before voucher1 starts)\n\n But note: the two conditions are symmetric. So we can assume without loss of generality that we fix the first voucher (with duration d1) and then look for a second voucher (with duration d2 = x-d1) that does not overlap.\n\n However, note: the two vouchers are chosen arbitrarily, so we have to consider both orders? Actually, the problem does not specify an order. But note: the condition is symmetric. However, we must consider that the two vouchers might be chosen in any order.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group vouchers by duration. Since duration can be at most 200000 (because l and r are at most 200000, so maximum duration is 200000), we can create an array (or dictionary) for each duration from 0 to 200000.\n\n    For each duration d, we will store a list (or multiple lists) of the vouchers (each voucher is [l, r, cost]) but then we might want to sort them by l (start) or by r (end). Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration the best cost for a given start (or end) and then use some data structure to quickly find non-overlapping ones.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can also consider storing for each duration d, the vouchers that have duration d, and then for a fixed voucher with duration d1, we look for a voucher with duration d2 = x-d1.\n\n    But then we have to check non-overlap. \n\n 3. We can also think: for each voucher i, we know its duration d_i = r_i - l_i + 1. Then we are looking for a voucher j with duration x - d_i that does not overlap.\n\n    How to check non-overlap? The two intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] do not overlap if r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n    This means that for a fixed voucher i, we can look for a voucher j with duration d_j = x-d_i and such that either:\n        Case 1: r_j < l_i   (then the j voucher ends before i starts -> condition satisfied)\n        Case 2: r_i < l_j   (then the i voucher ends before j starts -> condition satisfied)\n\n    But note: the two vouchers are independent, so we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n        We want to quickly, for a given query (for example, for a voucher i with [l_i, r_i] and duration d_i, and we are looking for duration d2 = x-d_i), we want to find:\n\n            Option 1: a voucher j in duration d2 that ends (r_j) before l_i.\n            Option 2: a voucher j in duration d2 that starts (l_j) after r_i.\n\n    However, note: the two conditions are symmetric, but we are considering two different orders.\n\n 4. Implementation:\n\n    We can create two dictionaries (or arrays) for each duration:\n\n        For each duration d, we want to store two sorted lists:\n          - One sorted by the start day (l) and then we can record the minimal cost for a voucher with a given start (but wait, we need to combine multiple attributes: we have [l, r, cost]. However, we are going to look for a condition on r (for case 1) or l (for case 2). \n\n    Alternatively, we can store two separate structures per duration:\n\n        For each duration d, we can store:\n            A list of (l, r, cost) and then we can precompute:\n                - A list of all r's (for case 1: we want a voucher j with r_j < l_i) and also we want the minimal cost among those that have duration d and r_j < l_i.\n                - Similarly, for case 2: we want a voucher j with l_j > r_i and minimal cost.\n\n    But note: we are going to iterate over all vouchers? Then we would do too many queries.\n\n    Instead, we can precompute for each duration d (from 0 to max_duration) two arrays:\n\n        Let's define:\n          For a fixed duration d, we have a list of vouchers: each is (l, r, cost)\n\n        Then, we can sort by l and also by r?\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          For each duration d, we want to answer two types of queries:\n\n            Query type 1: given a value 'a' (which would be l_i from the other voucher), find the minimal cost among all vouchers of duration d that have r < a.\n\n            Query type 2: given a value 'b' (which would be r_i from the other voucher), find the minimal cost among all vouchers of duration d that have l > b.\n\n        Then, for a voucher i with (l_i, r_i, cost_i, d_i) and for d2 = x - d_i (if d2 >= 0 and exists in our dictionary), we do:\n\n            If d2 == d_i, then we are looking for two vouchers in the same duration group. But note: the two vouchers must be distinct. However, the problem says exactly two distinct vouchers.\n\n            We must avoid using the same voucher twice.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Precomputation:\n\n            Step 1: Group all vouchers by duration. Let `groups` be a dictionary: key is duration d, value is a list of (l, r, cost).\n\n            Step 2: For each duration d that appears, we process the list of vouchers for that duration.\n\n                    We want to build two data structures for each d:\n\n                      DS1: for query \"find minimal cost for a voucher with r < a\" (for case 1: when the current voucher starts at l_i, then we require the other voucher to end before l_i)\n\n                      DS2: for query \"find minimal cost for a voucher with l > b\" (for case 2: when the current voucher ends at r_i, then we require the other voucher to start after r_i)\n\n            How to build DS1 for a fixed d?\n\n                We have a list of (l, r, cost) for duration d.\n\n                We are only interested in the 'r' and 'cost'. We want to quickly, for a given a, get the minimal cost of all vouchers in this group with r < a.\n\n                We can sort the list by r (and then we can do a binary search for the last index with r < a, and then take the minimal cost in the prefix). But note: we want the minimal cost overall, so we can precompute a segment tree or simply a sorted array by r and then store the minimum cost for all vouchers with r <= some value.\n\n                Alternatively, we can sort by r and then create an array `min_cost_by_r` for increasing r: meaning for each r (or for each position in sorted r) we store the minimal cost found so far (as we go from low r to high r). Then we can do:\n\n                    Sort the list of (r, cost) for duration d by r, and then create an array `min_costs` such that min_costs[i] = min(cost for the first i+1 vouchers in sorted order by r).\n\n                Then for a query a, we find the largest r that is < a, and then take min_costs at that index.\n\n            Similarly, for DS2: we want to query by l (for the start) and condition l > b.\n\n                We can sort the list by l, and then for a given b, we want the minimal cost for all vouchers with l > b.\n\n                Then we can sort by l, and then create an array `min_costs` from the end: from high l to low l, but actually we can do:\n\n                    Sort by l, and then traverse from the highest l to the lowest, and store the minimal cost from that point to the end.\n\n                Alternatively, we can also sort by l and then use a Fenwick tree or segment tree, but note that the constraints are up to 200000, and the l and r are in [1, 200000]. But note: the same duration d might have many vouchers.\n\n            However, we can also use two pointers or simply precompute for each duration d:\n\n                For DS1 (query by r < a): \n                    Sort the list of (r, cost) by r. Then, we can use a pointer and a heap? Or just do a binary search and then a prefix minimum.\n\n                Let's do:\n\n                    events1[d] = sorted list of (r, cost) for duration d.\n\n                    Then, we can create an array `arr1` of all r's (sorted) and then an array `prefix_min1` where prefix_min1[i] = min(cost for the first i+1 elements in events1[d]).\n\n                    Then, for a query a, we find the rightmost index i such that events1[d][i][0] < a. Then the minimal cost is prefix_min1[i] (if exists).\n\n                Similarly for DS2 (query by l > b):\n\n                    events2[d] = sorted list of (l, cost) for duration d.\n\n                    Then, we can create an array `suffix_min2` where suffix_min2[i] = min(cost from i to the end) for the sorted list by l.\n\n                    Then, for a query b, we find the leftmost index i such that events2[d][i][0] > b, and then the minimal cost is suffix_min2[i].\n\n            But note: we are storing two separate structures for each duration d? Actually, we can store one structure per duration d for both conditions, but we are going to use two different keys (one for r and one for l). Alternatively, we can store two separate dictionaries for the two conditions.\n\n            However, note: we are going to use these structures for each duration d that we have. And then when processing a voucher i with duration d_i, we look for d2 = x - d_i, and then use the two conditions.\n\n 5. Algorithm:\n\n    Precomputation:\n\n        groups = defaultdict(list)\n        for each voucher (l, r, cost):\n            d = r - l + 1\n            groups[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n        # We'll create two dictionaries: \n        #   For each duration d, we store:\n        #       ds1[d] = (sorted_events_by_r, prefix_min_list)   for events: (r, cost) and then prefix_min_list for the costs as we go by increasing r.\n        #       ds2[d] = (sorted_events_by_l, suffix_min_list)   for events: (l, cost) and then suffix_min_list for the costs as we go by decreasing l (or increasing l and then take suffix_min from the end).\n\n        Actually, for ds2, we can do:\n\n            Sort by l: then the list is [(l0, cost0), (l1, cost1), ...] with l0 <= l1 <= ... \n            Then, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l > b. We can precompute from the end: \n                suffix_min[i] = min(cost_i, cost_{i+1}, ... , cost_{n-1})\n\n            Then, for a given b, we find the first index i such that l_i > b (using bisect_right for b, then the next index) and then suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost.\n\n        Steps for building ds1 for duration d:\n\n            events = groups[d]   # list of (l, r, cost)\n            # extract (r, cost) and sort by r\n            events_r = sorted([(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in events], key=lambda x: x[0])\n            # Now, we want the minimal cost for each prefix (by increasing r)\n            prefix_min = [0]*len(events_r)\n            if len(events_r) > 0:\n                prefix_min[0] = events_r[0][1]\n                for i in range(1, len(events_r)):\n                    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], events_r[i][1])\n\n            Then store ds1[d] = (events_r, prefix_min)\n\n        Similarly, for ds2 for duration d:\n\n            events_l = sorted([(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in events], key=lambda x: x[0])\n            # Now, we want the minimal cost from the end (by increasing l) so we can do:\n            suffix_min = [0]*len(events_l)\n            if len(events_l) > 0:\n                # Traverse from the last element to the first.\n                suffix_min[-1] = events_l[-1][1]\n                for i in range(len(events_l)-2, -1, -1):\n                    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], events_l[i][1])\n\n            Then store ds2[d] = (events_l, suffix_min)\n\n    Then, we need to consider: what if d2 (x-d_i) is negative or zero? Then skip.\n\n    Also, note: the same duration d might appear for d2, and then we have to consider two different vouchers from the same duration group. But note: we must ensure they are distinct.\n\n    However, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be from different groups. They can be from the same group (same duration) if the group has at least two vouchers.\n\n    But note: if d_i = d2, then we are looking for two vouchers in the same duration group. Then we must make sure they don't overlap and are distinct.\n\n    However, our method for querying the same duration d for two conditions (case1: r_j < l_i, and case2: r_i < l_j) is still valid.\n\n    Then, we iterate over all vouchers i (each voucher) and for each voucher i with duration d_i, let d2 = x - d_i.\n\n        If d2 < 0: skip.\n\n        If d2 == 0: skip (since no voucher has duration 0? because l<=r, so duration>=1) unless x==0, but x>=2.\n\n        Then, if d2 exists in groups (i.e., in ds1 or ds2 keys), then:\n\n            Case 1: the other voucher j (with duration d2) must satisfy r_j < l_i.\n\n                Use ds1 for duration d2: we want the minimal cost for a voucher j in duration d2 with r_j < l_i.\n\n                Steps for case1:\n\n                    Let events_r_d2 = ds1.get(d2, (None, None))[0]   # sorted by r\n                    prefix_min_d2 = ds1.get(d2, (None, None))[1]\n\n                    If events_r_d2 is None (i.e., no voucher with duration d2), then skip.\n\n                    Then, we need to find the maximal r value in events_r_d2 that is < l_i.\n\n                    We can use bisect_left to find the insertion point for l_i, then the index is the one before that.\n\n                    Specifically, we can use bisect_left on the list of r's (the first element of each tuple in events_r_d2) to find the position where l_i would be inserted. Then, if the index is 0, there's no voucher. Otherwise, the last voucher with r < l_i is at index = pos-1.\n\n                    Then, the minimal cost from the prefix_min_d2 at that index is the candidate for case1.\n\n            Case 2: the other voucher j (with duration d2) must satisfy l_j > r_i.\n\n                Use ds2 for duration d2: we want the minimal cost for a voucher j in duration d2 with l_j > r_i.\n\n                events_l_d2 = ds2.get(d2, (None, None))[0]   # sorted by l\n                suffix_min_d2 = ds2.get(d2, (None, None))[1]\n\n                Find the first index where l_j > r_i. We can use bisect_right for r_i (then the next index) or bisect_left for r_i+1? Actually, we can use:\n\n                    In events_l_d2 (which is sorted by l), we want the first index i such that events_l_d2[i][0] > r_i.\n\n                    We can do: \n                        pos = bisect.bisect_right(events_l_d2, (r_i, 10**18))   # we are comparing only the first element, and since the tuples are (l, cost), we can use (r_i, 0) and then the next index is the first one with l>r_i.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can use bisect_left for (r_i+1, 0) but that's not the same.\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                        pos = bisect.bisect_right([l_val for (l_val, _) in events_l_d2], r_i)   # returns the insertion position for r_i in the list of l_vals, but then we want the first index that is greater than r_i, which is pos.\n\n                    Then, if pos is beyond the last index, then there's no voucher. Otherwise, the minimal cost from suffix_min_d2 at index pos is the candidate.\n\n        Then, we have two candidate costs for the second voucher (if exist) from case1 and case2.\n\n        Then, the total cost for the pair (i, j) is cost_i (from voucher i) plus the candidate cost from the other voucher (if found).\n\n        Then, we take the minimal total cost over all such pairs.\n\n    However, note: we are iterating over each voucher i, and then we consider two cases. But note: the same pair (i, j) might be considered twice (once when i is the first and once when j is the first). \n\n    Example: \n        Voucher i: (l_i, r_i, cost_i) and voucher j: (l_j, r_j, cost_j) with d_i + d_j = x.\n\n        When we process voucher i, we consider j (if d_j = x-d_i) and then we check the two conditions.\n\n        Then, when we process voucher j, we consider i (if d_i = x-d_j) and then we check the two conditions.\n\n        But note: the conditions are symmetric? Actually, the two conditions for non-overlap are the same: the two intervals do not overlap. But the way we break down the conditions is:\n\n            Condition1 (case1): j's r < i's l -> then when processing j, we are looking for i: condition2 (case2) is i's r < j's l? Not necessarily the same.\n\n        Actually, the two conditions are:\n\n            Condition for i and j: either (r_i < l_j) or (r_j < l_i).\n\n        Now, when processing i, we use case1: (r_j < l_i) and case2: (l_j > r_i).\n\n        When processing j, we use case1: (r_i < l_j) and case2: (l_i > r_j).\n\n        But note: (r_j < l_i) is the same as (r_i < l_j)? No, they are different.\n\n        Actually, the two conditions are independent and cover the two possible orders.\n\n        However, the pair (i, j) will be considered twice: once from i and once from j.\n\n        But note: the two conditions for the same pair (i, j) are:\n\n            Condition1 for i: requires r_j < l_i.\n            Condition2 for i: requires l_j > r_i.\n\n        And for j:\n\n            Condition1 for j: requires r_i < l_j.\n            Condition2 for j: requires l_i > r_j.\n\n        So actually, the two conditions for i and j are the same: the two conditions are complementary. The entire condition is that the two intervals do not overlap, and we break it into two disjoint cases.\n\n        But note: the two cases are mutually exclusive? Actually, no: they are two ways to express non-overlap. However, the entire condition is that the two intervals do not overlap, and we are checking both possibilities.\n\n        However, the same pair (i, j) is only counted once. Because if the pair satisfies condition1 (r_j < l_i) then when we process i we will consider j (via case1) and when we process j we will consider i (via case2: because for j, condition2 is l_i > r_j, which is the same as r_j < l_i). \n\n        So the same pair is found twice: once from i (case1) and once from j (case2). \n\n        Similarly, if the pair satisfies condition2 (l_j > r_i) then we find it from i (case2) and from j (case1).\n\n        Therefore, we are counting each valid pair twice. \n\n        To avoid that, we could iterate only over one ordering? But note: we don't know which one is first.\n\n        Alternatively, we can remember the best total cost and then update it, but then we must consider that the same pair might be found twice. \n\n        However, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be ordered. We are just looking for two distinct vouchers.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Initialize best = a very large number (like 10**18)\n\n            Then, for each voucher i (with duration d_i) and d2 = x-d_i (if d2>=0 and exists):\n\n                candidate1 = query ds1 for d2 with a = l_i   (if exists, then candidate1 = cost_i + (minimal cost from ds1[d2] for r < l_i))\n                candidate2 = query ds2 for d2 with b = r_i   (if exists, then candidate2 = cost_i + (minimal cost from ds2[d2] for l > r_i))\n\n                Then, update best = min(best, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n            But note: we must consider that the same pair (i, j) is found again when processing j. \n\n        However, we are updating with the same total cost (cost_i + cost_j) and (cost_j + cost_i) is the same. So we are updating with the same value twice.\n\n        This is acceptable because we are just taking the minimum, and we are doing two updates with the same value. But we can avoid processing the same pair twice by ensuring that we don't use the same voucher twice? \n\n        Actually, we are grouping by duration and then we are using two different sets (the same duration group for d2 might include the same voucher if we don't remove it). But note: we are storing all vouchers for a duration. \n\n        However, the problem requires distinct vouchers. In our query, we are allowed to pick any voucher j (even if it is the same as i) but wait, we are storing all vouchers for a duration. But if i is in duration d_i and d2 = x-d_i, then if d_i = d2, then i is included in the set for d2. Then, when we query for ds1[d2] (which includes i) and we ask for r_j < l_i, then if i itself satisfies that condition (i.e., if r_i < l_i? That's impossible because r_i>=l_i, so no) then we don't pick i. Similarly, for ds2: we ask for l_j > r_i, and i's l_i <= r_i, so l_i > r_i is false. So even if i is in the same duration group, we are not including i because the condition fails.\n\n        But wait: what if there are two identical vouchers? Then we might pick the same voucher twice? \n\n        However, the input has n distinct vouchers? The problem says: \"exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\".\n\n        So we must ensure that we don't pick the same voucher twice.\n\n        Our method does not consider the same voucher because:\n\n            In the same duration group, we are storing all vouchers. Then, when we query for a voucher j in the same duration group, we are including all vouchers (including i). But we must not use the same voucher i.\n\n        How to avoid that?\n\n        We can precompute the entire set of vouchers and then when we query, we are getting the minimal cost from the entire set. But if the minimal cost voucher in the set for duration d2 is i, then we should not use it.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the same voucher i (in the same duration group) is:\n\n            Condition1: r_i < l_i -> false, so we don't use i in case1.\n            Condition2: l_i > r_i -> false, so we don't use i in case2.\n\n        So even if we include i in the set, the condition for non-overlap fails, so i is not selected. \n\n        But wait: what if there are two identical vouchers? Then we have two vouchers with the same (l, r, cost). Then, we might use two different vouchers (both copies) that are identical. But then they are distinct and the condition might hold? \n\n        Example: two vouchers with [1,3,5] and x = (3-1+1)*2 = 10. Then we are looking for two vouchers of duration 5 (if 10/2=5). Then when processing the first voucher, we look for a voucher with duration 5 that has r<1 -> none, or l>3 -> then the second voucher has l=1 which is not >3, so no. Similarly, processing the second voucher: same. So we don't pick the same voucher twice? Actually, we are storing two separate vouchers.\n\n        But note: the two vouchers are distinct, so we can use them. However, we must ensure that we are not excluding a valid pair because of the same voucher? \n\n        The problem: if we have two vouchers (v1 and v2) that are identical and they do not overlap? Actually, they are the same interval [1,3] so they definitely overlap. So they are not valid.\n\n        However, what if two vouchers have the same duration and are non-overlapping? Then they are distinct and valid.\n\n        Therefore, our method of storing the entire set and then querying the entire set is correct, because we are allowing any two distinct vouchers (and we are storing the entire set). The fact that the same voucher i is stored in the set for duration d_i and then we are querying the set for duration d2 (which includes i) but the condition for i fails (so i is not chosen) is okay.\n\n        But wait: what if there are two different vouchers (not identical) with the same (l, r, cost) and they are non-overlapping? Then we are storing both, and the query will pick the minimal cost from the entire set. \n\n        However, the issue is: we are storing all vouchers. Then, when we query for a duration d2, we are getting the minimal cost from all vouchers of that duration, regardless of whether they are the same as i or not. And the condition (non-overlap) is checked by the query (using l_i and r_i). \n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n            Precomputation: \n                Group by duration and build ds1 and ds2 for each duration.\n\n            Then, initialize best = a big number (like 10**18 * 3)\n\n            For each voucher i (with l_i, r_i, cost_i) and duration d_i = r_i-l_i+1:\n\n                d2 = x - d_i\n\n                If d2 < 0: continue.\n\n                If d2 not in the groups: continue.\n\n                Then, for case1: query ds1 for d2: we want a voucher j (any) in duration d2 with r_j < l_i.\n\n                    If there is at least one, then candidate1 = cost_i + (minimal cost from ds1[d2] for r_j < l_i)\n\n                Then, for case2: query ds2 for d2: we want a voucher j (any) in duration d2 with l_j > r_i.\n\n                    If there is at least one, then candidate2 = cost_i + (minimal cost from ds2[d2] for l_j > r_i)\n\n                Then, update best = min(best, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n            If best remains the initial big number, output -1, else output best.\n\n 6. But note: the above iteration counts each pair twice (once from i and once from j). \n\n        However, the two candidates (candidate1 and candidate2) for voucher i are from the entire set of vouchers of duration d2 (which includes j). Then, when we process j, we will also consider i (if d_j + d_i = x, which is the same) and then we get the same candidate (the same cost_i + cost_j) again.\n\n        But that is acceptable because we are taking the minimum, and we are updating best with the same value twice.\n\n        However, if we are concerned about performance (n up to 200000) and each query takes O(log n) (because we do two binary searches per query) then the total time is O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\n 7. Implementation details:\n\n        We need to build two dictionaries: \n            ds1: keyed by duration d, value is (sorted_events_by_r, prefix_min_list)\n            ds2: keyed by duration d, value is (sorted_events_by_l, suffix_min_list)\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n, x.\n\n            vouchers = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                l, r, cost = data\n                d = r - l + 1\n                vouchers.append((l, r, cost, d))\n\n            groups = {}\n            for (l, r, cost, d) in vouchers:\n                if d not in groups:\n                    groups[d] = []\n                groups[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n            ds1 = {}   # for each d: (events_r, prefix_min)\n            ds2 = {}   # for each d: (events_l, suffix_min)\n\n            for d, lst in groups.items():\n                # Build ds1 for duration d\n                events_r = sorted([(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                # Build prefix_min for events_r\n                prefix_min = []\n                if events_r:\n                    prefix_min.append(events_r[0][1])\n                    for idx in range(1, len(events_r)):\n                        prefix_min.append(min(prefix_min[idx-1], events_r[idx][1]))\n                    ds1[d] = (events_r, prefix_min)\n\n                # Build ds2 for duration d\n                events_l = sorted([(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                suffix_min = []\n                if events_l:\n                    # sort by l, then traverse backwards\n                    suffix_min = [0]*len(events_l)\n                    suffix_min[-1] = events_l[-1][1]\n                    for idx in range(len(events_l)-2, -1, -1):\n                        suffix_min[idx] = min(suffix_min[idx+1], events_l[idx][1])\n                    ds2[d] = (events_l, suffix_min)\n\n            Then, we iterate over each voucher.\n\n            But note: the same duration d might be used in both ds1 and ds2, but we built them separately.\n\n            However, we must note: the groups are built from the same list, so it's consistent.\n\n 8. Query functions for ds1 and ds2:\n\n        For ds1 (for duration d2, and given a = l_i):\n\n            events_r, prefix_min = ds1.get(d2, (None, None))\n            if events_r is None or len(events_r)==0:\n                candidate1 = None\n            else:\n                # We want the last event with r < a\n                # Extract the list of r values from events_r: [r0, r1, ...] (sorted)\n                # Use bisect_left on the list of r values to find the first index >= a.\n                import bisect\n                # The list of r's is [event[0] for event in events_r]\n                r_list = [ev[0] for ev in events_r]\n                pos = bisect.bisect_left(r_list, a)   # returns the first index where r >= a\n                if pos == 0:\n                    candidate1 = None   # no event with r < a\n                else:\n                    # The last event with r < a is at index pos-1\n                    min_cost = prefix_min[pos-1]\n                    candidate1 = cost_i + min_cost\n\n            Similarly, for ds2 (for duration d2, and given b = r_i):\n\n            events_l, suffix_min = ds2.get(d2, (None, None))\n            if events_l is None or len(events_l)==0:\n                candidate2 = None\n            else:\n                # We want the first event with l > b\n                # events_l is sorted by l, and we have a list of l's: [l0, l1, ...] (increasing)\n                # We want the first index where l > b.\n                import bisect\n                l_list = [ev[0] for ev in events_l]\n                pos = bisect.bisect_right(l_list, b)   # returns the insertion position for b, so that all elements <= b are to the left of pos.\n                # Then, the first element with l > b is at index pos.\n                if pos >= len(events_l):\n                    candidate2 = None\n                else:\n                    min_cost = suffix_min[pos]   # because suffix_min is computed from the current index to the end, and our events_l is sorted by l, and suffix_min[i] is the min cost from index i to the end.\n                    candidate2 = cost_i + min_cost\n\n            Then update best.\n\n 9. However, note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are computed for the same voucher i. But the same voucher i is being added to the cost. \n\n        But wait: the candidate1 and candidate2 are the cost of voucher i plus the minimal cost of a voucher j (from the set of duration d2). \n\n        This is correct.\n\n 10. But note: the same duration d2 might be used and the minimal cost we get from the set might come from a voucher that is the same as i? We already argued that the condition (non-overlap) fails for i itself, so i is not included. However, if there are two vouchers (different) that are identical (same l, r, cost) then we are storing both, and the minimal cost is the same. And we are allowed to use two different vouchers that are identical (if they are distinct) and non-overlapping? \n\n        Example: two vouchers with (l=1, r=2, cost=10) and duration=2. Then x=4, so we look for two vouchers of duration 2. Then, when processing the first one (l=1, r=2, cost=10), we look for a voucher j in duration2 with r_j < 1 -> none, and with l_j > 2 -> none. Similarly for the second one. So they are not non-overlapping? Actually, they are overlapping: [1,2] and [1,2] overlap. So they are invalid.\n\n        But what if we have two vouchers with (l=1, r=2, cost=10) and (l=3, r=4, cost=10) in duration=2, and x=4. Then, when processing the first one (l=1, r=2, cost=10), we look for duration2: \n            Case1: r_j < 1 -> none.\n            Case2: l_j > 2 -> then the second voucher has l_j=3>2 -> valid. Then candidate2 = 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n        Then, processing the second one: \n            Case1: r_j (which is 4) < 3? -> no.\n            Case2: l_j (which is 3) > 2? -> yes, but wait, we are processing the second one (l=3, r=4) and we look for duration2: \n                Case1: r_j (which is the second one's r=4) < 3? -> no.\n                Case2: l_j (the second one's l=3) > 4? -> no.\n\n        Why did we not get the pair from the second one's perspective? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the second voucher (when processed) is: \n            We are looking for a voucher j (duration2) that either has r_j < 3 (the second voucher's l=3) OR l_j > 4 (the second voucher's r=4).\n\n            For case1: r_j < 3 -> the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping and querying the vouchers based on their durations and temporal constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers of a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Preprocessing for Queries**: For each duration, we preprocess two data structures:\n   - **DS1**: A structure sorted by the end day (`r`) of the voucher, along with a prefix minimum cost array. This allows us to quickly find the cheapest voucher ending before a given day.\n   - **DS2**: A structure sorted by the start day (`l`) of the voucher, along with a suffix minimum cost array. This allows us to quickly find the cheapest voucher starting after a given day.\n3. **Querying for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we determine the required complementary duration (`x - current_duration`). Using the preprocessed structures, we check if there exists a voucher of the complementary duration that does not overlap with the current voucher (either ending before it starts or starting after it ends). We then compute the minimal total cost for valid pairs.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimal total cost across all valid pairs is our answer. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index]); r = int(data[index+1]); cost_i = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        d = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_i, d))\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for (l, r, cost_i, d) in vouchers:\n        if d not in groups:\n            groups[d] = []\n        groups[d].append((l, r, cost_i))\n        \n    ds1 = {}\n    ds2 = {}\n    \n    for d, lst in groups.items():\n        events_r = sorted([(r, cost_i) for (l, r, cost_i) in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        if events_r:\n            prefix_min = [events_r[0][1]]\n            for i in range(1, len(events_r)):\n                prefix_min.append(min(prefix_min[-1], events_r[i][1]))\n            ds1[d] = (events_r, prefix_min)\n            \n        events_l = sorted([(l, cost_i) for (l, r, cost_i) in lst], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        if events_l:\n            suffix_min = [0] * len(events_l)\n            suffix_min[-1] = events_l[-1][1]\n            for i in range(len(events_l)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], events_l[i][1])\n            ds2[d] = (events_l, suffix_min)\n            \n    best = 10**18\n    \n    for (l_i, r_i, cost_i, d_i) in vouchers:\n        d2 = x - d_i\n        if d2 < 0:\n            continue\n            \n        candidate1 = None\n        candidate2 = None\n        \n        if d2 in ds1:\n            events_r_d2, prefix_min_d2 = ds1[d2]\n            if events_r_d2:\n                r_list = [ev[0] for ev in events_r_d2]\n                pos = bisect.bisect_left(r_list, l_i)\n                if pos > 0:\n                    min_cost = prefix_min_d2[pos-1]\n                    candidate1 = cost_i + min_cost\n                    \n        if d2 in ds2:\n            events_l_d2, suffix_min_d2 = ds2[d2]\n            if events_l_d2:\n                l_list = [ev[0] for ev in events_l_d2]\n                pos = bisect.bisect_right(l_list, r_i)\n                if pos < len(events_l_d2):\n                    min_cost = suffix_min_d2[pos]\n                    candidate2 = cost_i + min_cost\n                    \n        if candidate1 is not None:\n            if candidate1 < best:\n                best = candidate1\n                \n        if candidate2 is not None:\n            if candidate2 < best:\n                best = candidate2\n                \n    if best == 10**18:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration into a dictionary where each key is a duration and the value is a list of vouchers of that duration.\n3. **Preprocessing Structures**: For each duration, two structures are built:\n   - **DS1**: Sorted by end day (`r`) with a prefix minimum cost array to quickly find the cheapest voucher ending before a given day.\n   - **DS2**: Sorted by start day (`l`) with a suffix minimum cost array to quickly find the cheapest voucher starting after a given day.\n4. **Querying for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, the complementary duration (`x - current_duration`) is calculated.
