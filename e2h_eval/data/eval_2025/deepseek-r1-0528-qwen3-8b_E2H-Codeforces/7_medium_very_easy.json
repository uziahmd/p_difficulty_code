The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are to determine if there exists an integer k > 1 such that a snowflake with n vertices can be constructed.\n\nHow is the snowflake constructed?\n- Start with one vertex (step 0).\n- Then, at least one step: \n   Step 1: initial vertex (degree 0 so far) is connected to k new vertices. Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n   Step 2: each vertex that currently has degree 1 (the leaves) will connect to k new vertices. But note: the initial vertex already has degree k, so it doesn't do anything in step 2. However, in the next steps, we have multiple layers.\n\nBut note: the process is done at least once (so we must do the first step). Then, we can do more steps.\n\nLet's denote:\n  Let m be the number of steps (at least 1).\n\nAt step 1: \n   vertices = 1 + k\n\nAt step 2:\n   Each leaf from step 1 (there are k leaves) adds k new vertices. So we add k * k vertices. Then the total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nAt step 3:\n   Now the leaves are the ones added in step 2, which are k^2 leaves. Each adds k new vertices, so we add k^3. Total: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nSo after m steps, the total number of vertices is: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k new vertices. And we do this step at least once.\n\nHowever, note that the initial step (step 1) is mandatory and then we can do more steps (at least one time, but we can do more). So m>=1.\n\nBut wait: what about the structure? The initial vertex is the center. Then the next layer is the first ring. Then the second ring, etc.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not require that we do exactly m steps. It says \"at least once\", meaning we must do the first step and then we can do as many additional steps as we want.\n\nTherefore, for a fixed k>1, the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some m>=1.\n\nBut note: the problem does not fix m. We are allowed to choose m (as long as m>=1) and k (as long as k>1) such that n equals the sum above.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we are looking for integers k>1 and integer m>=1 such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: we can also consider that we stop after m steps. However, the problem allows stopping at any m>=1.\n\nBut note: the example input and output:\n\nInput: 9 test cases: [1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101,1000000000000000000]\n\nOutput: \nNO, NO, NO, NO, YES, YES, YES, YES, NO\n\nLet's check:\n\nn=1: \n   We need at least one step (m>=1). Then the minimal n is 1+k (with k>=2) -> at least 3. So 1 is not possible.\n\nn=2: similarly, minimal n is 3 (for k=2: 1+2=3) so 2 is not possible.\n\nn=3: \n   With k=2: 1+2 = 3 -> so m=1. Then yes.\n\nBut wait, the example output says for n=3: \"NO\", but according to our reasoning, n=3 should be \"YES\".\n\nWait, let me double-check the example output:\n\nExample output: \n['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\nSo the fourth test case is 6 -> NO, fifth is 13 -> YES.\n\nBut wait, the example input is:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSo the first four numbers are 1,2,3,6.\n\nAccording to the example output, they are all NO.\n\nBut for n=3: \n   We can have k=2 and m=1: total vertices = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThen why is n=3 NO?\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again:\n\n\"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the first step is done (we have 1+k vertices). Then the condition says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning the entire process (which includes the first step) must be done at least once. But then the problem says \"After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.\"\n\nWait, but note: the construction rule says:\n\n- Initially, the graph has one vertex.\n- Then, the first step: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (so now we have 1+k). Then, the step of adding to leaves is done at least once. \n\nBut the first step is part of the process? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Step 1: initial vertex (connected to nothing) is connected to k new vertices (so k>1). Then, the step (adding to leaves) is done at least once.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). \n   Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step (initial connection) is mandatory, and then the second step (adding to leaves) is also mandatory (at least once). Therefore, we must do the second step at least once. That means the minimal snowflake has two layers: the center, the first ring, and then the second ring (because the leaves from the first ring must be extended).\n\nWait, that would change everything.\n\nBut the example figure shows the smallest snowflake for k=4. Let me describe:\n\n   Center: 1 node.\n   First ring: 4 nodes (connected to center).\n   Then, each of these 4 nodes must have k (4) new children? Then we get 4*4=16 more nodes. But the figure shows a snowflake with 1 (center) + 4 (first ring) + 4*4 (second ring) = 21 nodes? Actually, the figure might show two rings.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once\". The step is: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" \n\nIn the first step, we have the center and the k new nodes. The center now has degree k (so not 1) and the k new nodes have degree 1. Then the next step (at least one time) requires that we take each of those k leaves and add k new children to each. Then we have k*k new nodes.\n\nSo the minimal snowflake (with two layers) has:\n\n   n_min = 1 + k + k*k.\n\nAnd we must have k>1.\n\nBut wait, the example output says for n=3: NO. \n\nNow, if k=2, then minimal n is 1+2+4 = 7. Then how did we get 3? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the entire process must include the first step (which gives 1+k) and then the second step (which gives 1+k+k*k). Therefore, the minimal number of vertices is 1+k+k^2, and k>1.\n\nBut wait, the example input n=13: \n   We need to find k>1 and m>=1 (but note: we must do the second step at least once, so m>=2) such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) and m>=2.\n\nActually, wait: the process description:\n\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: add k new vertices to the center -> total 1+k.\n   Then, the step (adding to leaves) is done at least once -> so we must do step 2: which adds k*k vertices -> total 1+k+k^2.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the maximum number of steps. So we can do more than two steps. \n\nSo the general formula is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m>=2 (because the first step is mandatory and then the second step is mandatory at least once, so we have at least two layers beyond the center? Actually, no: the first step is the center and the first ring, and the second step is the second ring. So the number of layers is m+1 (from the center being layer0, then layer1, layer2,...,layer m). \n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. The first step (initial connection) is separate. So the minimal configuration has two layers (center and one ring from the first step, and then the second step adds the second ring). So the minimal n is 1+k+k^2, and k>1.\n\nBut wait, the example output:\n\n   n=13: YES\n   n=15: YES\n   n=255: YES\n   n=10101: YES\n   n=1000000000000000000: NO\n\nNow, let's check n=13:\n\nWe need to write 13 as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m for some k>1 and m>=2.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that we stop at two layers. We can have more layers. However, the minimal configuration is two layers (m=2) because we must do the second step at least once.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do the leaf expansion at least once. So m (the exponent) must be at least 2 (so the geometric series goes up to k^2).\n\nBut actually, the geometric series is defined by the number of expansions. The initial vertex is the center. Then we do:\n\n   Expansion 1: we add k nodes (now 1+k)\n   Expansion 2: we add k^2 nodes (now 1+k+k^2)\n   Expansion 3: we add k^3 nodes (then 1+k+k^2+k^3)\n\nSo the number of expansions (steps) is m, and the total vertices is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1). And we require m>=1 (because we must do the second step at least once, so m>=1 expansion beyond the center? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   Step 1: initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (this is the first expansion).\n   Then, the step (of adding to leaves) is done at least once (so that's the second expansion).\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 2 (meaning we have two expansions: the first and the second). So the minimal n is (k^3-1)/(k-1) for k>1.\n\nWait, let's reindex:\n\n   After 0 expansions: 1 vertex.\n   After 1 expansion (first step): 1+k.\n   After 2 expansions (first and then the mandatory second step): 1+k+k^2.\n\nBut the problem says the first expansion is mandatory (k>1) and then the second expansion (adding to leaves) is mandatory at least once. So we must have at least two expansions. Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\nBut then for n=3: 1+k+k^2 = 3. Then k^2+k-2=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(1+8) )/2 = ( -1±3)/2 -> k=1 (not allowed) or k=-2 (invalid). So n=3 is not representable.\n\nSimilarly, n=6: \n   We need 1+k+k^2 <= 6, and k>1.\n\n   k=2: 1+2+4=7 -> too big.\n   k=3: 1+3+9=13 -> too big.\n\n   But wait, we can have more expansions? Actually, no: the minimal n for k=2 is 7, which is greater than 6. So no representation for 6.\n\nBut wait, what if we do more than two expansions? Then the total n would be 1+k+k^2+...+k^m for m>=2. \n\nFor example, for n=13, we can have:\n\n   Option 1: two layers (m=2): 1+k+k^2 = 13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(49))/2 = ( -1±7)/2 -> k=3 (since k>1). Then 1+3+9=13 -> valid.\n\n   Option 2: three layers: 1+k+k^2+k^3 = 13 -> k^3+k^2+k-12=0. For k=2: 8+4+2-12=2, not zero. k=1 is not allowed. So only two layers.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require minimal layers, just that the same n can be represented by some k>1 and some m>=2.\n\nNow, let's check n=15:\n\n   Two layers: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(57))/2 -> not integer.\n\n   Three layers: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0.\n\n      k=2: 8+4+2=14 -> 1+14=15? Wait, the total is 1+k+k^2+k^3 = 1+2+4+8=15. Yes, k=2 and m=3 (three layers: center, then two expansions beyond the center? Actually, the expansions are two: the first expansion (to k) and then two more expansions (to k^2 and k^3). But wait, the problem says the second expansion (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So we must have at least two expansions (so m>=2). Here we have m=3 (exponents go up to 3) so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: the first step (expansion 1) is mandatory, then the step (expansion) must be done at least once. So we must have expansion 1 and expansion 2 (at least two expansions). However, we can have more. So m (number of expansions) must be at least 2.\n\nBut note: the formula for the total vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for m>=1 (if we count expansions) OR m>=2 (if we consider the minimal number of expansions is 2)? \n\nActually, the problem says:\n\n   Step 1: center connects to k new (that's expansion 1).\n   Step 2: each leaf (from expansion 1) connects to k new (expansion 2) -> mandatory.\n\n   Then, we can do expansion 3, 4, etc.\n\nSo the total number of expansions is m, and we require m>=2 (meaning we have at least two expansions: expansion1 and expansion2). Then the total vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1))   ??? \n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire process as having m+1 layers (from 0 to m). Then:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the geometric series from k^0 to k^m is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1). \n\nBut we require m>=1 (because we have at least two expansions, so the exponents go from 0 to m, and m>=1? Actually, no: the expansions are the steps beyond the center. The center is the 0th layer. Then:\n\n   Layer0: 1\n   Layer1: k\n   Layer2: k^2\n   ...\n   Layerm: k^m\n\nTotal layers = m+1, and the number of expansions is m (each expansion adds a layer). The condition is that we must have at least two layers (center and one ring) and then the second expansion (so at least two expansions, i.e., m>=2). \n\nBut wait, the first expansion adds the first ring (layer1) and the second expansion adds the second ring (layer2). So we require m>=2 (because we have two expansions). Then the total layers is 3 (layers0,1,2). Then the total vertices is:\n\n   n = (k^3 - 1) / (k-1)   for two expansions (m=2) OR\n\n   More generally, for m expansions (with m>=2), n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the problem does not fix the number of expansions. We can have m from 2 to infinity (in theory) but n is given and we are working with very large n (up to 10^18).\n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n   Given n, does there exist an integer k>1 and an integer m>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the minimal representation is for m=2: then n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not require the entire process to stop at two expansions. We can have more. \n\nBut there is another possibility: what if we use a different base? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"There exists such k>1\", so k can be any integer greater than 1.\n\nNow, we must check for a given n (which can be as large as 10^18) whether there exists k>1 and m>=2 such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\nBut note: we cannot iterate over k from 2 to ... because k can be very large. Also, m is at least 2.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe know that for a fixed m (number of expansions, so m>=2) and k>1, the total n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\nBut note: the minimal value for a fixed m is when k=2: n_min(m) = (2^(m+1)-1).\n\nAlso, for a fixed m, we can solve for k: we are looking for integer k>1 such that (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut note: we can also consider the reverse: for a fixed m (which we don't know) and k (which we don't know). How to iterate?\n\nNote: m is at least 2, and the total n is fixed. Since n can be up to 10^18, we cannot iterate m from 2 to ... until k^m exceeds n.\n\nBut note: the minimal base is 2, and for base 2 the total n is (2^(m+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(m+1)-1.\n\nSo for a fixed m, we require:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) >= 2^(m+1)-1.\n\nAnd k must be an integer greater than 1.\n\nHow can we check for a given n? \n\nWe can consider:\n\n   Case 1: n < 7 (since the minimal n for m=2 and k=2 is 7). Then n cannot be represented because the smallest snowflake has 7 vertices.\n\n   But wait, what about m=2 and k=2: 1+2+4=7. Then for n=7: YES.\n\n   What about n=13? We found k=3 and m=2: 1+3+9=13.\n\n   However, note: we can also have more layers. For example, n=15: k=2 and m=3: 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nBut note: we can also consider m=3 and k=2: 15.\n\nHow to solve for arbitrary n?\n\nObservation:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (m>=2)\n\n   => n*(k-1) = k^(m+1) - 1.\n\nBut note: we can also express:\n\n   n = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... ))   (m+1 times)\n\nBut we can try to bound the parameters.\n\nSince n can be as large as 10^18, we can consider:\n\n   The minimal n for a given m (and k=2) is 2^(m+1)-1.\n\n   The maximal k for a fixed m: we require k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1. But that is circular.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix the number of layers (m+1) from 3 to ... until the minimal n (for k=2) is greater than 10^18. \n\nWhat is the maximal m? \n\n   For m+1=3: minimal n=7 (k=2)\n   For m+1=4: minimal n=15 (k=2)\n   ...\n\n   We need to consider m from 2 (so m+1=3) up to the point where even k=2 gives n_min = 2^(m+1)-1 > 10^18.\n\n   Let's compute: 2^(m+1) > 10^18.\n\n   m+1 >= log2(10^18) ≈ 60. So m can be up to about 60.\n\nBut note: for a fixed m (number of expansions, so the exponent is m+1), we have:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe are to check if there exists an integer k>1 such that the equation holds.\n\nBut note: for a fixed m, the function f(k) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1.\n\nSo for a fixed m, we can binary search for k? But k is an integer and the equation is non-linear.\n\nBut note: m is at most about 60, and k must be at least 2 and at most around n^(1/m) (since k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1, but roughly k^(m+1) ~ n*k, so k^m ~ n).\n\nBut n can be 10^18, so k is at most around 10^(18/m). For m=2, k is at most around sqrt(n) which is 10^9, which is too big to iterate.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, note:\n\n   We can express the equation as:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n   and note that for k=2, we have the minimal n for that m.\n\n   Then for a fixed m, we can check the equation for k=2,3,... until k^(m) is about n. But the range of k for a fixed m is from 2 to floor(n^(1/m)) (approximately). But for m=2, k can be up to 10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\nAnother idea: for a fixed m, we can use binary search on k (over the range [2, ceil(n^(1/m))]) and check if (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) == n.\n\nBut note: we cannot compute k^(m+1) for k=10^9 and m=2: that's 10^18 which is acceptable for exponentiation? But wait, m is the number of expansions (so the exponent is m+1). For m=2, exponent=3, so k^3. For k=10^9, k^3 = 10^27, which is too big for integers? Actually, in Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but we are limited by the exponentiation time and memory. However, n is only up to 10^18, so if k^3 > n, then we don't need to check that k.\n\nBut note: we are iterating k from 2 to about n^(1/m). For m=2, we are iterating k from 2 to about sqrt(n) which is 10^9, and for each k we do an exponentiation to the power of 3 (which is O(1) for fixed exponent). Then 10^9 iterations per test case, and t up to 10000 test cases -> 10^9 * 10^4 = 10^13 operations, which is too slow.\n\nWe need to avoid iterating over k.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say n up to 10^18 and t up to 10000.\n\nWe cannot iterate over k for each test case.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n   Notice that the equation for a fixed m (with m>=2) and integer k>1:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   => n*(k-1) = k^(m+1) - 1\n\n   => k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   Now, for fixed m, we can try to solve for k. Note that k must be an integer.\n\n   We can consider: for each m (from 2 up to about 60), we can try to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   But note: we can rearrange:\n\n        k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   This is a polynomial equation. However, we can use binary search for k for a fixed m.\n\n   Steps for fixed m and n:\n\n        We know k is at least 2 and at most floor((n-1)^(1/(m))) but actually from the equation k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1, so k^(m+1) is roughly n*k, so k^m ~ n.\n\n        So k is approximately n^(1/m). \n\n        We can set:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = min(10**6, int(round(n**(1/m)))+10)   # but n can be 10^18, and m is at least 2, so 10^18**(1/2)=10^9, which is too big.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            We know that k^m <= n (because the series has m+1 terms, but actually the last term is k^m, and the whole sum is about k^m/(k-1) which is less than k^m * (1/(k-1)) and we don't know k). \n\n        Another idea: since k must be an integer, we can try to check k from 2 to a limit. But the limit is about n^(1/m). For m=2, that's 10^9 which is too big.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Observe: for a fixed m, the equation:\n\n            k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        We can use Newton's method? But we don't need to, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, ceil(n**(1/m))+1] but the upper bound is too high.\n\n        Alternatively, note that k must divide (n*(k-1)+1) in the sense of the equation. But that is circular.\n\n        Or we can use the fact that k is the base and the equation is:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        We can compute the right-hand side and then take the (m+1)-th root? But that is floating point and we are dealing with integers.\n\n        How about: for each m from 2 to 60 (since m+1<=61, so we can do up to 60), we can try to find k by:\n\n            Let k_low = 2\n            Let k_high = None\n\n        But we can set k_high = 10**6? But wait, for m=2, k_high must be at least sqrt(n) (if n is 10^18, then sqrt(10^18)=10^9) so we cannot set k_high to 10**6.\n\n        We must use the equation to bound k.\n\n        From the equation: k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We know k^(m+1) <= n*k (since n*(k-1)+1 <= n*k) so k^m <= n.\n\n        Therefore, k <= n**(1/m).\n\n        For m=2: k <= sqrt(n) -> 10^9 for n=10^18 -> too big to iterate.\n\n        But note: we don't need to iterate for all k. We can use a while loop for each m that only checks the k that are near the solution. However, we are not required to find the exact k, we just need to know if there exists one.\n\n        Another idea: we can check for a fixed m without iterating over k by using the fact that k must be an integer and the equation is k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can try to compute k0 = round( (n)**(1/m) )? But that is not accurate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: for a fixed m, the function f(k) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) is increasing for k>1. So if we can compute k_min and k_max such that:\n\n            f(2) = 2^(m+1)-1 <= n, and then we can binary search for the k such that f(k) = n.\n\n        But note: we are given n and we want to know if there exists a k such that f(k)=n.\n\n        Steps for fixed m (from 2 to 60):\n\n            We know k_min = 2, and k_max = None.\n\n            We can set k_max = 10**6 initially? But wait, for m=2, k_max must be at least 10^9 for n=10^18.\n\n        We need to set k_max = min(10**6, ...) but then we might miss solutions for k>10**6.\n\n        However, note: for k>=2, the minimal n for a fixed m is f(2) = (2^(m+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(m+1)-1.\n\n        Then, if n < 2^(m+1)-1, then there is no solution for this m.\n\n        Also, for k_max, we can set:\n\n            k_max = 2\n            while f(k_max) < n:\n                k_max += 1\n\n        But then we iterate k from 2 to k_max, and k_max might be 10^9 for m=2 and n=10^18, which is too slow.\n\n        We need to use binary search for k for a fixed m.\n\n        Steps for fixed m:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = 10**18  # but k is at most n**(1/m) which is 10^9 for m=2, but we cannot set high to 10^18 because then the exponentiation k^(m+1) would be too big.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n\n            high = 10**6  # but that would be too low for m=2 and n=10^18.\n\n        We need to set high = int(round(n**(1/m))) + 10   but for m=2, n=10^18, then n**(1/2)=10^9, and then we set high=10^9+10, and then we do a binary search in the range [2, 10^9] for m=2, which is about 30 iterations (log2(10^9) is about 30). Then we can do for each m (from 2 to 60) and each test case, we do 60 * 30 = 1800 iterations per test case.\n\n        Then for 10^4 test cases, 10^4 * 1800 = 18e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, we are doing 60 * 30 = 1800 iterations per test case, and 10^4 test cases -> 1800 * 10000 = 18e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        However, we must be cautious because each iteration involves computing k^(m+1) for k up to 10^9 and m+1 up to 61. \n\n        But note: k^(m+1) for k=10^9 and m+1=61 is (10^9)^61 = 10^549, which is a very big number and might be too slow or use too much memory.\n\n        But note: we are doing this for each test case and for each m from 2 to 60. However, we can break early for a given m if n is less than the minimal value for that m (which is 2^(m+1)-1). \n\n        Also, we can break the inner binary search if the computed value (k^(m+1)) becomes too big (exceeds n*(k-1)+1) but note we are trying to solve k^(m+1)=n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid computing k^(m+1) for very large k by checking the bounds.\n\n        Steps for a fixed m and fixed n:\n\n            If n < (2^(m+1)-1): then no solution for this m.\n\n            Then, set low_k = 2, high_k = None.\n\n            How to set high_k? \n\n            We know k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n            We can set high_k = min(10**6, int(n**(1/m)) + 10)   ? But for m=2, n=10^18, then 10^9 is too big to set as high_k.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set high_k to the minimum between 10**6 and the (m+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, but k is unknown.\n\n            But note: we can set an upper bound for k: \n\n                k^(m+1) <= n*k   (since n*(k-1)+1 <= n*k)\n\n                => k^m <= n\n\n                => k <= n**(1/m)\n\n            So we can set high_k = min(10**18, int(n**(1/m)) + 10)\n\n            However, n**(1/m) for n=10^18 and m=2 is 10^9, which is acceptable as an integer but we cannot iterate from 2 to 10^9.\n\n            Instead, we use binary search. The binary search will run in O(log(n**(1/m))) which is about log(10^9) = 30 steps for m=2.\n\n            But the exponentiation k^(m+1) for k=10^9 and m=2: that's (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is a big integer but Python can handle it, but we are doing 30 steps per m and per test case, and 60*m per test case, so 60*30=1800 exponentiations per test case, and each exponentiation is for exponents up to 61 (for m=60, exponent=61) and base k which can be up to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a central vertex, with each subsequent layer adding \\( k \\) new vertices to each vertex in the previous layer (except the central vertex). The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must satisfy a specific geometric series condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph is built in layers. The central vertex (layer 0) is connected to \\( k \\) new vertices (layer 1). Each vertex in layer 1 must be connected to \\( k \\) new vertices (layer 2), and so on. The total number of vertices after \\( m \\) expansions is given by the geometric series sum \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). Here, \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\) (since at least one expansion beyond the first layer is mandatory).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\) and up to \\( 10^4 \\) test cases, we cannot iterate over all possible \\( k \\) values for each test case. Instead, we:\n   - Iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 2 to a maximum where \\( 2^{m+1} - 1 \\leq n \\)).\n   - For each \\( m \\), use binary search to find if there exists a \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} = n \\).\n   - The binary search bounds are derived from \\( k^m \\leq n \\), ensuring \\( k \\) is within feasible limits.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: For each test case, we check up to \\( \\log_2(n) \\) values of \\( m \\) (since \\( 2^{m+1} - 1 \\) grows exponentially). For each \\( m \\), binary search runs in \\( O(\\log(\\text{high}_k)) \\) time, where \\( \\text{high}_k \\) is \\( n^{1/m} \\). The overall complexity per test case is manageable due to the exponential growth of \\( m \\)'s upper bound.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        m_max = 0\n        base = 2\n        while True:\n            minimal_n = (base ** (m_max + 2)) - 1\n            if minimal_n > n:\n                break\n            m_max += 1\n            \n        for m_val in range(2, m_max + 1):\n            low_k = 2\n            high_k = min(10**18, int(round(n ** (1.0 / m_val))) + 100)\n            \n            if high_k < low_k:\n                continue\n                \n            found_k = None\n            while low_k <= high_k:\n                mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n                try:\n                    total_vertices = (mid_k ** (m_val + 1) - 1) // (mid_k - 1)\n                except Exception as e:\n                    total_vertices = None\n                    \n                if total_vertices == n:\n                    found_k = mid_k\n                    break\n                elif total_vertices < n:\n                    low_k = mid_k + 1\n                else:\n                    high_k = mid_k - 1\n                    \n            if found_k is not None:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph (since the smallest valid graph has 7 vertices for \\( k=2 \\) and \\( m=2 \\)).\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Layers (m)**: For each test case, we determine the maximum number of layers \\( m \\) such that the minimal vertex count \\( 2^{m+1} - 1 \\) does not exceed \\( n \\).\n4. **Binary Search for Base (k)**: For each \\( m \\), perform a binary search to check if there exists a base \\( k > 1 \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\). The search bounds are optimized using \\( n^{1/m} \\).\n5. **Output Result**: For each test case, output \"YES\" if a valid \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) are found, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all feasible configurations without resorting to brute force, leveraging mathematical insights and binary search to handle large numbers.",
