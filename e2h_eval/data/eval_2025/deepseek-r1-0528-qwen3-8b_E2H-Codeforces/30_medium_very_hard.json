Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (1 <= n <= 18) and a string A of exactly 2n digits.\n We have two players, Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number.\n\n The goal is to maximize the total prize: S1 (Homer's number) + S2 (Marge's number).\n\n However, note that the sequence of moves matters. At each turn, one of the players is chosen to move.\n\n Since both players must make exactly n moves, the entire sequence of 2n moves will be a string of n 'H' and n 'M' in some order.\n\n How does the game work?\n   Initially, A is the given 2n-digit string, and both S1 and S2 are empty.\n   For each move (in the order determined by the sequence):\n        Let d = the first character of A.\n        Append d to the current player's number.\n        Remove d from the beginning of A.\n\n But note: the entire process uses all the digits of A. The catch is that the value of the numbers built by the players depends on which digits they get and in what order.\n\n However, observe:\n   The entire set of digits is fixed. The players are going to take turns removing digits from the front and appending them to their own number.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the sequence of moves be represented by a string s of length 2n (each character either 'H' or 'M') with n H's and n M's.\n\n Then, the resulting numbers for Homer and Marge are built as follows:\n\n   Let H_digits = [ the digits taken by H in the order they were taken ]\n   Let M_digits = [ the digits taken by M in the order they were taken ]\n\n Then, Homer's number is the integer formed by concatenating his digits (which is the same as the digit sequence without considering order? Actually, the digits are taken from the front in the order of the sequence, so the first time H moves, he gets the very first digit of A; then later if H moves again, he gets the next available digit (which is now at the front of the remaining string).\n\n But note: the entire A is processed in order. The key is that the digits are taken from the front, so the i-th move (regardless of the player) removes the current front digit.\n\n So, if we consider the entire sequence, the digits that Homer gets are the ones that appear at positions specified by the indices where 'H' appears in the sequence. Similarly for M.\n\n However, the catch is that the digits are removed from the front, so the digit at the j-th position in the original A will only be available until j moves have been made. Therefore, the assignment of digits to players is fixed by the order of moves: the k-th move (counting from 0 to 2n-1) will take the (k)-th digit of A (if we index from 0) but wait: no, because the removal is from the front. Actually, the first move takes the first digit (index0), the second move takes the next (index1), etc.\n\n But note: the sequence of moves does not change the order of the digits that are taken. The entire process is deterministic: the digits are taken from left to right. The only choice is which player takes which digit.\n\n Therefore, the entire set of digits is partitioned: the first n moves (in order) will take the first n digits? Not necessarily: because the moves are interleaved. Actually, the moves are in the order of the sequence. The first move (whatever it is) takes the first digit, the second move (the next in the sequence) takes the second digit, and so on.\n\n This means: \n   The digit that is taken at the i-th move (0-indexed) is the (i)-th digit of A (the one originally at position i).\n\n Now, if we assign a digit (from the original A) to a player, then that player's number is built by the digits they got, in the order they were taken.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n\n   Consider sequence \"HHMM\":\n      Move0: H takes the first digit '1' -> S1 = \"1\", A becomes \"234\"\n      Move1: H takes the next first digit '2' -> S1 = \"12\", A becomes \"34\"\n      Move2: M takes the next first digit '3' -> S2 = \"3\", A becomes \"4\"\n      Move3: M takes the next first digit '4' -> S2 = \"34\"\n\n   Then, Homer's number is 12, Marge's number is 34.\n\n   Consider sequence \"HMHM\":\n      Move0: H takes '1' -> S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n      Move1: M takes '2' -> S2=\"2\", A=\"34\"\n      Move2: H takes '3' -> S1=\"13\", A=\"4\"\n      Move3: M takes '4' -> S2=\"24\"\n\n   Then, Homer's number is 13, Marge's number is 24.\n\n   Total prize in first case: 12 + 34 = 46.\n   Second case: 13 + 24 = 37.\n\n   But wait, the example output for input \"2\\n9911\" is \"HMHM\". So let's check with the example:\n\n   Example input: \n        2\n        9911\n\n   Output: \"HMHM\"\n\n   Let's simulate \"HMHM\" for A=\"9911\":\n        Move0: H takes '9' -> S1=\"9\", A=\"911\"\n        Move1: M takes '9' -> S2=\"9\", A=\"11\"\n        Move2: H takes '1' -> S1=\"91\", A=\"1\"\n        Move3: M takes '1' -> S2=\"91\"\n\n        Total: 91 + 91 = 182.\n\n   Now, what if we use \"HHMM\" for A=\"9911\":\n        Move0: H takes '9' -> S1=\"9\", A=\"911\"\n        Move1: H takes '9' -> S1=\"99\", A=\"11\"\n        Move2: M takes '1' -> S2=\"1\", A=\"1\"\n        Move3: M takes '1' -> S2=\"11\"\n\n        Total: 99 + 11 = 110.\n\n   So clearly \"HMHM\" gives a better total.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We have to assign each digit (from the original A) to either Homer or Marge, but the assignment is constrained by the order: the first digit can be assigned to either, but then the second digit can only be assigned to the next player in the sequence, and so on.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence of moves is determined by the order of H and M. And the total prize is the sum of two numbers: \n   S1 = d0 * 10^(n-1) + d1 * 10^(n-2) + ... (for Homer's digits, in the order they appear, each digit is placed in a power of 10 according to the position in his number)\n   S2 = ... similarly.\n\n But note: the digits are taken from A in order, but the players don't know the entire sequence in advance? Actually, they do (since they know A and they are trying to maximize the total). However, the problem is that the entire sequence must be decided beforehand.\n\n We can think of it as: we are to choose an interleaving of two sequences of length n (each with n moves) such that the digits are taken from the front of A in order.\n\n Then, the total prize is the number formed by the digits assigned to Homer (in the order they appear in A) interpreted as a base-10 number, plus the number formed by the digits assigned to Marge (in the same order) as a base-10 number.\n\n But note: the order in which a player collects their digits is the order of the digits in A. For example, if Homer collects the first, third, and fifth digits, then his number is (first digit) * 100 + (third digit) * 10 + (fifth digit) for n=3.\n\n However, the catch: the digits are taken from the front, so the first digit goes to whoever moves first, the second to the second mover, etc. But the number is built by the order of collection: the first digit collected by a player becomes the most significant.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is independent of the grouping? Not exactly: the assignment of which digits go to which player matters, and the order of moves determines the assignment.\n\n We are free to choose any sequence of 2n moves with n H's and n M's. We want to maximize the total prize.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n is at most 18, the total length is 36, which is manageable by dynamic programming or state space search (with state being the position in A and the counts of moves for each player). However, the state space would be (position, count_H, count_M) but the position goes up to 36, and counts up to 18, so about 36*19*19 ~ 13000 states.\n\n But note: we need to compute the total prize, which is the sum of two numbers. However, the numbers are built by the digits assigned to each player, and the digits are known. But the value of a number built from a set of digits depends on the order (because the more significant digits are the earlier ones). \n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Let the entire sequence be represented by a string s (of length 2n) with n H and n M.\n\n   Then, the digits assigned to Homer are the digits at positions i in A where the move at step i (0-indexed) is 'H'. Similarly for M.\n\n   Then, the number for Homer is the integer formed by the digits at those positions (in increasing order of the index, so the first occurrence is the most significant). But note: the order of the digits in Homer's number is the order of the moves that are H. That is, the digit at the smallest index (the earliest in A) is the most significant.\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   However, the entire set of digits is fixed, and we are just partitioning them. But the catch: the digits are taken in the order of A, so the digit at index i is taken at step i (the i-th move) and then appended to the player who moved at step i.\n\n   Therefore, the value of Homer's number is:\n\n        Let H_positions = sorted([i for i in range(2*n) if s[i]=='H'])\n        Then, Homer's number = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (digit at H_positions[j]) * (10**(n-1-j))\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   Then, total prize = Homer's number + Marge's number.\n\n We wish to maximize this total prize.\n\n However, note that the entire set of digits is fixed, and the assignment is by the sequence s. We are allowed to choose any sequence s with n H's and n M's.\n\n How to find the best sequence? The state space is too large to iterate over all sequences (there are C(2n, n) which for n=18 is about 18!/(9!9!) ~ 48620 many, but 2n=36, so C(36,18) is about 9e9, which is too many to iterate by brute-force.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We can use dynamic programming that considers:\n     - the current index (from 0 to 2n)\n     - the number of moves made by Homer (h_count) and Marge (m_count)\n\n   But then how do we account for the fact that the digits' significance depends on when they are taken? \n\n   Note: The total prize is the sum of two numbers. The two numbers are built from the digits taken by each player. The significance of a digit in a player's number is determined by the number of digits that player has already taken after it (including itself). \n\n   Specifically, if a player has taken k digits so far, then the next digit they take will be placed at the (k)-th most significant position (so multiplied by 10^(n-k-1)).\n\n   However, we don't know the future. But we can use DP that also tracks the current \"place value\" for each player? \n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire process uses all the digits. The total prize can be written as:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(2*n):\n            if s[i] == 'H':\n                # This digit is at position i, and it will be placed in Homer's number at a significance that depends on how many H moves have been made from i onward (until the last H) and also the total length of Homer's number is n, so the position in Homer's number is (number of H moves from 0 to i) (but actually, the digit at the j-th H move (0-indexed) will be multiplied by 10^(n-1-j). \n\n        We can break down the contribution of each digit:\n\n        Let f(i, h, m) be the maximum total prize we can achieve from the remaining part of A (from index i to the end) given that we have already assigned h moves to Homer and m moves to Marge, and we know that the entire sequence must have n moves for each.\n\n        However, we also need to account for the fact that the digits that have been assigned so far have a fixed significance. But wait, the significance of a digit in a player's number is fixed once the entire sequence is known (by the position of the H in the sequence). \n\n        Actually, the value of a digit taken by Homer at a particular move (say the j-th move by Homer) will be multiplied by 10^(n - j - 1). Similarly for Marge.\n\n        So, we can precompute the base value for each digit based on when it is taken by which player.\n\n        However, the problem: we don't know the future moves, so the base value of a digit might change if we assign it to a player and then the player gets more digits? No, because the base value is determined by the total number of moves the player will have (which is fixed: n) and the position of this digit in the player's sequence.\n\n        Specifically, if a player gets k digits so far (and there are still r moves left for that player) then the next digit they take will be the (k)-th digit (0-indexed) and will have a multiplier of 10^(n - k - 1).\n\n        But note: the entire sequence is fixed, so the total number of moves for each player is fixed (n). Therefore, the multiplier for a digit taken by a player is predetermined by the order in which the player takes the digits.\n\n        However, we don't know the order of the moves for the entire game. We only know that the two players will take n moves each.\n\n        The idea: we can consider that the total prize is the sum over all digits of (digit_value * multiplier) where the multiplier depends on the player and the index of that digit in the player's sequence.\n\n        But the multiplier for a digit is fixed once we know the entire sequence. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a DP that goes digit by digit and keeps track of:\n          - the current index (i)\n          - the number of moves already made by Homer (h)\n          - the number of moves already made by Marge (m)\n\n        Then, for the remaining digits (from index i to 2n-1), the multipliers for the digits assigned to Homer (if any) will be 10^(n - (h + k) - 1) for the k-th Homer move (k from 0 to n-h-1). Similarly for Marge.\n\n        However, the multipliers depend on the future moves. \n\n        We can compute the total contribution from a digit if we know the entire assignment. \n\n        Another idea: since the entire set of digits is fixed, we can consider that the total prize is:\n\n          total = 0\n          for j in range(n):   # j from 0 to n-1 for each player\n             total += (digit at the j-th H move) * (10**(n-1-j))\n          for j in range(n):\n             total += (digit at the j-th M move) * (10**(n-1-j))\n\n        But note: the j-th move of a player (meaning the j-th time that player moves) is taken from A at the position that corresponds to the j-th occurrence of that letter in the sequence.\n\n        So, if we decide the entire sequence s, then we can compute the total prize by:\n\n          h_indices = [ i for i, move in enumerate(s) if move=='H' ]\n          m_indices = [ i for i, move in enumerate(s) if move=='M' ]\n\n          Then, \n          s1 = 0\n          for idx, pos in enumerate(h_indices):\n              s1 += int(A[pos]) * (10**(n-1-idx))\n\n          s2 = 0\n          for idx, pos in enumerate(m_indices):\n              s2 += int(A[pos]) * (10**(n-1-idx))\n\n          total = s1 + s2\n\n        We wish to maximize total.\n\n        Now, we can use DP that goes over the positions (from 0 to 2n) and keeps track of:\n          - the current position (i)\n          - the number of H moves so far (h)\n          - the number of M moves so far (m)\n\n        Then, at each state (i, h, m), we consider the next move: either assign the current digit (at index i) to H (if h < n) or to M (if m < n).\n\n        But the problem: the multiplier for a digit depends on the total number of moves that player will have. However, we know that the entire sequence must have n moves for each. Therefore, for a digit assigned to Homer at state (i, h, m), the multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1) - 1) = 10^(n - h - 2)? Actually, no.\n\n        In the entire sequence, the j-th move of a player (0-indexed) will be multiplied by 10^(n-1-j). So if we assign the current digit to Homer, then the next time we assign a digit to Homer, that will be the (h+1)-th move (so j = h) and so on.\n\n        Actually, the current digit (at index i) if assigned to Homer will be the (h)-th digit of Homer (because we are about to do the (h+1)-th move for Homer, so the next one is the h-th in 0-indexed for the h moves that have been done so far? Let me clarify:\n\n          After assigning this digit to Homer, Homer will have h+1 moves. The digits assigned to Homer so far (including this one) are h+1. The significance of this digit is determined by its rank in Homer's moves: it is the (h)-th move (0-indexed, so the first move is the 0-th). Therefore, its multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1) - 1)? \n\n        Wait, no: the first digit taken by Homer (h=0) will be the most significant, so multiplier 10^(n-1). The second (h=1) will be 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n        So, if we are at state (i, h, m) and we assign the current digit (at index i) to Homer, then this digit is the (h)-th digit (0-indexed) for Homer. Then, its multiplier is 10^(n-1-h).\n\n        Similarly, if we assign to Marge, then it is the (m)-th digit for Marge, so multiplier 10^(n-1-m).\n\n        Then, the total contribution from this digit is:\n\n          If we assign to H: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))\n          If we assign to M: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-m))\n\n        But wait, note: the entire sequence must have n moves for each. So even if we are at state (i, h, m) and we assign to H, then the rest of the digits (from i+1 to the end) will be assigned to the remaining moves (n - h - 1 for H and n - m for M). \n\n        However, the rest of the digits will be assigned to the players and the multipliers for the remaining digits for each player are fixed by the number of moves they have left.\n\n        But note: the multipliers for the remaining digits are not fixed because we don't know the order. However, we can break down the total prize as:\n\n          total = (contribution from the current digit) + (contribution from the rest of the digits)\n\n        And the contribution from the rest of the digits depends on how we assign the remaining digits (from i+1 to 2n-1) to the remaining moves.\n\n        But the catch: the multipliers for the remaining digits for a player are determined by the number of moves that player has already made and will make. However, the assignment of the remaining digits is arbitrary (any interleaving with the remaining moves).\n\n        However, we cannot simply precompute the multipliers for the rest because the same digit might be assigned to a player at a different position (thus changing the multiplier). \n\n        But note: the entire set of remaining digits must be assigned to the remaining moves. The total contribution for a player from the remaining digits is independent of the order? Actually no: the order matters because the earlier digits get higher multipliers.\n\n        So, we must assign the remaining digits to the players in such a way that maximizes the total. \n\n        However, we can use a greedy approach? Or we can use DP that accumulates the value.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a DP that goes from left to right and at each step we decide the next move (H or M) and then add the immediate contribution and the future contributions.\n\n        But the future contributions depend on the entire assignment of the remaining digits. We can precompute the maximum total we can get from a given state (i, h, m) by:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = maximum total prize from the substring starting at index i, having already used h moves for H and m moves for M, and with n moves remaining for each.\n\n        Then, at state (i, h, m), if we assign the current digit (A[i]) to H (if h < n), then:\n\n          immediate_contribution = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))   [because this is the h-th move for H (0-indexed)].\n          Then, we have to assign the rest (from i+1 to 2n-1) with h+1 moves for H and m moves for M, so the state becomes (i+1, h+1, m).\n\n          Similarly for M.\n\n        Then, the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = max(\n            (if h < n) then (immediate_contribution_H + dp[i+1][h+1][m]),\n            (if m < n) then (immediate_contribution_M + dp[i+1][h][m+1])\n          )\n\n        Base case: when i == 2n, then we have used all digits. Then, if h==n and m==n, then dp[2n][n][n] = 0. Otherwise, invalid.\n\n        However, note: we are processing exactly 2n digits, and we require that we use n moves for each, so at i=2n, we must have h=n and m=n.\n\n        The state space: i from 0 to 36 (2n+1 states), h from 0 to n (n+1 states), m from 0 to n (n+1 states). So total states: (2n+1)*(n+1)*(n+1) <= 37*19*19 ~ 13000.\n\n        But the exponentiation: we have to compute 10**(n-1-h) for h from 0 to n-1. Since n<=18, we can precompute these powers.\n\n        However, note: the exponent is (n-1-h) and h can be from 0 to n-1, so the exponents are from 0 to n-1. We can precompute:\n\n          power_h = [10**x for x in range(n)]   # but we need exponents from 0 to n-1, but note: the first move (h=0) uses exponent n-1, then n-2, etc.\n\n        Actually, the exponent for the j-th move (0-indexed) is (n-1-j). So for a move by H at state h (meaning we have done h moves for H so far, then the next move for H is the (h)-th move (so j=h) and the exponent is (n-1-h). Similarly for M.\n\n        But wait, if we have done h moves for H so far, then the next move for H (if we assign this digit to H) is the (h)-th move (so j=h) and the exponent is (n-1-h). Similarly for M.\n\n        However, note: the exponent for the j-th move is 10^(n-1-j). The j-th move is the (h+1)-th move for H? Actually, no: the h we have is the count of moves already made. So the next move (if we assign to H) will be the (h)-th move (because we are going to have h+1 moves, and the next one is the h-th in 0-indexed). \n\n        Actually, the state h is the number of moves already made by H. Then, if we assign the current digit to H, then this digit is the (h)-th move (0-indexed) for H. Then, the multiplier is 10^(n-1-h).\n\n        Similarly for M.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Precompute a table dp[i][h][m] for i in [0, 2n], h in [0, n], m in [0, n].\n\n          Precompute a list of powers: \n            power[k] = 10**(n-1-k) for k in range(n)   [for k from 0 to n-1]\n\n          Then, for i from 2n-1 down to 0, and for h from 0 to n, m from 0 to n:\n\n            Let option1 = -infinity, option2 = -infinity.\n\n            If h < n:\n                digit_val = int(A[i])\n                contribution_H = digit_val * power[h]   # because h is the count of H moves so far, so the next H move is the h-th (0-indexed) so exponent is (n-1-h) -> wait, no: the exponent should be (n-1 - (h))? \n\n            But wait: our power array was defined for k from 0 to n-1, and we want the j-th move (0-indexed) to have exponent (n-1-j). Here, j = h (the current count of H moves is h, so the next move is the h-th move, so j=h). Then, we need exponent (n-1-h). However, note: if h is 0, then exponent is n-1; if h is 1, then n-2, etc.\n\n            But our power array: \n                power[0] = 10**(n-1)   [correct for the first move]\n                power[1] = 10**(n-2)   [correct for the second move]\n\n            So we can define:\n\n                power[k] = 10**(n-1-k)   for k in range(0, n)\n\n            Then, if we assign to H, the multiplier is power[h] (because h is the index in the sequence for H, from 0 to n-1).\n\n            Similarly for M: multiplier is power[m] (because m is the count of M moves so far, so the next M move is the m-th, so exponent n-1-m).\n\n            However, wait: the state (i, h, m) has already used h moves for H and m moves for M. Then, the next move for H is the (h)-th move (0-indexed) so we use power[h]. Similarly for M.\n\n            But note: the state h and m are the counts of moves so far. Then, the next move for H will be the (h)-th move (so the first move is h=0, then h=1, etc.). This is correct.\n\n          Then, the recurrence:\n\n            if h < n:\n                val1 = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))   # This is power[h] if we precomputed for h from 0 to n-1. But note: h can be from 0 to n-1, so we can precompute a list of powers for exponents from 0 to n-1 (for the H moves) and similarly for M.\n\n            However, we have to be cautious: the exponent for the j-th move is 10^(n-1-j). The j-th move for H is the (h)-th move (0-indexed) so j = h, so exponent = n-1-h.\n\n            Similarly, for M: exponent = n-1-m.\n\n            But note: the entire game uses all 2n digits, and the multipliers for the digits are fixed by the position (the move index) in the respective player's sequence.\n\n            Then, we set:\n\n                dp[i][h][m] = maximum of:\n                  (if h < n) then: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h)) + dp[i+1][h+1][m]\n                  (if m < n) then: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-m)) + dp[i+1][h][m+1]\n\n            And we need to compute dp[2n][n][n] = 0.\n\n            Then, we can reconstruct the sequence by backtracking.\n\n        However, the problem: the exponentiation 10**(n-1-h) might be expensive if we do it repeatedly, but n<=18 so we can precompute a list:\n\n            Let power = [10**(n-1-i) for i in range(n)]\n\n        Then, use power[h] for H and power[m] for M.\n\n        But note: the state h and m must be less than n. And we are iterating h from 0 to n and m from 0 to n.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Precomputation:\n            n_val = n (given)\n            total_length = 2 * n_val\n            A_str = the input string\n\n            power = [10**(n_val-1-i) for i in range(n_val)]\n\n          Then, we set up a DP table (3D) of dimensions [total_length+1] x [n_val+1] x [n_val+1]\n\n          We'll use bottom-up (from i=total_length down to 0) or top-down? Actually, we can do backward from the end.\n\n          Initialize dp[total_length][n_val][n_val] = 0.\n\n          Then, for i from total_length-1 down to 0, for h from 0 to n_val, for m from 0 to n_val:\n\n            dp[i][h][m] = -10**18  (a very small number) initially.\n\n            Then, consider the two options:\n\n            Option 1: assign A_str[i] to H (if h < n_val)\n                term1 = int(A_str[i]) * (power[h] if h < n_val else 0)   # but h from 0 to n_val-1 is valid for H\n                Then, dp[i][h][m] = max(dp[i][h][m], term1 + dp[i+1][h+1][m])\n\n            Option 2: assign A_str[i] to M (if m < n_val)\n                term2 = int(A_str[i]) * (power[m] if m < n_val else 0)\n                Then, dp[i][h][m] = max(dp[i][h][m], term2 + dp[i+1][h][m+1])\n\n            But note: if both conditions are true, we take the max.\n\n          Then, we also need to record the decision at each state to reconstruct the sequence.\n\n        However, note: the state (i, h, m) is defined for the current index i and the counts h and m. The digit at i is fixed, and then we move to i+1.\n\n        Then, after computing dp[0][0][0], we can backtrack to find the sequence.\n\n        But note: the above recurrence assumes that we can arbitrarily assign the remaining digits. However, we must ensure that we do not exceed n moves for each.\n\n        Also, we must consider that the entire string must be assigned.\n\n        The state (i, h, m) must satisfy that h+m = i (because we are processing one digit per move). Actually, no: because we are processing from left to right, so at step i (0-indexed) we have processed i+1 digits? Actually, we are at the i-th digit (0-indexed) and we haven't processed it yet. Then, the condition is that h+m == i? \n\n        Actually, we are at state (i, h, m) meaning we have processed the first i digits, and we have h moves for H and m moves for M, so h+m = i. \n\n        Therefore, we can also use that condition to reduce the state space.\n\n        We can iterate i from 0 to total_length, and then h from 0 to min(i, n_val) and m = i - h, but wait: no, because the moves can be interleaved arbitrarily, so we might have h+m = i, but we are storing h and m separately. Actually, we don't need to store m if we use h and i to compute m? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          dp[i][h] = maximum total prize from the substring starting at index i, having already used h moves for H and then M moves is i - h? \n\n        But wait: we have two constraints: we must have exactly n moves for each. And we are processing i digits, so the moves so far for H and M must be h and m, and h+m = i. \n\n        Then, we can use a 2D DP: dp[i][h] for i in [0, total_length] and h in [0, min(i, n_val)] (then m = i - h).\n\n        Then, the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i][h] = max(\n            (if h < n_val) then: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h)) + dp[i+1][h+1],\n            (if i-h < n_val) then: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-(i-h))) + dp[i+1][h]\n          )\n\n        But wait, the multiplier for M is determined by the count of M moves so far, which is m = i-h (because we have processed i digits and h moves for H, so M has i-h moves so far). Then, the next move for M (if we assign the current digit to M) would be the (i-h)-th move for M? \n\n        Actually, no: the count of M moves so far is m = i-h (because we have processed i digits and h by H, so i-h by M). Then, the next move for M (if we assign the current digit to M) is the (i-h)-th move (0-indexed) for M, so the exponent is (n-1 - (i-h)).\n\n        However, note: the state (i, h) implies that the next move (if we assign the current digit to M) is the (i-h)-th move for M. But wait, the next move is the (i-h)-th move for M? \n\n        Actually, the moves for M so far are i-h, so the next move (if we assign to M) is the (i-h)-th move (0-indexed) for M. \n\n        But then, the multiplier for M is 10**(n-1 - (i-h)).\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the entire sequence must have n moves for each. So we must not assign beyond n moves.\n\n        Conditions for the two options:\n\n          Option 1: assign to H: then we require h < n, and then the next state is (i+1, h+1). The multiplier is 10**(n-1-h).\n\n          Option 2: assign to M: then we require i-h < n (i.e., the number of M moves so far is i-h, and we need to have i-h < n) and then the next state is (i+1, h) and the multiplier is 10**(n-1 - (i-h)).\n\n        Then, the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i][h] = max(\n            (if h < n) then: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h)) + dp[i+1][h+1],\n            (if i-h < n)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from the left end of a given number A. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves (comprising 'H' for Homer and 'M' for Marge) such that each player makes exactly n moves, and the sum of their resulting numbers is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the digits of the number A into two sequences (one for each player) by interleaving their moves. Each digit's contribution to the final sum depends on its position in the respective player's sequence. The challenge is to find the optimal interleaving sequence that maximizes the sum of the two numbers formed by the players.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state is defined by the current digit index and the number of moves each player has made so far. The DP table `dp[i][h]` stores the maximum achievable prize from the substring starting at index `i`, given that Homer has made `h` moves.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each digit at position `i`, we consider two options:\n   - Assign the digit to Homer if he hasn't used all his moves. The digit's value is multiplied by \\(10^{(n-1-h)}\\) (based on its position in Homer's sequence).\n   - Assign the digit to Marge if she hasn't used all her moves. The digit's value is multiplied by \\(10^{(n-1-m)}\\), where `m` is the number of moves Marge has made so far (which is `i - h`).\n\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the start to reconstruct the sequence of moves that achieves the maximum prize. This involves checking which option (Homer or Marge) contributed to the maximum value at each step.\n\n5. **Complexity**: The DP table has dimensions \\((2n+1) \\times (n+1)\\), leading to a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), which is feasible since \\(n\\) is at most 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n_val = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    total_length = 2 * n_val\n    \n    power = [10**(n_val-1-i) for i in range(n_val)]\n    \n    dp = [[0] * (n_val+1) for _ in range(total_length+1)]\n    backtrack = [[''] * (n_val+1) for _ in range(total_length+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(total_length-1, -1, -1):\n        for h in range(n_val+1):\n            m = i - h\n            best_val = -10**30\n            best_move = None\n            \n            if h < n_val:\n                term = int(A_str[i]) * (power[h] if h < n_val else 0)\n                next_val = dp[i+1][h+1] if i+1 <= total_length else 0\n                total_val = term + next_val\n                if total_val > best_val:\n                    best_val = total_val\n                    best_move = 'H'\n            \n            if m < n_val:\n                term = int(A_str[i]) * (power[m] if m < n_val else 0)\n                next_val = dp[i+1][h] if i+1 <= total_length else 0\n                total_val = term + next_val\n                if total_val > best_val:\n                    best_val = total_val\n                    best_move = 'M'\n            \n            dp[i][h] = best_val\n            backtrack[i][h] = best_move\n\n    seq = []\n    i = 0\n    h = 0\n    while i < total_length:\n        move_char = backtrack[i][h]\n        seq.append(move_char)\n        if move_char == 'H':\n            i += 1\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    result_seq = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result_seq)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (number of moves per player) and a string `A` (the number with 2n digits).\n2. **Power Calculation**: Precompute powers of 10 for quick access during digit value calculation.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp[i][h]` is initialized to store the maximum prize achievable from the substring starting at index `i` with `h` moves by Homer. The `backtrack` table records whether the digit was assigned to Homer or Marge.\n4. **Filling DP Table**: Starting from the end of the string, for each digit and each possible count of Homer's moves, compute the best value by considering both players taking the current digit. Update the DP and backtrack tables accordingly.\n5. **Reconstructing the Sequence**: Using the backtrack table, start from the beginning of the string and follow the decisions (Homer or Marge) to build the move sequence that maximizes the total prize.\n6. **Output**: The constructed sequence of moves is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal move sequence by leveraging dynamic programming and careful state management, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
