The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can think of the ring as:\n   From house i, moving clockwise: \n      next house is (i % n) + 1, but note: if i == n, then next is 1.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise.\n\n Important: The tasks must be done in the given order. After completing a task, she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i (but note: the condition is automatically satisfied by processing in order).\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" — meaning that we must do the tasks in increasing index order. So we are given a list of m task locations (each ai is the house number for the i-th task).\n\n We start at house 1. Then we have to go from house 1 to a1, then from a1 to a2, then from a2 to a3, etc.\n\n However, because it's a ring, we can also consider that sometimes going backwards (via the ring) might be faster? But note: the movement is only clockwise. So we cannot go counterclockwise.\n\n But wait: the ringroad is one-way clockwise. Therefore, we can only move from house i to house i+1 (with house n+1 being house 1). However, note that the example:\n\n Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n Steps: \n   Start at 1.\n   Then to 3: from 1 to 3: we can go 1->2->3 (2 steps) OR 1->4->3? But wait, the ring is one-way clockwise so from 1 we can only go to 2, then 3, then 4, then 1, then 2, etc.\n\n However, in the example: \n   1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3\n\n How does 3 come after 4? Because after 3 we are at house 3. Then to get to the next task at house 2, we must go from 3 to 4 (one step) and then 4 to 1 (another step) and then 1 to 2 (another step) — but wait that would be 3 steps from 3 to 2? Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Task 1: at house 3 -> we start at 1, so we go from 1 to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Since we can only go clockwise, we have to go from 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (1 step), then 1 to 2 (1 step) — total 3 steps.\n\n   Then from 2 to 3: \n        From 2, we go 2->3 (1 step)\n\n   Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n But note: the example output is 6.\n\n However, there is an alternative way: \n   From 3, instead of going through 4 and then 1, we could also consider that we are allowed to pass through the entire ring. The key is that the ring is circular and we can use modulo arithmetic.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have to compute the distance from the current house to the next task's house, moving only clockwise.\n\n The distance from house x to house y (if we are moving clockwise) in a ring of n houses:\n\n   If x <= y: then distance = y - x\n   If x > y: then we have to go from x to n and then from 1 to y: so distance = (n - x) + y\n\n But note: our starting point is 1, then we have to do the tasks in the given list.\n\n However, note that the tasks might not be in increasing order.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let current = 1 (starting house)\n   total_time = 0\n\n   For each task location a_i in the list of m tasks:\n        Compute the distance from current to a_i (clockwise) as above.\n        Then update current to a_i.\n\n   But wait: what if the next task is behind? We have to go around the ring.\n\n Example: from 3 to 2 (in a ring of size 4): \n        current = 3, next = 2 -> since 3>2, distance = (4-3) + 2 = 1+2 = 3.\n\n Example: from 2 to 3: \n        current = 2, next = 3 -> 2<=3, distance = 3-2 = 1.\n\n Example: from 1 to 3: \n        current = 1, next = 3 -> 1<=3, distance = 3-1 = 2.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   For each task_location in the list:\n        if current <= task_location:\n            d = task_location - current\n        else:\n            d = n - current + task_location\n        total_time += d\n        current = task_location\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n Let's check with the second example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n   Start at 1.\n   First task: 2 -> distance: 1<=2 -> d= 2-1 = 1. total_time=1, current=2.\n   Second task: 3 -> 2<=3 -> d=3-2=1. total_time=2, current=3.\n   Third task: 3 -> 3<=3 -> d=3-3=0. total_time=2.\n\n   Output 2.\n\n So that matches.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". This condition is already taken care of by processing the tasks in the given order.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to do the tasks in increasing order of house numbers, just in the given order.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n However, note: the constraints (n and m up to 10^5) — this linear approach is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: the example input format: first line has two integers, second line has m integers.\n\n Example input:\n\n   \"4 3\"\n   \"3 2 3\"\n\n We read the first line and split to get n and m.\n\n Then read the second line and split to get the list of task locations.\n\n Code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   n = int(data[0])\n   m = int(data[1])\n   tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   for loc in tasks:\n        if current <= loc:\n            d = loc - current\n        else:\n            d = n - current + loc\n        total_time += d\n        current = loc\n\n   print(total_time)\n\n However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n   Step1: current=1, loc=3 -> d=3-1=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n   Step2: current=3, loc=2 -> 3>2 -> d=4-3+2=1+2=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n   Step3: current=2, loc=3 -> d=3-2=1, total_time=6.\n\n   Output: 6 -> correct.\n\n But wait, I see: in the example breakdown they said 1→2→3→4→1→2→3, which is 6 steps. However, in our calculation we broke the journey from 3 to 2 into 3 steps (which is correct) and then from 2 to 3 into 1 step. So 2+3+1=6.\n\n However, note the example breakdown did not break the same way: \n    They broke: \n        1→2→3 (2 steps) for the first task (at 3)\n        then from 3: 3→4→1→2 (3 steps) for the second task (at 2)\n        then from 2: 2→3 (1 step) for the third task (at 3)\n\n But in our code, we are computing the distance from the current house to the next task's house. The journey from 3 to 2 is broken as: \n        from 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (1 step), then 1 to 2 (1 step) — that's 3 steps.\n\n So the calculation is correct.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" is processed as:\n\n   Step1: from 1 to 2: 1 step (since 1<=2 -> 2-1=1)\n   Step2: from 2 to 3: 1 step (since 2<=3 -> 3-2=1)\n   Step3: from 3 to 3: 0 steps\n\n   Total: 2.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n Let me try another example: \n\n   n=5, tasks=[5,1,3]\n\n   Start at 1.\n   Step1: 1 to 5 -> since 1<=5, d=4. total_time=4, current=5.\n   Step2: 5 to 1 -> 5>1 -> d=5-5+1=1. total_time=5, current=1.\n   Step3: 1 to 3 -> 1<=3, d=2. total_time=7.\n\n   Alternatively, we can check: \n        1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps) to get to 5.\n        Then from 5: 5->1 (1 step) to get to 1.\n        Then from 1: 1->2->3 (2 steps) to get to 3.\n\n        Total steps: 4+1+2 = 7.\n\n   So correct.\n\n But note: there is a possibility to avoid going from 5 to 1? Actually, in the ring, from 5 the next is 1, so we must go 5->1 (clockwise). There is no other way.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read n and m, then the list of m integers.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses (numbered 1 to n). The movement is clockwise.\n\n   We'll assume the above logic.\n\n But wait, the problem statement says: \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", so the above distance calculation is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that n and m can be up to 10^5, and our loop runs m times, so it's efficient.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad where houses are arranged in a clockwise manner. The key observation here is that movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task is located at a specific house. The challenge is to calculate the minimal time required to move from her current position to each subsequent task's location, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Insight**: The distance between two houses in a clockwise direction can be computed based on their positions. If the current house is less than or equal to the target house, the distance is simply the difference between them. Otherwise, the distance involves moving from the current house to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then from house 1 to the target house.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's location. Sum these distances to get the total time required. The algorithm processes each task in sequence, updating the current position after each move.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `m` tasks exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each task. Thus, the time complexity is O(m), which is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for loc in tasks:\n        if current <= loc:\n            d = loc - current\n        else:\n            d = n - current + loc\n        total_time += d\n        current = loc\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) with total time initially zero (`total_time = 0`).\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - If the current house is less than or equal to the task's house, the distance is the difference between them.\n   - Otherwise, the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring (`n - current`) and then from house 1 to the task's house (`+ loc`).\n4. **Updating Time and Position**: The computed distance is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task's location.\n5. **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and straightforward arithmetic to determine movement distances.",
