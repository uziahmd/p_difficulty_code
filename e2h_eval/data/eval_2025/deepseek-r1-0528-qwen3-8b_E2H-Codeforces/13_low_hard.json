For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. The notes are in a circular list of 12: \n ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']? Wait, note: the example says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n But wait, let me check: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H -> that's 12 notes.\n\n However, note that the example input \"A B H\": \n   According to the problem, after H comes C. So we have a circular list.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) in the order of the list above.\n\n 2. We have three notes. We can form a circle of 12 notes. Since the chord is an unordered set, we need to consider all cyclic orders.\n\n 3. Conditions for major and minor:\n    - Major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones (so 4 steps from X to Y)\n        distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones (so 3 steps from Y to Z)\n        Then the entire span from X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\n    - Minor: Similarly, an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n        distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n 4. However, note that the circle has 12 tones, so distances can be measured in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise.\n    But the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", and the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. \n\n    However, in the example: \n        Input: \"C E G\" -> major: from C to E: 4 semitones (because C->C#->D->D#->E: 4 steps). Then from E to G: 3 semitones (E->F->F#->G: 3 steps). \n\n    But what if we have a chord that wraps around? For example, consider the notes [H, C, E]. \n        In the circle: ... H, then C (which is the same as the next cycle) but wait, the problem says \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" \n\n    Actually, we are working on a circle of 12. We can map the notes to numbers and then compute the circular distances.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (because from E to F, F to F#, G, G# -> then C is after H, so from E: E->F (1), F->F#(2), G(3), G#(4), A(5), B(6), H(7), then C(8) from E to C). But wait, that is the long way. The problem also says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we take the smallest nonnegative distance? Or the positive direction?\n\n    Actually, the example says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". This is because they are going from E to C in the upward direction (if we consider the circle as increasing from C to H and then back to C). But the chord condition requires the ordering from the lowest to the highest. However, the problem states that the chord is defined by the existence of an ordering (without specifying which one is the lowest). \n\n    How to handle this?\n\n    Let's define a function to get the circular distance (in semitones) from note a to note b, but we have to consider the direction. The problem says the distance from a to b is the minimal positive steps? Actually, the example: from E to C is 8, but from C to E is 4. So the distance is defined in the positive (clockwise) direction? But note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are always moving forward (in the increasing direction). \n\n    However, when we have a chord, we can reorder the notes arbitrarily. We are to check if there exists an ordering (a cyclic shift) such that the intervals are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\n    Important: The chord is an unordered",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible cyclic orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note chromatic scale. This allows us to perform arithmetic operations on the notes.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Given the circular nature of the musical scale, the distance between two notes can be calculated in both directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise). The minimal distance between two notes is considered, but for chord identification, we need to check specific intervals (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 for minor).\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the intervals between consecutive notes (in the correct order) match the required conditions for a major or minor chord. The notes are adjusted to account for the circular nature of the scale by considering modulo 12 arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        a, b, c = data\n    except:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        indices = [note_to_index[a], note_to_index[b], note_to_index[c]]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    def get_distance(x, y):\n        diff = (y - x) % 12\n        if diff > 6:\n            diff = 12 - diff\n        return diff\n        \n    def is_major(triplet):\n        x, y, z = triplet\n        dist1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        dist2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        dist3 = get_distance(z, x)\n        if dist1 == 4 and dist2 == 3 and dist3 == 7:\n            return True\n        return False\n        \n    def is_minor(triplet):\n        x, y, z = triplet\n        dist1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        dist2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        dist3 = get_distance(z, x)\n        if dist1 == 3 and dist2 == 4 and dist3 == 7:\n            return True\n        return False\n        \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        if is_major(perm):\n            found_major = True\n        if is_minor(perm):\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The notes are mapped to indices (0-11) for easy calculation. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, up to 'H' which is 11.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function calculates the minimal distance between two notes in either direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) on the 12-note circle.\n3. **Chord Identification**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between three consecutive notes in a permutation match the required intervals (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 for minor).\n4. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three notes are checked. If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, `found_major` is set to true. Similarly for minor chords.\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.",
