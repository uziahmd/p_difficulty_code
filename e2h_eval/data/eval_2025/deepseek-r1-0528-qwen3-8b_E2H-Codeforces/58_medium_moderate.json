You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to find:\n   t = the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length (with more than one vertex)\n   w = the number of ways to add t edges to achieve that\n\n Conditions: \n   The graph is undirected, without parallel edges or loops, and not necessarily connected.\n\n Important: We cannot add parallel edges or loops.\n\n Observations:\n\n 1. Odd cycle: In an undirected graph, an odd cycle must have an odd number of edges (so the cycle length is odd).\n 2. We are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (without creating multiple edges or loops). But note: we want the minimum number of edges to add.\n\n Let's consider possibilities:\n\n Case 0: If the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, then t=0 and w=1? But wait, note: we are forming a cycle by adding edges. However, if the graph already has an odd cycle, then no edge needs to be added. So t=0 and w=1.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"form a simple cycle of an odd length\", meaning we can use existing edges and possibly add some. However, if the graph already has such a cycle, then we don't need to add any edge.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the cycle is entirely formed by the added edges. It can be a cycle that uses some existing edges and some added edges. But actually, we are only adding edges, so the cycle must be present after the addition. If the graph already has an odd cycle, then we don't need to add anything.\n\n But what if the graph doesn't have an odd cycle?\n\n Then we consider:\n\n Option 1: Add a single edge (t=1) to form an odd cycle?\n   Consider: adding one edge might create an odd cycle. When can one edge create an odd cycle?\n   Example: Two triangles (each triangle is even? No, a triangle is odd cycle) but wait: if we have two triangles, then the graph already has an odd cycle.\n\n   Actually, we are starting from a graph without an odd cycle. Then we need to form one.\n\n   How can one edge create an odd cycle?\n   Suppose we have two distinct even cycles (or even components) and we connect them with one edge. Then we can traverse from one cycle to the other and come back, but that would be an even cycle? \n\n   Alternatively, consider: we have a path of even length (even number of edges) and we close it with an edge to form an odd cycle? The total cycle would be the even path (which has even edges) plus one edge -> odd total edges? But wait, the entire cycle is the edges of the path and the new edge. However, the cycle length in terms of edges is the number of edges. The condition for being odd is that the total edges must be odd.\n\n   But note: the cycle must be simple. Also, the entire cycle must have at least 3 edges (but the problem says more than one vertex, so at least a triangle).\n\n   Actually, we can also consider: if we have a complete graph of even cycle (like a bipartite graph) then adding an edge within the same part creates an odd cycle? Because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are even. Adding an edge within the same part will create an odd cycle.\n\n   So if the graph is bipartite (which means no odd cycle), then we can check: \n     - If we can add one edge that connects two vertices in the same part (in the same connected component) then that creates an odd cycle.\n\n   But note: the graph may not be connected. Each connected component is bipartite? Then we can have multiple bipartite components.\n\n   Actually, the entire graph is bipartite if each connected component is bipartite.\n\n   Now, what is the minimal number of edges to add?\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n   t=0: if the graph already has an odd cycle -> then done.\n\n   t=1: if we can add one edge that creates an odd cycle. This happens if and only if there exists a connected component (which is bipartite) that has at least two vertices in the same part (so that we can connect two same-colored vertices). But note: if we have a connected bipartite component, then the two parts are fixed. Then connecting two vertices from the same part will create an odd cycle.\n\n   However, what if the graph is disconnected? Then we can also consider connecting two different bipartite components? But note: if we connect two bipartite components, then we can form a cycle that goes through both? Actually, if we connect two bipartite components, then we can form a cycle that goes from one component, then the bridge, then the other component, and then back? But wait, to form a cycle we need two paths between two nodes. The bridge itself is one edge. Then we can take a path from node A in the first component to node B in the first component (using the existing edges) and then from node C in the second component to node D in the second component, and then use the bridge twice? Actually, no. The bridge is only one edge. To form a cycle, we need to go from A to B (in the first component) and then from B to A via the bridge? But then we have two edges: the original edge in the first component and the bridge. That would be a cycle of two edges? But two edges is not an odd cycle (it's even). \n\n   Actually, to form an odd cycle, we need an odd number of edges. Therefore, if we have two bipartite components, and we connect them, then the entire graph is no longer bipartite. But can we form an odd cycle?\n\n   Consider: \n      Component1: bipartite with parts A and B.\n      Component2: bipartite with parts C and D.\n\n   Now, if we connect a node from A to a node from C, then we can have a cycle that goes from a node in A to a node in C (via the bridge), then traverse in Component2 from C to D (using an odd number of edges? Actually, the edges in Component2 are even because it's bipartite. Then we can go from D to ...? We need to get back to A. But wait, we don't have an edge from D to A. \n\n   Actually, the cycle must be entirely contained in the graph. Since the two components were separate, we can only form a cycle that uses the bridge and two paths: one from the first component and one from the second. The entire cycle would be: \n        u1 -> v1 (in component1) and then from v1 to u1 via the bridge and then from the other side (v2) to u2 (in component2) and then back to u1? \n\n   Actually, the cycle would be: \n        Start at u1 (in comp1) -> go to v1 (in comp1) -> then use the bridge to go to v2 (in comp2) -> then go to u2 (in comp2) and then we need an edge from u2 to u1 to complete the cycle? But we don't have that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can form a cycle that goes from u1 to v1 (comp1) then bridge to v2, then in comp2 from v2 to u2, and then we are stuck. We need to return to u1. Without an edge from u2 to u1, we can't. \n\n   Actually, the minimal odd cycle we can form by connecting two bipartite components must involve at least two edges from the bridge? Or we can use two bridges? \n\n   But wait: we are only allowed to add one edge (if t=1). Then the cycle must be formed by one bridge and some existing edges. However, to form a cycle, we must have two independent paths from two nodes to the same node. \n\n   Let me reexamine: \n        Suppose we have two bipartite components. We add one edge between a node in comp1 and comp2. Then the entire graph is connected and non-bipartite. However, the existence of an odd cycle requires that there is a cycle with odd length. \n\n   How do we know if there is an odd cycle? The graph is no longer bipartite. But that doesn't guarantee an odd cycle? Actually, the graph being non-bipartite implies there is an odd cycle.\n\n   However, the minimal odd cycle might be larger. And we are asked for the minimal number of edges to add. So if we can form an odd cycle by adding one edge (i.e., the graph is bipartite and we add an edge within the same part of a component) then that is t=1.\n\n   Therefore, if the graph is bipartite and there exists at least one connected component that has at least two vertices in one part (so we can add an edge between two same-colored vertices), then t=1.\n\n   But note: if the graph is not connected, we can also form an odd cycle by adding one edge if we have two vertices in the same part of the same component? Yes, because the cycle will be entirely within that component.\n\n   However, what if the graph is bipartite and every connected component has no two vertices in the same part? That is, each connected component is a single edge (two vertices) or a single vertex? Then we cannot add an edge within the same component because we don't have two vertices in the same part. \n\n   Then we must consider t=2.\n\n   But wait, we can also form an odd cycle by adding two edges? For example, if we have three vertices that are all isolated, we can add two edges to form a triangle. However, note: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (as long as we don't duplicate). \n\n   Actually, we can also consider connecting two isolated edges (each edge is a component) and then form a triangle by adding one edge? No, because we have two edges (say vertices {a,b} and {c,d}), and if we connect a to c, then we can form a cycle of length 3: a->b, b->a (wait, no, we have edge a-c, then we can go a->b->a? But that's two edges and not a cycle that uses the new edge? Actually, the cycle would be a-b-a? But that's not a simple cycle (we repeat a). \n\n   Alternatively, we can form a triangle by adding two edges: say we have three isolated vertices a, b, c. Then we can add edges a-b and b-c, then we have a path. But wait, that doesn't form a cycle. Then we need to add a third edge to form the cycle. \n\n   Actually, the minimal cycle is a triangle (3 edges). So if we start with no edges, we need to add 3 edges to form a triangle. But note: we can also form a cycle of length 5, etc. However, we are looking for the minimal number of edges to add.\n\n   Let me think about the minimal t:\n\n   t=0: if there is an odd cycle.\n\n   t=1: if the graph is bipartite and there exists a connected component that has at least two vertices in the same part (then we can add an edge between two same-colored vertices in that component to form an odd cycle).\n\n   t=2: if the above condition is not met, but we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges? \n\n   Example: \n        Consider a graph that is bipartite (so no odd cycle) and such that each connected component is a complete bipartite graph (so no two same-colored vertices are missing). Then we cannot add an edge to form an odd cycle within a component. But we can try to connect two components.\n\n        However, note: if we connect two bipartite components, then the entire graph becomes non-bipartite, so there must exist an odd cycle. But how many edges do we need to add to create an odd cycle?\n\n        Actually, when we add one edge between two components, the entire graph is non-bipartite, so an odd cycle exists. But wait, is that true? \n\n        Example: \n            Component1: two vertices {a, b} (edge a-b)\n            Component2: two vertices {c, d} (edge c-d)\n\n        Now, if we add an edge between a and c, then the graph is non-bipartite. But let's check: \n            Try to color: \n                Component1: a and b are colored differently (say a:0, b:1).\n                Component2: c and d: say c:0, d:1.\n                Then edge a-c: a is 0, c is 0 -> conflict.\n\n            So the graph is not bipartite. \n\n        However, is there an odd cycle? \n            Consider: a-b (edge1), then from b we don't have an edge to d (unless we add one, but we haven't). Then we have a-c (new edge). Then from c to d (existing). Then from d? No edge to a. \n\n            Actually, the cycle must be: a->b->? and then how to get back to a? \n\n            We have: a-b (existing), then we don't have an edge from b to d (unless we add one). \n\n            So with only one added edge, we don't have a cycle. \n\n        Therefore, the one edge we added does not form a cycle. Then we need to form a cycle. \n\n        How do we form a cycle? We need to have two distinct paths from two vertices to the same vertex. \n\n        With two edges (from two different components) we can form a cycle? \n\n        Example: \n            Component1: two vertices {a, b} (edge a-b)\n            Component2: two vertices {c, d} (edge c-d)\n\n            Now, we add two edges: say a-c and b-d. Then we have a cycle: a->b->d->c->a? \n                Edges: a-b, b-d (added), d-c, c-a (added). \n                This cycle has 4 edges -> even.\n\n            Alternatively, if we add a-c and a-d, then the cycle: a->c->d->a: 3 edges (odd). \n\n            So in this case, we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges.\n\n        But note: we are looking for the minimal number of edges. In the above example, we cannot form an odd cycle by adding one edge. So t=2.\n\n        However, is two edges always sufficient when the graph is bipartite and we cannot add one edge (because no two same-colored vertices in the same component)? \n\n        Actually, the minimal t might be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n        Let me summarize:\n\n        Step 1: Check if the graph already has an odd cycle. If yes, then t=0, w=1.\n\n        Step 2: If the graph is bipartite, then:\n\n            Let the graph have k connected components. For each component i, we have two parts: L_i and R_i.\n\n            Condition for t=1: There exists at least one component i such that |L_i|>=2 OR |R_i|>=2. Then we can add one edge within the same part (either in L_i or R_i) to form an odd cycle. \n\n            But note: the edge must be between two vertices that are not connected (since no parallel edges). However, if there is a pair of vertices in the same part that are not connected, then we can add that edge. But wait, in a connected bipartite graph, the entire part is connected by edges? Not necessarily. The bipartite graph might not be complete. \n\n            Actually, the graph is bipartite but not necessarily complete. So we can add an edge between any two vertices in the same part that are not already connected. However, the problem states: we are not allowed to add parallel edges. So if the two vertices are not adjacent, we can add the edge.\n\n            But note: the entire graph is given and we know which edges are present.\n\n            Therefore, the number of ways for t=1 (if we choose a particular component i) is: \n                ways_i = (number of pairs (u, v) in L_i that are not connected by an edge) + (number of pairs (u, v) in R_i that are not connected by an edge)\n\n            However, wait: we are adding only one edge. And the entire graph must become non-bipartite (by having an odd cycle). But note: adding one edge in a bipartite component breaks the bipartiteness of that component, and hence the entire graph becomes non-bipartite. \n\n            But note: if the graph is disconnected, then the odd cycle must be entirely in one component? Actually, no: if we break bipartiteness in one component, then the entire graph is non-bipartite, but the odd cycle might be entirely contained in that component. \n\n            Therefore, the minimal t is 1 if there is at least one component that has at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices in the same part.\n\n            However, what if the graph is bipartite and each connected component is a complete bipartite graph (so no two same-colored vertices are missing)? Then we cannot add an edge within the same component. Then we must consider t=2.\n\n        Step 3: t=2: \n\n            How can we form an odd cycle by adding two edges?\n\n            One way is to connect two different components (each being bipartite) and then the entire graph becomes non-bipartite, but we must also form a cycle. However, as shown above, just connecting two components with one edge doesn't form a cycle. But if we connect two components with two edges, then we might form a cycle.\n\n            Actually, we can also consider: within two components, we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges that together form an odd cycle. \n\n            Example: \n                Component1: two vertices {a, b} (edge a-b) [so it's a complete bipartite graph K_{1,1}]\n                Component2: two vertices {c, d} (edge c-d) [K_{1,1}]\n\n                Then if we add two edges: a-c and b-d, we get a cycle of length 4 (even). \n                But if we add two edges: a-c and a-d, then we have a triangle: a-c-d-a (if we also have the edge c-d, then a-c, c-d, d-a). \n\n            However, note: we are allowed to use existing edges. In the example, the edge c-d is already present. Then the cycle a-c-d-a uses edges: a-c (new), c-d (existing), d-a (new). So that's two edges added.\n\n            Therefore, we can form an odd cycle (triangle) by adding two edges.\n\n            But note: the triangle is an odd cycle.\n\n            How many ways to add two edges to form an odd cycle?\n\n            Actually, we have two possibilities for t=2:\n\n            Possibility A: The two edges are added within two different connected components (and possibly the same) and the cycle is formed by combining edges from two different components.\n\n            However, note: if we add two edges within the same connected component, and that component was bipartite, then we break the bipartiteness, but we must form an odd cycle. \n\n            Example: Consider a connected bipartite component (with parts L and R). If we add two edges, then we can form an odd cycle. For instance, if we pick three vertices: two from L and one from R, then adding edges between the two in L and the one in R (if they weren't there) might form an odd cycle. \n\n            But wait: if the component is a tree (so no cycles) then we can form a cycle by adding two edges? \n\n            Example: a tree (three vertices: a, b, c; edges a-b, b-c). Then the graph is bipartite (parts: {a,c} and {b}). Now, if we add two edges: say a-c and a-b (but a-b is already there) -> no. Actually, we cannot add a-b again. So we must add edges that are not present.\n\n            Actually, we can add two edges: for example, a-c and a-b? But a-b is already present. So we can only add a-c. Then we form a triangle: a-b-c-a (if we have edge b-c) but wait, we have a-b and b-c, and now a-c. Then we have a triangle (odd cycle). But that took only one edge. However, we assumed that the component is bipartite and complete? Actually, the component is not complete. \n\n            So the key is: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (without duplication). \n\n            Therefore, if the graph is bipartite, then:\n\n                t=1: if there exists a connected component that has at least one pair of same-colored vertices that are not connected.\n\n                Otherwise (each connected component is a complete bipartite graph) then we cannot form an odd cycle by adding one edge. Then we try two edges.\n\n            How to form an odd cycle with two edges?\n\n            Option 1: Break two different complete bipartite components by connecting them appropriately. \n\n            Option 2: Within one complete bipartite component, we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges? \n\n            Example: Consider a complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}. Then if we add two edges, we can form an odd cycle? Actually, no, because K_{3,3} is bipartite, and adding two edges might create an odd cycle. \n\n            But note: if the component is complete bipartite, then we cannot add an edge within the same part (because they are complete). So we cannot add one edge. Then we must use two edges. \n\n            How? \n\n            In a complete bipartite graph, we can form a cycle of even length. To form an odd cycle, we must have an odd number of edges. \n\n            Actually, we can use two edges to form a cycle that goes through two edges and two existing edges? \n\n            Example: In K_{3,3} (with parts A={a1,a2,a3}, B={b1,b2,b3}), we have edges between every a and b. Now, if we add two edges: say a1-a2 and b1-b2, then we can form a cycle: a1-b1-a2-b2-a1. This cycle has 4 edges (even). \n\n            Alternatively, we can form a cycle that uses the two added edges and the existing edges: \n                a1-a2 (added) and then from a2 to b1 (existing) and then from b1 to a1 (existing) -> that's a triangle: a1, a2, b1. But wait, we didn't use the edge a1-b1? Actually, we have a1-b1 originally. So the cycle a1->a2->b1->a1: \n                    a1 to a2 (new edge), a2 to b1 (existing), b1 to a1 (existing). This cycle has 3 edges (odd). \n\n            So that works.\n\n            Therefore, if we have a complete bipartite graph (so no missing edge within the same part, but note: we are allowed to add edges only between the same part? Actually, no: in a bipartite graph, edges are only between the two parts. We are allowed to add edges only within the same part (which would break bipartiteness) or between different components? \n\n            But wait, the graph is connected (one component) and complete bipartite. Then we cannot add an edge within the same part (because it's complete). Then we must add edges that are between the same part? Actually, no: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (as long as no parallel or loop). So we can add edges within the same part, but we said the graph is complete bipartite, so there are no edges within the same part. However, the problem does not say that the graph is complete bipartite, only that we are considering the case where we cannot add an edge (because the same part has no missing edge? Actually, no: the graph is bipartite and complete in the bipartite sense, meaning all edges between the two parts are present. But edges within the same part are not present (and we cannot add edges within the same part because they are forbidden by the bipartite definition? No, we are breaking the bipartite structure by adding an edge within the same part, but that would require that the edge is not present. \n\n            Correction: We are not forced to keep the graph bipartite. We are allowed to add edges arbitrarily. However, in our Step 2 we considered the condition for t=1: we require that there is a pair of same-colored vertices that are not adjacent. But if the graph is complete bipartite, then there are no edges within the same part, so we can add an edge within the same part. \n\n            Wait, I think I confused the two. \n\n            In a bipartite graph, edges are only between the two parts. So in the same part, there are no edges. Therefore, even if the graph is complete bipartite (meaning all edges between the two parts are present), the same part is an independent set (no edges). Therefore, we can always add an edge within the same part (if there are at least two vertices) regardless of whether the bipartite graph is complete.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for t=1 is simply: the graph is bipartite and there exists a connected component that has at least two vertices (so that we can pick two vertices from the same part). \n\n            Why did I think of complete bipartite? The problem does not require the graph to be complete. The graph is just bipartite (so we can color it). \n\n            Then why did I mention complete bipartite? Actually, the condition for t=1 is independent of the graph being complete. We only need two vertices in the same part (that are not adjacent). But in a bipartite graph, there are no edges within the same part, so if there are two vertices in the same part, they are not adjacent. \n\n            Therefore, the condition for t=1 is: the graph is bipartite and there exists a connected component that has at least two vertices (so that we can pick two from the same part). \n\n            Then why did the example above (with two components of two vertices) require two edges? \n\n            Because in that example, each component has two vertices (so two parts, each part has one vertex). Then we cannot add an edge within the same component (because we need two vertices in the same part). Therefore, we must consider edges across components.\n\n            So the condition for t=1 is: the graph is bipartite and there exists a connected component that has at least two vertices in one part.\n\n            Then, if the graph is bipartite and every connected component has all parts of size 1 (so the component is either a single vertex or an edge) then we cannot add one edge (within a component) to form an odd cycle.\n\n            Then we consider t=2.\n\n            How can we form an odd cycle by adding two edges?\n\n            There are two ways:\n\n            Way 1: Add two edges in the same connected component (if the component has at least two vertices, but note: each component is an edge, so two vertices in one part? Actually, if a component is an edge, then the two vertices are in different parts. So we cannot add an edge within the same part because each part has only one vertex. Then we cannot add an edge in the same component (since we need two vertices in the same part, and we don't have that). \n\n            Then we must use two edges to connect two different components and form an odd cycle.\n\n            Example: \n                Component1: {a, b} (edge a-b) -> parts: {a}, {b}\n                Component2: {c, d} (edge c-d) -> parts: {c}, {d}\n\n            Now, if we add two edges: say a-c and b-d, then we form a cycle of length 4 (even). \n            If we add two edges: a-c and a-d, then we form a cycle: a-c-d-a (edges: a-c, c-d, d-a). This cycle has 3 edges (odd). \n\n            So the two edges are: one edge connecting component1 to component2 (a-c) and another edge (a-d) that completes the triangle.\n\n            Similarly, we can do: a-d and b-c, then cycle: a-b-c-d-a? \n                Actually, we have a-b (existing), then we add a-d and b-c. Then the cycle: a->b->c->d->a: \n                    a-b (existing), b-c (added), c-d (existing), d-a (added) -> 4 edges (even).\n\n            Or: a-c and b-c: then cycle: a-b-c-a (edges: a-b, b-c, c-a). This is a triangle (odd). \n\n            So we have two possibilities for two edges:\n\n            Possibility 1: Connect two vertices from the same component to two vertices in another component (the two edges share one vertex from the first component). Then the cycle is formed by the two added edges and one edge from the second component.\n\n            Possibility 2: Connect two edges that form a triangle with an edge from the first component and an edge from the second component? Actually, the above examples.\n\n            Actually, the minimal cycle we can form by adding two edges is a triangle. \n\n            Therefore, if the graph is bipartite and no component has two vertices in the same part, then we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges. \n\n            How many ways?\n\n            We need to count the number of ways to add two edges such that they form an odd cycle.\n\n            Note: the two edges must form a triangle with an existing edge.\n\n            The triangle must consist of three distinct vertices. \n\n            The triangle can be formed by:\n\n                Option A: Three vertices from two different components: two from one component and one from the other. But note: each component has at most two vertices (because if a component has more than two vertices, then it would have a part with at least two vertices? Actually, no: consider a star graph (bipartite) with center and leaves. Then the center is one part, and the leaves are the other. Then the center has more than one vertex (if there are at least two leaves) and then we could have added an edge in the center (same part) for t=1. \n\n            But wait, we are in the case where each component has no two vertices in the same part. So each component is a complete bipartite graph and the bipartite graph has parts of size 1 and the rest? Actually, no: the condition for t=1 fails, meaning that in every component, for every part the size is <=1. \n\n            Therefore, each component must be a complete bipartite graph with parts of size at most 1. \n\n            Then, the only possibility is that each component is either a single vertex or an edge.\n\n            Why? Because if a component has a part of size >=2, then we could add an edge (for t=1). \n\n            So the graph consists of isolated vertices and isolated edges (each edge is a component).\n\n            Then, the two edges we add must connect two different edges (components) or an edge and an isolated vertex.\n\n            Example: \n                Component1: edge (a,b)\n                Component2: edge (c,d)\n                Component3: isolated vertex e\n\n            Then, we can form a triangle by:\n\n                Using two edges from two different edges (components) and one isolated vertex? \n\n            Actually, we can form a triangle by:\n\n                Triangle using two edges from the same component: impossible (because a component is an edge, and we cannot use two edges from the same component to form a triangle without a third edge).\n\n            The triangle must be formed by two edges from two different components and one edge from the graph? \n\n            Actually, we are adding two edges. The existing edges are the ones we cannot change.\n\n            The odd cycle (triangle) must have three edges. We are adding two edges, so one edge must be provided by the graph.\n\n            Therefore, the triangle must include one existing edge and two added edges.\n\n            So we need to pick one existing edge (from the graph) and then two edges to form a triangle. But note: the existing edge is between two vertices, say u-v. Then we can add edges u-w and v-w (for some w) to form the triangle. But w must not be u or v, and the edges u-w and v-w must not exist.\n\n            However, the graph is bipartite. The existing edge u-v is between two different parts. Then w must be in one of the parts? \n\n            Actually, in the bipartite graph, the parts are fixed. Let u is in part0 and v is in part1. Then w can be in part0 or part1. But to form a triangle, the edges u-w and v-w must be present. \n\n            But note: the graph is bipartite, so edges only go between part0 and part1. Then:\n\n                If w is in part0, then the edge u-w is within the same part -> which is not allowed in the bipartite graph? Actually, we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (we are breaking the bipartiteness). But the edge u-w (both in part0) is an edge we can add. Similarly, v-w (v in part1, w in part0) is an edge between part1 and part0, which is already present or not? \n\n            Actually, the graph is bipartite, so the edge between v and w (if they are in different parts) might already exist or not. But we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (as long as not duplicated). \n\n            However, to form a triangle with the existing edge u-v, we need to add two edges: u-w and v-w. \n\n            But note: the edge v-w (if w is in the opposite part of v) might already exist. Then we cannot add it again. \n\n            Therefore, we must choose w such that the edge u-w does not exist and the edge v-w does not exist.\n\n            Alternatively, we can form a triangle that does not use an existing edge? \n\n            Example: three isolated vertices: a, b, c. Then we can add two edges: a-b and b-c, but that doesn't form a cycle. Then we must add a third edge to form a cycle. But we are adding two edges, so we cannot form a triangle from three isolated vertices.\n\n            Therefore, the triangle must use an existing edge.\n\n            Steps for counting t=2:\n\n            We need to count the number of ways to add two edges that together with an existing edge form a triangle (and the triangle is an odd cycle).\n\n            The triangle is defined by three distinct vertices: x, y, z, and the edges (x,y), (y,z), (z,x). \n\n            We are going to add two edges. The third edge (x-y, say) must already exist.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n            - The two added edges are (y,z) and (z,x) (if the existing edge is (x,y)).\n            - The two added edges must not be present initially.\n\n            How to count?\n\n            We can iterate over the existing edges (each edge (u,v)) and then consider:\n\n                We can form a triangle by choosing a third vertex w (w != u and w != v). Then we add edges (u,w) and (v,w). \n\n            But note: we are allowed to add two edges arbitrarily. However, the same two edges might be counted multiple times? We have to avoid double-counting.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider: the two edges we add must be incident to the same vertex w (and one of the edges must be incident to u and the other to v). \n\n            But note: the two edges we add must form a triangle with an existing edge. \n\n            However, there is another possibility: the two edges we add might not be incident to the same w? \n\n            Example: we have two edges: u-v (existing) and we add u-w and v-x (where w and x are different). Then we don't form a triangle. \n\n            Therefore, the two edges must be incident to the same w.\n\n            So the triangle is: u, v, w. We require the existing edge (u,v) and then we add (u,w) and (v,w).\n\n            But note: the graph is bipartite. The parts are fixed. \n\n            Conditions for the triangle to be odd: the cycle has 3 edges (odd) -> always odd.\n\n            However, note: the graph is bipartite, so the triangle is an odd cycle and is not allowed in a bipartite graph. \n\n            But wait: the triangle is formed by adding two edges to an existing edge (which is between two parts). \n\n            The coloring: \n                u and v are in different parts (because the existing edge is between the parts). \n                Then w must be in the same part as u (then the edge u-w is within the same part, and v-w is between parts) OR same part as v (then u-w is between parts, and v-w is within the same part). \n\n            Either way, the two added edges: one is within a part and one is between parts. \n\n            But note: the edge between parts might already exist? \n\n            Actually, we are counting the ways to add two edges that do not exist. \n\n            Therefore, for a fixed existing edge (u,v) and a candidate w:\n\n                Condition1: w is not u and not v.\n                Condition2: the edge (u,w) does not exist.\n                Condition3: the edge (v,w) does not exist.\n\n            Then, we can add these two edges to form a triangle.\n\n            However, note: we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges (t) that must be added to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and the number of ways (w) to add those edges. The solution involves checking for existing odd cycles in the graph and, if none are found, determining the minimal edges required to create one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycles**: \n   - Use a bipartite check (BFS/DFS) to determine if the graph is bipartite. If it is not bipartite, the graph already contains an odd cycle, so t=0 and w=1.\n   \n2. **Graph is Bipartite**:\n   - **Case 1 (t=1)**: If any connected component has at least two vertices in the same part (indicating missing edges within the same part), adding one edge between two vertices in the same part will create an odd cycle. The number of ways (w) is the sum of all possible pairs of vertices in each part that are not already connected by an edge.\n   - **Case 2 (t=2)**: If no such pairs exist (each component's parts have at most one vertex), we need to add two edges. These edges must form a triangle with an existing edge. For each existing edge (u, v), count the vertices w not adjacent to both u and v. Each valid w contributes one way to form the triangle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    edges = []\n    index = 2\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        edges.append((u, v))\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n        \n    color = [-1] * (n+1)\n    is_bipartite = True\n    components = []\n    visited = [False] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            comp = []\n            queue = deque([i])\n            visited[i] = True\n            comp.append(i)\n            color[i] = 0\n            while queue:\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        color[neighbor] = color[node] ^ 1\n                        queue.append(neighbor)\n                        comp.append(neighbor)\n                    else:\n                        if color[neighbor] == color[node]:\n                            is_bipartite = False\n            components.append(comp)\n            \n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n        \n    total_ways = 0\n    part0_edges = 0\n    part1_edges = 0\n    comp_color_map = {}\n    for comp in components:\n        c0 = 0\n        c1 = 0\n        for node in comp:\n            if color[node] == 0:\n                c0 += 1\n            else:\n                c1 += 1\n        total_nodes = c0 + c1\n        if c0 >= 2 or c1 >= 2:\n            total_ways += 1\n            break\n            \n    if total_ways > 0:\n        print(\"1\", total_ways)\n        return\n        \n    total_ways = 0\n    for comp in components:\n        c0 = 0\n        c1 = 0\n        nodes_set = set(comp)\n        for node in comp:\n            if color[node] == 0:\n                c0 += 1\n            else:\n                c1 += 1\n                \n        if c0 * c1 == 0:\n            continue\n            \n        for node in range(1, n+1):\n            if node not in nodes_set:\n                continue\n            if node not in graph:\n                continue\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in nodes_set:\n                    break\n            else:\n                continue\n            part = color[node]\n            other_part = part ^ 1\n            count = 0\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if color[neighbor] != other_part:\n                    count += 1\n            if count == len(graph[node]):\n                continue\n            remaining = 0\n            for w in range(1, n+1):\n                if w not in nodes_set:\n                    if color[w] == part:\n                        if node == w:\n                            continue\n                        if w in graph and node in graph and (node, w) not in edges and (w, node) not in edges:\n                            remaining += 1\n            total_ways += remaining\n            \n    print(\"2\", total_ways)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Bipartite Check**: The graph is checked for bipartiteness using BFS.
