Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Note that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can only swap '0' with '1' and '1' with '2', the relative order of the three digits (with respect to each other) is constrained by their inherent ordering: '0' < '1' < '2'.\n\n However, note that we cannot freely rearrange all three. But we can think of the operations as allowing:\n   - Any number of swaps between adjacent 0 and 1, meaning that 0s and 1s can be rearranged arbitrarily relative to each other (because we can bubble sort through adjacent swaps).\n   - Similarly, any number of swaps between adjacent 1 and 2, meaning that 1s and 2s can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n But what about 0 and 2? We cannot swap them directly. However, note that we can use 1 as an intermediary. For example, consider \"02\": \n   We cannot swap 0 and 2, but if we have a 1 in between, then we can do:\n        \"012\" -> swap the 0 and 1: becomes \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2: becomes \"120\". \n   Alternatively, we can also think that we can move a 0 past a 1 to the right, and then move it past a 2 by first moving the 2 away (using the 1) and then inserting the 0.\n\n Actually, we can break down the problem:\n\n Since we can swap adjacent 0 and 1, and adjacent 1 and 2, then effectively we can rearrange the entire string arbitrarily except for the relative positions of 0 and 2? Not exactly.\n\n However, note: we cannot swap 0 and 2 directly, but we can use a sequence of swaps to move a 0 through a series of 1s and 2s. Similarly, we can move a 2 through a series of 1s and 0s? Actually, the moves allow:\n\n   - We can move 0's arbitrarily to the left (by swapping with 1's) until they hit the beginning or a non-1 (but note: we cannot swap 0 and 2, so if there's a 2, we must use the 1's to pass through).\n\n But wait: the operation is defined on adjacent pairs. So we can simulate that:\n\n   Example: \"02\"\n     We cannot swap because no adjacent 0 and 1 or 1 and 2? In \"02\", there is no 1, so no swap is allowed.\n\n   Example: \"012\"\n     We can do: \n        Step1: swap 0 and 1 -> \"102\"\n        Step2: swap 1 and 2 -> \"120\"\n\n   So from \"012\", we can get \"120\", which is lexicographically larger than \"012\"? Actually, we want the minimum lexicographical string.\n\n   Let me clarify: the goal is to minimize the string lexicographically.\n\n   How does the swapping affect the lex order?\n\n   Note: We can also move 1's and 2's arbitrarily relative to each other and to 0's (as long as we use the intermediate steps). \n\n   The key is: we can independently rearrange the 0s and 1s, and the 1s and 2s. But note that 1s act as intermediaries for both 0s and 2s.\n\n   However, note that the operations do not allow swapping 0 and 2 directly, but they allow:\n\n     0 can move left through 1's, and 2 can move right through 1's.\n\n   But what about moving 0 to the right? Actually, the swaps are bidirectional: \n      We can swap 0 and 1 (so 0 can move to the right if we swap 0 and 1 in the opposite direction? Actually, let's define:\n\n        Operation 1: swap \"01\" to \"10\": this moves the 0 to the right? Actually, no: \n            Original: ...0 1... -> swap to ...1 0...\n            This moves the 0 to the right? Actually, no: the 0 moves from the left to the right. Wait, let's index:\n\n            Suppose we have two adjacent characters: s[i] = '0', s[i+1] = '1'. Then swapping gives s[i]='1', s[i+1]='0'. Now the 0 has moved one step to the right.\n\n        Similarly, swapping \"10\" to \"01\" moves the 0 to the left.\n\n        For",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on a ternary string composed of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the relative order of '0's and '2's can be altered indirectly through '1's. Specifically, a '0' can move left through '1's, and a '2' can move right through '1's. However, direct swaps between '0' and '2' are not allowed. This means that the positions of '0's and '2's in the final string will depend on their interactions with '1's.\n\n2. **Insight**: The lexicographically smallest string can be constructed by ensuring all '0's come first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, because '0's and '2's cannot directly swap, we need to place '1's strategically to allow '0's to move left and '2's to move right.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Separating the original string into three lists: one for each character ('0', '1', '2').\n   - Using a two-pointer technique to merge these lists while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's, but allowing '1's to interleave appropriately. Specifically, '0's should appear before any '1' or '2', and '2's should appear after any '0' or '1'.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes the string in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string, by traversing the string once to separate the characters and then merging them in linear time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n            \n    result = []\n    i = j = k = 0\n    n0 = len(zeros)\n    n1 = len(ones)\n    n2 = len(twos)\n    \n    while i < n0 or j < n1 or k < n2:\n        if i < n0 and (j >= n1 or k >= n2 or zeros[i] <= ones[j]):\n            result.append(zeros[i])\n            i += 1\n        elif j < n1 and (i >= n0 or k >= n2 or (ones[j] < '0' or (ones[j] >= '0' and (k >= n2 or twos[k] <= ones[j]))):\n            result.append(ones[j])\n            j += 1\n        elif k < n2 and (i >= n0 or j >= n1 or twos[k] <= ones[j] if j < n1 else True):\n            result.append(twos[k])\n            k += 1\n            \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separation**: The input string is divided into three separate lists based on the characters '0', '1', and '2'.\n2. **Merging**: The algorithm merges these lists by comparing elements at the current positions of each list. The goal is to place '0's first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, during the merge process, '1's can be placed between '0's and '2's if they are lexicographically smaller (which they always are) compared to '0's and '2's in certain contexts.\n3. **Output**: The merged list is converted back into a string and printed, which represents the lexicographically smallest string achievable under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps by treating '1's as intermediaries to position '0's and '2's optimally, ensuring the smallest lexicographical order.",
