            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b.\n The second line is a string representing a number in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to an integer (base 10) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral (without leading zeros, and note the input condition: the number is at most 300010 and not zero).\n 2. Otherwise, b is an integer between 2 and 25. We first convert the given string (which is in base a) to an integer (base 10), and then convert that integer to base b.\n\n However, note that the input number c might be given in base a which could be greater than 10. Since the problem states that in bases greater than 10 we use letters (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.), we can handle the conversion from base a to base 10 by treating each digit appropriately.\n\n But note: the example includes base 12 with the digit 'A' (which is 10).\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n Case 1: b is not 'R'\n   Step 1: Convert the string (which is in base a) to a base 10 integer.\n        We note that the digits can be from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' to ... (if a > 10). But note: the input string may have leading zeros.\n\n        How to convert?\n          For each character in the string, map it to a digit value. For example, if a=16, then the digits are from '0' to 'F' (but wait: the problem says for bases above 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.). However, note the example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> output 'A'\n\n        Actually, the input is given as a string of digits (each digit being either a digit or a letter) in base a. We can do:\n\n          num_base10 = 0\n          power = 1\n          for each char in the string (from right to left? Actually, we can go from left to right, but we must consider the base and the fact that the string might be empty? But the problem says non-negative and length <= 1000, but also the number won't be too big in the non-Roman case only when b is not R? Actually, the condition says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me read again.\n\n        Correction: The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\" \n\n        Actually, the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is a binary number. So we need to convert the string from base a to base 10. Then from base 10 to base b.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a. And the base a is between 2 and 25.\n\n        Example: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 16, so the number is 5 (in base 16) which is 5 in base 10, then convert to Roman: 'V'\n\n        Another example: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base 5, the number is 4 (base 5) which is 4 in base 10, then convert to Roman: 'IV'\n\n        But note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is a binary number. We convert \"1111001\" from base 2 to base 10, then from base 10 to base 2. However, note that base 2 to base 10: \n          1111001 (base2) = 121 (base10) and then convert 121 to base2: 1111001 (base2) is the same. But wait, why output the same? Because the problem says: write the number in base b. So we are converting from base a to base b. \n\n        However, note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" outputs \"1111001\". This is because the number in base2 is 1111001, and we want to write it",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to base 10, and then converting it from base 10 to the desired target base (either a standard base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the first line to determine the source base `a` and the target base `b`. The target base `b` can be an integer between 2 and 25 or the string 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input number (given as a string in base `a`) to a base 10 integer. Each character in the string is treated as a digit in base `a`, where digits beyond '9' are represented by letters (e.g., 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, etc.).\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If `b` is an integer, convert the base 10 number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped back to their respective digits (0-9, A-Z as needed).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If `b` is 'R', convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using predefined rules for Roman numeral representation. This involves mapping numbers to their corresponding Roman symbols, handling subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9), and processing the number from the largest to the smallest denomination.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    base_a_str = parts[0]\n    base_b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if base_b_str == 'R':\n        base_b = 'R'\n    else:\n        base_b = int(base_b_str)\n        if base_b < 2 or base_b > 25:\n            base_b = 'R'\n    \n    def base_a_to_base10(num_str, base_a):\n        value = 0\n        power = 1\n        for char in reversed(num_str):\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit_val = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                digit_val = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n            if digit_val >= base_a:\n                print(\"Invalid digit for base\", base_a)\n                return None\n                \n            value += digit_val * power\n            power *= base_a\n        return value\n\n    base10_num = base_a_to_base10(num_str, int(base_a_str)) if base_a_str != 'R' else None\n\n    if base_b == 'R':\n        if base10_num is None:\n            base10_num = int(num_str, int(base_a_str))\n        roman_numerals = {\n            1000: \"M\",\n            900: \"CM\",\n            500: \"D\",\n            400: \"CD\",\n            100: \"C\",\n            90: \"XC\",\n            50: \"L\",\n            40: \"XL\",\n            10: \"X\",\n            9: \"IX\",\n            5: \"V\",\n            4: \"IV\",\n            1: \"I\"\n        }\n        res = \"\"\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals.items():\n            while base10_num >= value:\n                res += symbol\n                base10_num -= value\n        print(res)\n    else:\n        if base10_num is None:\n            base10_num = int(num_str, int(base_a_str))\n        \n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n = base10_num\n        while n > 0:\n            remainder = n % base_b\n            n = n // base_b\n            if remainder < 10:\n                digits.append(str(remainder))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n                \n        digits.reverse()\n        print(''.join(digits))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line specifies the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which might be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line is the number to be converted, provided as a string in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `base_a_to_base10` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value based on its position in the base `a` system. This results in a base 10 integer.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: For Roman numeral conversion, the base 10 number is decomposed into the largest possible Roman numeral denominations (like M, CM, D, etc.), appending the corresponding symbols until the number is reduced to zero.\n   - **Standard Base**: For standard base conversion, the base 10 number is divided by the target base `b` repeatedly. The remainders of these divisions are collected and converted back to their respective digits, forming the result string in reverse order, which is then reversed to present the correct sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
