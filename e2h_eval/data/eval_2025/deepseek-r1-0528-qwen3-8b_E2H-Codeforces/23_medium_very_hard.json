            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (and they can be any tile) and we want the minimum number of draws so that there is at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Conditions for a mentsu:\n   - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit). Example: ['1m','1m','1m'].\n   - Shuntsu: three consecutive digits in the same suit (the digits must be consecutive and the suit must be the same). Example: ['1m','2m','3m'].\n\n Since we start with three tiles, and we can draw more, we have to consider that we might form a mentsu by having a set of three (possibly by drawing two more if we have one triplet partially, or two more for a sequence, etc.)\n\n However, note: the problem says that after drawing, the hand has more than three tiles. But we are only concerned with having at least one mentsu (a set of three). \n\n The goal is to find the minimum number of draws (each draw adds one tile) so that the hand contains a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n 1. Already has a mentsu: then 0 draws.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we can try to see if we can form a mentsu by drawing 1, 2, or even 3 tiles? Actually, the minimum draws could be 0, 1, 2, or 3? Let's think:\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, we can consider:\n\n Case 0: Check if there's already a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) -> 0\n\n Otherwise, we need to consider:\n\n Option 1: Drawing 1 tile.\n   Then we will have 4 tiles. But note: we don't require the entire hand to be a mentsu, just that there is at least one mentsu (any three tiles). So we can have extra tiles.\n\n   How can one draw help?\n     - For a koutsu: if we have two identical tiles, then drawing one more of that tile would complete the triplet. Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> draw '1m' and we have a triplet and an extra '2m'. This requires 1 draw.\n\n     - For a shuntsu: if we have two consecutive tiles in the same suit, then drawing the next or previous one might complete the sequence. But note: we have three tiles, so we might have two tiles that are part of a sequence and the third is unrelated. Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> we have a pair [1m,2m] and missing 3m. Then drawing 3m completes [1m,2m,3m]. Similarly, if we have [2m,3m,5m] then drawing 4m doesn't complete a sequence because we don't have 1m and 5m isn't adjacent to 4m? Actually, wait: a shuntsu is three consecutive. So we need three consecutive. With two tiles, we can complete the sequence in two ways: if we have [x, y] (with y = x+1) then we can add x-1 to form [x-1,x,x+1] or add x+2 to form [x,x+1,x+2] (if x+2 is available). However, note: the example input \"3p 9m 2p\" requires 1 draw because we have two p-tiles: 3 and 2, and then we can form a sequence by adding 1p or 4p? Actually, wait: \n        Input: ['3p','9m','2p'] -> we have two p-tiles: 2p and 3p. Then we can form a sequence by drawing 1p: [1p,2p,3p] OR by drawing 4p: but wait, [2p,3p,4p] is also a sequence. So from two consecutive numbers (like 2 and 3), we can complete the sequence by either the lower or the higher.\n\n   However, note: the example output for ['3p','9m','2p'] is 1.\n\n   But what if we have three tiles that are not forming a mentsu, but two of them are consecutive? Then one draw can complete a shuntsu.\n\n   Also, note: we might have two identical tiles (for koutsu) and then one draw can complete the triplet.\n\n   Therefore, with one draw we can fix:\n        - Two identical tiles: then we need one more of that to make a triplet.\n        - Two consecutive in the same suit: then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one (either the one before the first or the one after the last).\n\n   However, what if the two consecutive are at the edge? For example, [1m,2m] (and a third tile that is unrelated). Then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] OR we can draw 0m (but 0 is invalid) so only one way. Similarly, [8m,9m] can only be completed by drawing 7m (to form [7m,8m,9m])? Actually, wait: [8m,9m] and then drawing 7m gives [7m,8m,9m] which is valid. Alternatively, we cannot draw 10m because it's not allowed (digits 1-9). So for [8m,9m] we can only complete by drawing 7m.\n\n   But note: the third tile might be the same as one of the two? Then we have three tiles and we have to consider duplicates.\n\n   Let me restructure:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let the initial hand be a list of three strings.\n\n   Step 1: Check for existing mentsu (0 draws).\n\n   Step 2: If not, check for possibilities with 1 draw.\n\n   Step 3: If not, check for possibilities with 2 draws.\n\n   Step 4: If not, check for possibilities with 3 draws.\n\n   However, note: we can always complete a triplet by drawing three more of a duplicate. But wait, if we have two duplicates, then one draw is enough. If we have one duplicate, then two draws are needed (because we have two of a kind, then we can draw two more). Similarly, for a sequence: if we have two consecutive, one draw is enough. But if we have one tile that is part of a potential sequence, we might need two draws? Or maybe not.\n\n   Actually, let's think about the minimal draws:\n\n   We are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. We are not limited to the same suit or same number, but we are looking for a mentsu (which requires three tiles).\n\n   The hand starts with 3 tiles.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   - 0 draws: already a mentsu.\n\n   - 1 draw: \n        * We have two tiles that are identical (so we have two of one kind). Then we draw one more to complete the triplet. (Note: the third tile is irrelevant.)\n        * We have two tiles in the same suit and consecutive numbers (like [a, a+1] in the same suit). Then we can draw a-1 to form [a-1, a, a+1] OR a+2 to form [a, a+1, a+2]. But note: the third tile might be the same as one of these? Actually, no, because the third tile is fixed. However, the two consecutive tiles must be in the same suit, and the third tile can be anything.\n\n        But wait: what if the third tile is the one we need to complete the sequence? For example, if we have [1m,2m,3m] then we already have a mentsu. So we are in step 1.\n\n        Another example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we have two consecutive (1m and 2m). Then we can draw 3m to complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m]. The fourth tile is 4m, which is extra. So this is valid.\n\n        However, what if we have [1m,2m,2m]? Then we have two possibilities for one draw:\n            - Drawing 1m: then we have [1m,1m,2m,2m] -> we have a koutsu (two 2m is not a triplet, but wait: we have two 1m and two 2m. We can form a triplet from the 2m by drawing one more 2m? But wait, we drew one tile, so we have four tiles. Then we can form the triplet from the 2m's (three 2m's) and leave one 1m. So we can do that.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire hand to be a mentsu, just that there exists at least one mentsu.\n\n        So in [1m,2m,2m] we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more 2m (then we have three 2m's). Alternatively, we can complete a shuntsu by drawing 1m (then we have [1m,1m,2m,2m] and the sequence [1m,2m] is not a shuntsu (needs three) but wait: we don't have a consecutive triplet of numbers in the same suit. We have two 1m and two 2m. The consecutive numbers are 1 and 2, but we don't have three consecutive. So we cannot form a shuntsu from [1m,2m] by drawing 1m.\n\n        Therefore, in [1m,2m,2m], we have two ways for one draw: \n            Option 1: Draw 2m -> then we have three 2m's (a koutsu).\n            Option 2: Draw 3m? Then we have [1m,2m,2m,3m] and we don't have a koutsu (unless we use three 2m's? but we have only two 2m's and one 3m). Alternatively, we can form a shuntsu from the 2m and 3m? But we have two 2m's and one 3m, so we can form [2m,2m,3m] -> but that is not a shuntsu because shuntsu requires consecutive numbers (2,3,4) or (1,2,3) etc. Not (2,2,3). So only Option 1 is valid.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for one draw for a shuntsu is: we must have two consecutive numbers (in the same suit) and we can complete the sequence by drawing the next or the previous (if it exists). And note: we must not break the condition that the three tiles for the sequence are distinct (they are, because consecutive numbers are distinct).\n\n        But wait: the definition of shuntsu: three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit. The numbers must be distinct and consecutive. So [1m,2m,3m] is valid.\n\n        Therefore, the one-draw conditions are:\n\n          Condition A: There exists a tile that appears at least twice. Then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more of that tile.\n\n          Condition B: There exist two tiles (in the same suit) that are consecutive (i.e., their numbers differ by 1) and we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing tile (which is either the previous one or the next one). Note: the two consecutive tiles must be from the same suit.\n\n        However, note: the hand has three tiles. It might be that the two consecutive tiles are not the majority? But we only need two to form a basis for a sequence.\n\n        But wait: what if we have three tiles that are all the same suit and two of them are consecutive? Then we can use the two consecutive and the third tile might be the one we need? Actually, no: the third tile is fixed. Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> already a mentsu.\n\n        Example for one draw for shuntsu: [1m,2m,4m] -> the two consecutive are [1m,2m] and we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. The 4m is left. But what if the third tile is the one we draw? No, because we are drawing one tile, and the hand becomes four.\n\n        Now, what if the two consecutive are not the only ones? Example: [1m,2m,2m] -> we have two consecutive (1m and 2m) but we can complete the triplet for 2m by drawing one 2m (which is Condition A). We don't need to check Condition B for the consecutive 1m and 2m because Condition A already gives a solution.\n\n        So we are checking Condition A and Condition B separately, and if at least one holds, then answer is 1.\n\n   - 2 draws: \n        We can complete a triplet if we have one duplicate (so we have two of a kind). Then we need two more of that kind. So two draws.\n\n        Or, for a shuntsu: if we have one consecutive pair (two tiles in the same suit with consecutive numbers) but we cannot complete the sequence in one draw (because the missing tile is at the edge and we cannot go beyond 1 or 9? Actually, no: for example, [9m,8m] (same suit) can be completed by drawing 7m (to form [7m,8m,9m]), so that's one draw. But wait, we are considering two draws. \n\n        Actually, the two-draw case might be:\n\n        Case 1: We have a single duplicate (so one tile appears twice). Then we need two more of that to make a triplet: two draws.\n\n        Case 2: We have two tiles that are consecutive (same suit) and the missing tile for the sequence is not available (or we don't want to use the one-draw option because we didn't have the consecutive pair that can be completed by a one-draw). But note: if we have two consecutive, then one draw is sufficient unless the consecutive pair is at the edge? Actually, no: even at the edge, one draw is sufficient (as above). \n\n        However, what if we don't have two consecutive but we have two tiles that are one apart from a gap? Example: [1m,3m,5m]. Then we have no duplicate and no consecutive. Then we need two draws to form a shuntsu? \n\n        Actually, we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles. But note: we can choose which two to draw. We need three consecutive. We have 1m and 3m. We can draw 2m and then we have [1m,2m,3m] (and leave out the 5m). So that's one draw? But wait, we started with [1m,3m,5m] and drew 2m -> then we have [1m,2m,3m] (and 5m) so we have a mentsu. That's one draw.\n\n        But wait, how did I get one draw? Because we have two tiles (1m and 3m) that are two apart. Then we can complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m. So actually, the condition for one draw for a shuntsu is: having two tiles (same suit) that are consecutive OR having two tiles that are separated by one (so we can complete the middle). \n\n        Therefore, let me refine the one-draw condition for shuntsu:\n\n        We have two tiles (same suit) with numbers a and b (a <= b). Then the gap is |a-b|. \n        - If |a-b| == 1, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one (the one between a and b) OR by drawing the next or the previous? Actually, wait: we need three consecutive. \n\n        Actually, the definition: a shuntsu is three consecutive numbers. So if we have two tiles, say [a, b] (same suit) and we want to form a shuntsu, we can choose to form a sequence that includes these two. \n\n        Possibilities for two tiles (same suit) [a, b] (with a<=b):\n\n          - If b == a+1: then we can form [a-1, a, a+1] by drawing a-1, or [a, a+1, a+2] by drawing a+2. But note: the numbers must be between 1 and 9.\n\n          - If b == a+2: then we can form [a, a+1, a+2] by drawing a+1. So one draw.\n\n          - If b >= a+3: then we cannot form a shuntsu with just these two and one draw? Actually, we can form a shuntsu that uses one of the two and then two other consecutive? But wait, we are only drawing one tile. With one tile, we can only fill one gap.\n\n        Therefore, the one-draw condition for shuntsu is: there exists two tiles (same suit) such that the absolute difference is at most 2. \n\n        However, note: we have three tiles. So we must consider that the third tile might be involved. But we are allowed to ignore the third tile. So we only need two tiles that are at most 2 apart (in the same suit) to form a shuntsu in one draw.\n\n        But wait: if the two tiles are [a, a+2] (same suit), then drawing a+1 completes the sequence [a, a+1, a+2]. \n\n        Now, consider if we have three tiles that are not consecutive and not duplicates, but we have two pairs that are close? \n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we have two pairs: [1m,2m] (difference 1) and [2m,4m] (difference 2). But the [1m,2m] is already a consecutive pair so we can complete by drawing 3m (for [1m,2m,3m]) OR [2m,3m,4m] (but wait, we don't have 3m). Actually, we have [1m,2m] and then 4m. We can use [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m, and we don't use 4m. Or we can use [2m,3m,4m] by drawing 3m. So one draw.\n\n        So the one-draw condition for shuntsu is: there exist two tiles (same suit) with numbers x and y such that |x-y| <= 2 and they are not consecutive (if they are consecutive, then we can complete by drawing the adjacent one, and if they are two apart, we can complete by drawing the middle). \n\n        However, note: if we have two tiles that are the same (duplicate) then |x-y|=0, so that falls under the consecutive condition? Actually, no: duplicate is handled by the koutsu condition.\n\n        But wait: two tiles being the same is a duplicate, so we check koutsu condition (which requires three) so we don't use duplicate for shuntsu.\n\n        Therefore, for shuntsu one-draw condition: two tiles (same suit) with numbers a and b (a != b) and |a-b| <= 2.\n\n        However, what if we have two tiles that are the same? Then we don't consider that for shuntsu (because shuntsu requires distinct consecutive numbers). \n\n        But wait: the problem says the hand has three tiles. What if the two tiles that are same are part of a shuntsu? They cannot be because shuntsu requires distinct numbers.\n\n        So the one-draw conditions:\n\n          Condition A: There exists a tile (represented by string) that appears at least two times. Then we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more.\n\n          Condition B: There exist two distinct tiles (same suit) such that the absolute difference of their numbers is 1 or 2. Then we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile.\n\n        But note: the two tiles for Condition B must be the same suit, and distinct (so not duplicates). \n\n        However, what if we have three tiles, and two of them are the same? Then Condition A applies. Condition B: we cannot use the two same tiles (because they are duplicates and the numbers are the same -> difference 0) so Condition B doesn't apply.\n\n        Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> Condition A: two 1m -> we can complete with one 1m. Condition B: we have two distinct tiles: 1m and 2m (same suit) with difference 1 -> so Condition B also holds. But note: we are allowed to use Condition B: we can draw 0m (which is invalid) or 3m to form [1m,1m,2m,3m] and then the shuntsu would be [1m,2m,3m] (using one 1m, one 2m, and the drawn 3m). However, we have two 1m's. The shuntsu only requires three consecutive distinct numbers. We can use one 1m and one 2m and the drawn 3m, leaving the other 1m. So Condition B holds.\n\n        But wait: Condition B requires two distinct tiles (same suit) with numbers differing by 1 or 2. Here, we have two distinct tiles: 1m and 2m (difference 1). So Condition B holds.\n\n        However, Condition A also holds. So the minimal draw is 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can have multiple conditions satisfied.\n\n        Now, what about two draws?\n\n        If we don't have any one-draw condition, then we consider two draws.\n\n        Possibilities for two draws:\n\n          - We have one duplicate (one tile appears twice). Then we can complete the triplet by drawing two more of that tile.\n\n          - We have two tiles (same suit) that are consecutive (difference 1) but the missing tile for the sequence is not available (because it would require two draws? Actually, no: the one-draw condition already covers consecutive. \n\n        Actually, the two-draw conditions:\n\n          Condition C: There exists a tile that appears exactly two times. Then we can complete the triplet by drawing two more of that tile.\n\n          Condition D: There exists two tiles (same suit) with numbers a and b (a != b) such that |a-b| >= 3. Then we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles. But wait, we can also use the two draws to complete two different sequences? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n\n          We have three tiles. We want to form a mentsu (any three). We can ignore up to two tiles (since we are drawing two, we can keep the best three). \n\n          Actually, we are allowed to choose any three tiles from the hand (after drawing) to form a mentsu. But note: the problem doesn't specify that the hand must be used entirely. We just need at least one mentsu.\n\n        However, note: we are drawing two tiles, so we have five tiles. We can form a mentsu from any three.\n\n        But wait, the minimal draws: we are trying to minimize the number of draws.\n\n        After two draws, we have five tiles. We can form a mentsu if:\n\n          - There is a triplet: then we need three of the same. So if we have a tile that appears at least three times, we have a triplet. How can we get three of the same? We start with some counts.\n\n          Let the initial hand be represented by a multiset.\n\n          We can count the frequency of each tile.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider: \n\n          Case 1: One duplicate (so two of one kind, and one of another). Then after two draws of the same kind, we have four of that kind -> then we have a triplet.\n\n          Case 2: No duplicate, but we have two consecutive (same suit) that are two apart (so |a-b|=2). Then we can complete the sequence by drawing the middle one, but that's one draw. \n\n          Actually, wait: if we have two tiles with |a-b|>=3, then we can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles? \n\n          Example: [1m,4m,7m]. Then we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles: for example, we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m. But wait, we have 1m and then we draw 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m] (and the other two are 4m and 7m). Alternatively, we can form [4m,5m,6m] by drawing 5m and 6m. Or [7m,8m,9m] by drawing 8m and 9m. \n\n          But note: we are drawing two tiles. So we can choose which two to draw. We can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles if we have a tile and then the next two? \n\n          Actually, we can complete a sequence from scratch: we can draw three consecutive tiles to form a new shuntsu. But wait, we have three tiles and we can draw two, so we have five. We can form a shuntsu from three of the five. \n\n          However, we have three tiles that are all different and not consecutive. We can choose to form a shuntsu from three of the five. But note: we are free to choose the two tiles to draw arbitrarily.\n\n          The minimal two-draw condition might be:\n\n          Condition E: There is no one-draw condition. Then the minimal draws is 2.\n\n        But wait, is there a two-draw condition that requires less than two draws? No, because we are considering two draws.\n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n          0 draws: already done.\n\n          1 draw: if Condition A or Condition B holds.\n\n          2 draws: if neither Condition A nor Condition B holds, then we must check: \n\n            - Condition C: There is a tile that appears exactly two times (so we can complete the triplet by two draws).\n\n            - Condition D: There is a tile that appears once, but we have two tiles (same suit) that are not consecutive (gap>=3) and we can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles? Actually, Condition D is not necessary because we can always form a triplet by drawing three of the same, but that would take three draws. \n\n        However, wait: we can also form a triplet by drawing three of the same, but that is three draws. We are looking for two draws.\n\n        But note: we might form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles. \n\n        Actually, the minimal two-draw condition is: we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles. \n\n        How?\n\n          Option 1: Complete a triplet from a two-of-a-kind (so we have two of one tile, then we draw two more: two draws).\n\n          Option 2: Form a shuntsu from two tiles that are at least 3 apart (same suit). Example: [1m,4m] (same suit). Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, we have 1m and then we draw 2m and 3m). However, we also have 4m. Then we can use [1m,2m,3m] and ignore 4m. Similarly, we can form a shuntsu from [4m,5m,6m] by drawing 5m and 6m. \n\n          But note: we are allowed to draw any two tiles. So we can choose two tiles arbitrarily.\n\n          Therefore, if we have two tiles (same suit) that are at least 3 apart, then we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles (the two consecutive numbers in between). \n\n          However, we might have more than two tiles. But we are starting with three.\n\n        But wait: we have three tiles. So we must consider the entire hand.\n\n        Actually, we can break the hand into groups by suit.\n\n        Approach:\n\n        Let the hand be represented as a list of two-character strings.\n\n        Step 1: Check for existing mentsu (0 draws).\n\n        Step 2: Check for one-draw conditions (Conditions A and B). \n\n        Step 3: If none of the one-draw conditions hold, then check for two-draw conditions.\n\n        But note: we might have the possibility to complete a triplet by drawing two tiles if we have one duplicate (so two of a kind) -> that's Condition C (which is the same as Condition A but we need two draws because we only have two). \n\n        However, Condition A was for two or three of the same. Condition A: two of the same is not enough, we need three. So Condition A (as defined for one-draw) is: having two or three of the same? Actually, if we have three, then we already have a mentsu (koutsu). So Condition A (one-draw) is: having two of the same (then we can complete by one draw). \n\n        Similarly, Condition B: having two distinct tiles (same suit) with |a-b|<=2 (then we can complete by one draw).\n\n        Now, for two draws:\n\n          Condition C: Having exactly two of one tile (so we can complete the triplet by drawing two more) OR\n\n          Condition D: Having two tiles (same suit) that are at least 3 apart (so we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles) OR\n\n          Condition E: We can form a triplet by drawing three of a kind (but that would be three draws, so we don't consider that for two draws).\n\n        But wait: we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles if we have one tile and then we can form a sequence with two draws? \n\n        Actually, the two-draw condition is: if we don't have a one-draw condition, then the minimal draws is 2? \n\n        However, consider: if we have no duplicate and no two tiles (same suit) that are within 2, then we cannot form a mentsu by drawing one tile. Then we must draw at least two.\n\n        But is two always sufficient?\n\n        Example: [1m, 2p, 3s] -> three tiles of different suits and consecutive numbers. Then we have no duplicate and no two tiles of the same suit that are consecutive or two apart. Then we cannot form a mentsu by drawing one tile. Then we need two draws.\n\n        But wait: we can draw two tiles to form a triplet. For example, draw two 1m. Then we have [1m,1m,1m] (and the other two tiles). So that's two draws.\n\n        However, we can also draw two tiles to form a shuntsu. For example, draw two tiles of the same suit. But we have three suits. We can choose one suit and then form a triplet or a sequence.\n\n        Actually, we can form a triplet by drawing two of any tile. But we have to choose a tile that we don't have. However, we can choose any tile arbitrarily. So we can always complete a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (if we have at least one tile? Actually, we have three tiles, so we have at least one tile. But wait: we have three tiles, but they might be all distinct. \n\n        However, note: we can draw two of a tile that is not present. Then we have two of that tile, which is not a triplet (we need three). But wait, we are allowed to draw any tile. To form a triplet, we need three of the same. So if we draw two of a tile that we don't have, then we have two of that tile. Then we need one more draw to get three. So that would be three draws.\n\n        Alternatively, if we have one tile (say we have one '1m'), then we can draw two more '1m' to form a triplet. Then we have drawn two tiles? Actually, no: we draw two tiles, so we have the original three plus two new, making five. In these five, we have three '1m'. So yes, we can complete a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have one tile initially). \n\n        But wait: if we have one tile, then drawing two more of that same tile gives three. So that's two draws.\n\n        Similarly, if we have two tiles of the same kind, then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more (one-draw condition). But if we have one tile, then we need two draws.\n\n        Therefore, two-draw condition: \n\n          Condition F: There is at least one tile in the hand. Then we can complete a triplet by drawing two more of that tile.\n\n        However, note: we have three tiles. The hand has three tiles. So we have at least one tile? Actually, we have three tiles, so we have at least one tile. \n\n        But wait: if we have three distinct tiles, then we have one of each. Then we can choose one of them and draw two more of that. Then we have three of that tile (and two others). So two draws.\n\n        Therefore, two draws is always sufficient? \n\n        However, consider: we might form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles (if we have two tiles that are one apart, but we already considered one-draw for that). But if we don't have any one-draw condition, then we cannot form a shuntsu by drawing one tile, but we can form a triplet by drawing two tiles (by choosing one tile and drawing two more).\n\n        Therefore, if we don't have a one-draw condition, then two draws are sufficient.\n\n        Then why consider three draws? \n\n        Actually, we can always form a mentsu by drawing two tiles (unless the hand is empty, but we have three). So the answer can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: ['1s','2s','3s'] -> already a shuntsu -> 0.\n\n          Example 2: ['9m','9m','9m'] -> already a koutsu -> 0.\n\n          Example 3: ['3p','9m','2p'] -> \n             Tiles: ['3p','9m','2p'] -> two p-tiles: '2p' and '3p'. \n                 Condition B: same suit (p), numbers 2 and 3 -> difference 1 -> one-draw condition holds. So answer 1.\n\n          Example 4: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> \n                 Condition A: two '1m' -> one-draw condition holds (draw one '1m') -> 1.\n\n          Example 5: ['1m','1m','4m'] -> \n                 Condition A: two '1m' -> one-draw condition holds (draw one '1m') -> 1.\n\n                 But also Condition B: two tiles (same suit) with numbers 1 and 4 -> difference 3 -> not <=2, so Condition B doesn't hold.\n\n          Example 6: ['1m','4m','7m'] -> \n                 No duplicate -> Condition A fails.\n                 Check Condition B: \n                    Group by suit: ['1m','4m','7m'] -> same suit, so check the numbers: [1,4,7]. \n                    Pairs: (1,4): diff=3 -> not <=2; (1,7): diff=6; (4,7): diff=3 -> Condition B fails.\n\n                 Then two draws are sufficient. Answer 2.\n\n          Example 7: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> already a triplet -> 0.\n\n          Example 8: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> \n                 Condition A: no duplicate (each tile appears once) -> fails.\n                 Condition B: same suit: [1,2,4] -> \n                    Pairs: (1,2): diff=1 -> valid -> one-draw condition holds. So answer 1.\n\n          Example 9: ['1m','1m','3m'] -> \n                 Condition A: two '1m' -> one-draw condition holds. So 1.\n\n          Example 10: ['1m','3m','5m'] -> \n                 Condition A: no duplicate -> fails.\n                 Condition B: same suit: [1,3,5] -> \n                    Pairs: (1,3): diff=2 -> valid -> one-draw condition holds. So answer 1.\n\n          Example 11: ['1m','4m','5m'] -> \n                 Condition A: no duplicate -> fails.\n                 Condition B: same suit: [1,4,5] -> \n                    Pairs: (1,4): diff=3 -> not valid; (1,5): diff=4 -> not valid; (4,5): diff=1 -> valid -> one-draw condition holds. So answer 1.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Let hand = list of three strings.\n\n          Step 1: Check if there's a mentsu in the current hand (0 draws).\n            - Check for koutsu: any tile appears three times.\n            - Check for shuntsu: any three tiles (must be same suit) that are consecutive numbers (sorted",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the current hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Check for One-Draw Conditions**: If no mentsu is found, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This happens in two scenarios:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: There are at least two identical tiles; drawing one more of the same tile completes the triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: There are two tiles of the same suit with numbers differing by 1 or 2; drawing the missing tile completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two-Draw Conditions**: If neither of the above conditions is met, then drawing two tiles will suffice. This is because:\n   - **Triplet Formation**: Drawing two more of any tile (even if it's not present initially) can form a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Formation**: Drawing two tiles can complete a sequence if the initial tiles are far apart in the same suit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = [tile for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing mentsu (0 draws)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for tile in tiles:\n        num_char = tile[0]\n        suit_char = tile[1]\n        count_dict[(num_char, suit_char)] += 1\n        suits[suit_char].append(int(num_char))\n    \n    # Check for koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    if any(count >= 3 for count in count_dict.values()):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for shuntsu (sequence of three in the same suit)\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        nums_sorted = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(nums_sorted)\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if nums_sorted[i] + 1 == nums_sorted[i+1] and nums_sorted[i+1] + 1 == nums_sorted[i+2]:\n                print(0)\n                return\n                \n    # Check for one-draw conditions\n    # Condition A: Koutsu: at least two of the same tile\n    for tile, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count >= 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Condition B: Shuntsu: two tiles in the same suit with difference 1 or 2\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        nums_sorted = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(nums_sorted)\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                diff = nums_sorted[j] - nums_sorted[i]\n                if diff <= 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n                    \n    # If none of the above, then two draws are needed\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three tiles represented as strings (e.g., \"1m\", \"2p\", etc.). These are split into a list for processing.\n2. **Counting Tiles**: We use a dictionary to count occurrences of each tile and another dictionary to group tiles by their suit.\n3. **Checking for Mentsu**: \n   - **Koutsu Check**: If any tile appears three times, print `0` since no draws are needed.\n   - **Shuntsu Check**: For each suit, sort the numbers and check if any three consecutive numbers exist.\n4. **One-Draw Conditions**:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: If any tile appears at least twice, drawing one more completes a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: If any two tiles in the same suit have numbers differing by 1 or 2, drawing the missing number completes a sequence.\n5. **Two-Draw Condition**: If none of the above conditions are met, drawing two tiles will always allow forming a mentsu (either by completing a triplet or starting a new sequence), so the answer is `2`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance even for the given constraints.",
