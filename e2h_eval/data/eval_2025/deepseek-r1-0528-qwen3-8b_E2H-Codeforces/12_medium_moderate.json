The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can consider the ring as circular.\n\n However, note that moving clockwise: \n   From house i, to go to house j:\n     If j >= i, then the distance is (j - i).\n     If j < i, then we can either go clockwise from i to j by going through the next houses until we complete the circle and then to j, which is (n - i + j). But note: we can also break the journey into segments.\n\n But note: since the ringroad is one-way, we can only move clockwise. So the movement from i to j is:\n   Option 1: Go from i to j without wrapping around the ring: if j >= i, then distance = j - i.\n   Option 2: If j < i, then we have to go from i to n, then from n to 1, and then from 1 to j? Actually, no, because it's a ring and we can't go counter-clockwise. \n        Actually, we can think: we can go from i to i+1, i+2, ... until we reach j by going all the way around? \n        The clockwise path from i to j when j < i: \n          We can go from i to n, then from n to 1, and then to j? But wait, we can't skip the fact that after n comes 1. However, the problem says the houses are numbered 1..n in clockwise order and the ringroad is one-way (clockwise). \n          So the entire ring has n houses, so the total distance from i to j (if j < i) is: (n - i) + j.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the distance as: (j - i) mod n? But note: we don't want negative. Actually, we can define:\n\n Let d(i, j) = (j - i) % n   but then if j-i is negative, we add n and then take modulo? Actually, we want the minimal clockwise distance from i to j.\n\n But note: the ring has fixed houses and we must traverse clockwise. The clockwise distance from i to j is:\n   If j >= i: j - i\n   Else: (n - i) + j\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to compute the distance from every house to every house, but rather we have a sequence of tasks.\n\n Important: Xenia must complete the tasks in the given order. And initially she is at house 1.\n\n Observation:\n   We can simulate the journey by keeping track of the current position and the total time.\n\n But note: m and n can be up to 10^5, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n However, the problem states: \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\n This means that the tasks are given in order, so we must do them in the given sequence.\n\n Steps:\n   Start at house 1.\n   Then for each task location (in order), we travel from the previous task location (or from the start) to the next.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the tasks are ordered by index. However, the example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n        Output: 6\n\n   Explanation: \n        Start at 1, then go to 3: \n            From 1 to 3: clockwise, so 1->2->3: 2 steps.\n        Then from 3 to 2: \n            Now, from 3 to 2: since 2<3, we have to go from 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (another step), then 1 to 2 (another step): total 3 steps.\n        Then from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n\n        Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the distance from the current house to the next task house using:\n\n        dist = 0\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for each task in the list:\n            if task >= current:\n                steps = task - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + task\n\n            total_time += steps\n            current = task\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \n        First task: 3 -> current=1, task=3: 3>=1 -> steps=2. total_time=2, current=3.\n        Second task: 2 -> current=3, task=2: 2<3 -> steps=4-3+2 = 3. total_time=5, current=2.\n        Third task: 3 -> current=2, task=3: 3>=2 -> steps=1. total_time=6.\n\n   That matches.\n\n   But wait, why did we use n=4? Because the ring has 4 houses. The formula for the else branch: n - current + task. \n        For current=3, task=2: 4-3+2 = 3, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input is \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", so n=4.\n\n   But what if n=5? Then from 3 to 2: 5-3+2 = 4, which is 3->4->5->1->2: that's 4 steps, which is correct.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n        Read n, m.\n        Read the list of m integers.\n\n        current = 1\n        total = 0\n\n        for each task in the list:\n            if task >= current:\n                total += (task - current)\n            else:\n                total += (n - current + task)\n\n            current = task\n\n        Print(total)\n\n   However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> steps=1, total=1, current=2.\n        Second task: 3 -> 3>=2 -> steps=1, total=2, current=3.\n        Third task: 3 -> same as current, so steps=0, total remains 2.\n\n        Output 2, which matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" is provided as the second example, and the expected output is 2.\n\n   However, let me check the example: \n        Start at 1, then go to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n        Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step)\n        Then from 3 to 3: 0 steps.\n\n        Total: 2.\n\n   This seems correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the tasks are done in order, and the condition is that when doing the i-th task, you must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. This doesn't change the order of movement.\n\n   However, the problem does not require to return to the starting point. It just requires to complete the tasks in the given order.\n\n   Therefore, the above algorithm is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the tasks are not necessarily distinct and we might have consecutive tasks in the same house? Then the else branch for the same house would be: \n        if task == current: then steps=0, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" So our algorithm handles that.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say that n and m can be up to 10^5, and we are doing a simple loop over m tasks, so this is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, there's a catch: the above formula for the else branch is (n - current + task). But note: we are moving from 'current' to 'task' in a circle. \n\n   Let me re-express the distance: \n        The entire ring is of length n. The direct clockwise distance from current to task is:\n            If task >= current: task - current\n            Otherwise: (n - current) + task\n\n   But note: we could also consider the entire circle as having two ways, but the problem restricts to clockwise. So we don't consider counter-clockwise.\n\n   However, wait: is there a possibility that sometimes going clockwise the long way might be shorter? No, because the ring is one-way. We can't go backwards. So we have to go clockwise.\n\n   But note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So we have no choice.\n\n   Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n   However, let me test with a different example: \n        n=5, tasks=[5,1,2]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 5 -> 5>=1 -> steps=4, total=4, current=5.\n        Second task: 1 -> 1<5 -> steps=5-5+1 = 1, total=5, current=1.\n        Third task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> steps=1, total=6.\n\n        Let's break down the moves:\n            From 1 to 5: 1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps.\n            From 5 to 1: 5->1 (but wait, in a ring of 5, the next house from 5 is 1, so that's 1 step? Actually, according to our formula: \n                n=5, current=5, task=1: 1<5 -> steps = 5-5+1 = 1. Correct.\n            Then from 1 to 2: 1 step.\n\n        Total 4+1+1=6.\n\n        But wait, from 5 to 1: actually, the ring is 1,2,3,4,5,1. So from 5 we can only go to 1, so that's 1 step. Correct.\n\n   Another example: \n        n=10, tasks=[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Step1: 10 -> 10>=1 -> steps=9, total=9, current=10.\n        Step2: 9 -> 9<10 -> steps=10-10+9=9, total=18, current=9.\n        Step3: 8 -> 8<9 -> steps=10-9+8=9, total=27, current=8.\n        ... until the last step: from 2 to 1: 2>=1 -> steps=1, total=27+1=28.\n\n        But wait, let's calculate the entire journey:\n\n        From 1 to 10: 9 steps (1->2->...->10)\n        Then from 10 to 9: 10->1->2->...->9? That would be 10->1 (1 step) and then from 1 to 9: 8 steps? So 1+8=9 steps.\n        Then from 9 to 8: 9->10->1->...->8? Again, 9->10 (1 step) and then 1 to 8 (7 steps) -> 8 steps? Wait, but our formula was 10-9+8=9.\n\n        Actually, the movement from 9 to 8 in a ring of 10: \n            We can go: 9->10->1->2->...->8: \n                How many steps? \n                    9->10: 1\n                    10->1: 1 (but wait, in a ring, the next house from 10 is 1, so that's 1 step) and then from 1 to 8: 7 steps. So total 1+1+7=9.\n\n        Similarly, from 10 to 9: \n            10->1: 1 step, then 1->2->...->9: 8 steps, so 1+8=9.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the houses are numbered 1 through n. The starting house is 1, and the task locations are between 1 and n.\n\n   But wait, what if n=1? The problem states n>=2.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total_time += t - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + t\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n        n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n        current=1, total_time=0\n        t=3: 3>=1 -> total_time=2, current=3\n        t=2: 2<3 -> total_time=2 + (4-3+2)=2+3=5, current=2\n        t=3: 3>=2 -> total_time=5+1=6, current=3\n        Output: 6 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n        current=1, total_time=0\n        t=2: 2>=1 -> total_time=1, current=2\n        t=3: 3>=2 -> total_time=1+1=2, current=3\n        t=3: 3>=3 -> total_time=2+0=2, current=3\n        Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement says the second example input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n   However, the example in the problem note says: \n        Input: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n        Output: \n            ['6', '2']\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But wait, I just noticed: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" is provided as the second example, and we output 2.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\" \n        This first example is \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", and the second example is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\".\n\n   There is a possibility that the example inputs are given as strings in a list, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We assume the input is provided in the standard way.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: what if the tasks are large and the total_time might be very big? The problem says n, m up to 10^5, so the maximum distance for one segment is at most n (which is 10^5) and we have m (10^5) segments, so the total_time could be up to 10^10, which is within the range of Python integers, but we should use integer arithmetic.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\" \n        In Python, we don't have to worry about that because integers can be arbitrarily large, but we are just printing an integer.\n\n   However, the problem constraints are up to 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, which is acceptable for Python.\n\n   But wait, worst-case scenario: \n        n = 10^5, and we have a task list that goes from 1 to n, then from n to 1, then from 1 to n, etc.\n\n        Example: n=10^5, and tasks = [10**5] * 10**5   (all tasks at house 10^5)\n\n        Then the journey:\n            Start at 1.\n            First task: from 1 to 10^5: steps = 10^5-1\n            Then each subsequent task: from 10^5 to 10^5: 0\n\n            Total_time = 10^5-1, which is 99999.\n\n        Another worst-case: alternating between 1 and n (with n=10^5) for 10^5 tasks.\n\n        Example: tasks = [1, n, 1, n, ...] (m=10^5, so 50000 times 1 and 50000 times n)\n\n        Then:\n            Start at 1.\n            First task: 1 -> 0\n            Second task: n -> n-1 (if n>1) but wait, from 1 to n: n-1 steps? Actually, from 1 to n: n-1 steps (because we don't wrap). But wait, n is the last house, so from 1 to n: n-1 steps? Actually, the houses are 1,2,...,n. The distance from 1 to n is n-1.\n\n            Then from n to 1: \n                n>=1? Actually, 1 < n, so we use the else branch: n - n + 1 = 1 step.\n\n            Then from 1 to n: n-1 steps.\n\n            Then from n to 1: 1 step.\n\n            So for two tasks (one round trip): (n-1) + 1 steps.\n\n            Then for 10^5 tasks (which is even, say 2*50000):\n                Each pair (from 1 to n and then n to 1) takes (n-1)+1 = n steps.\n\n            Total_time = 50000 * n = 50000 * 10^5 = 5e9, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, the first task is from 1 to 1: 0, then from 1 to n: n-1, then from n to 1: 1, then from 1 to n: n-1, then from n to 1: 1, etc.\n\n        Actually, the first two tasks (if the first task is 1 and the second is n) then:\n            Start at 1, first task is 1: 0 steps, then second task is n: n-1 steps.\n\n        Then the third task (if exists) is 1: from n to 1: 1 step.\n\n        So for the entire 10^5 tasks, the pattern is:\n\n            Task0: 1 -> 1: 0\n            Task1: 1 -> n: n-1\n            Task2: n -> 1: 1\n            Task3: 1 -> n: n-1\n            ...\n\n        So if there are k pairs (each pair being two tasks: one at n and one at 1) then:\n\n            If m is even: \n                The first task is 1 (if we start with 1) then we have (m//2) pairs of (n and 1) but note the first two tasks are: [1, n] then [n, 1] then [1, n] etc.\n\n            Actually, the example tasks = [1, n, 1, n, ...] for m=10^5 (even) then:\n\n                Number of 1's: m/2 (including the first one) and n's: m/2.\n\n            The movements:\n                From 1 (start) to first task (1): 0\n                Then from 1 to n: n-1\n                Then from n to 1: 1\n                Then from 1 to n: n-1\n                Then from n to 1: 1\n                ...\n\n            The total_time = 0 + (n-1) + 1 + (n-1) + 1 + ... for (m-1) moves? Actually, we have m-1 moves (since we start at 1 and then do m tasks).\n\n            The first move (from 1 to first task) is included in the first task.\n\n            Actually, we break the journey into m-1 legs (from the start to the first task, then from the first task to the second, etc.)\n\n            The legs:\n                Leg1: from 1 to 1 -> 0\n                Leg2: from 1 to n -> n-1\n                Leg3: from n to 1 -> 1\n                Leg4: from 1 to n -> n-1\n                Leg5: from n to 1 -> 1\n                ...\n\n            So the legs for even-indexed tasks (starting from 0) are:\n                For leg i (i from 0 to m-1):\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                Leg0: from 1 to 1 -> 0\n                Leg1: from 1 to n -> n-1\n                Leg2: from n to 1 -> 1\n                Leg3: from 1 to n -> n-1\n                Leg4: from n to 1 -> 1\n\n            So the pattern for legs is:\n\n                For i from 0 to m-1 (0-indexed leg index, representing the movement to the (i+1)-th task):\n\n                    if i==0: 0\n                    else:\n                        if i is odd: then the previous task was n (if i is odd and positive, then the previous task is the first n) or 1? Actually, we are alternating.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note:\n\n                The first task (index0) is at 1, so we don't move (or we start at 1 and the first task is 1).\n\n                Then the second task (index1) is at n, so we move from 1 to n: n-1.\n\n                Then the third task (index2) is at 1, so we move from n to 1: 1.\n\n                Then the fourth task (index3) is at n: from 1 to n: n-1.\n\n                Then the fifth task (index4) is at 1: from n to 1: 1.\n\n            Therefore, for i>=1 (leg index i, which is the movement from task i-1 to task i):\n\n                If i is odd (like 1,3,5,...): then we are going from 1 to n (n-1) OR from n to 1 (1)? \n\n            Actually, the movement from task i-1 to task i:\n\n                i=1: from task0 (which is 1) to task1 (n): n-1\n                i=2: from task1 (n) to task2 (1): 1\n                i=3: from task2 (1) to task3 (n): n-1\n                i=4: from task3 (n) to task4 (1): 1\n\n            So for i>=1:\n                if i is odd: then we are going from 1 to n: n-1\n                if i is even: then we are going from n to 1: 1\n\n            Then total_time = 0 + (for i=1 to m-1: if i odd: n-1; if i even: 1)\n\n            Since m=10^5, then we have 10^5 - 1 legs (from the start to the first task and then from each task to the next).\n\n            How many odd indices in the range [1, m-1]? \n                The legs are from index1 to index m-1 (both inclusive). The number of legs is m-1.\n\n            Number of odd legs: ceil((m-1)/2) but actually:\n\n                The legs are numbered from 1 to m-1.\n\n                For i from 1 to m-1:\n                    if i is odd: count of odd legs = (m-1)//2 if m-1 is even, or (m-1+1)//2?\n\n            Actually, the odd indices: 1,3,5,..., up to m-1 (if m-1 is odd) or m-2 (if m-1 is even). \n\n            Alternatively, we can note:\n\n                Number of odd-indexed legs (legs with index i where i is odd) is (m-1+1)//2 if we consider the first leg (index1) as odd.\n\n            Actually, the odd-indexed legs (in terms of leg index) are the ones that are odd numbers: 1,3,5,..., which is (m-1)//2 if (m-1) is even, or (m-1)//2 + 1 if odd? \n\n            But wait: \n                If m-1 is even: then the last leg index is even? Actually, the legs are from 1 to m-1. The count of odd numbers in [1, m-1] is (m-1)//2 if m-1 is even, and (m-1+1)//2 if m-1 is odd.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use: \n                num_odd = ((m-1) + 1) // 2   # because the numbers from 1 to m-1: the number of odd numbers is (m-1+1)//2\n\n            Example: m=4 -> legs: 1,2,3 -> odd legs: 1,3 -> 2, which is (3+1)//2 = 4//2=2.\n            Example: m=3 -> legs: 1,2 -> odd legs: 1 -> 1, which is (2+1)//2 = 3//2=1 (integer division) -> correct.\n\n            Actually, the formula for the number of odd numbers from 1 to n is (n+1)//2.\n\n            Here, n = m-1, so number of odd legs = (m-1+1)//2 = m//2.\n\n            Then the even legs (from n to 1) occur (m-1)//2 times.\n\n            Then total_time = (number of odd legs)*(n-1) + (number of even legs)*1\n                         = (m//2)*(n-1) + ((m-1)//2)*1\n\n            For m=4: (4//2)*(n-1) + (3//2) = 2*(n-1) + 1 (since 3//2=1) -> 2*(n-1)+1.\n\n            But wait, our example for m=4, n=4: \n                tasks = [1,4,1,4] (if we have 4 tasks, but wait the example above was for two tasks per cycle? Actually, the example tasks were [1,4,1,4] for m=4.\n\n                Our algorithm:\n\n                    current=1\n                    task0: 1 -> 0, current=1\n                    task1: 4 -> 4>=1 -> 3, total=3, current=4\n                    task2: 1 -> 1<4 -> 4-4+1=1, total=4, current=1\n                    task3: 4 -> 4>=1 -> 3, total=7, current=4\n\n                So total_time=7.\n\n                But by the formula: (4//2)*(4-1) + (4-1)//2 = 2*3 + 3//2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Correct.\n\n            But wait, the example above with alternating tasks and m=10^5: \n                total_time = (10^5//2)*(n-1) + (10^5-1)//2 * 1\n                            = 50000 * (10^5-1) + 49999\n                            = 50000*99999 + 49999\n                            = 4999950000 + 49999 = 4999999999\n\n            This is acceptable in Python.\n\n   However, note that the above analysis is just for a specific worst-case. Our original algorithm is simpler and works for any task list.\n\n   Therefore, we stick to the original algorithm.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total_time += t - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + t\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   Let me run the example with m=4, n=4, tasks=[1,4,1,4] and see:\n\n        current=1\n        t=1: 1>=1 -> total_time=0, current=1.\n        t=4: 4>=1 -> total_time=3, current=4.\n        t=1: 1<4 -> total_time=3 + (4-4+1)=3+1=4, current=1.\n        t=4: 4>=1 -> total_time=4+3=7, current=4.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n   Our code produces 6, which is correct.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad of houses. The ringroad is one-way and clockwise, so Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction. The solution involves calculating the distance between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house number 1, as given in the problem.\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task location, calculate the distance from the current position to the task's house:\n   - If the task's house number is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between the two.\n   - If the task's house number is less than the current position, the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then from house 1 to the task's house.\n3. **Update current position**: After each task, update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Sum the distances**: Accumulate the distances for all tasks to get the total time required.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement by breaking down each leg of the journey into straightforward arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            total_time += t - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + t\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n- **Loop through tasks**: For each task, it checks if the task's house is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction. If the task's house is ahead, the distance is the difference between the two. If it's behind, the distance is the sum of moving from the current position to the end of the ring and then from the start of the ring to the task's house.\n- **Update and accumulate**: The current position is updated to the task's house after each iteration, and the total time is accumulated by adding the computed distance for each task.\n- **Output**: Finally, the total time is printed, which represents the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all tasks in the given order.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the problem with a time complexity of O(m), making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.",
