For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. We need to determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number in a 12-note circle. The notes are: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] (note: H is the same as B? Actually, wait: the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And it's cyclic. But note: the example input \"A B H\" — wait, let me check the example: \n   Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n   Output: ['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\n However, note that the note list is 12 and the problem states: \"after H goes C again\", so the 12th note is H. But wait, the list has 12 distinct notes. Let me count: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H -> 12 notes.\n\n But wait, in the example, one of the inputs is \"A B H\". In standard music theory, H is sometimes called B-flat? Actually, the problem states the note list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So we have two B's? No, wait: the last note is H. \n\n Let me clarify: the problem says the notes are: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n So the 12th note is H. Then the next after H is C. \n\n But wait, in standard music, the chromatic scale from C is: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B.\n\n Here, the problem uses H for the last note. So we have two different notations: one uses B (which is the 11th note) and then H (which is the 12th note). \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\". So the notes are:\n\n 0: C\n 1: C#\n 2: D\n 3: D#\n 4: E\n 5: F\n 6: F#\n 7: G\n 8: G#\n 9: A\n 10: B\n 11: H\n\n However, wait: the example input \"A B H\" — that would be notes at positions 9, 10, and 11. Then the distances would be computed from these numbers.\n\n But note: the chord definition is about the cyclic distances. We have to consider the circle. So we can map each note to a number from 0 to 11.\n\n Steps:\n - Create a list of the 12 notes: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n - Map the input notes to numbers. But note: the input might have sharps and flats? The problem says the input is in the above-given notation.\n\n Important: the input is three space-separated notes. Each note is one of the 12.\n\n However, note that the example \"C# B F\": \n   C# -> index 1, B -> index 10, F -> index 5.\n\n How do we compute the distances? We are to consider the cyclic nature. But the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes is 1 semitone\", and the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest, meaning we should order the notes in increasing order (then take modulo 12). However, the example says: \n   For minor: \"C# B F\" ordered as \"B C# F\" -> so we are ordering the notes in the circle from low to high.\n\n Steps for computing the distances:\n 1. Map the three notes to their indices (0-11).\n 2. Since the circle is cyclic, we can arrange the three numbers in a circular way. But we want to check all cyclic orders? Actually, we have to consider that the chord is unordered. We have to consider all cyclic shifts and also the reverse? \n\n However, note the definition: \n   Major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        (Y - X) % 12 =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither (classified as \"strange\"). The solution involves understanding the musical theory behind major and minor triads and translating that into a computational approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale starting from C (0). This allows us to perform mathematical operations on the notes.\n2. **Cyclic Order Handling**: Since the musical scale is cyclic, we handle the circular nature by normalizing the positions of the three notes. This involves rotating the notes so that the first note is at the start of the scale, effectively converting the problem into checking linear distances within a 12-note cycle.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each possible ordering of the three notes, compute the distances between consecutive notes in semitones. A major chord requires distances of 4 and 3 semitones between consecutive notes, while a minor chord requires distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Classification**: Check all possible cyclic permutations of the three notes to see if any ordering matches the criteria for a major or minor chord. If none match, classify the chord as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    \n    input_str = input().split()\n    if len(input_str) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        note_indices = [notes_list.index(note) for note in input_str]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    indices_sorted = sorted(note_indices)\n    base_index = min(note_indices)\n    normalized_indices = [(idx - base_index) % 12 for idx in note_indices]\n    normalized_indices.sort()\n    \n    rotations = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        rotated = normalized_indices[i:] + normalized_indices[:i]\n        rotations.append(rotated)\n        \n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n    \n    for triad in rotations:\n        d1 = (triad[1] - triad[0]) % 12\n        d2 = (triad[2] - triad[1]) % 12\n        d3 = (triad[0] + 12 - triad[2]) % 12\n        \n        total = d1 + d2 + d3\n        if total == 12:\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                is_major = True\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                is_minor = True\n                \n    if is_major and not is_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor and not is_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `notes_list` array maps each note to its position in the chromatic scale. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, up to 'H' which is 11.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is split into three separate notes. If the input does not contain exactly three distinct notes, it is classified as \"strange\".\n3. **Index Conversion**: Each note is converted to its corresponding index in the `notes_list`. If any note is invalid, the chord is \"strange\".\n4. **Normalization**: The notes are normalized by rotating them so the lowest note is at position 0. This simplifies distance calculations by treating the scale as linear within the 12-note cycle.\n5. **Distance Check**: For each cyclic permutation of the three notes, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated. If any permutation matches the major (4, 3) or minor (3, 4) pattern, the chord is classified accordingly.\n6. **Output**: Based on the checks, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither pattern is found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
