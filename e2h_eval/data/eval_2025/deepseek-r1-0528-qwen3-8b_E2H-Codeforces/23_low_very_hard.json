In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (minimum is 0) and we want to form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu). However, note that after drawing some tiles, we have more than three? Actually, the problem says: \"she has three tiles\", then she draws extra ones. The goal is to have at least one mentsu (three tiles) in her hand.\n\nBut note: the hand after drawing might be more than three? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that we use exactly three tiles for the mentsu. However, the definition of mentsu is three tiles. So we need three tiles to form a mentsu. But the hand size after drawing is n = 3 + k (where k is the number of draws). We are allowed to draw as many as we want, but we want the minimum k such that there exists a set of three tiles (from the hand) that forms a mentsu.\n\nHowever, note: the problem does not require that the entire hand is a mentsu. Only that there is at least one mentsu (so three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu) in the hand.\n\nBut wait, the examples:\n\nExample 1: Input is ['1s','2s','3s'] -> already a shuntsu, so answer 0.\nExample 2: ['9m','9m','9m'] -> koutsu, answer 0.\nExample 3: ['3p','9m','2p'] -> answer 1.\n\nIn example 3, after drawing one tile, we can get [3p, 9m, 2p, x] and then we have four tiles. Then we can form a shuntsu from three of them? Actually, we don't need to use all four. We just need to have three tiles that form a mentsu. So with four tiles, we can look for three that form a sequence or triplet.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"after drawing\", the hand has more tiles, but we only need one mentsu (three tiles) somewhere in the hand.\n\nSo the idea: we start with 3 tiles. We can draw k tiles (k>=0). We can choose which k tiles to draw arbitrarily (any tile, including duplicates). Then we must have at least one mentsu (a triplet or a sequence) in the entire hand.\n\nWhat are the possibilities?\n\nPossibility 1: Already have a mentsu (k=0) -> check if the three tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\nPossibility 2: If not, maybe we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile (k=1). Then we have four tiles. We can consider:\n\n- Forming a triplet: we might have two same tiles, then we need one more of the same. Or we might have one of a kind, then we need two more (but then k=2 would be required). However, with one draw, we can complete a triplet if we already have two of the same.\n\n- Forming a sequence: we might have two consecutive numbers in the same suit. Then we can draw the missing one. Or we might have two non-consecutive? Then one draw might not help.\n\nBut note: the problem allows drawing any tile. So we are free to choose the tile to draw.\n\nWe have to consider:\n\nCase 0: Check if the current three tiles form a mentsu. Then answer 0.\n\nCase 1: Check if we can complete a mentsu by drawing 1 tile.\n\nCase 2: Check if we can complete a mentsu by drawing 2 tiles.\n\nCase 3: Otherwise, we might need 3? But note: sometimes even 3 might not be enough? Actually, let's think: \n\nBut note: we can always form a triplet by drawing two more copies of one tile if we have one, or one more if we have two. Similarly, for sequences, we can complete a sequence by drawing two more (if we have one tile in the sequence) or one more (if we have two consecutive). However, the problem asks the minimum number.\n\nHowever, note that we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily, so we can also form multiple sets and choose the one that requires the least draws.\n\nBut the problem is: we are only required to have one mentsu. So we can focus on how to form one mentsu with minimal draws.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Parse input: three strings, each string is two characters: digit and suit.\n\n2. Check for k=0: \n   - Check if there is a koutsu: if there are three identical tiles (same digit and same suit).\n   - Check if there is a shuntsu: three tiles of the same suit and consecutive",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check for Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. This can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same digit and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Check for One Draw**: If no mentsu is found initially, we check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: If two tiles are part of a potential sequence (same suit and consecutive numbers), drawing the missing tile completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two Draws**: If one draw does not suffice, we then check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This includes:\n   - **Triplet Formation**: Drawing two additional tiles of an existing tile (if only one exists) to form a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Formation**: Drawing two tiles to complete a sequence from scattered tiles.\n\n4. **Final Check for Three Draws**: In cases where two draws do not form a mentsu, drawing three tiles will always suffice because we can form a triplet by drawing three copies of any tile.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [tile for tile in data]\n\n    # Check for 0 draws\n    if is_koutsu(tiles) or is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for 1 draw\n    if can_form_with_one_draw(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Check for 2 draws\n    if can_form_with_two_draws(tiles):\n        print(2)\n        return\n\n    # Otherwise, 3 draws\n    print(3)\n\ndef is_koutsu(tiles):\n    return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n\ndef is_shuntsu(tiles):\n    suits = set([t[1] for t in tiles])\n    if len(suits) != 1:\n        return False\n\n    digits = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles]\n    digits.sort()\n    \n    if len(set(digits)) != 3:\n        return False\n        \n    return digits[0] + 1 == digits[1] and digits[1] + 1 == digits[2]\n\ndef can_form_with_one_draw(tiles):\n    # Case 1: Triplet with one draw\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_suit = defaultdict(int)\n    count_num = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_suit[tile[1]] += 1\n        count_num[tile[0]] += 1\n\n    for suit, cnt in count_suit.items():\n        if cnt >= 2:\n            return True\n\n    # Case 2: Shuntsu with one draw\n    suits = set([t[1] for t in tiles])\n    for suit in suits:\n        num_tiles = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        num_tiles.sort()\n        seen = set(num_tiles)\n        for num in num_tiles:\n            if num + 1 in seen and num + 2 in seen:\n                return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef can_form_with_two_draws(tiles):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_suit = defaultdict(int)\n    count_num = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_suit[tile[1]] += 1\n        count_num[tile[0]] += 1\n\n    # Case 1: Form a triplet with two draws\n    for tile in tiles:\n        d, s = tile[0], tile[1]\n        count_needed = 3 - count_num[d]\n        if count_needed <= 2 and count_needed > 0:\n            return True\n\n    # Case 2: Form a shuntsu with two draws\n    suits = set([t[1] for t in tiles])\n    for suit in suits:\n        num_tiles = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        num_tiles.sort()\n        seen_nums = set(num_tiles)\n        for num in num_tiles:\n            if num + 1 in seen_nums and num + 2 in seen_nums:\n                return True\n            if num + 1 in seen_nums and num + 2 not in seen_nums:\n                continue\n            if num + 2 in seen_nums and num + 1 not in seen_nums:\n                continue\n\n        # Consider having two tiles of the same suit but not forming a sequence\n        if len(num_tiles) < 3:\n            if len(num_tiles) == 2:\n                for candidate in range(min(num_tiles) - 1, max(num_tiles) + 3):\n                    if candidate not in seen_nums:\n                        if candidate + 1 not in seen_nums:\n                            if candidate + 2 not in seen_nums:\n                                continue\n                        else:\n                            return True\n            elif len(num_tiles) == 1:\n                for candidate in range(num_tiles[0] - 2, num_tiles[0] + 3):\n                    if candidate == num_tiles[0]:\n                        continue\n                    if candidate + 1 in seen_nums and candidate + 2 in seen_nums:\n                        return True\n\n    return False\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the three tiles form a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) without any draws. If so, it prints `0`.\n2. **One Draw Check**: If no mentsu is found initially, the code checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves checking if two identical tiles exist (for a triplet) or if two tiles can form part of a sequence (for a shuntsu).\n3. **Two Draws Check**: If one draw isn't sufficient, the code checks if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This includes completing a triplet by drawing two more of an existing tile or forming a sequence from scattered tiles in the same suit.\n4. **Three Draws**: If none of the above checks pass, the code defaults to three draws, ensuring a triplet can always be formed by drawing three copies of any tile.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, leveraging combinatorial checks for both triplets and sequences.",
