There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is knockout. The winner must win all his games. We want the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n The rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n Let's denote that the winner plays k games. Then, the structure of the tournament must allow the winner to play k games, and the rule must be satisfied for each match the winner plays.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, the total number of games is n-1, but the winner's path is only k games, and k is at most floor(log2(n)) + something? Actually, the standard single elimination gives log2(n) as an upper bound (if n is power of two). However, note that the rule imposes an additional constraint.\n\n How does the rule work?\n Consider the winner's matches. Let the winner play in rounds. But note: the rule doesn't require the tournament to be perfectly balanced. However, we are allowed to arrange the grid arbitrarily (as long as the condition holds).\n\n Let's denote by a_i the number of games the winner has played before the i-th match (so the winner's first match: a_1 = 0, then after winning the first match becomes 1, then the second match requires that the opponent has between 0 and 1 games, etc.)\n\n But note: the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner can keep playing until he wins k times, and also the other players must be eliminated according to the rule.\n\n Alternate approach: think about the structure as a binary tree, but not necessarily complete.\n\n We can model the tournament as having two types of rounds for the winner:\n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, the tournament must have at least 2^k players? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, consider:\n\n k=0: no game, but then n>=2 so not applicable.\n\n k=1: n>=2 -> minimum 2 players. Then the winner plays one game. So n can be 2.\n\n k=2: the winner must play two games. In the first game, he plays one opponent. Then in the second game, he plays another opponent. But the rule says that when the winner has played 1 game (so 1 win), the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 game. However, the opponent must have won all his games. So the opponent must have come from a subtree that hasn't been played by the winner.\n\n How many players are needed for the winner to play 2 games?\n\n Option 1: \n   First round: two matches: (player1 vs player2) and (player3 vs player4). Then the winner plays the winner of the second match.\n\n   This requires 4 players.\n\n Option 2:\n   First round: (player1 vs player2) and then the winner plays (player3). But then the rule for the second game: the winner has 1 game, and the opponent (player3) must have between 0 and 1. If player3 didn't play any game, then it's okay (difference 1). But wait, how did we get to have three players? Actually, if there are only 3 players, then the first round must have one match (with one player getting a bye). But the rule says the two players can play if the number of games differs by at most one.\n\n   In the case of 3 players: \n      We could have the tournament as:\n        Round1: player1 vs player2 -> player1 wins (now player1 has 1 game, and player3 has 0)\n        Now, can player1 play against player3? The rule: |1 - 0| <= 1 -> yes.\n        So the winner (player1) plays 2 games.\n\n   Therefore, for k=2, we can have n=3 or n=4.\n\n   Similarly, for k=3:\n\n   We need to check the minimal n for k=3.\n\n   We can break down:\n\n   The winner must have 3 wins.\n\n   The first two wins: we can use the same structure as above (for k=2) but then the third opponent must have either 1 or 2 games (because the winner has 2 games). \n\n   However, the entire tournament must have a total of n players.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think recursively:\n\n   Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required for a winner to have k games.\n\n   Base cases:\n     f(0) = 1 (no game, just the winner)\n     f(1) = 2\n\n   For k>=1, the winner must defeat one player from a bracket that has at least f(k-1) players (but note: the rule allows the opponent to have up to k-1 or k-2 games? Actually, when the winner has k-1 games, the opponent must have between k-2 and k-1 games? \n\n   However, note that the entire tournament must be built such that the winner's path is as above, and the rest of the players are arranged in subtrees that are \"compatible\" with the rule.\n\n   Actually, we can think of the tournament as having two halves: the winner's half and the rest.\n\n   But note: the rule is global. However, the key is to maximize the winner's games.\n\n   After reading the examples and the sample outputs:\n\n     Input: 2 -> Output: 1\n            3 -> Output: 2\n            4 -> Output: 2\n            10 -> Output: 4\n\n   Why for n=10 the answer is 4?\n\n   Let me explain:\n\n   The winner must play 4 games. The minimal number of players to have a winner play 4 games is 10? Or maybe 10 is more than enough.\n\n   Actually, we can compute the minimal n for k games.\n\n   Let F(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\n   Conditions for the last match (the k-th match):\n     The winner has k-1 wins, so the opponent must have either k-2 or k-1 wins.\n\n   How do we build the tournament?\n\n   In the last two matches (the k-1 and k), we have:\n\n     Match k: Winner (with k-1 wins) vs Opponent (with w wins, where w is either k-2 or k-1)\n\n   The opponent must have come from a subtree that has a certain number of players. The entire tournament is structured so that the winner's opponents are chosen from the remaining players.\n\n   We can model the tournament as a full binary tree? But note the rule allows for byes (like in a standard single elimination, but sometimes you don't play in early rounds) but here the rule is about the number of games played.\n\n   Actually, we can define:\n\n   Let A_k be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games.\n\n   The last match: the winner (from a subtree of size A_{k-1}) must play an opponent who comes from a subtree of size at least A_{k-1} or A_{k-2}? \n\n   However, note the rule: the opponent must have either k-2 or k-1 games. \n\n   But the opponent's subtree must have been a tournament that produced one winner (the opponent) and the opponent's number of wins is the number of games he played, which is the depth of his wins. \n\n   Actually, the opponent's number of wins must be the same as the depth of the subtree he came from. And the entire tournament must be set up so that the winner and the opponent are the two winners of their respective subtrees.\n\n   The two subtrees must have been played under the same rule.\n\n   But note: the entire tournament must be such that the winner's matches and the opponent's matches are scheduled appropriately.\n\n   How to combine?\n\n   Consider the two possibilities for the opponent's wins:\n\n   Case 1: Opponent has k-2 wins.\n      Then the opponent's subtree must have at least A_{k-2} players (to produce an opponent with k-2 wins).\n\n   Case 2: Opponent has k-1 wins.\n      Then the opponent's subtree must have at least A_{k-1} players.\n\n   But wait, the entire tournament has two parts: the winner's part and the opponent's part, and the rest of the players must be arranged in these two subtrees.\n\n   However, note: the winner's subtree (excluding the last match) must have the winner and the players that the winner defeated in the first k-1 matches. Similarly, the opponent's subtree must have the opponent and the players that the opponent defeated.\n\n   But also, there might be other subtrees? Actually, the entire tournament is the union of the two subtrees (the one producing the winner and the one producing the opponent) and possibly some other players? \n\n   However, the problem states that the tournament is knockout and we are only concerned with the winner's path.\n\n   Actually, the minimal way to set up the tournament for the winner to have k games is to have two subtrees: one that produces the winner (which requires A_{k-1} players) and one that produces the opponent (which requires either A_{k-1} or A_{k-2} players). But note: the two subtrees must be disjoint.\n\n   So the minimal n for k games would be:\n\n      n_min(k) = 1 + [minimal number of players in the opponent's subtree] \n\n   But wait, the winner's entire path is built from the two subtrees? Actually, the winner's subtree (without the last match) requires A_{k-1} players (including the winner and the opponents he beat in the first k-1 matches). Then the last match requires one more opponent, who comes from a subtree of size at least A_{k-1} (if the opponent has k-1 wins) or A_{k-2} (if the opponent has k-2 wins). \n\n   However, note: the winner's entire subtree (the one that leads to the winner) must have the winner and the players he beat, but the players he beat are the ones from the opponent's side? Actually, we can model the entire tournament as:\n\n   Total players = (players in the winner's subtree) + (players in the opponent's subtree) - 2 * (the players that are common?) -> no, because the two subtrees are separate.\n\n   Actually, the tournament has two halves: the winner's half (which includes the winner and the players he beat) and the opponent's half (which includes the opponent and the players the opponent beat). But note: the winner and the opponent are distinct.\n\n   However, the minimal tournament for k games would be:\n\n      If we choose the opponent to have k-1 wins, then the opponent's subtree has A_{k-1} players, and the winner's subtree (the one we are building) has A_{k-1} players (but note: the winner is included in both? Actually, we must subtract the winner). \n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   Let F(k) be the minimal number of players that must be present so that the winner (one specific player) can have k wins.\n\n   Then, the winner must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must have a certain number of wins (at most k-1). The minimal way is to have the opponents themselves come from increasingly large subtrees.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   In order for the winner to have k wins, the tournament must have at least:\n\n      T(0) = 1 (the winner)\n      T(1) = 2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\n      For k >= 2, the winner must have a subtree for the first k-1 wins (which takes T(k-1) players) and then the last opponent must come from a subtree that has at least T(k-2) or T(k-1) players? Actually, the opponent must have either k-2 or k-1 wins.\n\n   But note: the entire tournament must have a structure such that the winner's k-1 wins are achieved, and then the last opponent must be the winner of a separate tournament that has at least one player (if the opponent has 0 wins) but wait, the opponent must have played k-2 or k-1 games.\n\n   Actually, the minimal tournament for the opponent to have k-1 wins is T(k-1) (same as the winner's first k-1 wins). But wait, the opponent's wins are independent.\n\n   However, we can share the same structure for the opponent's subtree as the winner's. But note: the rule applies to the entire tournament, so the scheduling must be consistent.\n\n   There is an alternative known solution for this problem: the answer is the maximum k such that the sum of two geometric series:\n\n      Let k be the answer. Then the total number of players must be at least:\n\n          S(k) = 2^(k) - 1   [this is the standard single elimination, but note the rule]\n\n   But wait, the example: n=10, answer=4.\n\n   Standard single elimination for 10 players: the winner would have ceil(log2(10)) = 4 wins? Actually, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, so to have 10 players, the winner must have at least 4 wins? Because the tournament would have 4 rounds.\n\n   However, the example output for n=10 is 4, so that matches.\n\n   But wait, for n=4: \n        standard single elimination: winner plays 2 games (since 2^2=4). So that matches.\n\n   For n=3: \n        standard single elimination: the winner would have 2 wins (since 3-1=2, and the tournament has 2 games). But wait, the tournament with 3 players: one bye, then two games. The winner plays 2 games.\n\n   So the answer is the maximum k such that 2^k >= n? \n\n   However, let's check:\n\n        n=2: 2^1=2 -> k=1 -> correct.\n        n=3: 2^2=4 >=3 -> k=2 -> correct.\n        n=4: 2^2=4 >=4 -> k=2 -> correct.\n        n=5: 2^3=8 >=5 -> k=3 -> but the example doesn't give n=5, but according to the pattern, for n=5 the winner would play 3 games? \n\n   However, wait the example input only goes to 10, and the output for 10 is 4 (which is floor(log2(10)) + 1? Actually, log2(10) is about 3.3, so floor(3.3)=3, then 3+1=4? \n\n   But then for n=5: floor(log2(5)) is 2, then 2+1=3 -> so k=3.\n\n   However, is k=3 possible for n=5?\n\n        We need to arrange 5 players so that the winner (player1) plays 3 games.\n\n        The tournament must have 3 wins for the winner.\n\n        The minimal number of players for 3 wins (by the standard) is 8 (since 2^3=8). But we have only 5, so is it possible?\n\n        Let's try:\n\n        We need 3 wins for the winner.\n\n        The last match: the winner has 2 wins, the opponent must have either 1 or 2 wins.\n\n        Option 1: Opponent has 2 wins (so the opponent beat two players). Then the entire tournament would have:\n\n          Winner's wins: 3 (against three opponents: one with 0 wins, one with 1 win, and one with 2 wins? Actually, the opponents in the first two matches must have been built from their own subtrees.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the entire tournament as:\n\n          Round1: We have to arrange the players. Since the winner must play 3 games, there must be at least 3 rounds.\n\n          Round1: Some matches. The winner (player1) must be in one of them. Then he advances.\n\n          Round2: He must play again.\n\n          Round3: He must play again.\n\n        How many players are eliminated in each round?\n\n        We can use a different structure: not necessarily a power of two.\n\n        According to the rule, the tournament can be arranged arbitrarily as long as the condition holds.\n\n        Let me try to build for n=5:\n\n          We have 5 players: P1 (winner), P2, P3, P4, P5.\n\n          We need to have 3 wins for P1.\n\n          Possibility:\n\n          Round1: \n            Match1: P2 vs P3 -> say P2 wins (so P2 has 1 win)\n            Match2: P4 vs P5 -> say P4 wins (so P4 has 1 win)\n\n          Now, we have 3 players left: P1 (0 wins), P2 (1 win), P4 (1 win)\n\n          Round2: \n            Now, we cannot have P1 play against both P2 and P4 in the same round. We have to schedule two matches? But we have 3 players.\n\n          We can do:\n            Match1: P1 vs P2 -> P1 wins (P1 now has 1 win, and P2 is out)\n            Now, we have two players: P1 (1 win) and P4 (1 win)\n\n          Round3: \n            Match: P1 vs P4 -> P1 wins (P1 has 2 wins). But we only have 2 wins, not 3.\n\n          Alternatively, in Round2 we have to have two matches? But we only have 3 players. We can give a bye to one. But the rule: two players can play if the difference is at most one.\n\n          Another possibility:\n\n          Round1: \n            We have 5 players. We can have two matches and one bye. Let's assign:\n\n            Match1: P1 vs P2 -> P1 wins (P1:1)\n            Match2: P3 vs P4 -> P3 wins (P3:1)\n            P5 gets a bye.\n\n          Now, Round2: \n            We have 3 players: P1 (1), P3 (1), P5 (0)\n\n          Now, we can have:\n            Match1: P1 vs P3 -> P1 wins (P1:2)\n            Then we have two players: P1 (2) and P5 (0). The rule: |2-0|=2 -> not allowed. So we cannot have P1 play P5.\n\n          Alternatively, in Round2:\n            We can have:\n            Match1: P1 vs P5 -> |1-0|=1 -> allowed. P1 wins (P1:2)\n            Then we have two players: P1 (2) and P3 (1). Now |2-1|=1 -> allowed. Then Round3: P1 vs P3 -> P1 wins (total 3 wins).\n\n          So for n=5, the winner can have 3 wins.\n\n          Therefore, the answer for n=5 should be 3.\n\n        Now, what is the minimal n for k=3? We just used n=5, but what is the minimal n for k=3?\n\n        We need at least 5 players.\n\n        How about k=4? Minimal n for k=4?\n\n          The winner must have 4 wins.\n\n          The last match: the opponent must have either 2 or 3 wins.\n\n          We can build:\n\n          Round1: ... (we need to have a structure that eventually leads to the winner having 4 wins)\n\n          The minimal n for k=4 is 9? Because:\n\n          Standard single elimination: 2^4 - 1 = 15, but we don't need a complete bracket.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the recurrence:\n\n          Let F(k) be the minimal n for k wins.\n\n          Then, F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3 or 4? Actually, for k=2: we saw that n=3 and n=4 both work, so minimal is 3.\n\n          Then, for k=3, we have minimal n=5.\n\n          Then, for k=4, the minimal n is ?\n\n          The last match: the opponent must have either 2 or 3 wins.\n\n          Option 1: Opponent has 3 wins. Then the opponent's subtree must have at least F(3)=5 players (minimal). Then the winner's subtree (without the last match) must have F(3)=5 players (because the winner had 3 wins already, so the entire winner's path including the last match requires the same structure as having 3 wins, but then the last opponent comes from a separate 5-player tournament). Then total players = 5 (for the winner's side) + 5 (for the opponent's side) - 2 (because the two tournaments are separate and we are counting the winner and the opponent separately) -> but wait, the winner is only one and the opponent is only one. Actually, the two subtrees are separate and the winner is in one and the opponent is in the other. So the total players is F(3) (for the winner's side) + F(3) (for the opponent's side) - 1 (because the root of the winner's side is the winner and the root of the opponent's side is the opponent, and these two are distinct, so no overlap). But wait, the winner's side is built from the winner and the players he beat, and the opponent's side is built from the opponent and the players he beat. They are disjoint.\n\n          However, note: the winner's side for 3 wins requires 5 players (including the winner). The opponent's side for 3 wins requires 5 players (including the opponent). Then the total is 5+5 = 10, but then we have the winner and the opponent are two distinct players, so that's 10 players.\n\n          Option 2: Opponent has 2 wins. Then the opponent's side requires F(2)=3 players (minimal). Then total players = F(3) (which is 5) + F(2) (which is 3) = 8.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal n for k=4 is min(10,8) = 8.\n\n          But wait, is 8 enough? \n\n          We have two subtrees: one for the winner (which has 5 players) and one for the opponent (which has 3 players). Then the total is 8.\n\n          However, the winner's subtree (for 3 wins) must have 5 players, so the opponent's subtree (for 2 wins) must have 3 players, and they are disjoint. Then the entire tournament has 5+3 = 8 players.\n\n          But is that valid? \n\n          The winner's path: \n            First, the winner (from the 5-player subtree) has 3 wins (so he played 3 matches). Then the last match against the opponent (from the 3-player subtree) who has 2 wins. The rule: |3-2|=1 -> allowed.\n\n          So k=4 is achievable with n=8.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal n for k=4 is 8.\n\n        Now, we can see a recurrence:\n\n          F(0) = 1\n          F(1) = 2\n          For k>=2, F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n          But wait, for k=2: F(2) = F(1)+F(0)=2+1=3 -> correct (minimal n for 2 wins is 3).\n          For k=3: F(3)=F(2)+F(1)=3+2=5 -> correct.\n          For k=4: F(4)=F(3)+F(2)=5+3=8 -> correct.\n\n        This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n        Then, the answer for a given n is the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        Why?\n\n        Because F(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\n        Then, we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        However, note: F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, F(4)=8, F(5)=13, F(6)=21, ... \n\n        Example: n=10 -> the maximum k such that F(k)<=10 is k=4 (because F(4)=8<=10, and F(5)=13>10). So answer=4.\n\n        Example: n=4 -> F(2)=3<=4, F(3)=5>4 -> k=2.\n\n        Example: n=3 -> F(2)=3<=3 -> k=2.\n\n        Example: n=2 -> F(1)=2<=2 -> k=1.\n\n        Example: n=5 -> F(3)=5<=5 -> k=3.\n\n        Example: n=6 -> F(3)=5<=6, F(4)=8>6 -> k=3.\n\n        Example: n=7 -> k=3.\n\n        Example: n=8 -> k=4.\n\n        Example: n=9 -> k=4 (since 8<=9, and 13>9).\n\n        Example: n=10 -> k=4.\n\n        This matches the sample: \n          Input: ['2','3','4','10'] -> Output: ['1','2','2','4']\n\n        But wait, the sample input 4 gives 2, which we get by k=2.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n          We have a recurrence: \n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n            F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n          We are given n (which can be up to 10^18). We need to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        However, note: the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially (like the golden ratio). The k will be around log_phi(n). Since n can be up to 10^18, k will be at most around 100 (because Fibonacci numbers grow as fast as the golden ratio, and the 90th Fibonacci number is already around 2.8e18?).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step1: Generate Fibonacci-like numbers (starting with F0=1, F1=2) until the value exceeds n.\n\n          Step2: Count the index k (the number of terms generated minus one, but note: we start counting from k=0).\n\n          However, note: our F(k) is defined for k>=0, and the answer is k (the number of wins). But note: the problem says the winner's number of games is k.\n\n          But wait, the definition: \n            k=0 -> 0 wins? That doesn't make sense because the tournament has at least 2 players and the winner must win at least one game. However, our base case F0=1 is for 0 wins (a completed tournament with no games for the winner?).\n\n          Actually, we are using F(k) as the minimal n for a winner to have k wins. The base case F0=1: a tournament with 1 player (the winner) and 0 wins. But the problem states n>=2.\n\n          So we are going to ignore k=0 because n>=2.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n          We'll generate the sequence until the value exceeds n.\n\n          Let k=0, a0=1; k=1, a1=2.\n          Then for k=2, a2 = a0+a1 = 3\n          Then for k=3, a3 = a1+a2 = 5\n          Then for k=4, a4 = a2+a3 = 8\n\n          Then we want the maximum k such that a_k <= n.\n\n          Then output k.\n\n        However, note: the problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in. And k is the number of wins (which is the same as the number of games).\n\n        But wait: the example n=3: k=2 -> 2 games, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the Fibonacci sequence we are generating is for the minimal n to have k wins. And we are taking the maximum k such that minimal n <= given n.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We can use a loop to generate the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n        However, n can be up to 10^18, but the Fibonacci sequence grows very fast (exponential). The k will be at most about 100 (because the 100th Fibonacci number is around 3.5e20, which is greater than 1e18). So we can safely iterate.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          count = 0\n          a0 = 1\n          a1 = 2\n          if n < a0: then answer 0? but n>=2, so not needed.\n          We start with k=0 and k=1.\n\n          We want the maximum k (which is the index) such that F(k) <= n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          current = 1\n          prev1 = 1   # for k-1\n          prev2 = 0   # for k-2, but we don't have k=-1, so we use two variables.\n\n          Alternatively, we can store the sequence.\n\n          Since we only care about the count (the k) and we don't need the entire sequence beyond n, we can:\n\n          k = 0\n          low = 1   # F0\n          high = 2  # F1\n\n          Then while high <= n:\n              k = k+1\n              temp = low + high\n              low = high\n              high = temp\n\n          Then the answer is k (the number of wins) but wait, we started with k=0 for the first term (n>=1). Then we are counting the index.\n\n          Actually, we want the maximum k (number of wins) such that F(k) <= n.\n\n          Our sequence:\n\n            k=0: F0=1\n            k=1: F1=2\n            k=2: F2=3\n            k=3: F3=5\n\n          But note: the minimal n for k wins is F(k). So we want the maximum k such that F(k)<=n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          Let k = 0\n          Let a = 1   # F0\n          Let b = 2   # F1\n\n          Then if n>=1, then k=0 is valid. Then we check for k=1: if n>=2, then k=1 is valid. Then we move to k=2.\n\n          We can iterate:\n\n          k = 0\n          while True:\n             if k==0: a=1\n             elif k==1: a=2\n             else: a = previous_two_terms_sum\n\n          But we can do:\n\n          a, b = 1, 2\n          k = 1   # because we have at least one win (minimum n=2) then k=1 is the minimum.\n\n          Actually, we want to count the index k (which is the number of wins). The minimal n for k wins is F(k). We start with k=0 (n>=1) and then k=1 (n>=2), then k=2 (n>=3), etc.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Let k = 0\n          Let low = 1   # F0\n          Let high = 2   # F1\n\n          Then we are going to count the highest k for which F(k) <= n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          while low <= n:\n              # then k is at least 0, but we want the maximum k (index) such that F(k)<=n.\n              # But we are storing two consecutive terms.\n\n          Instead, we can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          a = 1\n          while a <= n:\n              k += 1\n              if k == 1:\n                  a = 2\n              else:\n                  a = a + prev   # but we need to remember the previous two.\n\n          Better:\n\n          Let a_prev2 = 1   # F0\n          Let a_prev1 = 2   # F1\n          k = 1   # because we have the first term (F1=2) is the minimal for 1 win.\n\n          Then, while a_prev1 <= n:\n              # then we have a candidate for k (current k is the index, but we are counting the wins as k)\n              # But actually, we are storing F(k) in a_prev1 for k being the current index.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          a0 = 1\n          a1 = 2\n          if n >= a0:\n              k = 0\n          if n >= a1:\n              k = 1\n\n          Then for k>=2, we compute a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}, and if a_k <= n, then k is valid.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          a0 = 1\n          a1 = 2\n          # We are going to iterate until a1 > n, but we also need to consider a0.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          a_prev = 1   # F0\n          a_curr = 1   # we will update to F1, then F2, etc.\n\n          But let me reframe:\n\n          We want to know the maximum index k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n          We can generate the sequence until the value exceeds n.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          k = 0\n          F[0] = 1\n          if n < 1: then no solution? but n>=2.\n          Then k=1, F[1]=2\n          Then k=2, F[2]=3\n          ...\n\n          Code:\n\n          k = 0\n          a = 1\n          while a <= n:\n              k += 1\n              if k == 1:\n                  a = 2\n              else:\n                  a = a + (a - previous_previous)   # no, we need two variables.\n\n          We can use:\n\n          a0 = 1\n          a1 = 2\n          k = 1   # because we have a1=2 for k=1 wins.\n\n          Then while a1 <= n:\n              k += 1\n              a_next = a0 + a1\n              a0 = a1\n              a1 = a_next\n\n          Then the answer is k? \n\n          But note: when we break the loop, a1 is the first value that exceeds n. Then the last valid k is the previous one.\n\n          Example: n=2\n\n          Start: a0=1, a1=2, k=1 (because we enter the loop with a1=2<=2 -> true)\n          Then k becomes 2, and a_next = 1+2=3, then a0=2, a1=3.\n          Then we check 3<=2? no, so break.\n\n          Then the answer should be k-1? because we incremented k too much.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          a_prev_prev = 1   # F0\n          a_prev = 2        # F1\n          while a_prev <= n:\n              k = 1          # because we are at F1, so k=1 is valid.\n              # Then we break?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that the winner must defeat `k` opponents in `k` consecutive games. Each opponent must have a number of wins differing by at most one from the winner's current wins. This constraint leads us to model the problem using a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the recurrence relation `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`, with base cases `F(0) = 1` and `F(1) = 2`. This sequence grows exponentially, allowing us to efficiently compute the solution even for very large `n` (up to 10^18).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate terms of this sequence until the term exceeds the given `n`. The largest term less than or equal to `n` gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. This approach leverages the exponential growth of the sequence to handle very large values of `n` efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a0 = 1\n    a1 = 2\n    k = 1\n    \n    while a1 <= n:\n        k += 1\n        a_next = a0 + a1\n        a0 = a1\n        a1 = a_next\n        \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players in the tournament.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If `n` is 1 (though the problem states `n >= 2`, this handles any edge case), the output is 0 since no games are played.\n3. **Sequence Generation**: The variables `a0` and `a1` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the first two terms of the sequence. The loop continues as long as `a1` (the current term) is less than or equal to `n`.\n4. **Term Calculation**: In each iteration, the next term in the sequence is computed as the sum of the previous two terms. The loop then updates the previous terms to continue the sequence generation.\n5. **Result Determination**: Once the loop exits, the value of `k` is incremented once more (since the loop condition fails when the next term exceeds `n`), and the result is `k - 1`, which represents the maximum number of games the winner can play without exceeding the player count `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
