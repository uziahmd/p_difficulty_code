    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can try a straightforward approach.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can do an O(n^3) solution by checking each substring.\n\n However, we can be smarter: \n We can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the problem says occurrences can overlap. So \"aaa\" has substring \"aa\" appearing multiple times (at indices 0 and 1).\n\n Alternative approach:\n  - We can use a set to record all substrings of a given length, and then check for duplicates. We want the maximum length for which we have at least two occurrences.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n Let n = len(s)\n For length in range(n//2, 0, -1):   # We start from the maximum possible duplicate substring length (which is at most floor((n)/2) because two same substrings of length L would require at least 2*L <= n+? Actually, they can overlap so the condition is just that the substring appears at least twice. But the maximum length we can have is when the entire string is duplicated? Actually, no: the two occurrences must be non-overlapping? Wait, the problem says they can overlap. So the substring can appear anywhere, even overlapping.\n\n Example: \"ababa\": \n   substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2 -> overlapping.\n\n But note: the two occurrences must be distinct as substrings (but they can share some letters). \n\n However, the maximum length of such a substring cannot exceed half the string? Actually, no: because if we have a substring of length L, then we need two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]. The minimal requirement is that the two occurrences don't necessarily need to be non-overlapping. But the maximum L we can have is still limited by the length of the string.\n\n Actually, we can have a substring of length L, and we can have two occurrences that are adjacent or with any gap. The maximum L can be up to n-1? Actually, no: because if we have two occurrences, then the first occurrence starts at index0 and ends at index L-1, and the second occurrence must start at some index >=0 and go to index L-1 + ... but wait, the entire string is of length n.\n\n Actually, the two occurrences can start at positions i and j (with j>=i+1) and then the substring of length L must fit from i to i+L-1 and from j to j+L-1. The condition is that i+L-1 < n and j+L-1 < n.\n\n But note: they can overlap, so we can have two occurrences that start at indices i and j where j <= i+L-1. Then the condition is that j+L-1 < n, so j <= n-L.\n\n Therefore, the maximum L we need to consider is from 1 up to floor(n/2)? Actually, no: consider \"aaa\", n=3. The substring \"aa\" (length 2) appears twice: at index0 and index1. But 2 > 3//2 (which is 1). So we cannot restrict to n//2.\n\n Actually, the maximum length L can be as long as there are two occurrences. The condition is that there exists two indices i and j (with i<j) such that j-i < L and j+L-1 < n. But note: we are not requiring the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. However, the two occurrences must be distinct as substrings (but they can share characters). \n\n But note: the entire string might be composed of repeating a single character, e.g., \"aaaa\". Then the longest substring that appears at least twice is \"aaa\", which has length 3, and n=4. So the maximum L can be up to n-1? Actually, no: because if we take L = n-1, then we have only one substring of length n-1 (the whole string without the last character) and then the next one would be the whole string without the first character, but these two are different unless the string is like \"aaa...a\". \n\n Actually, let's consider: \n   s = \"aaa\", n=3. Then substring of length 2: \"aa\" (from index0 and index1) -> two occurrences. So maximum L=2.\n\n   s = \"aaaa\", n=4. Then substring of length 3: \n        \"aaa\" at index0, and \"aaa\" at index1 -> two occurrences. So maximum L=3.\n\n   So the maximum L can be from 1 to n-1, but we are looking for the maximum L that has at least two occurrences.\n\n However, we can break early: we start from the maximum possible L (which is n-1) and go down until we find one that has at least two occurrences. But wait: the condition for a substring of length L to have two occurrences is that the number of distinct starting positions (from 0 to n-L) is at least 2 and at least two of them yield the same substring.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", so we need two or more.\n\n However, we can use a dictionary for each L? But we are iterating from large L to small, and we break at the first L that has a duplicate.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the string.\n 2. Let n = len(s)\n 3. For L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # because we are going from largest to smallest, so the first L we find is the answer.\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n 4. If we don't find any, then output 0.\n\n However, what if we have a string with no duplicate substring? Then we output 0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\". And the above method checks for any duplicate substring of length L.\n\n But wait: what if the same substring appears more than twice? Then we still break at the first L we find (which is the largest L that has a duplicate).\n\n However, we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) downward. But note: the largest L that has a duplicate might not be the one that appears the most? Actually, we are only concerned with the length of the substring, and we want the longest. So we break at the first L (starting from the top) that has a duplicate.\n\n But is it possible that a longer substring has a duplicate while a shorter one also has? Then we break at the longer one. That's correct.\n\n Example: \n   s = \"abcdeabcde\" (n=10)\n   The longest duplicate substring is \"abcde\" (if it appears twice? Actually, in this example, \"abcde\" appears once (from index0 and then again from index5). So yes, then L=5.\n\n   But what about \"abcd\" (length 4)? It appears twice? Actually, from index0 and index5. But we are checking from L=9 down to 1. We will break at L=5.\n\n However, consider: \n   s = \"abcdeabcde\" \n   The substring \"abcde\" (L=5) appears twice: at index0 and index5.\n   Then we break and output 5.\n\n But what if we have two different substrings of the same maximum length? We break at the first one we find. But we are iterating from large L downward, so we break at the first L we find (which is the maximum L that has a duplicate). \n\n However, there is a catch: the same substring of length L might not be contiguous in the set of starting positions? Actually, our inner loop checks every starting position for the same substring.\n\n But note: we are storing the substring itself. So if we see the same substring again, we break.\n\n But what if two different substrings of the same length L are duplicated? We are breaking at the first duplicate we find (for any substring of length L). And we are going from the largest L downward, so the first duplicate we find is the answer.\n\n However, the above algorithm does not consider that two different substrings of the same length L might both be duplicated, but we are only concerned with the maximum L. We break at the first L (largest) that has at least one duplicate.\n\n But wait: what if we have two different substrings of length L, one of which is duplicated and the other is not? Then we break at the first duplicate we find (which is the first substring of length L that appears twice). However, we are iterating over all starting positions for a fixed L. So we check every substring of length L and store the ones we've seen. When we see a substring that we've seen before, we break.\n\n However, we are storing all the substrings we've seen. But note: we break when we see the same substring again. But what if we have two different substrings of the same length L, each appearing twice? Then we break at the first substring that is duplicated.\n\n But that's okay because we are looking for the maximum L, and we are checking from large L to small. We break at the first L (the largest) for which we found a duplicate.\n\n However, we must note: the same substring might appear more than twice, but we break at the first occurrence of a duplicate.\n\n But the problem asks for the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we don't care which one, we just need the maximum L.\n\n But note: we are iterating from L = n-1 down to 1. We break at the first L that has at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Example: \n   s = \"abababa\"\n\n   We want the answer to be 3? Actually, let's check:\n      The substring \"aba\" appears at indices 0, 2, 4. So it appears at least twice -> so we break at L=3.\n\n   But wait, what about L=4?\n        substrings of length 4: \n          \"abab\", \"baba\", \"abab\", \"baba\", etc. Actually, we have two \"abab\" and two \"baba\". But note: the substring \"abab\" appears twice (at indices0 and indices2) and \"baba\" appears twice (at indices1 and indices3). So we should break at L=4?\n\n   However, wait: \n        s = \"abababa\"\n        L=4: \n            substring at index0: \"abab\"\n            substring at index1: \"baba\"\n            substring at index2: \"abab\" -> duplicate of index0 -> so we break and output 4.\n\n   But is that correct? The problem says \"longest substring that can be met at least twice\". The substring \"abab\" (length4) appears twice. So the answer is 4.\n\n   However, let me check the sample input: \n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n        Expected Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   For \"abcd\": \n        There's no duplicate substring, so output 0.\n\n   For \"ababa\":\n        What are the substrings?\n        length 5: \"ababa\" -> only one occurrence -> skip.\n        length 4: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> each appears once -> skip.\n        length 3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> \"aba\" appears twice -> so output 3.\n\n   For \"zzz\":\n        length 2: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> two occurrences -> output 2.\n\n   So our algorithm for \"ababa\" gives 3, which matches.\n\n   But wait: in \"abababa\", we found 4, but the expected answer according to the problem statement is not provided. However, the problem says the input is a string of lower-case Latin letters and the length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n   The sample test 2 is \"ababa\", which we handled. The problem says \"These occurrences can overlap\", and our method considers overlapping.\n\n   However, note: in \"abababa\", the substring \"abab\" (at index0 and index2) are overlapping? \n        index0: \"abab\" covers indices0 to 3.\n        index2: \"abab\" covers indices2 to 5. They overlap.\n\n   So the answer 4 is correct.\n\n   But wait, let me check with the problem statement: the problem says \"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\" -> outputs 0, 3, 2.\n\n   Our algorithm:\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" (n=4)\n        L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicates -> continue.\n        L=2: \"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\" -> no duplicates -> continue.\n        L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicates -> output 0.\n\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" (n=5)\n        L=4: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicates (each substring is unique) -> continue.\n        L=3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> \"aba\" is repeated -> output 3.\n\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" (n=3)\n        L=2: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n   So the algorithm works for the provided examples.\n\n   However, note: the above algorithm uses a dictionary for each L. Since the maximum n is 100, the maximum L is 99, and the total number of substrings is about n*(n+1)/2, which is 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: we are iterating for each L from 99 down to 1, and for each L we iterate over n-L+1 substrings. The total operations would be:\n\n        Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1) = (n-1)*n/2, which for n=100 is 4950. And for each substring we do a hash lookup (and the substring length is L). The total cost is O(n^3) because comparing strings of length L takes O(L). \n\n   However, the worst-case string might be such that we compare many long substrings. But the maximum L is 99, and the total number of comparisons is about 4950 * (average length) but the average length is about 50, so 4950*50 ~ 250000, which is acceptable.\n\n   But we can optimize by using rolling hash to avoid comparing entire substrings. However, the problem says the string length is at most 100, so worst-case 100, then the total operations would be about 100*100*100 = 1e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   However, let me calculate: \n        For a fixed L, we have (n-L+1) substrings, and each substring comparison is O(L). So the total operations for fixed L is (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        Then the overall is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        For n=100, this is about sum_{L=1}^{99} (100-L)*L = sum_{L=1}^{99} (100L - L^2) = 100 * (99*100/2) - (99*100*199/6) [since sum_{L=1}^{k} L^2 = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6]\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n        Let k = 99.\n        S1 = 100 * (k*(k+1)//2) = 100 * (99*100//2) = 100 * 4950 = 495000\n        S2 = sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2 = 99*100*199//6 = (99*100*199)//6 = 328350\n\n        So total operations = 495000 - 328350 = 166650.\n\n        This is acceptable for n=100.\n\n   But note: we are doing this for each L from 99 down to 1, and we break as soon as we find a duplicate. So in the best case, we break at L=99 (if the first substring of length 99 appears again). Then we only do the work for L=99.\n\n   However, worst-case (no duplicate) we do all L from 1 to 99, so 166650 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a set of tuples (start, end) is not helpful. Or we can use a dictionary for each L, but we are already doing that.\n\n   But note: we are storing the substrings in a dictionary. The memory is acceptable because the total number of keys per L is at most (n-L+1) and we do for each L separately.\n\n   However, we can break early in the inner loop: if we find a duplicate, we break out of the inner loop and then break the outer loop (the L loop) and output L.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is empty, output 0.\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            found = False\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n\n        # If we get here, no duplicate found for any L.\n        print(0)\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example: \"abcd\" -> outputs 0 -> correct.\n   Example: \"ababa\" -> \n        L=4: \n            start0: \"abab\" -> not seen -> seen = {\"abab\":1}\n            start1: \"baba\" -> not seen -> seen = {\"abab\":1, \"baba\":1}\n            start2: \"abab\" -> already in seen -> output 4? \n\n        But wait, the example \"ababa\" expected output is 3.\n\n        Why did we get 4 for \"ababa\"? \n\n        Let me check the substring \"abab\" in \"ababa\":\n            s[0:4] = \"abab\"\n            s[2:6] -> but wait, the string is \"ababa\", so s[2:6] is from index2 to 5 -> \"aba\" (if we do substring of length 4 from index2: \"abab\"[2:6] -> actually, the string is \"ababa\", so from index2 we have \"aba\" (only 3 characters left). \n\n        Correction: the string \"ababa\" has length 5. So for L=4, the valid starts are 0 and 1.\n\n        So the inner loop for L=4 runs for start=0 and start=1.\n\n        Then we don't get a duplicate at L=4.\n\n        Then we go to L=3:\n            start0: \"aba\" -> not seen -> seen={\"aba\":1}\n            start1: \"bab\" -> not seen -> seen={\"aba\":1, \"bab\":1}\n            start2: \"aba\" -> already in seen -> output 3.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        I think I miscalculated the substring for start=2 and L=4: \n            s[2:2+4] = s[2:6] -> but the string has only 5 characters, so from index2 we can only take 3 characters (because 2+4=6 which is beyond the string). \n\n        In Python, slicing beyond the string returns as many as available. But wait, in our code, the inner loop runs for start in range(0, n-L+1). For n=5, L=4: n-L+1 = 5-4+1 = 2, so start goes from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\n        So we don't consider start=2 for L=4. \n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Another example: \"zzz\" (n=3)\n        L=2: \n            start0: \"zz\" -> not seen -> seen={\"zz\":1}\n            start1: \"zz\" -> found duplicate -> output 2.\n\n   Example: \"aaa\" (n=3)\n        L=2: \n            start0: \"aa\" -> not seen -> seen={\"aa\":1}\n            start1: \"aa\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n   Example: \"aaaa\" (n=4)\n        L=3: \n            start0: \"aaa\" -> not seen -> seen={\"aaa\":1}\n            start1: \"aaa\" -> duplicate -> output 3.\n\n   Example: \"abcdeabcde\" (n=10)\n        L=9: \n            start0: \"abcdeabcd\" -> not seen -> seen.add\n            start1: \"bcdeabcde\" -> not seen -> seen.add\n            ... until L=9: no duplicates.\n        Then L=8: similarly no duplicates until we get to L=5: \n            start0: \"abcde\" -> not seen\n            start5: \"abcde\" -> duplicate -> output 5.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: we are using a dictionary for each L. We can optimize by breaking early in the inner loop, and we are.\n\n   But note: we are building a dictionary for each L. The memory is acceptable because the maximum number of distinct substrings of length L is at most (n-L+1) and we do for each L separately, so the memory is O(n^2) in the worst-case (when n=100, the total memory for storing all substrings for one L is 100, and we do 99 L's, so 99*100 = 9900, which is acceptable).\n\n   But we can break early: as soon as we find a duplicate, we break.\n\n   However, we are already breaking.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        # We are going from the largest L (n-1) down to 1.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n        print(0)\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example: \"abcd\" -> output 0.\n   Example: \"ababa\" -> output 3.\n   Example: \"zzz\" -> output 2.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   However, the example input format is shown as a list. But the problem says \"first input line\", meaning one string per test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You're given a string\", so we assume one string.\n\n   How is the input provided? The example input is three separate strings? Actually, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example shows:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is confusing. Let me read the problem again: \n\n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        You're given a string of lower-case Latin letters. Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n        Input\n        The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n        Output\n        Output one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n        Example\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output\n        ['0', '3', '2']\"\n\n   This example input format is ambiguous. But typically, in competitive programming, we have one test case per run.\n\n   However, the example input is shown as a list of three strings. But the problem says \"the first input line contains the string\", meaning one string.\n\n   After re‐reading: the example input is showing three test cases. But the problem says \"Input\" and then the example input is given as a list.\n\n   Clarification: the problem likely means that the input is provided one string per test case. But the example input is showing three different strings.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The first input line contains the string\", we assume one string per input.\n\n   However, the sample test 2 is \"ababa\", so we must be able to handle multiple test cases? Or is the example input meant to be three separate runs?\n\n   The problem says \"Output one number\", so we assume one test case per run.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list. This might be a formatting issue.\n\n   Let me look again: the example input is:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is probably just a way to show the three test cases. In reality, the input is:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one line. \n\n   Actually, the problem says \"The first input line\", so there is one string in the first line. But the example input is given as three lines? Or as a list?\n\n   The example output is:\n\n        ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   So the problem expects three numbers as output? Or three separate runs?\n\n   Since the problem says \"Output one number\", we assume one test case per program run.\n\n   Therefore, we read one string per run.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three strings. This might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   However, the problem statement says: \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\"\n\n   But note: the example input format in many problems is given as a list for convenience. But in standard input, we would get one string per line if there are multiple test cases.\n\n   The problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"The first input line contains the string\".\n\n   So we assume one string.\n\n   But the example input is provided as three strings. This is confusing.\n\n   Let me check the sample test 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3.\n\n   Therefore, if we are running the program and the input is \"ababa\", we output 3.\n\n   So the problem expects one string per run.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three. This is probably just to show the three test cases.\n\n   Conclusion: we write the program to read one string and output one number.\n\n   However, if the problem intended to have multiple test cases, then we would have to read until EOF. But the problem says the first input line contains the string.\n\n   Since the constraints say the string is non-empty and length <=100, we assume one string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of three. Maybe the problem statement is showing three examples. \n\n   Let me assume that the input is one string per execution.\n\n   However, if we are to run the program three times, then:\n\n        First run: input \"abcd\" -> output \"0\"\n        Second run: input \"ababa\" -> output \"3\"\n        Third run: input \"zzz\" -> output \"2\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\" and \"Output: ['0','3','2']\". This suggests that the input is three strings and the output is three numbers. \n\n   This is inconsistent with the problem description.\n\n   To clarify, I will read the problem statement again: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So there is one string.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list. This is likely a formatting issue. The intended meaning is that the input can be one of these three strings, and the output is the corresponding number.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, if the problem intended to have multiple test cases, we would have to read until EOF. But the problem says \"the first input line\", so one string.\n\n   Let me stick to one string.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example input is given as a list. This is ambiguous.\n\n   I will write the code to read one string and output one number.\n\n   If the competition provides multiple test cases, then we must adjust. But the problem says \"the string\", so one string.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   And then process.\n\n   However, if the problem intended to have multiple test cases, then we would read until EOF. But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"The first input line\", we assume one string per run.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three. This might be an error.\n\n   Since the problem says the string is non-empty and length<=100, and we are guaranteed one string, we proceed.\n\n   However, the example output is a list of three numbers. So the problem might be providing three test cases in one input file? \n\n   Let me read the problem again: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) and then the example input is given as a list of three.\n\n   Another possibility: the problem statement is showing the example inputs and outputs for three different cases, but the actual input is one string.\n\n   We'll write the code for one string.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output one number\", so one test case.\n\n   So final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = {}\n                found = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        print(L)\n                        exit(0)\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n            print(0)\n\n   However, we can break out of the loops and then print 0.\n\n   But note: we are using `exit(0)` which terminates the program. This is acceptable for a script.\n\n   But in a programming competition, sometimes they run multiple test cases, but the problem says one string.\n\n   We'll assume one string.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0.\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3.\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2.\n\n   All correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list, but we are reading one string. So if the input is provided as three separate lines, then we must read three times? \n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one line. \n\n   But wait: the example input format is:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is one line? Or three lines? \n\n   Actually, the problem says \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\" which is one line of text: a string that looks like a list.\n\n   But then the program would read that entire line as the string. Then the string is \"['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\", which is not one of the examples.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   I think the problem statement intended to show three separate examples, but the input format is one string per test.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", we assume the input is one string.\n\n   Therefore, we leave the code as is.\n\n   However, if the competition provides multiple test cases (each in one line), then we would have to read until EOF. But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The first input line\", we assume one test case.\n\n   We'll submit the code as below.\n\n   One more edge: empty string. The problem says non-empty, but our code handles empty string by printing 0.\n\n   But the problem guarantees non-empty, so we don't need to worry.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty\", so we can remove the n==0 check.\n\n   But the input is non-empty, so we can assume n>=1.\n\n   But the code above: if n==0, we print 0 and exit. Since the string is non-empty, we can remove that.\n\n   Revised code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # Since the string is non-empty, n>=1.\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n        print(0)\n\n   But wait, what if the string has length 1? Then n=1, and the range is from 0 to 0 (exclusive) so the for loop for L doesn't run. Then we print 0. Correct because a string of length 1 cannot have a duplicate substring (since two occurrences would require at least two characters).\n\n   Example: \"a\" -> output 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Now, we are ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but the example input includes \"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\", which are non-empty.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   But wait: the example output is given as a list of strings: ['0','3','2'].\n\n   Our program outputs integers. The problem says \"Output one number\", so integer is fine. But the example output is given as strings in a list.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Output one number\", so we output the integer.\n\n   But the example output is written as:\n\n        ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This is just showing the expected outputs as a list of strings for the three test cases.\n\n   Our program outputs:\n\n        For \"abcd\": 0\n        For \"ababa\": 3\n        For \"zzz\": 2\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is one string. So we output one number.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input is one string, but the example input is given as a list. This is just for illustration.\n\n   We'll run the code as is.\n\n   However, if the input is provided as a multi-line input with multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF. But the problem says \"The first input line\", so one string.\n\n   We assume one string.\n\n   Final code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means they can share some characters. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string from the longest to the shortest and determining if any of them appear more than once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest substring that occurs at least twice in the input string. The key observation here is that longer substrings are more likely to be unique, so we start checking from the longest possible substring and move downwards until we find a duplicate.\n2. **Intuition**: By checking longer substrings first, we can efficiently determine the solution without exhaustive checks for all possible substring lengths. For each length, we examine all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return its length.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length. If a substring is found more than once, the algorithm outputs the length and exits. If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, it outputs 0.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (iterating over lengths and then over starting positions, with each substring comparison taking O(L) time). However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen[substr] = 1\n            \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty, the output is 0 since no duplicates can exist.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the longest possible substring (length `n-1`) down to 1. For each length `L`, it checks all substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Seen Substrings**: A dictionary is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found more than once, its length `L` is printed, and the program exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, the program outputs 0, indicating no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
