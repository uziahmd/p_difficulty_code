Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row, the middle element is 's' but the diagonal requires 'x'. Also, the non-diagonal elements should be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\n Steps:\n  Let's denote:\n    Let the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) be: [ (i,i) for i in range(n) ]\n    The anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) be: [ (i, n-1-i) for i in range(n) ]\n\n  Conditions to check:\n  Condition 1: All characters on the main diagonal must be the same, say char1.\n  Condition 2: All characters on the anti-diagonal must be the same, and also that same character must be char1.\n\n  Condition 3: For all the other cells (not on either diagonal), they must be the same letter, say char2, and char2 != char1.\n\n  However, note that the example input 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n  This should output \"YES\".\n\n  Let's break down example 2:\n    Main diagonal: [ (0,0)='w', (1,1)='s', (2,2)='w'] -> wait, not the same! But wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n  Actually, let me read the problem again: \n      \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n  In example 2, the main diagonal has 'w','s','w' -> which are not the same. So why is the answer YES?\n\n  Wait, let me check the example input again:\n\n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      The diagonals are:\n          Main diagonal: first row first char, second row second char, third row third char: 'w', 's', 'w'\n          Anti-diagonal: first row last char, second row second char (wait, no: for a 3x3, anti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0): 'w','s','w'\n\n      But the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". \n\n      However, note: the problem does not require the two diagonals to have the same letter as each other? It says:\n        - Both diagonals: all letters are the same (so the entire main diagonal is one letter, and the entire anti-diagonal is one letter, but these two letters can be different? Let me check the problem statement.)\n\n      But wait, the example output is \"YES\", so let me re-read:\n\n      \"Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:\n        on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;\n        all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n      There's no requirement that the two diagonals have the same letter. But wait, what if they do not? Then we cannot form an X because the two diagonals would have two different letters, and the rest the same as each other but different from both?\n\n      However, looking at the example: \n        The main diagonal has 'w','s','w' -> not all same! So according to condition 1, it fails.\n\n      But wait, the example input provided in the example is:\n\n          ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n      and the expected outputs are:\n\n          ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n      This implies that the example with 3 lines is \"YES\".\n\n      Let me clarify: In the 3x3 example, the main diagonal is 'w','s','w' -> not all same. So why is the answer YES?\n\n      I think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says \"on both diagonals\" meaning each diagonal individually must have the same letter? But in the example, the main diagonal doesn't have the same letter.\n\n      Alternatively, perhaps the example is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: The main diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. We first verify that all characters on each diagonal are identical.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Characters**: All characters not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the grid is square (n x n) and that n is odd, as specified in the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag_char1 = None\n    diag_char2 = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        char1 = grid[i][i]\n        char2 = grid[i][n-1-i]\n        \n        if diag_char1 is None:\n            diag_char1 = char1\n            diag_char2 = char2\n        else:\n            if char1 != diag_char1:\n                diag_char1 = None\n                break\n            if char2 != diag_char2:\n                diag_char2 = None\n                break\n    \n    if diag_char1 is None or diag_char2 is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    non_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_char is None:\n                non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                    non_diag_char = None\n                    break\n        if non_diag_char is None:\n            break\n    \n    if non_diag_char is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    if non_diag_char == diag_char1 or non_diag_char == diag_char2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks all characters on both the main and anti-diagonals. If any character on these diagonals differs from the first encountered character on each diagonal, it sets `diag_char1` or `diag_char2` to `None` and prints \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code then checks all characters not on the diagonals. If any such character differs from the first encountered non-diagonal character, it sets `non_diag_char` to `None` and prints \"NO\".\n4. **Final Check**: If the non-diagonal character matches any diagonal character, it prints \"NO\". Otherwise, it prints \"YES\", confirming the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid meets the criteria for forming an \"X\".",
