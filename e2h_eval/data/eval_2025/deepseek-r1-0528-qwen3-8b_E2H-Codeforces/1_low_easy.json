The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1). The number of cells in the border (ring) of an a x b rectangle is:\n   If a <= 0 or b <= 0, then 0.\n   Otherwise, if a==1 and b==1, then 1 (but note our rings start from the outer edge and we have at least 3x3 so the first ring will be for 3x3).\n   Actually, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (with one cell wide border) is: \n        cells = 2 * (a + b)   [if we consider that each side is contiguous] but wait, let's break down:\n\n Actually, the border of a rectangle of size a x b (each cell being 1x1) consists of:\n   top row: a cells\n   bottom row: a cells\n   left and right columns: each has (b-2) cells because the top and bottom are already counted.\n\n So total = a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But note: if the rectangle has only one row (a=1) then the top and bottom rows are the same, so we would have:\n   top row: a=1, then bottom row is also a=1, and the sides: (b-2) for left and (b-2) for right -> total = 1+1+(b-2)+(b-2) = 2*b - 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the standard formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (which counts each side without the corners being duplicated) but here we are counting every cell.\n\n Actually, the standard way: \n   Top: a cells\n   Bottom: a cells\n   Left: (b-2) cells (because the top and bottom are already accounted for in the top and bottom rows)\n   Right: (b-2) cells\n\n Therefore, total = 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, what if a==1? Then the left and right columns are actually the entire sides (without the top and bottom because there's only one row). But note: when a=1, the top and bottom rows are the same row. Then we cannot subtract the corners twice? \n\n Let me check with a=1, b=3: \n   Rectangle: 1x3\n   Top row: 1 cell\n   Bottom row: 1 cell (same as top)\n   Then the sides: left column has 3-2 = 1 cell, but wait, the top and bottom of the left column are already included in the top row and bottom row. However, in the left column we have the middle cell (the one below the top) which is not in the top row. Similarly for the right.\n\n So the total should be: top row (1) + bottom row (1) + left column (from row 2 to row 2: only the middle one) and right column (only the middle one). \n   That gives 1+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n Using the formula: 2*1 + 2*3 - 4 = 2 + 6 - 4 = 4. Correct.\n\n Now, what if a=2, b=2?\n   Then: 2*2 + 2*2 - 4 = 4+4-4 = 4. \n   The rectangle is 2x2, so the border is the entire 2x2, which has 4 cells. Correct.\n\n But wait, the problem states that the rings are drawn starting from the edge. The first ring is for the entire 3x3 plate? Actually, no: the first ring is for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(0)) = w x h. Then we take the border of that. However, the example input \"3 3 1\" gives output 8.\n\n Let's compute for w=3, h=3, k=1:\n   Dimensions of the inner rectangle for the first ring: 3x3.\n   The border of 3x3: \n        Top: 3\n        Bottom: 3\n        Left: 3-2 =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, starting from the outer edge of the plate. The solution involves determining the dimensions of each ring and computing the number of cells in its border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w x h` cells. The first ring is the border of the entire plate. Each subsequent ring is the border of a rectangle that is 2 cells smaller in both dimensions compared to the previous one (since each ring moves 2 cells inward). The number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size `a x b` is given by the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`, which accounts for the top and bottom rows (each of `a` cells) and the left and right columns (each of `b-2` cells, excluding the corners already counted).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring `i`, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. We then compute the number of cells in the border of this rectangle using the formula mentioned above. If either dimension becomes zero or negative, the ring does not contribute any cells.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`. For each ring, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If both dimensions are positive, calculate the number of cells in its border; otherwise, skip the ring. Sum the cells for all valid rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    w = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        if a == 1 and b == 1:\n            total_cells += 1\n        else:\n            total_cells += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n            \n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to accumulate the sum of cells in all valid rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - Compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle as `a = w - 4*(i-1)` and `b = h - 4*(i-1)`.\n   - If either dimension is non-positive, break the loop as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n   - For valid dimensions, calculate the border cells using `2*a + 2*b - 4` unless the rectangle is 1x1, in which case the cell count is 1.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of cells computed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
