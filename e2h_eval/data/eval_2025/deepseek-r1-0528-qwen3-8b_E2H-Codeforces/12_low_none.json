The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can traverse clockwise.\n\n The key observation: \n   We start at house 1. Then we have to complete tasks in the given order (each task i requires being at house a_i, and all previous tasks must be done).\n\n However, note that we can revisit houses and the ring is circular. The movement is one way (clockwise only) so we cannot go backwards without going through all the intermediate houses and then wrapping around.\n\n But note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the ringroad is circular.\n\n We can break the journey into segments:\n\n   Let the current position be `cur` (initially 1). Then for each task location `a` (in the given order):\n\n     Option 1: Move clockwise from `cur` to `a`. But if `a` is less than `cur`, then we have to go through the entire circle? Actually, because it's a ring, the clockwise distance from `cur` to `a` is:\n        If a >= cur: distance = a - cur\n        If a < cur: distance = (n - cur + 1) + (a)   [because we go from cur to n, then wrap to 1 and then to a]?\n        Alternatively, we can compute the clockwise distance from x to y as:\n            dist(x, y) = (y - x) % n, but if negative then add n and then mod? Actually, we can do:\n\n        Since the ring has n houses, the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            if d < 0: d += n   -> then d becomes positive, but note: we don't want to use modulus that way because we want the actual steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n            If y >= x: d = y - x\n            Else: d = n - x + y\n\n        But wait: from house 3 (n=4) to house 2: \n            Using the above: 2 < 3 -> d = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3, which is correct: 3->4->1->2 (3 steps)\n\n        However, note that the problem does not require to return to start, so we can also think of the total path as:\n\n        We start at 1. Then we have a sequence of tasks.\n\n        Example 1: Input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output 6.\n\n        Steps: \n          Start at 1.\n          Task1: go from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1->2->3). Time=2.\n          Then from 3 to 2: since 2<3, we go 3->4->1->2 (3 steps). Time becomes 2+3=5.\n          Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step). Time=6.\n\n        So we need to accumulate the distances between consecutive tasks.\n\n        However, note: the problem condition is that the i-th task must be completed and all previous ones. So we are forced to complete the tasks in the given order.\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n          total_time = 0\n          current = 1\n\n          For each task_location in the list of tasks:\n             if task_location >= current:\n                 distance = task_location - current\n             else:\n                 distance = n - current + task_location\n\n             total_time += distance\n             current = task_location\n\n        But wait, let's check with the example:\n\n          Start at 1.\n          First task: 3 -> 3>=1 -> distance=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n          Second task: 2 -> 2<3 -> distance=4-3+2=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n          Third task: 3 -> 3>=2 -> distance=1, total_time=6.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, consider the second example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n          Start at 1.\n          First task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> distance=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n          Second task: 3 -> 3>=2 -> distance=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n          Third task: 3 -> same, distance=0, total_time=2.\n\n        This gives output 2, which matches.\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple consecutive same tasks? It doesn't matter because the distance from a house to itself is 0",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad of houses. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house number 1 and must complete tasks in a specified order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. The challenge is to calculate the minimal time taken to move from her current position to the next task's location, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal path involves moving clockwise from the current house to the next task's house. If the next task's house is ahead (higher number) than the current house, the distance is simply the difference. If it's behind (lower number), the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ringroad and then from the start to the target house.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's location, add this distance to the total time, and update the current position to the task's location. This approach efficiently accumulates the total time by leveraging simple arithmetic based on the positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            distance = a - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + a\n        \n        total_time += distance\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by a list of `m` integers representing the task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` keeps track of the cumulative time taken, starting from 0. `current` is initialized to 1, Xenia's starting position.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is the difference between them.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, the distance is computed as `(n - current + a)`, accounting for the circular path.\n4. **Updating Position**: After each task, `current` is updated to the task's location, and the computed distance is added to `total_time`.\n5. **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and straightforward distance calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
