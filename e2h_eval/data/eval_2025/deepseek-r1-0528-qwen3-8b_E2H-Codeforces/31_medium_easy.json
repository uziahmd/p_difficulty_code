Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We want the minimum number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   Since we can choose any integer in [-x, x], one card can add at most x (if we choose x) or at least -x (if we choose -x).\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to: what is the minimum number k such that we can represent -S as the sum of k numbers each in the range [-x, x]?\n\n 5. But note: we are allowed to use any integers, so the set of achievable sums with k cards is all integers T such that:\n      k_min * (-x) <= T <= k_min * x   (but actually, we can achieve every integer T in the interval [k_min_lower, k_min_upper] but wait, no)\n\n   Actually, with k cards, the minimum sum we can get is -k*x and the maximum is k*x. However, we can also get every integer in between? \n   Not necessarily: for example, with k=2 and x=2, can we get all integers between -4 and 4? \n        Yes: \n          -4: (-2,-2)\n          -3: (-2,-1) or (-1,-2)\n          -2: (-2,0) or (-1,-1) etc.\n        Actually, because we have consecutive integers, the set of achievable sums is contiguous from -k*x to k*x.\n\n   Why? Because we can adjust by 1 by changing one card by 1 (if we have a card that is not at the extreme). \n\n   However, note: we start with the base of having zeros? Actually, we can use any integer in the range. So the set of achievable sums with k cards is all integers between -k*x and k*x.\n\n 6. So we need the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that there exists an integer T = -S satisfying:\n        -k*x <= T <= k*x\n\n   But note: T is fixed as -S. So we require:\n        -k*x <= -S <= k*x\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n        | -S | <= k*x   =>   |S| <= k*x\n\n   However, wait: is that sufficient? Because we can represent any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. So if |S| <= k*x, then -S is in the interval.\n\n 7. Therefore, we need the smallest k such that k*x >= |S|.\n\n   Then, k_min = ceil(|S| / x) if we were only considering the absolute value? But note: k must be an integer.\n\n   However, consider: if |S| is exactly divisible by x, then k_min = |S| // x.\n   But what if |S| is not divisible by x?\n\n   Example: |S| = 5, x=2 -> then k_min = ceil(5/2) = ceil(2.5) = 3.\n\n   But wait, is 3 enough? 3*2 = 6 >= 5 -> yes.\n\n   So k_min = ceil(|S| / x) ?\n\n 8. However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, cards = [-1, 1, 2] -> sum = 2.\n        Then |S| = 2, so k_min = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> output 1. Matches.\n\n Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards = [-2, -2] -> sum = -4, |S|=4.\n        Then k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333...) = 2 -> output 2. Matches.\n\n 9. But wait: is it always true that the minimal k is ceil(|S|/x)? \n\n   Consider: we can also use negative cards. However, note that we are representing -S, which is the same as having to cover the deficit of |S| (if S is positive, then we need negative cards; if negative, positive). \n\n   However, note: the condition is that the sum of the added cards must be -S. The absolute value of the required sum is |S|. And we can use up to k*x (in absolute value) per k cards.\n\n   So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |S|, which is indeed ceil(|S| / x).\n\n 10. However, there is a catch: what if the current set already has sum 0? Then |S|=0, then k_min=ceil(0/x)=0.\n\n 11. But wait, what if we have negative and positive cards and the sum is not zero, but we can get a sum of zero by using fewer than ceil(|S|/x) cards if we use both positive and negative? \n\n   Let me reexamine: the condition is that the total sum of the additional cards must be -S. The minimal k is determined by the fact that each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). \n\n   However, note that we are allowed to use any combination. The minimal k is the smallest k for which the total absolute contribution (in terms of magnitude) can cover |S|. \n\n   Actually, the minimal k is the smallest k such that the maximum absolute value we can achieve with k cards (which is k*x) is at least |S|.\n\n   But note: we don't need to have k*x >= |S| necessarily? Actually, we require that the entire deficit (or surplus) is covered. \n\n   However, consider: if we have a deficit of D (so S is negative, then we need to add D positive, or equivalently, we need to cover a positive deficit of |S|), then we can use at most k*x from positive cards (if we are covering a positive deficit). But we can also use negative cards to cover a negative deficit? Actually, the requirement is the total added must be -S. \n\n   Example: S=-4 (deficit of 4, i.e., we need to add 4). Then we can use two cards: two 2s (since 2+2=4). But note: the cards can be positive or negative. In this case, we are adding positive cards. Alternatively, if S=4, we need to add negative cards. \n\n   The key is: the absolute value of the total added must be at least |S|? Actually, no: the total added must be exactly -S, so the absolute value of the total added is |S|. \n\n   Now, how do we form a total of |S| (in absolute value) with k cards? The maximum absolute value we can get from k cards is k*x, but note: we are free to choose signs. \n\n   The condition is: we must have at least one representation of the number -S (which has absolute value |S|) as the sum of k integers each in [-x, x]. \n\n   The necessary and sufficient condition is that |S| <= k*x. Why?\n\n     - The maximum absolute value we can get is k*x, so if |S| > k*x, we cannot represent it.\n\n     - Conversely, if |S| <= k*x, then we can represent it. How?\n          We can use a greedy strategy: \n          Let d = |S|.\n          We can use as many x's as possible, and then adjust with one card.\n\n          Specifically, we can use floor(d/x) cards of x (if d is positive) and then one card of (d mod x) if d mod x !=0, but wait: we are allowed to use negative too, but note: we are only concerned with the absolute value.\n\n          However, note: we are forming the exact value -S. But since we can use negative cards as well, we can break the absolute value into two parts? \n\n          Actually, the problem is symmetric. We can use:\n\n          Option 1: Use all positive cards (if S is negative, then we need positive cards to add to get 0) OR all negative cards (if S is positive). But sometimes we might mix to get a better representation? \n\n          However, the condition for the existence of a representation of T (with |T|<=k*x) is that k>= ceil(|T|/x). \n\n          Why is that? Because even if we use the largest steps (in absolute value) we can only cover up to k*x. And we can achieve every integer in between? \n\n          Actually, we can achieve every integer T such that |T| <= k*x? \n\n          Counterexample: k=1, x=2, then we can only achieve T in {-2,-1,0,1,2}. So yes, we can achieve every integer from -2 to 2.\n\n          For k=2, x=2: we can achieve from -4 to 4. And indeed, we can get every integer in between: \n            -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n          Why? Because with two cards, we can adjust by 1: \n            To get -3: (-2, -1) -> -3, and then to get -2: (-2,0) or (-1,-1). Similarly for positive.\n\n          So the condition is: k_min = ceil(|S| / x) \n\n 12. However, wait: what if we have a fractional part? \n\n      Example: |S|=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then 2*2=4>=3 -> yes.\n\n      But can we represent 3 with two cards of maximum 2? \n          The maximum positive we can get is 4 (if we take two 2's). But 3 is less than 4, so we can do: 2+1. But wait, 1 is allowed (since 1<=2). \n\n      However, note that the card can be any integer from -x to x. So 1 is allowed. But wait, the set of available numbers is all integers from -x to x. So yes, we have 1.\n\n      But note: the example above: we need to represent 3 (because S=-3, then we need to add 3). We can use two cards: [2,1] or [1,2] or [3] is not allowed because 3>2 (x=2). But wait, the card must be in [-2,2]. So 3 is not allowed. \n\n      However, we are allowed to use two cards. The two cards can be 2 and 1, so 2+1=3. So that works.\n\n      What about |S|=3, x=1? Then we need ceil(3/1)=3. Then we can use three 1's.\n\n 13. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Let s = sum(found_cards)\n        Let abs_s = abs(s)\n        Then, if abs_s == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = ceil(abs_s / x)\n            print(k)\n\n 14. But wait: is that always the minimal k? \n\n      Example: |S|=0 -> k=0, correct.\n\n      Example: |S|=1, x=2 -> ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example: |S|=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example: |S|=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n 15. However, let me test with the provided examples again.\n\n      Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, abs_s=2 -> k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n      Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, abs_s=4 -> k=ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.333)=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n 16. But wait: what if the current sum is very large? \n\n      Example: n=1000, x=1, and the found cards are all 1 -> then s=1000, abs_s=1000, k=ceil(1000/1)=1000.\n\n      However, can we really represent 1000 with 1000 cards? Each card can be at most 1, so we need 1000 ones. That matches.\n\n      Example: n=1000, x=1, found cards are [1]*500 + [-1]*500 -> s=0, then k=0.\n\n 17. However, note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So if x=1, then the available numbers are {-1,0,1}. \n\n      But wait, the problem states: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x.\"\n\n      So our reasoning holds.\n\n 18. But wait: is it possible that sometimes we can use fewer than ceil(|S|/x) cards? \n\n      Let me think: no, because with k-1 cards, the maximum absolute value we can get is (k-1)*x. We require (k-1)*x < |S|, so we cannot represent |S| with k-1 cards. Hence, k is minimal.\n\n 19. However, wait: what if we can use negative and positive together to cancel out? \n\n      Example: Suppose we have a deficit of 5 (so S=-5) and x=3. Then |S|=5, so k_min=ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.666)=2.\n\n      With two cards, can we get 5? \n          Maximum positive we can get is 3+3=6, so 5 is within [min_sum, max_sum] = [-6,6]. But can we form 5?\n          We can use two cards: 3 and 2. But wait, 2 is allowed (because |2|<=3). So 3+2=5. So yes.\n\n      However, note: the deficit is 5, so we need to add 5. We can do that with two cards: 3 and 2.\n\n      Now, what if x=2? Then |S|=5, ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. \n          With 3 cards, maximum positive is 3*2=6, so we can form 5: 2+2+1=5.\n\n      But can we form 5 with 2 cards when x=2? \n          The maximum positive with two cards is 4 (2+2). So 5 is greater than 4 -> cannot.\n\n      So the formula still holds.\n\n 20. However, note that the above reasoning is based on the absolute value. But what if we can use negative cards to help? \n\n      Actually, we are trying to achieve a specific value: -S.\n\n      Example: S = -5 (so we need to add 5). We are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. So we can use positive and negative arbitrarily. \n\n      But note: we are free to choose the sign of the cards. However, to get a positive total, we would use positive cards. Similarly, for negative.\n\n      However, consider if we have a deficit (negative S) and we try to use a mix of positive and negative? \n\n      Example: S = -5, x=3. We are allowed to use negative cards too, but why would we use negative cards when we need to add 5? \n\n      Actually, the total must be 5. Using negative cards would reduce the total. So we wouldn't use negative cards if we need to increase the sum.\n\n      Similarly, if S=5 (positive), then we need to add -5, so we would use negative cards.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal k is still determined by the absolute value.\n\n 21. However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? Then we need to add positive. Similarly, if the deficit is positive, we need to add negative. \n\n      But note: the deficit is -S. \n\n        If S is negative, then deficit = -S (positive) -> we need to add positive.\n        If S is positive, then deficit = -S (negative) -> we need to add negative.\n\n      In either case, we are trying to cover an absolute deficit of |S|.\n\n 22. Therefore, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that k*x >= |S|, i.e., k = ceil(|S|/x).\n\n 23. Implementation:\n\n        Read n and x.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n\n        s = sum(list)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n\n        If abs_s == 0:\n            print(0)\n        Else:\n            # k = ceil(|S|/x)\n            # How to compute ceil(a/b) for positive a and b?\n            #   ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   if we are dealing with integers.\n\n            # But note: |S| and x are integers.\n\n            # Example: |S|=5, x=2 -> (5+2-1)//2 = (6)//2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n            # However, if |S| is divisible by x, then (|S| + x - 1) // x = (|S|//x) + (x-1)//x? \n            #   Let |S|=4, x=2: (4+2-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n            # But note: if |S|=0, then we skip.\n\n            k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x   # This is integer ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n            However, wait: what if abs_s is 0? We have handled that separately.\n\n            But note: we must consider that if abs_s is 0, then we don't use this formula.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if abs_s % x == 0:\n                k = abs_s // x\n            else:\n                k = abs_s // x + 1\n\n            But the expression (abs_s + x - 1) // x is standard for ceiling division.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say that n and x are at least 1 and at most 1000, and the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value.\n\n 24. But wait: is it always that simple? \n\n      Consider: what if the current set of cards already has a non-zero sum, and we are allowed to use any integers (including zeros) to adjust? \n\n      Example: current sum = 0 -> k=0.\n\n      Example: current sum = 1, x=1 -> k=ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example: current sum = 1, x=2 -> k=ceil(1/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example: current sum = 2, x=2 -> k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example: current sum = 3, x=2 -> k=ceil(3/2)=2 -> correct.\n\n 25. However, wait: what if we can use a single card that is exactly -S? \n\n      Then k=1. But note: the condition for k=1 is that |S|<=x. \n\n      So if |S|<=x, then k=ceil(|S|/x) will be 1 (if |S|>0 and <=x). \n\n      But if |S| is 0, then k=0.\n\n      Example: S=0 -> k=0.\n\n      Example: S=1, x=1 -> k=ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example: S=1, x=2 -> k=ceil(1/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n 26. Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n\n        if abs_s == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Ceiling division: (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n            # But wait: what if (abs_s + x - 1) // x gives the same as ceil(|S|/x) for positive integers?\n            # Let's test with |S|=3, x=2: (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n            print(k)\n\n 27. However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? Our reasoning was based on the absolute value, so we use abs_s.\n\n 28. But wait: the above formula does not account for the possibility of using negative and positive cards to cancel out a larger deficit? \n\n      Actually, note: the deficit is fixed: we need to change the sum from S to 0, so we need to add a total of -S. The absolute value is |S|, and we can use any integers in [-x, x]. \n\n      The minimal number of cards is independent of the sign because we can use positive or negative as needed.\n\n 29. However, wait: the above solution does not consider that we might be able to use more than one card to cancel out the deficit without necessarily covering the entire deficit with one sign? \n\n      Example: current sum = 3, x=2. We need to add a total of -3.\n\n        With one card: the card must be -3, but -3 is not in [-2,2] -> invalid.\n        With two cards: we can use two cards: for example, -2 and -1 (which is allowed because | -2 |<=2 and | -1 |<=2) -> total -3. So k=2.\n\n        Our formula: ceil(|3|/2)=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n      Example: current sum = 4, x=3. \n        |S|=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n        Can we represent -4 with two cards? The maximum absolute value we can get with two cards is 6, and we need -4. \n        We can use two cards: -3 and -1 -> -4. Or -2 and -2 -> -4. So yes.\n\n      Example: current sum = 5, x=3. \n        ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2.\n        Can we represent -5 with two cards? Maximum absolute value is 6, but can we get 5? \n            We need two cards that sum to -5. The minimum we can get is -6. \n            -3 and -2: -5. So yes.\n\n 30. But wait: is there a case where the minimal k is not ceil(|S|/x)? \n\n      Let me consider: |S|=0 -> k=0 (correct).\n\n      Another: |S|=x -> then k=ceil(x/x)=ceil(1)=1 (correct).\n\n      |S|=x+1 -> then k=ceil((x+1)/x)=ceil(1+1/x)=2 (correct).\n\n 31. However, wait: what if the deficit is zero? Then k=0.\n\n 32. Therefore, the code should work.\n\n 33. But wait: the problem statement says \"minimum number of cards\" and our reasoning is that the minimal k is ceil(|S|/x). \n\n 34. However, let's compare with the sample: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> sum=-4, |S|=4 -> k=ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n 35. But wait: what if we consider the possibility of using more than one card to cover the deficit by having a net effect of -4? \n\n      We did: two cards: two 2's (each 2 is allowed because |2|<=3) -> 2+2=4, so we add two cards of 2 to the existing two cards: total sum becomes -4+4=0. \n\n      But note: the existing cards are [-2,-2] and we add two cards [2,2]. \n\n 36. But wait: the problem does not require to use the minimal k in terms of the number of cards, and we are only allowed to use cards from -x to x. \n\n 37. There is one more consideration: what if the current set already has a sum that is zero? Then we don't need any card.\n\n 38. However, wait: what if the current set has a sum that is not zero, but we can use a combination of positive and negative cards to cancel out the entire set without necessarily covering the entire deficit? \n\n      Example: current sum = 3, x=2. We need to add -3. We cannot do that with one card (because we don't have a card -3). But with two cards: we can use -2 and -1. \n\n      But note: the total deficit is 3. However, the two cards we add are negative, so they subtract 2 and 1, totaling 3.\n\n      The absolute value of the deficit is 3, and we are covering 3 by two cards.\n\n      The minimal k is 2.\n\n 39. Therefore, the answer is: k = ceil(|S|/x)\n\n 40. However, wait: what if we have a deficit that is negative? \n\n      Example: current sum = -3, x=2. Then we need to add 3. \n          One card: maximum positive is 2 -> not enough.\n          Two cards: maximum positive is 4 -> 3 is within [0,4]. We can use two cards: 2 and 1 -> 3. So k=2.\n\n      Same formula.\n\n 41. Therefore, we can write:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n\n        if abs_s == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Ceiling division for positive integers\n            # k = ceil(|S| / x)\n            # Since |S| and x are positive, we can use:\n            k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n 42. But wait: what if |S| is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x -> which is 0 if x>=1, because (x-1)//x = 0 for x>=1. \n\n        Example: x=1 -> (0+1-1)//1 = 0//1=0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: x=1000 -> (0+1000-1)//1000 = 999//1000=0 -> correct.\n\n        So actually, we don't need the if statement: \n\n            k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n\n        will be 0 when abs_s=0.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            s = sum(arr)\n            abs_s = abs(s)\n\n            k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n 43. However, wait: what if x is 0? The problem states x>=1, so we are safe.\n\n 44. But wait: let's test with a small example: \n        n=1, x=1, cards=[1] -> s=1, abs_s=1 -> k=(1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n\n        n=1, x=1, cards=[0] -> s=0, k=0.\n\n 45. However, wait: the problem says the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. \n\n 46. Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n 47. But wait: the example input format: the first line is two integers separated by space, and the second line is n integers.\n\n 48. However, the example input is given as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n 49. Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n            n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s= (-1+1+2)=2, abs_s=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n\n            n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, abs_s=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n 50. However, wait: consider the following:\n\n        Example: n=1, x=1000, arr=[0] -> s=0, k=0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, x=1000, arr=[500] -> s=500, k=(500+1000-1)//1000 = 1499//1000=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, x=1000, arr=[1000] -> s=1000, k=(1000+1000-1)//1000=1999//1000=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, x=1000, arr=[1001] -> wait, but the problem says the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value, so we won't get 1001.\n\n 51. Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n 52. But wait: what if the deficit is not an integer? It is because s is an integer (sum of integers) and x is integer, so abs_s is integer.\n\n 53. We are good.\n\n However, wait: I just thought of an alternative scenario.\n\n  Alternate Approach:\n\n      We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. The goal is to cover a deficit of D (where D = -s) with the fewest cards.\n\n      The minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak in [-x, x] such that a1+a2+...+ak = D.\n\n      We know that the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x. So we require k*x >= |D|.\n\n      However, we must also be able to form the exact value D. \n\n      Since we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] (because we can use consecutive integers from -x to x, and the step is 1), the condition is that |D| <= k*x.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |D|, which is ceil(|D|/x) (since D=-s, |D|=|s|).\n\n 54. Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the initial set has infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range.\n\n 55. But note: the problem does not require the cards to be distinct. So we can use the same number multiple times.\n\n 56. Therefore, the minimal number of cards is indeed ceil(|s|/x).\n\n Let me run through one more example: \n\n      s = 5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> correct.\n\n      s = 6, x=3 -> ceil(6/3)=ceil(2)=2 -> correct.\n\n      s = 7, x=3 -> ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3 -> correct.\n\n 57. But wait: can we represent 7 with three cards of maximum 3? \n        Maximum is 3+3+3=9, so 7 is within [0,9]. \n        We can use: 3, 3, 1 -> 3+3+1=7. But wait, 1 is allowed (|1|<=3). So yes.\n\n 58. However, note: the deficit is 7, so we need to add 7 (if s=-7) or subtract 7 (if s=7). \n\n      If s=-7, then we need to add 7. We can use three cards: 3,3,1.\n\n      If s=7, then we need to add -7. We can use three cards: -3,-3,-1.\n\n 59. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n 60. However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card. Our formula: ceil(0/x)=0, which is correct.\n\n 61. Submit the code.\n\n But wait: the problem says the first line contains two integers: n and x. The second line contains n integers.\n\n 62. Code:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      abs_s = abs(s)\n      k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n      print(k)\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative way to compute ceiling division for positive integers: \n\n      k = (abs_s - 1) // x + 1   if abs_s > 0, but if abs_s==0 then k=0.\n\n      But note: (abs_s-1)//x + 1 for abs_s=0: (0-1)//x +1 = (-1)//x +1. In Python, (-1)//x is -1 (for x>=1), so -1+1=0 -> correct.\n\n      However, the expression (abs_s + x - 1) // x is standard and works for positive integers.\n\n 63. But wait: what if abs_s is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0. So we can use the same formula for all cases.\n\n 64. Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      abs_s = abs(s)\n      k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n      print(k)\n\n 65. However, wait: what if the deficit is negative? We are taking absolute value, so that is handled.\n\n 66. But wait: consider the following example from the problem: \n        Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n 67. We have tested these.\n\n 68. However, wait: what if the deficit is very large? \n\n      Example: n=1000, x=1, and the found cards are all 1 -> s=1000, then k=ceil(1000/1)=1000.\n\n 69. But wait: the problem says the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. So if x=1, then the maximum absolute value is 1, and the minimum is -1.\n\n 70. This matches.\n\n 71. Therefore, we are confident.\n\n 72. However, wait: what if the deficit is negative and the absolute value is very large? \n\n      Example: n=1000, x=1, cards=[-1]*1000 -> s=-1000, abs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must be exactly the negation of the current sum of the found cards. Let the current sum be `S`. We need to find the smallest number of cards `k` such that the sum of `k` cards (each between -x and x) equals `-S`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the current sum divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards reducing the deficit (if the sum is positive, we need negative contributions, and vice versa). The ceiling function ensures we account for any fractional part when dividing the deficit by `x`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the absolute value of the current sum of the found cards. The minimal number of cards needed is then computed using ceiling division: `(abs_s + x - 1) // x`, where `abs_s` is the absolute value of the current sum. This formula efficiently computes the ceiling of `abs_s / x` without floating-point operations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves a single pass through the list of found cards to compute their sum, which is O(n), where n is the number of cards. The subsequent calculations are constant time operations, making the overall complexity linear and efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    abs_s = abs(s)\n    k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The absolute value of this sum (`abs_s`) is taken to determine the deficit that needs to be covered by additional cards.\n3. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards `k` is calculated using the formula `(abs_s + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of `abs_s / x` without using floating-point arithmetic.\n4. **Output Result**: The result `k` is printed, representing the minimum number of additional cards needed to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insight to solve the problem with optimal performance, ensuring correctness across all possible input scenarios within the given constraints.",
