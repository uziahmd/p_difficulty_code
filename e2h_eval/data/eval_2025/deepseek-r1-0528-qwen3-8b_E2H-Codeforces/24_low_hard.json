She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r.\n\n The cursor starts at `pos` (which is between 1 and n) and there are n tabs.\n\n Operations allowed in one second:\n   - Move the cursor left: from current tab i to max(i-1, a), where a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs (initially 1, then as we close tabs, a increases).\n   - Move the cursor right: from current tab i to min(i+1, b), where b is the current maximum index of unclosed tabs (initially n, then decreases as we close tabs).\n   - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor: sets a to the current cursor's position (so the left boundary becomes the cursor's current position). This operation does not move the cursor, but changes the boundaries for future moves.\n   - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor: sets b to the current cursor's position.\n\n However, note that after closing, the boundaries change. Also, we can only close one side at a time.\n\n The goal is to minimize the number of seconds.\n\n Observing the problem:\n\n There are two parts to close: the left part (tabs [1, l-1]) and the right part (tabs [r+1, n]). \n\n But note: we don't necessarily have to do both. If the segment [l, r] already covers from the beginning or the end, then we don't close that side.\n\n Also, the cursor starts at `pos`. We might be already inside [l, r] or not. However, note the input condition: we must leave the tabs from l to r. So if the initial configuration has tabs outside [l, r], we must close them.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire set of tabs is already [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we have to consider two operations: closing left and closing right.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to close the entire set of tabs beyond [l, r] by moving the cursor arbitrarily. We can also use the boundary conditions to help.\n\n Let me break down:\n\n Case 1: The required segment [l, r] is the entire set of tabs (n= r-l+1? Actually, if l==1 and r==n, then 0).\n\n Case 2: We have to close either the left part (if l>1) and/or the right part (if r<n).\n\n How to think?\n\n We can consider two main strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: First close the left part, then the right part.\n   - To close the left part, we must move the cursor to l (or at least to a position from which we can close the left part) and then close the left part. Then we must move again to close the right part.\n\n But note: when we close the left part, the left boundary becomes the cursor's position. Then the available tabs are from the cursor's position to the original right boundary (which hasn't been closed yet). Similarly for the right.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Option A: If we are already at a position that can close the left part (meaning we are at l or to the left of l, but actually we have to be at l or beyond to close the left part? Let me clarify:\n\n Operation: \"close all the tabs to the left\" will close tabs from a (current left boundary) to i-1. So to close the left part [1, l-1], we must have the cursor at a position >= l (because if the cursor is at i, then we close [a, i-1] and we want [1, l-1] to be closed. Therefore, we must have i-1 >= l-1, i.e., i>=l. Actually, no: we don't necessarily have to cover the entire [1, l-1] in one go. But note: the operation closes all the tabs to the left of the cursor (from the current left boundary to i-1). So if we are at a position i, then we close all tabs from a (the current left boundary) to i-1. So to ensure that [1, l-1] is closed, we must have i-1 >= l-1 and also the left boundary a must be at most 1 (which it initially is). However, we are going to close the left part, so we must set the left boundary to at least l (so that the left boundary becomes l, meaning that the first tab we leave is l). \n\n Actually, the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" sets a = i (the current cursor position). Then the next time we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The solution involves analyzing different scenarios based on the initial and target segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Luba can close tabs either by moving the cursor to the desired position and then closing all tabs to the left or right. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closures to minimize the time taken.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n) is already within [l, r], no action is needed.\n   - Otherwise, if the left boundary (1) is not part of the required segment, Luba must close tabs to the left of `l`.\n   - Similarly, if the right boundary (n) is not part of the required segment, she must close tabs to the right of `r`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: If `l == 1` and `r == n`, the answer is 0 since no tabs need closing.\n   - **Case 2**: If `l > 1` and `r < n`, Luba might need to close both sides. The optimal approach depends on whether the cursor starts closer to `l` or `r`.\n   - **Case 3**: If only one side needs closing, the solution involves moving the cursor to the appropriate boundary and performing the closure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    steps = 0\n    \n    if l > 1:\n        if pos < l:\n            steps += (l - pos) + 1\n        else:\n            steps += (pos - l) + 1\n            \n    if r < n:\n        if pos < r:\n            steps += (r - pos) + 1\n        else:\n            steps += (pos - r) + 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the entire range of tabs (1 to n) is already within the required segment [l, r]. If so, it prints 0 and exits.\n2. **Left Closure Handling**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, the code calculates the steps needed to move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. The movement direction (left or right) is determined by comparing `pos` with `l`.\n3. **Right Closure Handling**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, the code calculates the steps to move the cursor from `pos` to `r`.\n4. **Output**: The total steps required to close all necessary tabs are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases by breaking down the problem into manageable subproblems and calculating the minimal steps required for each segment. The solution ensures optimal performance with a clear and concise implementation.",
