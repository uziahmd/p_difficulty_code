Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the best we can do with one card is to choose a number in [-x, x].\n\n   Let T = -S (the target sum we need to achieve with additional cards).\n\n 5. We want to minimize the number of cards, say k, such that there exists k numbers (each between -x and x) that sum to T.\n\n 6. Note: The problem does not require that the additional cards must be distinct or positive, etc.\n\n 7. We can think greedily:\n\n    Let k_min be the minimal number of cards.\n\n    Since each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative), the maximum absolute value we can cover with k cards is k*x.\n\n    Therefore, if |T| <= k*x, then it might be achievable. But note: we can mix positive and negative.\n\n    Actually, we can also consider:\n\n        With k cards, the minimum sum we can get is -k*x, and the maximum sum is k*x.\n\n        So we require: -k*x <= T <= k*x.\n\n    But also note: we are allowed to use any integer in between. However, there is a catch: sometimes even if T is within [-k*x, k*x], we might not be able to represent T as the sum of k integers each in [-x, x]? Actually, we can because we can use fractions? No, but note: we are allowed to use any integer. \n\n    However, there's a more subtle constraint: we cannot use non-integer values, but since T is an integer (because S is the sum of integers, so T is integer) and we can use integers, we can represent T as long as:\n\n        -k*x <= T <= k*x\n\n    BUT wait, is that sufficient? Not exactly. For example, with k=1, we can represent T only if T is in [-x, x]. With k=2, we can represent T if T is in [-2*x, 2*x] but also note that the parity condition? Actually, no, because we can use any integers. However, the set of representable numbers with k cards is all integers between -k*x and k*x? \n\n    Actually, no: the set of sums of k integers each in [-x, x] is the set of integers from -k*x to k*x. Why?\n        Because we can choose the first k-1 cards arbitrarily (as long as they are in [-x,x]) and then the last card can adjust by any integer between -x and x. However, note that the total sum must be an integer and the adjustments are by integers. But actually, the entire set is consecutive?\n\n    Let me check for k=2 and x=1: \n        We can get from -2 to 2: \n            (-1,-1): -2\n            (-1,0): -1\n            (-1,1): 0\n            (0,0): 0 -> wait, but then how do we get 0? Actually, we can get 0 in two ways. But the set of integers from -2 to 2 is complete.\n\n    Actually, the set of sums of k integers from [-x, x] is every integer between -k*x and k*x. Why? \n        Base case: k=1 -> [-x, x] which is consecutive if we allow every integer in between? Yes, because x is integer and the set is symmetric.\n\n        Then for k>=1, we can use induction: \n          Suppose with k cards we can represent every integer from -k*x to k*x. Then with k+1 cards, we can take any representation of a number t from -k*x to k*x and then add a card with value v from -x to x, so the new sum is t+v. Then the minimum is -k*x-x = -(k+1)*x and maximum is k*x+x = (k+1)*x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum (i.e., if the current sum is S, the target is -S).\n3. **Find Minimum Cards**: The goal is to find the smallest number of cards (k) such that their combined values can sum up to the target. Each card can contribute a maximum of x or a minimum of -x. Therefore, the sum of k cards must lie within the range [-k*x, k*x]. \n\nThe solution involves checking for the smallest k where the absolute value of the target sum does not exceed k*x. This is because with k cards, each contributing at most ±x, the maximum positive sum achievable is k*x, and the maximum negative sum is -k*x. \n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(arr)\n    target = -total\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        if abs(target) <= k * x:\n            print(k)\n            return\n        k += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards (n), the maximum absolute value allowed on any card (x), and the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Current Sum Calculation**: The sum of the integers on the found cards is computed. This sum determines the target sum needed from additional cards (which is the negative of the current sum).\n3. **Target Check**: If the target sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed, and the answer is 0.\n4. **Finding Minimum Cards**: The algorithm checks for the smallest integer k such that the absolute value of the target sum is less than or equal to k multiplied by x. This is because with k cards, each can contribute a value between -x and x, so the combined sum can range from -k*x to k*x. The first k for which this condition is met is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the mathematical constraints of the problem, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input sizes.",
