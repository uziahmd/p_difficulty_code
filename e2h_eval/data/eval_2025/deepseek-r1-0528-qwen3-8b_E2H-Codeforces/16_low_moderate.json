Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation here is that the roads are lines and they divide the plane into regions. The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a nonzero boundary, which in this case means crossing a road (i.e., going from one side of a road to the other). However, note that we can cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: when you cross one road, you move from one block to an adjacent one. But if two roads intersect, then crossing one road might be independent of another.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that you must cross a single contiguous segment of a road. But note: if two roads cross at a point, then the borders are segments (or rays) of the roads. \n\n But here's the catch: moving from one block to another requires crossing at least one road. Moreover, the minimal steps required is actually the number of roads that separate the home from the university? However, note that sometimes you can cross multiple roads at the same time (if they are all crossed by a straight line connecting home and university). \n\n Actually, think about it: if we consider the entire set of roads, each road divides the plane into two half-planes. For the home and university to be in the same block, they must lie on the same side for every road. If they are separated by a road, then we must cross that road. However, we can cross several roads at once if we cross them all along the same path (but note: the step is defined as moving from one block to another via a nonzero border, meaning we cross one road at a time? Actually, no: the problem says that we can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. A shared border is a segment of a road. So crossing two roads at the same time would require two steps? Not necessarily: because if the two roads are not parallel, then they form four regions and the border between two opposite regions is two different roads? Actually, let me clarify:\n\n In fact, the problem is equivalent to: each road is a constraint. We start at home and end at university. Each time we cross a road, we change the side (from positive to negative or vice versa). The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross? But wait: what if we cross two roads at the same time? Then we would have moved from one block to a non-adjacent block in one step? No, because the problem says: move from one block to another if the common border is nonzero. The common border must be a part of one road. So you cannot cross two roads at the same time (unless the two roads are the same, but they are distinct). Therefore, each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n However, note: the step does not require crossing the entire road; just stepping from one side to the other. But the minimal path (in terms of crossings) from home to university is determined by the number of roads that separate the two points. But note: if two roads are crossed independently, then we must cross each one. However, there is a possibility that the home and university are separated by k roads, but we can cross these k roads in any order. But the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate them? \n\n Actually, no. Consider: we are allowed to cross roads arbitrarily. However, the problem is similar to the concept of \"planar graphs\" and dual graphs. The dual graph has nodes as blocks and edges as the borders (roads). But note: the problem does not require to count the edges (roads) crossed, because we can cross multiple roads in one step? Wait, no: we can only cross one road per step.\n\n But then, the minimal number of steps would be the minimal number of roads we have to cross to go from home to university. However, note that if we cross a road, we change the side. And if home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then we must cross that road at least once.\n\n However, we can cross roads in any order, and we don't need to cross a road more than once. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross. But wait: the problem does not require to minimize the Euclidean distance, but the number of steps (each step being crossing one road). Therefore, the answer is the minimal number of roads that must be crossed to go from home to university.\n\n However, note: it is possible that a single step (crossing one road) is sufficient, but if home and university are separated by two roads, then we must cross two roads. But is the minimal steps always equal to the number of roads that separate the two points?\n\n Let me define: for each road i, we can assign a sign to home and university. Specifically, we can",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (i.e., moving from one block to an adjacent block sharing a nonzero boundary segment). The key insight is that each road separates the plane into two half-planes, and the home and university blocks must lie on the same side for all roads they are not separated by. If they are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to counting how many roads separate the home and university blocks. Each time the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed. The minimal number of steps is simply the number of such roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides, crossing that road is necessary. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\), compute the sign of \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, increment the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    steps = 0\n    for (a, b, c) in roads:\n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) or (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0):\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the coordinates of home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the code checks whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the road. This is done by evaluating the sign of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) at both points.\n3. **Counting Steps**: If the evaluations for the two points have opposite signs, it means the road separates them, and thus a step (crossing the road) is necessary. The total count of such roads gives the answer.\n4. **Output**: The result, which is the minimal number of steps, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging simple arithmetic checks for each road, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
