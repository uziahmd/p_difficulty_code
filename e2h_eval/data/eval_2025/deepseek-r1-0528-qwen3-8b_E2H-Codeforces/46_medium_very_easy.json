    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to change at most one number in the subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We are going to consider three cases:\n 1. The entire sequence is already strictly increasing -> then answer n (with 0 changes) or if not, we can have a segment of length n by changing one element? Actually, note: we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n However, note: sometimes even if the entire sequence is not increasing, we might be able to fix one problem and get a long increasing subsegment.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We can think of:\n   Case 1: Without any change, the longest strictly increasing contiguous subsegment.\n   Case 2: With one change, we can fix one drop in the sequence.\n\n But note: the problem allows changing one number to any integer. So we can fix one violation.\n\n How do we find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by at most one change?\n\n Observation:\n   We can traverse and look for the positions where the condition breaks (i.e., a[i] >= a[i-1] fails).\n\n We can precompute:\n   left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change)\n   right[j]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at j (without any change)\n\n Then, if we are allowed to change one element, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Entirely without change: max_length = max(left) [which is the standard longest increasing contiguous subsegment]\n\n   Option 2: With one change, we can merge two increasing parts if the drop is fixed by changing one element.\n\n   Specifically, consider a segment from L to R (0-indexed). We want to fix one element such that the entire segment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n   There are two possibilities for the changed element:\n\n     a) The changed element is at an index that is causing the break. For example, if we have [2, 3, 1, 5, 6], then the break is between index 2 (value 3) and index 3 (value 1). If we change the 1 to something greater than 3 and less than 5 (if we want to extend the increasing part), but note we can set it arbitrarily.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to set it to any integer. So the only condition is that the fixed element must be greater than the left neighbor and less than the right neighbor (if we are fixing an internal element). But wait, we might also fix an element at the beginning or end? Actually, the change can be anywhere.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Let dp0[i] = the length of the increasing subsegment ending at i without any change so far.\n\n   Then, we can also consider:\n\n   - We can have a segment that has one change somewhere in the middle.\n\n   Another idea: use two arrays:\n\n     left[i]: the length of the increasing sequence ending at i (without change)\n        left[0] = 1\n        for i from 1 to n-1:\n            if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            else:\n                left[i] = 1\n\n     Similarly, right[i]: the length of the increasing sequence starting at i (without change)\n        right[n-1] = 1\n        for i from n-2 down to 0:\n            if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            else:\n                right[i] = 1\n\n   Now, with at most one change, we can consider:\n\n   Case 1: Entirely without change -> candidate = max(left)\n\n   Case 2: We fix one element. Then the segment might be formed by:\n\n        [ ... , a[i-1], x, a[i+1], ... ]\n\n        But note: we can fix one element and then the entire segment must be strictly increasing.\n\n        Possibilities:\n\n          a) The change is at the beginning: then the segment starts at some index and the first element is changed arbitrarily. Then we can have a segment from i to j, but the condition is that the entire segment (starting from i) is increasing. However, we can fix the first element arbitrarily so that it is less than the next. But then we don't need to know the previous value. Actually, we can have a segment that starts at i and goes until j, provided that from i+1 to j is increasing. Then we set a[i] to a value that is less than a[i+1]. But note: we are allowed to change at most one, and we are considering the entire segment. The segment length would be (right[i+1] + 1) if we fix a[i] (if the segment starts at i and ends at i + right[i+1] - 1, then by fixing a[i] we can set it to be less than a[i+1]). However, we don't require the entire segment to be connected to anything before i.\n\n          Similarly, we can fix an element at the end.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire segment to be connected to outside. We can fix one element and then the entire segment is increasing.\n\n        How to combine? We can consider:\n\n          Consider a segment that has one change. The change can occur at any position. The segment is broken into two parts (if the change is in the middle) that must be increasing, and the fixed element must bridge the gap.\n\n        Conditions for a change at position i:\n\n          The segment from L to R (with one change at i) must satisfy:\n\n          - From L to i-1 is strictly increasing (if L <= i-1 exists)\n          - From i+1 to R is strictly increasing (if R>=i+1 exists)\n          - And the fixed element at i must be greater than the element at i-1 (if exists) and less than the element at i+1 (if exists).\n\n        However, note that we are allowed to choose the fixed value arbitrarily, so the condition is:\n\n          If we fix a[i], then:\n\n            Condition for left: if L <= i-1, then a[i] must be > a[i-1].\n            Condition for right: if i+1 <= R, then a[i] must be < a[i+1].\n\n        But note: we can also have a segment that doesn't require the entire segment to be connected to both sides? Actually, the entire segment must be strictly increasing. So if we fix one element, then the entire segment must be increasing.\n\n        We can consider three types:\n\n          Type 1: Change at the beginning (so the segment is from i to j, and we fix a[i]). Then we require that the rest (from i+1 to j) is increasing. Then the segment length is 1 + (the increasing sequence starting at i+1). But note, we can also have the entire segment from i to j without requiring the fixed a[i] to be less than a[i+1]? Actually, we require the entire segment to be strictly increasing. So if we fix a[i], then we must have a[i] < a[i+1] (if the segment has at least two elements). But if the segment is just one element, then we don't care.\n\n          Similarly, change at the end: the segment from i to j-1 must be increasing, and then we fix a[j] to be greater than a[j-1].\n\n          Type 2: Change in the middle. Then we require that the part before the change (ending at i-1) is increasing, the part after the change (starting at i+1) is increasing, and the fixed element must be greater than the left neighbor and less than the right neighbor.\n\n        We can try:\n\n          candidate = max( \n              # Without change: max(left)\n              # With one change at the beginning: for each i, we can have a segment from i to i + (right[i+1] - 1) if i+1 exists, but if i is the last element then we can have 1. Also, we can have a segment that starts at i and goes to the end of the increasing run starting at i, but note: we can fix the first element arbitrarily to be less than the next, so the entire run from i to j (where j-i+1 = right[i])? Wait, no: if we fix the first element, then the condition for the next element must hold. Actually, the segment from i to j (with j from i to n-1) must be strictly increasing. But by fixing a[i], we can set it arbitrarily so that it is less than a[i+1] (if there is a next). Then the rest from i+1 to j must be increasing. So the maximum segment we can form starting at i is: 1 + (length of increasing sequence starting at i+1). But note: we are allowed to change one element, so we can only change one. So if we fix a[i] and the rest is already increasing, then the entire segment from i to j (where j = i + right[i+1] - 1) is valid. But what if the increasing sequence starting at i+1 is of length L, then the segment from i to i+L-1 has length L+1.\n\n          Similarly, for the change at the end: the segment from i to j (with j being the last element of the increasing sequence ending at j, and we fix a[j]) would be: the increasing sequence ending at j (without change) is of length L, then by fixing a[j] we can set it to be greater than a[j-1] (if j>i). Then the segment from i to j would be the entire increasing sequence ending at j, but we can extend it to the left? Actually, we can consider the entire increasing sequence ending at j, and then we fix the last element to be greater than the previous, but we are allowed to change one element anywhere. So the segment from i to j must be increasing. We can fix a[j] to be greater than a[j-1] (if the original a[j] is not already greater than a[j-1]), but note that the part from i to j-1 must be increasing.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          Let's define:\n\n          candidate1 = max(left)   [without change]\n\n          candidate2 = for each i, consider changing a[i] to fix a break. Then the segment can be:\n\n            If we change a[i], then the segment must include a[i] and we can extend as much as possible to the left and right.\n\n          How about:\n\n          Let's consider a break at i (meaning a[i] <= a[i-1] or a[i] >= a[i+1] might not hold). But we are allowed to fix one element.\n\n          We can iterate through each index i and consider:\n\n            Option A: Fix a[i]. Then the segment can be extended to the left until we hit a break (but we can only fix one, so we must check the conditions for the entire segment). However, we can use the precomputed left and right arrays to quickly compute the boundaries.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            candidate = max(candidate, left[i] + right[i] - 1)   # This is without fixing? Not exactly.\n\n          Let me reexamine:\n\n          Without change, the maximum increasing contiguous segment is the maximum of left.\n\n          With one change, we can consider:\n\n            For an index i, we can form a segment that covers:\n\n              [left part: from i-left_bound to i-1] and [right part: from i+1 to i+right_bound] and we fix a[i] to be between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if they exist). But note, the left part must be increasing and the right part must be increasing, and the fixed element must be greater than the last element of the left part and less than the first element of the right part.\n\n          However, note: the left part is the increasing sequence ending at i-1 (so the last element is a[i-1]), and the right part is the increasing sequence starting at i+1 (so the first element is a[i+1]).\n\n          Conditions:\n\n            If we have a left part (i-1 exists) and a right part (i+1 exists), then we require that a[i-1] < x < a[i+1] for the fixed value x. Since we can choose x arbitrarily, the condition is always satisfied as long as a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Because we can choose x to be any integer between them.\n\n          But what if there is no left part or no right part?\n\n            If there is no left part (i is the first element), then we only require that the right part is increasing and we fix a[i] to be less than a[i+1] (if there is a next). Then the entire segment from i to i+right[i+1]-1 is valid, and the length is right[i+1] (since we fixed the first element, so we can set it arbitrarily to be less than a[i+1] and then the rest is increasing). Similarly, if there is no right part (last element), then we fix the last element to be greater than a[i-1].\n\n          Therefore, for an index i, the maximum segment that we can form by fixing a[i] is:\n\n            If we fix a[i], then:\n\n              left_side = 0\n              right_side = 0\n\n              If i-1 exists, then we can take the entire increasing sequence ending at i-1 (length = left[i-1]), and we require that the fixed a[i] > a[i-1] (which we can do arbitrarily, so condition satisfied). Then the left_side is left[i-1] (meaning the segment from i-left[i-1]+1 to i-1 is increasing, and we fix a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]).\n\n              Similarly, if i+1 exists, then we can take the increasing sequence starting at i+1 (length = right[i+1]), and we require a[i] < a[i+1] (again arbitrary).\n\n              However, if both sides exist, we require that the fixed a[i] is greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]. This is automatically satisfied if a[i-1] < a[i+1]. But if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then we cannot fix a[i] to satisfy both? Actually, no: because we are allowed to change a[i] to any integer. But note: the condition for the entire segment to be strictly increasing requires that the fixed a[i] is greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]. So if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then we cannot fix a[i] to be both greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] (because that interval is empty). \n\n          Therefore, when both sides exist, we can only fix a[i] if a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then the entire segment from (i-left_side) to (i+right_side) is:\n\n            left_side = left[i-1]   (the increasing segment ending at i-1)\n            right_side = right[i+1] (the increasing segment starting at i+1)\n\n            Then the total length is left_side + 1 (for the fixed a[i]) + right_side.\n\n          But wait, what if the left_side is 0? Then we are only fixing a[i] and then the right side. Similarly for the right_side.\n\n          Actually, we can break it down:\n\n            Case 1: Fixing an element that is not at the boundary.\n\n            Condition: a[i-1] < a[i+1] (so that we can choose a value between them)\n\n            Then the segment we can form is:\n\n                [from (i - left[i-1]) to (i + right[i+1])] -> that's a contiguous segment of length (left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1])\n\n            Case 2: Fixing the first element (i=0). Then the segment is from 0 to (0 + right[1] - 1) [if we fix a[0] to be less than a[1]]? Actually, the entire segment from 0 to (right[1] - 1) (if we consider the increasing sequence starting at 1) and then we set a[0] arbitrarily to be less than a[1]. Then the length is 1 + right[1] (if right[1] is defined). But note: the increasing sequence starting at 1 is of length right[1], so the indices from 1 to 1+right[1]-1. Then the entire segment from 0 to 1+right[1]-1 is of length 1+right[1]. However, we can also consider that the fixed element is at 0, and then the rest must be increasing. But note: the rest is the increasing sequence starting at 1. So yes.\n\n            Similarly, for the last element (i=n-1): we set a[n-1] to be greater than a[n-2] (if exists) and then the increasing sequence ending at n-2 is of length left[n-2], so the entire segment is from n-2-left[n-2]+1 to n-1, which has length left[n-2] + 1.\n\n          However, note: the increasing sequence ending at i-1 and starting at i+1 might not necessarily be adjacent to i? Actually, we are taking the entire increasing segments that are immediately adjacent to i.\n\n          But wait, what if the increasing segment ending at i-1 is not the entire increasing run to the left? Actually, our left[i] is defined as the length of the increasing run ending at i. So left[i-1] is the length of the increasing run ending at i-1, which is the maximal increasing run ending at i-1.\n\n          Similarly, right[i+1] is the maximal increasing run starting at i+1.\n\n          Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate = max(candidate, \n                            (if i==0: 1 + (right[1] if n>1 else 0)),\n                            (if i==n-1: (left[n-2] if n>1 else 0) + 1),\n                            (if 0 < i < n-1 and a[i-1] < a[i+1]: left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]))\n\n          But wait: what if we fix an element that is not at the boundary and the left[i-1] or right[i+1] is 0? Then we are effectively not using that side.\n\n          However, note: if left[i-1] is 0, then i-1 is the start? Actually, left[i-1] is at least 1 because we defined left[0]=1. So i-1 must be at least 0. Similarly, for right[i+1], i+1 must be at most n-1.\n\n          But note: our arrays left and right are defined for every index. For example, if i=0, then we don't have a left[i-1] (so we skip that condition). Similarly for i=n-1.\n\n          However, there is another possibility: we might fix an element that is in the middle, but the increasing runs on the left and right are separated by more than one element? Actually, we are only concerned with the immediate neighbors.\n\n          But note: the increasing runs we consider (left[i-1] and right[i+1]) are the maximal contiguous increasing runs that end at i-1 and start at i+1. They are independent.\n\n          However, there is a catch: the entire segment we form must be contiguous. And by fixing a[i], we are connecting the two runs. But note: the two runs are separated by a[i] (which we fix) and the condition a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1] (if both sides exist) ensures that the entire segment is increasing.\n\n          But what if the two runs are not adjacent? Actually, we are only looking at the immediate left and the immediate right. The left run ends at i-1 and the right run starts at i+1. Then the entire segment we form is:\n\n            [start of left run to i-1] and [i+1 to end of right run] and then we put a fixed value at i. But note: the two runs are separated by one element (a[i]), so we are effectively merging the two runs by inserting a fixed element at i.\n\n          However, the entire segment is from (start of left run) to (end of right run) with the fixed element at i. But note: we are allowed to change only one element, so we cannot change the other elements. The left run and the right run are already increasing and we fix a[i] to bridge the gap.\n\n          But wait: what if the left run and the right run are not separated by a single element? Actually, we are considering the immediate neighbors. The left run ends at i-1 and the right run starts at i+1. The gap is only the element at i.\n\n          However, the problem is that the entire segment must be contiguous. We are considering the segment from (i - left[i-1]) to (i + right[i+1] - 1) ? Actually, no: the left run is from (i - left[i-1]) to i-1, and the right run is from i+1 to (i+right[i+1]). Then the entire segment is from (i - left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]). The length is (left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]).\n\n          But note: we are not forced to take the entire left and right runs? Actually, we are taking the maximal increasing runs that are adjacent to i. Why maximal? Because if we take a smaller run, then we might be able to include more? No, because we want the longest.\n\n          However, there is a possibility that the entire segment is not necessarily composed of the maximal runs. But note: we are allowed to change one element. The goal is to maximize the length.\n\n          But wait: what if the element we fix is in the middle of a longer increasing run? Actually, we are only looking at the immediate neighbors. The condition for the entire segment to be strictly increasing is that the entire segment is increasing. So if we fix a[i], then the entire segment must be increasing. The best we can do is to take the maximal increasing run to the left (until a break) and the maximal increasing run to the right (until a break) and then connect with the fixed element.\n\n          Therefore, the above candidate for each i is the maximum we can get by fixing a[i].\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to change at most one element, so we can also fix an element and then the segment might be entirely contained within the array. We are iterating over every index i to consider fixing that element.\n\n          Then the answer is the maximum of:\n\n            candidate0 = max(left)   [without change]\n\n            candidate1 = for each i from 0 to n-1, the segment length when fixing a[i] (as described above)\n\n          But wait: what if we fix an element that is not breaking the increasing condition? Actually, we are only considering the breaks? Actually, no: we are considering every element as a candidate for fixing. That is correct.\n\n          However, note: if we fix an element that is already in an increasing segment, we might be able to extend the segment further? Actually, no: because if we fix an element that is already in an increasing segment, then we are not actually breaking the increasing condition. But wait, maybe we can extend the segment beyond what we had? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,4] (already strictly increasing). Then we can fix any element arbitrarily, but we don't have to. However, note that if we fix an element that is already in the increasing segment, we might break the segment? Actually, we are allowed to change at most one. So if we fix an element arbitrarily, we can set it to any value. But if we set it to a value that is not increasing, then we break the segment. However, we are free to set it to a value that maintains the increasing property. So in fact, if we fix an element that is already in an increasing segment, we don't gain any extra length because the entire segment was already increasing. But note: we might be able to extend the segment? Actually, no: the entire segment was already increasing, so we don't need to fix. But wait, what if we fix an element that is in the middle to extend the segment? Actually, we are not extending the segment because we are only allowed to change one element. However, the problem says \"at most one\", so we can also fix one element even if it is not necessary. But note: the goal is to maximize the length. \n\n          However, consider: [1,3,2,4] (n=4). Without change, the longest increasing contiguous subsegment is 2 (either [1,3] or [2,4]). But if we fix the 3 (at index1) to 2, then we have [1,2,2,4] -> not strictly increasing. But wait, we can fix the 3 to 2.5, then [1,2.5,2,4] -> 2.5>2 fails. Alternatively, fix the 2 (at index2) to 4: then [1,3,4,4] -> not strictly increasing. Or fix the 2 to 3: [1,3,3,4] -> fails.\n\n          Actually, we can fix the 3 (at index1) to 0: then [1,0,2,4] -> then the segment [0,2,4] (from index1 to index3) is increasing. But wait, the entire segment from index0 to index3: [1,0,2,4] is not increasing (because 1>0). So we cannot take the entire segment. But we can take [0,2,4] (from index1 to index3) and that is increasing. The length is 3.\n\n          How did we get that? We fixed index1 (the 3) to 0, then the segment from index1 to index3 is increasing. But note: we are allowed to change one element anywhere in the subsegment. So we can choose the subsegment from index1 to index3 and fix the element at index1.\n\n          In our method, we consider fixing each element. For i=1 (index1):\n\n            Condition: both sides exist. Check a[0]=1 and a[2]=2. Since 1 < 2, we can fix a[1] to a value between 1 and 2. We choose 0, but note: 0 is less than 1 (the left neighbor) but wait: the condition for the entire segment [index1, index3] is that the entire segment must be strictly increasing. The segment [0,2,4] is increasing. But note: the left neighbor of the fixed element is a[0] (which is 1) and the fixed element is 0. Then 1 (at index0) is not in the segment we are considering. So we are only concerned with the segment from index1 to index3. The condition for the segment [index1 to index3] is:\n\n              a[1] < a[2] and a[2] < a[3]\n\n            But we fixed a[1] to 0, and then 0 < 2 and 2 < 4 holds.\n\n            However, in our formula for i=1:\n\n              left[i-1] = left[0] = 1 (the increasing run ending at index0 is [1])\n              right[i+1] = right[2] = 2 (the increasing run starting at index2: [2,4])\n\n            Then the segment we form is from index0 to index3? Actually, no: our formula for the segment when fixing i=1 is:\n\n              left[i-1] = 1 -> so we take the increasing run ending at i-1 (index0) and then the fixed element at i=1 and then the increasing run starting at i+1 (index2). Then the entire segment is from index0 to index3. But wait, we are including index0? Then the entire segment is [1,0,2,4]. Is that increasing? 1>0 -> no. So that segment is not increasing.\n\n          Therefore, we must not include the element at i-1 if we are only considering the segment from i to the right? Actually, no: we are considering the entire segment that includes the fixed element and the two runs. But the runs we consider are the maximal runs that are adjacent to i. However, the condition for the entire segment to be increasing is that the entire segment must be increasing. \n\n          In the example, when we fix a[1] (at index1) we are forming a segment that includes:\n\n            The left run: [a0] (which is [1])\n            The fixed element: 0\n            The right run: [a2, a3] (which is [2,4])\n\n          But then the entire segment is [1,0,2,4] which is not increasing. \n\n          What went wrong? The issue is that the entire segment we form must be contiguous and we are including the element at i-1 (from the left run) and the element at i (the fixed one) and the element at i+1 (the start of the right run). But the condition for the entire segment is that every adjacent pair must be increasing.\n\n          In particular, we require that the last element of the left run (a[i-1]) is less than the fixed element (a[i]) and the fixed element (a[i]) is less than the first element of the right run (a[i+1]). But note: the left run is [a0] and the fixed element is at a1. Then we require a0 < a1 (fixed). Then we require a1 < a2. And then the right run must be increasing. \n\n          However, the entire segment [a0, a1, a2, a3] must be increasing. But we broke the condition between a0 and a1 (1 and 0). \n\n          So we must not include the left run if we are forming a segment that does not necessarily start at the beginning of the left run? Actually, no: we are allowed to change one element, but the entire segment we choose must be contiguous and we are free to choose any contiguous segment. \n\n          Let me clarify: the problem asks for the longest contiguous subsegment (consecutive elements) such that we can change at most one element in that subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n\n          In the example [1,3,2,4]:\n\n            We can choose the subsegment [3,2,4] (indices 1 to 3) and change the 3 to 0 -> then [0,2,4] is strictly increasing. The length is 3.\n\n          How do we capture that?\n\n          In our method, we considered the left run ending at i-1 and the right run starting at i+1. But note: the segment we are considering is from (i - left[i-1] + 1) to (i+right[i+1])? Actually, we are including the entire left run (from i-left[i-1] to i-1) and the entire right run (from i+1 to i+right[i+1]-1) and the fixed element at i. But wait, the left run is from i-left[i-1] to i-1, so if we include the entire left run, then the segment starts at i-left[i-1] (which is 0 in the example) and goes to i+right[i+1]-1 (which is 3). \n\n          But in the example, the left run (ending at i-1=0) has length 1, so the segment we form is from 0 to 3. But that segment is not increasing.\n\n          Therefore, we must be careful: the entire segment we form must be increasing. The condition for the entire segment is:\n\n            For the left part: the increasing run ending at i-1 is from (i-left[i-1]) to i-1, and we require that the fixed element is greater than a[i-1] (the last element of the left run). But note: the fixed element is at i, and the left run ends at i-1. Then the condition between the last element of the left run (at i-1) and the fixed element (at i) is that a[i-1] < fixed_value. \n\n          However, in the entire segment, the element at i-1 is included and the fixed element at i must be greater than a[i-1]. Then the entire segment from (i-left[i-1]) to i is increasing? \n\n          Actually, the increasing run ending at i-1 is increasing, and then we set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]. Then the entire segment from (i-left[i-1]) to i is increasing. Similarly, the segment from i to (i+right[i+1]-1) is increasing. Therefore, the entire segment from (i-left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]-1) is increasing if and only if:\n\n            Condition 1: The left run is increasing (by definition).\n            Condition 2: The fixed element is greater than the last element of the left run (a[i-1]).\n            Condition 3: The fixed element is less than the first element of the right run (a[i+1]).\n            Condition 4: The right run is increasing (by definition).\n\n          But note: the entire segment is the concatenation of the left run, the fixed element, and the right run. And the conditions are:\n\n            a[k] < a[k+1] for all k from (i-left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]-2) and also:\n\n            a[i-1] < fixed_value and fixed_value < a[i+1]\n\n          However, the condition between a[i-1] and a[i] is taken care of by Condition 2, and between a[i] and a[i+1] by Condition 3.\n\n          But what about the entire segment? The increasing run on the left is up to i-1, then we jump to i (with fixed_value) and then the right run. There is no condition between a[i-2] and a[i] because they are not adjacent. The entire segment is contiguous, so we require:\n\n            a[i-2] < a[i-1] (which is given by the left run) and then a[i-1] < fixed_value and fixed_value < a[i+1] and then the right run.\n\n          But note: the entire segment is contiguous, so the fixed_value must be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]. However, the left run and the right run are independent. \n\n          The problem in the example is that the entire segment from index0 to index3 includes the element at index0 (which is 1) and then the fixed element at index1 (0) and then the right run. But 1 (at index0) and 0 (at index1) are adjacent, and 1>0, so the entire segment is not increasing.\n\n          Therefore, our method must not include the left run if we are only forming a segment that starts at i (the fixed element) and goes to the right? Or do we have two different possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: We fix an element and then we can choose the segment to be from i to j (the right part) and ignore the left part.\n\n            Possibility 2: We fix an element and then we can choose the segment to be from k to i (the left part) and ignore the right part.\n\n            Possibility 3: We fix an element and then we can choose the segment to be from k to j (both sides) as long as the fixed element bridges the gap.\n\n          Actually, we are allowed to choose any contiguous segment. So we can choose the segment to be from i to i+right[i+1]-1 (fixing a[i] to be less than a[i+1]), or from i-left[i-1] to i (fixing a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]), or from i-left[i-1] to i+right[i+1]-1 (fixing a[i] to bridge the gap).\n\n          And the maximum length for fixing a[i] is the maximum of these three possibilities, provided the conditions are met.\n\n          Let me define:\n\n            candidate_i = 1   (at least the fixed element)\n\n            If i is not the last element, then we can extend to the right: the increasing sequence starting at i+1 has length L = right[i+1]. Then we can set a[i] to be less than a[i+1] (if we fix a[i]) and then the entire segment from i to i+L-1 is increasing. The length is L+1.\n\n            Similarly, if i is not the first element, then we can extend to the left: the increasing sequence ending at i-1 has length M = left[i-1]. Then we can set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] and the entire segment from i-M+1 to i is increasing. The length is M+1.\n\n            Additionally, if both sides exist and a[i-1] < a[i+1], then we can combine: the entire segment from i-M+1 to i+L-1 is increasing (provided we fix a[i] to be between a[i-1] and a[i+1]). The length is M + L + 1.\n\n          But wait: the entire segment from i-M+1 to i+L-1 must be increasing. We know:\n\n            [i-M+1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the array to determine the maximum possible length of such a subsegment efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left`)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at each index `i`.\n   - **Right Array (`right`)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at each index `i`.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**:\n   - The initial candidate for the answer is the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes, which is the maximum value in the `left` array.\n\n3. **Evaluate Single Change**:\n   - For each element in the array, consider the scenario where this element is the one being changed. The goal is to determine the longest subsegment that can be formed by including this element and possibly extending it to the left or right.\n   - **Single Side Extension**: If changing the current element allows extending the subsegment to the left or right, calculate the potential length.\n   - **Both Sides Extension**: If changing the current element allows combining left and right increasing subsegments (i.e., the left neighbor is less than the right neighbor), then the combined length is considered.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The final result is the maximum value obtained from either the initial maximum length or the best single-change scenarios across all elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(max(left), 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if left[i] >= 2 and i + 1 < n:\n            candidate = left[i] + 1\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n                \n        if right[i] >= 2 and i - 1 >= 0:\n            candidate = right[i] + 1\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n                \n        if i - 1 >= 0 and i + 1 < n:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                total_length = left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1\n                if total_length > ans:\n                    ans = total_length\n                    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the size of the array and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the answer is trivially 1 since a single element is always strictly increasing.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: The `left` array is filled such that each entry `left[i]` holds the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at index `i`. Similarly, the `right` array holds the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n4. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is set to the maximum value in the `left` array, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n5. **Single Change Evaluation**: For each element, the algorithm checks if changing that element allows extending the subsegment to the left or right. If both sides can be extended (and the left neighbor is less than the right neighbor), the combined length is considered.\n6. **Output Result**: The maximum value obtained from all evaluations is printed as the result, representing the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.",
