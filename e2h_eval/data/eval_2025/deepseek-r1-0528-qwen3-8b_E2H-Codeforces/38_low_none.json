    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000). We need to:\n 1. Find the minimum number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with n nodes that is p-reachable.\n    - Note: The graph must have exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v being mutually reachable.\n\n 2. Among all graphs with n nodes (the minimum n found in part 1) that are p-reachable, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Observing the problem:\n\n Condition for p-reachable: exactly p unordered pairs (or rather, note: the condition says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v\", so it's about unordered pairs? Actually, the condition is on unordered pairs because u < v. But note: the definition of unidirectional is about ordered pairs (u,v) and (v,u) separately.\n\n However, the condition for p-reachable counts only the mutual reachability for u < v. So, if two nodes are mutually reachable, then the pair (u, v) (with u < v) is counted. And the graph must have exactly p such pairs.\n\n How can we form a graph with exactly p mutual pairs (for u < v)? \n\n Note: In a strongly connected component (SCC), every pair of nodes (u, v) (with u < v) is mutually reachable. So, if we have a strongly connected component of size k, then it contributes C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2 mutual pairs.\n\n Therefore, the entire graph must decompose into several SCCs (say, components C1, C2, ... , Cm) such that the sum of C(|Ci|,2) over i is exactly p.\n\n Moreover, we want to minimize the total number of nodes (which is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs). Also, we want to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n But note: the definition of unidirectional pair (u, v): \n   - There is a path from u to v, but not from v to u.\n\n However, in a directed graph, if we have multiple SCCs, then we can have edges between them. But note the condition for being p-reachable: we require exactly p mutual pairs (each mutual pair is within one SCC). \n\n What are the constraints for the graph to be p-reachable?\n   - The entire graph must break down into SCCs such that the sum of C(|Ci|,2) = p.\n   - Additionally, the graph must be built from these SCCs with no extra mutual connections (i.e., we don't have edges between two different SCCs that would make them part of the same SCC? Actually, we can have edges between SCCs, but then they might merge. So, to keep the SCCs separate, we must ensure that there are no edges from a node in a smaller SCC to a larger one that would connect them? Actually, we can use the standard condensation of a DAG of SCCs, and then we can have edges from one SCC to another, but then we cannot have a cycle in the condensation (so the condensation is a DAG). \n\n However, note: the problem does not require the graph to be connected. It just requires exactly p mutual pairs (each mutual pair is an unordered pair {u,v} that is in the same SCC). \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the minimum n (total nodes) such that there exists a set of positive integers k1, k2, ..., km (each >=1, and sum_i ki = n) and \n        sum_i [ C(ki,2) ] = p.\n\n    Note: We can also consider that the entire graph could be one SCC. Then we need C(n,2) = p, so n*(n-1)//2 = p. But sometimes we can break the graph into multiple SCCs to achieve p with fewer nodes? Actually, wait: \n\n    Why would breaking into multiple SCCs help to minimize the total nodes? Consider: \n        With one SCC of size n, we get T = n*(n-1)//2 mutual pairs.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use two SCCs: one of size a and one of size b (a+b = n). Then the total mutual pairs is a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2.\n\n        We want to know: is there a way to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number is T_k = k*(k-1)//2) and minimize the total n (the sum of the k's) ?\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to have more than two SCCs.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is exactly p-reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachability**: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and there is mutual reachability between u and v. This means the graph must decompose into strongly connected components (SCCs) where the sum of combinations of nodes within each SCC equals p. Each SCC of size k contributes \\( \\binom{k}{2} \\) mutual pairs.\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: The goal is to find the smallest number of nodes n such that the sum of \\( \\binom{k_i}{2} \\) for all SCCs (where \\( \\sum k_i = n \\)) equals p. This involves partitioning n nodes into SCCs whose combined mutual pairs sum to p, using the smallest possible n.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal n is determined, the next step is to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) where there is a path from u to v but not vice versa. This is achieved by structuring the graph such that edges are directed in a way that minimizes mutual reachability outside the SCCs while maximizing paths in one direction.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"1 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    total_triangles = 0\n    while True:\n        n += 1\n        if n*(n-1)//2 > p:\n            break\n        total_triangles = n*(n-1)//2\n        if total_triangles == p:\n            print(f\"{n} 0\")\n            return\n            \n    # Now we know n is the smallest integer such that n*(n-1)//2 >= p+1 (actually just greater than p)\n    # We need to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k = k*(k-1)//2) with minimal total nodes.\n\n    # Step 1: Find the largest triangular number <= p.\n    k = 1\n    remaining = p\n    while (k+1)*(k+2)//2 <= remaining:\n        k += 1\n    remaining -= k*(k-1)//2\n\n    # Now, we have one component of size k (which gives k*(k-1)//2) and the rest must form a graph with 'remaining' triangles.\n    # But note: the minimal total nodes would be k plus the minimal nodes needed for the remaining triangles.\n\n    # However, the above loop does not necessarily give the minimal n because we can combine multiple components.\n\n    # Alternate approach: Let n be the smallest integer such that the maximum sum of triangular numbers for n nodes is at least p.\n    # We already know that for n nodes, the maximum p is T_n = n*(n-1)//2. But we need exactly p.\n\n    # We can use dynamic programming or greedy to decompose p into triangular numbers, but note: the triangular numbers here are defined for each SCC.\n\n    # Actually, we want to minimize the total nodes. So we should use as large triangular numbers as possible.\n\n    # Steps:\n    # 1. Let n_min be the smallest n such that T_n >= p.\n    # 2. Then, we try to represent p as a sum of some triangular numbers (each T_k <= T_{n_min}) without exceeding the node limit n_min.\n\n    # But note: the triangular numbers we can use are only those that correspond to valid SCC sizes (each at least 1).\n\n    # We can use a greedy algorithm to subtract the largest triangular number less than or equal to the remaining p until we reach zero.\n\n    # However, the above greedy might not yield the minimal n because sometimes using smaller components might allow a smaller total node count? Actually, no: because the triangular numbers grow quadratically, so using larger components is more efficient in terms of node count.\n\n    # Actually, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that there exists a set of integers k1, k2, ..., km (each >=1) with sum ki = n and sum T_{ki} = p.\n\n    # How to compute minimal n?\n    # We know that the maximum p we can get with n nodes is T_n = n*(n-1)//2.\n    # But we need exactly p. We can start from the smallest n such that T_n >= p, then check if p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k <= T_n) and the sum of the bases (k's) is n.\n\n    # However, note: the problem requires the minimal n. \n\n    # Insight: The minimal n is the smallest integer such that T_n >= p. But wait, consider p=3: \n    #   n=2: T_2 = 1 -> not enough.\n    #   n=3: T_3 = 3 -> exactly p, so minimal n=3.\n\n    # But what if p=4?\n    #   n=3: T_3=3 <4 -> not enough.\n    #   n=4: T_4=6>=4. Now, can we form p=4 with n=4? \n    #       We need to decompose 4 into triangular numbers (each <=6). The triangular numbers available are T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=3, T_4=6.\n    #       We can use two components: one of size 3 (gives 3) and one of size 1 (gives 0). Then total p=3+0=3, which is less than 4.\n    #       Alternatively, one component of size 2 (gives 1) and another of size 2 (gives 1): total p=2, still less.\n    #       Or one component of size 3 (3) and one of size 1 (0): 3.\n    #       Or one component of size 4 (6) which is too much.\n    #       What about three components? One of size 2 (1), one of size 1 (0), one of size 1 (0): total 1.\n    #       So with n=4, we cannot form p=4? Then we must use n=5: T_5=10>=4.\n    #       Now, with n=5, we can decompose into components: \n    #           Option: one component of size 3 (3) and two components of size 1 (0): total 3.\n    #           Option: two components of size 2 (each gives 1): total 2.\n    #           Option: one component of size 2 (1) and three components of size 1 (0): total 1.\n    #       Still not 4. \n    #       Alternatively, we can use a component of size 4 (6) and then we have one node left, but then we cannot use the node without creating an extra mutual pair? Actually, we can have multiple components. The mutual pairs are only within components. So if we have a component of size 4 (which gives 6) and a component of size 1, then total mutual pairs is 6+0=6, which is too much.\n\n    #       How to get 4? \n    #         We can have two components: one of size 3 (3) and one of size 2 (1). Then total mutual pairs = 3 + 1 = 4. And total nodes = 3+2 = 5.\n\n    #       So the minimal n for p=4 is 5.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimal n is not simply the smallest n such that T_n >= p. We need to check if p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of k's being n.\n\n    # Algorithm for minimal n:\n    #   Start with n = 0, and let current_p = 0.\n    #   Then, while current_p < p:\n    #       Consider adding a new node. When we add a node, we can either put it in an existing component (increasing its size) or form a new component (of size 1).\n    #       - If we form a new component (size 1), then the mutual pairs added is T_1 = 0.\n    #       - If we add to an existing component of size k, then the mutual pairs added is T_{k+1} - T_k = k.\n    #       We want to minimize the total nodes, so we choose the operation that adds the most mutual pairs per node? Actually, we want to reach exactly p with minimal nodes.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can iterate over possible n starting from 1 until we find the minimal n such that the maximum p achievable with n nodes (which is T_n) is at least p, and then check if we can form p with n nodes.\n\n    #   But note: the maximum p with n nodes is T_n (when the entire graph is one SCC). The minimum p with n nodes is 0 (when there are no mutual pairs, i.e., all nodes are isolated). However, we can achieve any p between 0 and T_n by appropriately splitting the nodes into SCCs. \n\n    #   Why? Because if we have n nodes, we can split them into components of sizes k1, k2, ..., km (summing to n) and the total mutual pairs is the sum of T_{ki}. Since T_k is the triangular number, and we can choose any partition, the set of achievable p values is all integers that can be written as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k <= T_n) with the sum of the bases (ki) being <= n. \n\n    #   However, note: the sum of the bases is exactly n because we are using all nodes. And the triangular numbers are additive. \n\n    #   But the triangular numbers are not arbitrary: they are fixed for each base. However, since we can use multiple components, we can achieve any p between 0 and T_n as long as p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) with the condition that the sum of the k's is n. \n\n    #   Actually, the problem is known in mathematics: representing a number p as a sum of triangular numbers (with repetition allowed) and minimizing the total \"base\" (the sum of the k's) is equivalent to minimizing the total nodes. \n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming to find the minimal n for a given p. However, p can be up to 200,000, so we need an efficient method.\n\n    #   Observation: The triangular numbers grow quadratically. We can use a greedy approach:\n\n    #   Let n_min = ceil((1 + sqrt(1+8*p))/2) ? Not exactly, because p might not be a triangular number.\n\n    #   Actually, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that there exists a decomposition of p into triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of the k's being n.\n\n    #   But note: we are allowed to use any triangular numbers (any k>=1). The triangular numbers are T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=3, T_4=6, etc.\n\n    #   We can use a two-step process:\n\n    #   Step 1: Find the minimal n such that T_n >= p. This gives us an upper bound on n.\n\n    #   Step 2: Check if p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of the k's being n. \n\n    #   However, we want the minimal n. We can iterate n from 1 upwards until we find an n such that p can be written as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) and the sum of the k's is n.\n\n    #   But how to check for a given n if p can be represented? \n\n    #   Note: Each triangular number T_k is non-negative. The maximum p we can get with n nodes is T_n. The minimum is 0. \n\n    #   We need to find a multiset of k's (each k>=1) such that:\n    #       sum_{i} k_i = n\n    #       sum_{i} T_{k_i} = p\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can think: we are going to assign each node to a component. The contribution of a component of size k is T_k. The total contribution is p. The total nodes is the sum of the sizes.\n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming where dp[i] = the minimal number of nodes needed to achieve exactly i mutual pairs. But i can be up to 200,000, and n can be up to around 900 (since T_900 ~ 400,000).\n\n    #   However, the constraints say p up to 200,000. We can use a greedy method:\n\n    #   We know that the triangular numbers are increasing. We can use the largest triangular numbers first to minimize the total nodes.\n\n    #   Steps for checking a given n:\n    #       Let x = p.\n    #       For k from floor((sqrt(8*x+1)+1)/2) down to 2:\n    #           while x >= T_k and (the remaining nodes after using a component of size k doesn't exceed n - k) and (the total mutual pairs from the remaining components doesn't exceed p - T_k):\n    #               Actually, we need to track both the mutual pairs and the nodes used.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can use a different approach:\n\n    #   Let n_min be the smallest n such that T_n >= p. Then, we can use a greedy decomposition of p into triangular numbers, and then the total nodes would be the sum of the k's used in the decomposition. But note, the same node cannot be reused.\n\n    #   Actually, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of the triangular numbers in the decomposition of p does not require more than n nodes. \n\n    #   We can use a known result: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that T_n >= p. But from the example p=4, T_4=6>=4, but we needed n=5. So that is not true.\n\n    #   Another known result: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the maximum p achievable with n nodes (which is T_n) is at least p, but then we must be able to form p with n nodes. \n\n    #   We can use the following algorithm:\n\n    #   Let n = 1\n    #   while T_n < p:\n    #       n += 1\n\n    #   Then, we need to check if p can be formed with n nodes. But note, with n nodes, the maximum p is T_n, and the minimum is 0. However, not every value between 0 and T_n is achievable. \n\n    #   Example: p=4, n=4 (T_4=6). Can we form 4 with 4 nodes? \n    #       We need to decompose 4 into triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of k's being 4.\n    #       Possibilities: \n    #           Four components of size 1: 0.\n    #           Two components of size 1 and one of size 2: 0+0+1 = 1.\n    #           One component of size 1 and one of size 3: 0+3 = 3.\n    #           Two components of size 2: 1+1 = 2.\n    #           One component of size 4: 6 -> too big.\n    #       So 4 is not achievable with 4 nodes.\n\n    #   Therefore, we need to increase n until we can represent p.\n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming to precompute the minimal n for each p up to 200,000. However, p can be up to 200,000, and n might be up to around 900 (since T_900 ~ 405,000). We can do:\n\n    #   Let dp[i] = the minimal total nodes required to achieve exactly i mutual pairs.\n    #   We initialize dp[0] = 0, and for other i, dp[i] = infinity.\n\n    #   Then, for k from 2 upwards (component sizes), we update dp[i + T_k] = min(dp[i + T_k], k) for all i from 0 to p.\n\n    #   But note: T_k = k*(k-1)//2. The maximum k we need is the smallest k such that T_k > p_max (which is 200,000). k_max ~ 950 (since 950*949//2 = 447,000).\n\n    #   However, the state i goes up to 200,000, and k goes up to 950, so the complexity is O(p * k_max) which is about 200,000 * 950 ~ 190e6, which is acceptable in C++ but might be borderline in Python.\n\n    #   But note: p can be 0, then we don't need any components. Also, we are only asked for one p.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: iterate over component sizes and update a DP array for mutual pairs.\n\n    #   Steps for DP:\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       For k from 2 to k_max (until T_k <= p_max):\n    #           For s from p_max down to T_k:\n    #               dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #   Then, for a given p, the minimal n is dp[p] (if dp[p] is set). But note: we are allowed to use multiple components, and the order of components doesn't matter. \n\n    #   However, the problem asks for two things: the minimal n and then the maximum unidirectional pairs.\n\n    #   But note: the sample input includes p=0, p=3, p=4.\n\n    #   After reading the problem statement again, note that the graph must be p-reachable, meaning exactly p mutual pairs. So if p=0, then there are no mutual pairs, so each node is isolated. Then the minimal n is 1 (if p=0, then one node has no mutual pairs). But the sample output for p=0 is \"0 0\", however the sample input provided was ['3','4','0'] and the output was ['3 0','5 6','0 0']. Actually, the sample input was three separate test cases: p=3, p=4, p=0.\n\n    #   But the problem says: \"The first and only line contains a single integer p\", so we are solving for one p.\n\n    #   However, the sample output for p=0 is \"0 0\". But note: if there are 0 nodes, then there are no mutual pairs, so p=0 is satisfied. But the problem says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v\", so with 0 nodes, there are 0 such pairs. So minimal n=0.\n\n    #   So we must handle p=0 separately.\n\n    #   Given the complexity of the DP approach and the constraints (p up to 200,000), we need an efficient solution.\n\n    #   There is a mathematical insight: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of the first n natural numbers taken in a specific way equals p. But I recall that representing a number as a sum of triangular numbers is not straightforward.\n\n    #   Another approach: since the triangular numbers are convex, we can use a greedy algorithm to decompose p into a sum of triangular numbers, and then the total nodes would be the sum of the corresponding k's. However, we want the minimal total nodes.\n\n    #   We can use a BFS-like approach for small p, but p can be up to 200,000.\n\n    #   Let me reframe: We want to minimize the total nodes n = sum_i k_i, subject to sum_i T_{k_i} = p.\n\n    #   This is similar to the coin change problem where coins are triangular numbers, and we want to minimize the sum of the denominations (k_i) for a given amount p.\n\n    #   But note: the denomination here is T_k, and the cost is k. We want to minimize the total cost (nodes) to achieve exactly p.\n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming where dp[i] = minimal nodes to achieve i mutual pairs.\n\n    #   Steps:\n    #       Let dp[0] = 0\n    #       For i from 1 to p:\n    #           dp[i] = a large number\n    #       For k from 2 to k_max (while T_k <= p):\n    #           For s from T_k to p:\n    #               if dp[s - T_k] != large_number:\n    #                   dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #   Then, the minimal n is dp[p].\n\n    #   But note: the triangular numbers are not the usual coins; they are sparse. The maximum k we need is the smallest k such that T_k > p. For p=200,000, k_max = ceil((1+sqrt(1+8*p))/2) = ceil((1+sqrt(1600001))/2) ≈ ceil((1+1264.9)/2) ≈ 633.\n\n    #   Then the inner loop runs from T_k to p (which is 200,000) and k from 2 to 633. The total operations are about 633 * 200,000 = 126,600,000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be slow. However, we must optimize by iterating only over the necessary range.\n\n    #   But note: we are iterating for each k, and for each s from T_k to p. We can reverse the loops to use a 1D array and update in decreasing order to avoid reusing the same component multiple times? Actually, we are allowed to use multiple components of the same size, so it's an unlimited supply.\n\n    #   However, the problem states that the graph can have multiple SCCs, so components can be repeated.\n\n    #   But the above DP is for unlimited supply, so we can use the same component size multiple times.\n\n    #   But wait, the above nested loops (for k and then for s) will work for unlimited supply if we iterate s from high to low (to avoid using the same component multiple times in one iteration). Actually, no: the standard coin change problem for unlimited supply uses increasing order, but for minimizing the number of coins (or here the sum of k_i) we can use any order. However, we are allowed to use unlimited supply, so we can use the same component size multiple times.\n\n    #   But note: the minimal n might be achieved by using many small components. \n\n    #   However, the triangular numbers are not very dense, and the minimal n might be large.\n\n    #   But the problem also requires the maximum number of unidirectional pairs for the minimal n graph.\n\n    #   After computing minimal n (total nodes), how to compute the maximum unidirectional pairs?\n\n    #   In a graph with n nodes and p mutual pairs (from the SCC decomposition), the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). The mutual pairs (both ways) are counted once for each unordered pair {u,v} that is mutually reachable. The unidirectional pairs are the ones where only one direction exists.\n\n    #   The total directed edges in the graph is not fixed. However, to maximize unidirectional pairs, we should minimize the edges that are part of the mutual reachability (i.e., the SCCs) and maximize the edges in one direction between different SCCs.\n\n    #   In the condensation of the graph (which is a DAG), we can have edges from one SCC to another but not back. This ensures that there are no mutual reachabilities between different SCCs.\n\n    #   The number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) is the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) such that there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n    #   This includes:\n    #       - Edges within an SCC: but note, within an SCC, every pair is mutually reachable, so no unidirectional pairs within an SCC.\n    #       - Between two SCCs: if there is an edge from an SCC A to SCC B but not vice versa, then for every node u in A and v in B, the pair (u, v) is unidirectional.\n\n    #   However, the graph might have multiple edges and cycles in the condensation? Actually, the condensation is a DAG, so we cannot have cycles. But note: the mutual reachability condition only holds within an SCC. Between SCCs, we can have directed edges.\n\n    #   To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange the condensation as a complete DAG, i.e., a total order of the SCCs, and direct all edges from an earlier SCC to a later one. Then, for every ordered pair (u, v) where u is in an earlier SCC and v is in a later SCC, there is a path (via the condensation) but not vice versa.\n\n    #   The total number of unidirectional pairs is then the sum over all ordered pairs (A, B) of SCCs (A != B) of |A| * |B|, but only if there is an edge from A to B. In the complete DAG, we have edges from every A to every B with A < B (in the topological order). But note: the mutual reachability within an SCC is fixed (p), and the unidirectional pairs come entirely from between SCCs.\n\n    #   However, we must also consider the edges within the condensation. But note, the problem does not restrict the number of edges. To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should include every possible edge between different SCCs in the direction of the topological order.\n\n    #   Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|) where C_i and C_j are the sizes of the SCCs and the condensation has an edge from C_i to C_j if i < j.\n\n    #   But wait, what if the decomposition into SCCs is fixed (by the requirement to have exactly p mutual pairs)? Then the sizes of the SCCs are fixed (as the solution to the coin change problem). However, there might be multiple ways to decompose p into triangular numbers. We need the decomposition that maximizes the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|).\n\n    #   But note: the problem states that we are to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all p-reachable graphs with the minimal n. Therefore, we must consider all decompositions of p into triangular numbers (with the sum of the k's being n) and then choose the one that maximizes the between-component product sum.\n\n    #   However, the minimal n is fixed, and we have to decompose p into triangular numbers with exactly n nodes (i.e., the sum of the k's is n). \n\n    #   Let the decomposition be k1, k2, ..., km (each ki>=1, sum ki = n, and sum T_{ki} = p).\n\n    #   Then, the between-component product sum is: \n    #       S = (1/2) * [ (sum_{i} ki)^2 - sum_{i} ki^2 ] \n    #   But wait, the complete DAG between m components gives for each pair (i, j) with i != j, the product ki * kj. And the total is (sum ki)^2 - sum ki^2, then divided by 2? Actually, no: the sum_{i<j} ki*kj = ( (sum ki)^2 - sum ki^2 ) / 2.\n\n    #   But note: the condensation is a DAG, and we have a complete order, so yes, we count every pair (i, j) with i < j. And the total is indeed ( (sum ki)^2 - sum ki^2 ) / 2.\n\n    #   However, the sum ki = n (fixed). So the between-component product sum is (n^2 - sum ki^2) / 2.\n\n    #   Therefore, to maximize the between-component product sum, we need to minimize the sum of squares of the ki's.\n\n    #   Why? Because n is fixed, so minimizing the sum of squares maximizes (n^2 - sum ki^2).\n\n    #   So the problem reduces to: given n and p, decompose n into positive integers k1, k2, ..., km (with sum ki = n) such that sum T_{ki} = p, and among all such decompositions, minimize the sum of squares of the ki's.\n\n    #   But note: we also have the constraint that the sum of T_{ki} must be p.\n\n    #   However, we already fixed n as the minimal nodes. And the decomposition must satisfy the mutual pairs condition.\n\n    #   But wait, there might be multiple decompositions of p into triangular numbers with the same total nodes n. We need to choose the one with the smallest sum of squares of the component sizes.\n\n    #   Steps for the second part:\n\n    #       Let n_min = dp[p] (the minimal nodes found by the coin change style DP).\n    #       Then, we need to find all decompositions of p into triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of the k's being n_min, and then choose the decomposition that minimizes the sum of squares of the k's.\n\n    #   But note: the coin change DP only finds the minimal nodes, not the actual decomposition. We need to store the decomposition or at least the sum of squares.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can modify the DP to also keep track of the sum of squares. But the state space is p (up to 200,000) and the number of states might be too many.\n\n    #   Given the complexity, perhaps we need to reconsider.\n\n    #   Insight: The decomposition that minimizes the sum of squares for a fixed sum n is when the numbers are as equal as possible. But note: we have the additional constraint that the sum of T_{ki} = p.\n\n    #   However, we already know the minimal n. Now, we want to distribute the n nodes into components such that the sum of T_{ki} = p and the sum of ki^2 is minimized.\n\n    #   But note: T_k = k*(k-1)//2. We can write the constraint as: \n    #       sum_{i} (k_i*(k_i-1)//2) = p\n    #       => sum_{i} k_i^2 - sum_{i} k_i = 2p\n\n    #   And we know sum_{i} k_i = n.\n\n    #   So: sum_{i} k_i^2 = 2p + n.\n\n    #   Therefore, the sum of squares is fixed by p and n! \n\n    #   But wait, is that right? \n    #       Let m be the number of components. Then:\n    #           sum_{i} k_i = n\n    #           sum_{i} T_{k_i} = (sum_{i} k_i^2 - sum_{i} k_i) / 2 = p\n    #       => sum_{i} k_i^2 - n = 2p\n    #       => sum_{i} k_i^2 = 2p + n\n\n    #   So the sum of squares is uniquely determined by p and n. \n\n    #   Therefore, the between-component product sum is:\n    #       S = (n^2 - (2p + n)) / 2 = (n^2 - 2p - n) / 2\n\n    #   But wait, let me verify with the example p=3, n=3:\n    #       S = (3^2 - 2*3 - 3) / 2 = (9 - 6 - 3) / 2 = 0/2 = 0 -> matches the sample.\n\n    #   Example p=4, n=5:\n    #       S = (5^2 - 2*4 - 5) / 2 = (25 - 8 - 5) / 2 = 12/2 = 6 -> matches the sample.\n\n    #   Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n^2 - 2p - n) // 2.\n\n    #   However, note: this formula assumes that the decomposition exists. And indeed, the sum of squares is fixed by the mutual pairs and the total nodes.\n\n    #   But caution: is this always an integer? \n    #       n^2 - n - 2p must be even? \n    #       n^2 - n = n(n-1) is always even, and 2p is even, so their difference is even. So yes.\n\n    #   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n    #       Step 1: Handle p=0 separately: output \"0 0\".\n    #       Step 2: Use dynamic programming to find the minimal n such that p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) and the sum of the k's is n.\n    #       Step 3: If no n is found (shouldn't happen because p<=200000 and T_n for n~900 is huge), then we use the next available n.\n    #       Step 4: Compute the maximum unidirectional pairs as (n*n - 2*p - n) // 2.\n\n    #   However, the DP for Step 2 might be heavy. But note: p is up to 200,000, and the maximal component size k is about 900. We can do:\n\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       For k from 2 to k_max (until T_k > p):\n    #           For s from p down to T_k:\n    #               dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #   Then, n_min = dp[p]\n\n    #   But what if p=0? Then dp[0]=0, and n_min=0.\n\n    #   Let's test with p=3:\n    #       T_2=1, T_3=3.\n    #       dp[0]=0\n    #       For k=2: T_2=1, then for s=1: dp[1]=min(inf, dp[0]+2)=2.\n    #       Then for k=3: T_3=3, then for s=3: dp[3]=min(inf, dp[0]+3)=3.\n    #       So n_min=3.\n\n    #   p=4:\n    #       We need to achieve 4.\n    #       With k=2: dp[1]=2, then for k=2 again: dp[2]=min(inf, dp[0]+2) is not updated because we did k=2 first and then k=2 again? Actually, we are doing unlimited supply, so we should allow using the same component multiple times.\n\n    #       But our DP loop for k=2: updates s=1 to 2, then for k=2 again, we would update s=2 from dp[0]+2=2, then s=3 from dp[1]+2=4, then s=4 from dp[2]+2=4.\n    #       Then for k=3: updates s=3 from dp[0]+3=3, s=4 from dp[1]+3=5, s=5 from dp[2]+3=5, s=6 from dp[3]+3=6.\n    #       So the minimal n for p=4 is min(4 (from two components of size 2), 5 (from one component of size 3 and one of size 1, but wait: our dp does not allow size 1 because k starts from 2? \n\n    #   We forgot size 1: T_1=0. But including size 1 doesn't help because it adds 0 mutual pairs and uses 1 node. \n\n    #   But note: the mutual pairs condition is exactly p. Using a component of size 1 adds 0, so it doesn't change p. So to achieve p=4, we can use two components of size 2 (each giving 1) and one component of size 1 (0) -> total mutual pairs=2, which is not 4.\n\n    #   Actually, the components must be at least size 1, but a component of size 1 contributes 0. So to achieve p=4, we need components that sum to 4 in their T_k values.\n\n    #   Our DP only considers components of size>=2. But a component of size 1 is allowed and contributes 0. So we must include size 1.\n\n    #   However, including size 1 doesn't help in increasing p, so it only increases n. Therefore, to minimize n, we should not use any size 1 components. \n\n    #   But wait, sometimes you might need to use size 1 components to make the total nodes sum to n_min? No, because the minimal n is the sum of the k's. \n\n    #   Actually, the decomposition only includes components of size>=2 if we want to accumulate mutual pairs. But note: the mutual pairs are the sum of T_k for each component, and T_1=0.\n\n    #   We can modify the DP to include components of size 1. But then dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s] + 1) for any s? That would be useless because it doesn't change s.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can ignore components of size 1 because they don't contribute to p. \n\n    #   Therefore, we only need to consider components of size>=2.\n\n    #   But then, for p=4, the minimal n is 5 (two components of size 2 and one of size 1 is not minimal because we can do two components of size 2 and then the mutual pairs is 2, but wait, two components of size 2 give 1+1=2, not 4). \n\n    #   We must achieve exactly 4. So we need components whose T_k sum to 4. The available T_k (for k>=2) are 1, 3, 6, ... \n    #       4 = 1 + 3 -> two components: one of size 2 and one of size 3, total nodes = 2+3=5.\n\n    #   So the minimal n is 5.\n\n    #   Now, let's run the DP for p=4:\n\n    #       k=2: T_2=1 -> dp[1]=2\n    #       k=3: T_3=3 -> dp[3]=min(inf, dp[0]+3)=3, dp[4]=min(inf, dp[1]+3)=2+3=5\n    #       k=4: T_4=6 -> skip because 6>4.\n    #       So dp[4]=5.\n\n    #   This matches.\n\n    #   Therefore, we can do:\n\n    #       Precompute triangular numbers T_k = k*(k-1)//2 for k from 2 up to the smallest k such that T_k > p_max (200000).\n\n    #       Use a DP array of size p_max+1, initialize with a large number (or -1 for not reached).\n\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       For each k from 2 to k_max:\n    #           For s from p_max down to T_k:\n    #               if dp[s - T_k] != -1:\n    #                   dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #       Then for given p, n_min = dp[p]\n\n    #   Then, the maximum unidirectional pairs = (n_min*n_min - 2*p - n_min) // 2\n\n    #   But note: the formula relies on the fact that the sum of squares is 2p + n_min. This is derived from the mutual pairs equation. However, we must ensure that the decomposition exists and that the sum of squares is indeed 2p + n_min.\n\n    #   But the derivation holds: \n    #       Let the decomposition be k1, k2, ..., km. Then:\n    #           sum_{i} T_{k_i} = p\n    #           => (sum_{i} k_i^2 - sum_{i} k_i) / 2 = p\n    #           => sum_{i} k_i^2 = 2p + sum_{i} k_i = 2p + n_min\n\n    #   Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n    #   However, what if there are multiple decompositions with the same n_min but different sum of squares? The derivation shows that the sum of squares is fixed: 2p + n_min. Therefore, the between-component product sum is fixed.\n\n    #   Therefore, the answer for a given p is:\n    #       n_min = dp[p]   (minimal nodes)\n    #       unidirectional = (n_min*n_min - 2*p - n_min) // 2\n\n    #   But note: the sample input p=0: \n    #       We handled p=0 separately as \"0 0\". But our DP would try to compute for p=0: \n    #           dp[0]=0, so n_min=0.\n    #           unidirectional = (0 - 0 - 0)//2 = 0.\n    #       So we can handle p=0 in the same way.\n\n    #   However, the problem states that for p=0, the minimal n is 0. But note: with 0 nodes, there are no mutual pairs (p=0) and no unidirectional pairs. So output \"0 0\".\n\n    #   But the sample input example was given as three separate test cases: 3, 4, 0.\n\n    #   We'll implement the DP for p up to 200,000. The maximum k is about 900.\n\n    #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n    #   Edge: p=0 -> n_min=0, unidirectional=0.\n\n    #   But note: the DP initialization and loop.\n\n    #   However, the above DP does not consider using the same component type multiple times. We are iterating k from 2 to k_max and then updating s from high to low. This is the standard unbounded knapsack.\n\n    #   But wait, the coin change problem for unlimited supply: yes, we are allowed to use unlimited components of the same size.\n\n    #   But note: the minimal n might be achieved by using many small components. \n\n    #   Example: p=1 -> requires one component of size 2 (T_2=1). n_min=2.\n\n    #   Example: p=2 -> two components of size 2: T_2+T_2=2, n_min=4. \n    #       But can we do better? \n    #           Component of size 3: T_3=3 -> too big.\n    #           So n_min=4.\n\n    #   But wait, what if we use one component of size 2 and one component of size 1? Then mutual pairs=1, not 2.\n    #   Or two components of size 2: mutual pairs=1+1=2, nodes=4.\n\n    #   Example: p=5 -> \n    #       5 = 3 + 1 + 1 (but 1 is not allowed in our DP) -> so 3+1+1 is not considered.\n    #       5 = 3 + 1 (not allowed) or 1+1+3 (same) or 1+1+1+1+1 (not allowed) or 3+2 (T_3+T_2=3+1=4) -> not 5.\n    #       5 = 2+2+1 -> not allowed.\n    #       5 = 2+3 -> 1+3=4 -> not 5.\n    #       5 = 3+2 -> 3+1=4.\n    #       5 = 2+2+2 -> 1+1+1=3.\n    #       5 = 4 (T_4=6) -> too big.\n    #       5 = 3+2 -> 4, then add another 1 (not allowed) -> no solution? \n\n    #   Wait, p=5 cannot be represented? Then our DP would return a large number for p=5.\n\n    #   But note: p=5 can be represented by three components of size 2 and one component of size 1? No, because 1 is not allowed. \n    #   Or by one component of size 4 and one component of size 1: mutual pairs=6+0=6 -> too big.\n    #   Or by one component of size 3 and two components of size 1: 3+0+0=3.\n    #   Or by five components of size 2: 1+1+1+1+1=5. So n_min=10.\n\n    #   But wait, T_2=1, so five components of size 2: mutual pairs=5, nodes=10.\n\n    #   So the minimal n for p=5 is 10.\n\n    #   We must ensure our DP can handle that.\n\n    #   The DP for p=5:\n    #       k=2: T_2=1 -> dp[1]=2, dp[2]=4, dp[3]=6, dp[4]=8, dp[5]=10.\n    #       k=3: T_3=3 -> dp[3]=min(6, 0+3=3) -> 3, dp[4]=min(8, dp[1]+3=5) -> 5, dp[5]=min(10, dp[2]+3=7) -> 7.\n    #       k=4: T_4=6 -> dp[6]=min(inf, dp[0]+4=4) -> 4, dp[7]=min(inf, dp[1]+4=6) -> 6, dp[8]=min(inf, dp[2]+4=8) -> 8, dp[9]=min(inf, dp[3]+4=7) -> 7, dp[10]=min(10, dp[4]+4=9) -> 9.\n    #       So for p=5, dp[5]=7 (using two components: one of size 3 (3 nodes) and two of size 2 (2*2=4 nodes) -> total nodes=3+2+2=7).\n\n    #   But wait, mutual pairs: 3 (from size 3) + 1+1 (from two size 2) = 5.

Then we need to use a larger n? \n    #               # But the problem says p up to 200000, so theoretically it should be achievable.\n    #               # We can extend the DP to higher p? But p is given up to 200000.\n    #               # Actually, the maximal p we can achieve with n_min nodes is T_{n_min} (if one component) but we are decomposing arbitrarily.\n    #               # But note: our DP is for exactly p. If p is not achievable, then we must find the minimal n such that p is achievable. \n    #               # However, the problem states that p is between 0 and 200000, and we are to find the minimal n for that p.\n    #               # But the mutual pairs must be exactly p. If p is not achievable by any decomposition, then we cannot form the graph? \n    #               # Actually, the set of achievable p is all integers that are sums of triangular numbers (with repetitions) and the sum of the bases (k's) is the total nodes.\n    #               # But note: the triangular numbers include 0 (for k=1) and then 1,3,6,... So we can achieve any p>=0 by using sufficiently many components of size 2 (each adding 1). \n    #               # Therefore, every p is achievable. But our DP only considers components of size>=2, so we are missing the possibility of using size 1 components? \n    #               # However, using a size 1 component doesn't change p (adds 0) and only increases the node count. So to minimize n, we never use size 1 components. \n    #               # And with components of size>=2, we can achieve any p>=0 by using p components of size 2 (each adds 1) if p>=0. \n    #               # But wait, if p=0, then we don't need any component of size>=2, so n_min=0.\n    #               # For p>=1, we can always use p components of size 2, so n_min = 2*p.\n    #               # But is that minimal? Sometimes we can use fewer nodes by using larger components (which provide more mutual pairs per node). \n    #               # However, if p is not achievable by a combination of components with total nodes < 2*p, then the minimal n is 2*p.\n\n    #               # But our DP already found a way for p=5 with n_min=7 < 10 (which is 2*5). \n\n    #               # Therefore, if our DP returns a large number for p, it means we didn't find a decomposition with components of size>=2. But we know that by using p components of size 2, we can achieve p mutual pairs with n_min=2*p. \n\n    #               # So we can set n_min = 2*p if dp[p] is still 10**9.\n\n    #           Then, unidirectional = (n_min*n_min - 2*p - n_min) // 2\n\n    #   But note: the above formula for unidirectional pairs relies on the sum of squares being 2*p + n_min. This is derived from the mutual pairs equation. However, if we use p components of size 2, then:\n    #       mutual pairs = p * T_2 = p * 1 = p.\n    #       sum of squares = p * (2^2) = 4*p.\n    #       According to the formula: 2*p + n_min = 2*p + 2*p = 4*p -> matches.\n    #       And the between-component product sum = (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = ((2*p)^2 - 4*p) // 2 = (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   But wait, the between-component product sum is also computed by: (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2, which is (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   However, the graph with p components of size 2 (each is a complete graph of 2 nodes) and arranged in a complete DAG between them would have:\n    #       Within each component: no unidirectional pairs (because each component is a SCC of 2 nodes, and the mutual pairs are counted in p).\n    #       Between components: for each pair of components (i, j), there are 2*2=4 unidirectional pairs (since the condensation is complete). But wait, the complete DAG between m components means for each ordered pair (i, j) (i != j), there is an edge from i to j. But in our case, each component is two nodes. The unidirectional pairs between two components (say component i and component j) are: for each node in i and each node in j, the pair (node_i, node_j) is unidirectional. There are 2*2=4 such pairs per ordered pair (i, j) with i < j in the topological order.\n\n    #       Total between-component unidirectional pairs = (number of ordered pairs of components) * 4 = (m*(m-1)) * 4, where m = p (since we have p components).\n\n    #       But note: the between-component product sum we derived was (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #       And (p*(p-1)) * 4 = 4*p^2 - 4*p = 2*(2*p^2 - 2*p) -> not the same.\n\n    #   Let me recalc the between-component product sum properly:\n\n    #       The between-component product sum is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|) [if the condensation is complete]. But in our case, each component has size 2, so |C_i|=2 for all i. Then:\n    #           Sum_{i<j} 2*2 = 4 * (number of unordered pairs of components) = 4 * (C(m,2)) = 4 * (m*(m-1)//2) = 2*m*(m-1)\n\n    #       But note: the condensation is a DAG, and we count every ordered pair (i,j) with i->j. But in a complete DAG, the number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i->j and i<j is m*(m-1). And each such ordered pair contributes |C_i|*|C_j|. So total unidirectional pairs = sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|.\n\n    #       In our example, |C_i|=2 for all i, so total = 2 * (sum_{i<j} 2) = 4 * (number of ordered pairs) = 4 * (m*(m-1)).\n\n    #       But wait, the number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i<j is m*(m-1). And each ordered pair (i,j) contributes 2*2=4. So total = 4*m*(m-1).\n\n    #       Now, m = p (the number of components, each of size 2). So total = 4*p*(p-1).\n\n    #       But our formula from the sum of squares was: (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #       These two are not equal: \n    #           4*p*(p-1) vs 2*p^2 - 2*p = 2p(p-1)\n\n    #       Clearly, 4*p*(p-1) != 2*p*(p-1).\n\n    #   What went wrong in the derivation?\n\n    #   Revisit the derivation:\n\n    #       We said: the between-component product sum (for the complete DAG) is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|). This is correct.\n\n    #       And the total number of nodes n = sum_i |C_i| = 2*p.\n\n    #       And the sum of squares = sum_i |C_i|^2 = p * (2^2) = 4*p.\n\n    #       Then, the between-component product sum = (n^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = ( (2*p)^2 - 4*p ) // 2 = (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #       But the direct count is 4*p*(p-1).\n\n    #   They are not the same. \n\n    #   Let me expand 2*p^2 - 2*p = 2*p*(p-1). \n    #   And 4*p*(p-1) is four times larger.\n\n    #   Where did the factor of 4 come from in the direct count? \n\n    #   In the direct count, for each ordered pair (i,j) (i<j), we have |C_i| * |C_j| = 2 * 2 = 4. But note: the between-component product sum formula (n^2 - sum_of_squares)//2 is derived from the identity:\n\n    #       (sum_i |C_i|)^2 = sum_i |C_i|^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|\n\n    #       => n^2 = sum_of_squares + 2 * (between-component product sum)\n\n    #       => between-component product sum = (n^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2\n\n    #   So it should be (2*p)^2 - 4*p = 4*p^2 - 4*p, then divided by 2 is 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   But the direct count is 4 * p*(p-1) = 4*p^2 - 4*p, which is twice as much as 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   There is a factor of 2 discrepancy.\n\n    #   Let's test with p=1 (one component of size 2):\n    #       n=2, sum_of_squares=4.\n    #       between-component product sum = (2^2 - 4) // 2 = (4-4)//2 = 0.

Matches.\n\n    #   In the p=2 case, the direct count is 4, and the formula gives 4.\n\n    #   But in the p=5 case (using five components of size 2), the direct count would be: \n    #       number of ordered pairs of components = 5*4 = 20.\n    #       each ordered pair contributes 2*2=4, so total=80.\n    #       Formula: n=10, sum_of_squares=5*4=20, then (100-20)//2=80/2=40. \n    #       But wait, the formula gives 40, but the direct count is 80.\n\n    #   Now, the identity: \n    #       (sum_i |C_i|)^2 = sum_i |C_i|^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|\n    #       10^2 = 20 + 2 * (between-component product sum)\n    #       100 = 20 + 2*S  => 2*S=80 => S=40.\n\n    #   But the direct count is 80. \n\n    #   What is the between-component product sum? It is defined as the sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|. In the complete DAG, the between-component product sum is the sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|, and this is 40 in the p=5 case? \n\n    #   But direct count: for each ordered pair (i,j) with i<j, we have |C_i|*|C_j| = 4, and there are C(5,2)=10 unordered pairs, so the sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j| = 10 * 4 = 40.\n\n    #   And the total unidirectional pairs is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i|*|C_j|) (each term being the number of directed edges from i to j) = 40.\n\n    #   But why did I previously think it was 80? Because I counted ordered pairs and multiplied by 4? \n\n    #   Actually, the between-component product sum (for the complete DAG) is defined as the sum_{i<j} (|C_i|*|C_j|), not the sum_{i<j} (|C_i|*|C_j|)*2.\n\n    #   And the unidirectional pairs are exactly these: for each ordered pair (i,j) with i<j, there are |C_i|*|C_j| directed edges from i to j (assuming we put a complete bipartite graph from i to j). \n\n    #   Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is indeed the between-component product sum = (n^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2.\n\n    #   And the direct count for p=5 (five components) is 40, not 80.\n\n    #   So the formula is correct.\n\n    #   Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n    #       if p == 0:\n    #           print(\"0 0\")\n    #       else:\n    #           Use DP to find minimal n for p (if not found, use n = 2*p)\n    #           Then, unidirectional = (n*n - 2*p - n) // 2\n\n    #   However, note: the derivation of the sum of squares relies on the mutual pairs equation, and the mutual pairs are exactly p.

Correct.\n\n    #   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n    #       Precompute dp for p up to 200000.\n    #       Then for the given p, output (dp[p], (dp[p]*dp[p] - 2*p - dp[p])//2)\n\n    #   However, note: the minimal n might be large (up to around 2*p) and p is up to 200000, so n could be up to 400000, and the unidirectional pairs could be huge. But the problem constraints say p up to 200000, and we are to output the number.\n\n    #   We must be cautious for performance: the DP has a state size of 200000 and iterates over k from 2 to about 900, so the inner loop runs 200000 * 900 iterations, which is 180e6, acceptable in Pyton if optimized (using PyPy or fast Python might be needed, but 180e6 iterations is about a few seconds in C++ and maybe 10-20 seconds in Python). \n\n    #   But the problem says p up to 200000, and we are doing a double loop: outer loop 900, inner loop 200000 -> 900*200000=180e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in many online judges if implemented in C++ but in Python might be borderline in speed.\n\n    #   We can optimize by breaking early if T_k > p.\n\n    #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n    #   Special note: p=0.\n\n    #   Let's write the code.\n\n    #   IMPORTANT: We must use a large number for initialization, but 10**9 might be too small if the minimal n is large (like 400000). We can use a large number like 10**18, but then memory for dp array might be an issue.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can use a list of zeros and then update, but we need to know the minimal nodes.\n\n    #   But note: the minimal nodes for p=200000 might be around 630 (since T_630 = 630*629//2 = 195, 630*629//2 = 195, let me compute: 630*629//2 = 201, 630*629=396, 396/2=198, so T_630=198,000). Then to achieve 200000, we might need to use one component of size 630 (198,000) and then some smaller ones to add 2000 more.

Then we must use n=5: T_5=10>=4.\n    #       Now, with n=5, we can decompose into components: \n    #           Option: one component of size 3 (3) and two components of size 1 (0): total 3.\n    #           Option: two components of size 2 (each gives 1): total 2.\n    #           Option: one component of size 2 (1) and three components of size 1 (0): total 1.\n    #       Still not 4. \n    #       Alternatively, we can use a component of size 4 (6) and then we have one node left, but then we cannot use the node without creating an extra mutual pair? Actually, we can have multiple components. The mutual pairs are only within components. So if we have a component of size 4 (which gives 6) and a component of size 1, then total mutual pairs is 6+0=6, which is too much.\n\n    #       How to get 4? \n    #         We can have two components: one of size 3 (3) and one of size 2 (1). Then total mutual pairs = 3 + 1 = 4. And total nodes = 3+2 = 5.\n\n    #       So the minimal n for p=4 is 5.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimal n is not simply the smallest n such that T_n >= p. We need to check if p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of k's being n.\n\n    # Algorithm for minimal n:\n    #   Start with n = 0, and let current_p = 0.\n    #   Then, while current_p < p:\n    #       Consider adding a new node. When we add a node, we can either put it in an existing component (increasing its size) or form a new component (of size 1).\n    #       - If we form a new component (size 1), then the mutual pairs added is T_1 = 0.\n    #       - If we add to an existing component of size k, then the mutual pairs added is T_{k+1} - T_k = k.\n    #       We want to minimize the total nodes, so we choose the operation that adds the most mutual pairs per node? Actually, we want to reach exactly p with minimal nodes.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can iterate over possible n starting from 1 until we find the minimal n such that the maximum p achievable with n nodes (which is T_n) is at least p, and then check if we can form p with n nodes.\n\n    #   But note: the maximum p with n nodes is T_n (when the entire graph is one SCC). The minimum p with n nodes is 0 (when there are no mutual pairs, i.e., all nodes are isolated). However, we can achieve any p between 0 and T_n by appropriately splitting the nodes into SCCs. \n\n    #   Why? Because if we have n nodes, we can split them into components of sizes k1, k2, ..., km (summing to n) and the total mutual pairs is the sum of T_{ki}. Since T_k is the triangular number, and we can choose any partition, the set of achievable p values is all integers that can be written as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k <= T_n) with the sum of the bases (ki) being <= n. \n\n    #   However, note: the sum of the bases is exactly n because we are using all nodes. And the triangular numbers are additive. \n\n    #   But the triangular numbers are not arbitrary: they are fixed for each base. However, since we can use multiple components, we can achieve any p between 0 and T_n as long as p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) with the condition that the sum of the k's is n. \n\n    #   Actually, the problem is known in mathematics: representing a number p as a sum of triangular numbers (with repetition allowed) and minimizing the total \"base\" (the sum of the k's) is equivalent to minimizing the total nodes. \n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming to find the minimal n for a given p. However, p can be up to 200,000, so we need an efficient method.\n\n    #   Observation: The triangular numbers grow quadratically. We can use a greedy approach:\n\n    #   Let n_min = ceil((1 + sqrt(1+8*p))/2) ? Not exactly, because p might not be a triangular number.\n\n    #   Actually, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that there exists a decomposition of p into triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of the k's being n.\n\n    #   But note: we are allowed to use any triangular numbers (any k>=1). The triangular numbers are T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=3, T_4=6, etc.\n\n    #   We can use a two-step process:\n\n    #   Step 1: Find the minimal n such that T_n >= p. This gives us an upper bound on n.\n\n    #   Step 2: Check if p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of the k's being n. \n\n    #   However, we want the minimal n. We can iterate n from 1 upwards until we find an n such that p can be written as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) and the sum of the k's is n.\n\n    #   But how to check for a given n if p can be represented? \n\n    #   Note: Each triangular number T_k is non-negative. The maximum p we can get with n nodes is T_n. The minimum is 0. \n\n    #   We need to find a multiset of k's (each k>=1) such that:\n    #       sum_{i} k_i = n\n    #       sum_{i} T_{k_i} = p\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can think: we are going to assign each node to a component. The contribution of a component of size k is T_k. The total contribution is p. The total nodes is the sum of the sizes.\n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming where dp[i] = the minimal number of nodes needed to achieve exactly i mutual pairs. But i can be up to 200,000, and n can be up to around 900 (since T_900 ~ 400,000).\n\n    #   However, the constraints say p up to 200,000. We can use a greedy method:\n\n    #   We know that the triangular numbers are increasing. We can use the largest triangular numbers first to minimize the total nodes.\n\n    #   Steps for checking a given n:\n    #       Let x = p.\n    #       For k from floor((sqrt(8*x+1)+1)/2) down to 2:\n    #           while x >= T_k and (the remaining nodes after using a component of size k doesn't exceed n - k) and (the total mutual pairs from the remaining components doesn't exceed p - T_k):\n    #               Actually, we need to track both the mutual pairs and the nodes used.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can use a different approach:\n\n    #   Let n_min be the smallest n such that T_n >= p. Then, we can use a greedy decomposition of p into triangular numbers, and then the total nodes would be the sum of the k's used in the decomposition. But note, the same node cannot be reused.\n\n    #   Actually, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of the triangular numbers in the decomposition of p does not require more than n nodes. \n\n    #   We can use a known result: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that T_n >= p. But from the example p=4, T_4=6>=4, but we needed n=5. So that is not true.\n\n    #   Another known result: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the maximum p achievable with n nodes (which is T_n) is at least p, but then we must be able to form p with n nodes. \n\n    #   We can use the following algorithm:\n\n    #   Let n = 1\n    #   while T_n < p:\n    #       n += 1\n\n    #   Then, we need to check if p can be formed with n nodes. But note, with n nodes, the maximum p is T_n, and the minimum is 0. However, not every value between 0 and T_n is achievable. \n\n    #   Example: p=4, n=4 (T_4=6). Can we form 4 with 4 nodes? \n    #       We need to decompose 4 into triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of k's being 4.\n    #       Possibilities: \n    #           Four components of size 1: 0.\n    #           Two components of size 1 and one of size 2: 0+0+1 = 1.\n    #           One component of size 1 and one of size 3: 0+3 = 3.\n    #           Two components of size 2: 1+1 = 2.\n    #           One component of size 4: 6 -> too big.\n    #       So 4 is not achievable with 4 nodes.\n\n    #   Therefore, we need to increase n until we can represent p.\n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming to precompute the minimal n for each p up to 200,000. However, p can be up to 200,000, and n might be up to around 900 (since T_900 ~ 405,000). We can do:\n\n    #   Let dp[i] = the minimal total nodes required to achieve exactly i mutual pairs.\n    #   We initialize dp[0] = 0, and for other i, dp[i] = infinity.\n\n    #   Then, for k from 2 upwards (component sizes), we update dp[i + T_k] = min(dp[i + T_k], k) for all i from 0 to p.\n\n    #   But note: T_k = k*(k-1)//2. The maximum k we need is the smallest k such that T_k > p_max (which is 200,000). k_max ~ 950 (since 950*949//2 = 447,000).\n\n    #   However, the state i goes up to 200,000, and k goes up to 950, so the complexity is O(p * k_max) which is about 200,000 * 950 ~ 190e6, which is acceptable in C++ but might be borderline in Python.\n\n    #   But note: p can be 0, then we don't need any components. Also, we are only asked for one p.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: iterate over component sizes and update a DP array for mutual pairs.\n\n    #   Steps for DP:\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       For k from 2 to k_max (until T_k <= p_max):\n    #           For s from p_max down to T_k:\n    #               dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #   Then, for a given p, the minimal n is dp[p] (if dp[p] is set). But note: we are allowed to use multiple components, and the order of components doesn't matter. \n\n    #   However, the problem asks for two things: the minimal n and then the maximum unidirectional pairs.\n\n    #   But note: the sample input includes p=0, p=3, p=4.\n\n    #   After reading the problem statement again, note that the graph must be p-reachable, meaning exactly p mutual pairs. So if p=0, then there are no mutual pairs, so each node is isolated. Then the minimal n is 1 (if p=0, then one node has no mutual pairs). But the sample output for p=0 is \"0 0\", however the sample input provided was ['3','4','0'] and the output was ['3 0','5 6','0 0']. Actually, the sample input was three separate test cases: p=3, p=4, p=0.\n\n    #   But the problem says: \"The first and only line contains a single integer p\", so we are solving for one p.\n\n    #   However, the sample output for p=0 is \"0 0\". But note: if there are 0 nodes, then there are no mutual pairs, so p=0 is satisfied. But the problem says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v\", so with 0 nodes, there are 0 such pairs. So minimal n=0.\n\n    #   So we must handle p=0 separately.\n\n    #   Given the complexity of the DP approach and the constraints (p up to 200,000), we need an efficient solution.\n\n    #   There is a mathematical insight: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of the first n natural numbers taken in a specific way equals p. But I recall that representing a number as a sum of triangular numbers is not straightforward.\n\n    #   Another approach: since the triangular numbers are convex, we can use a greedy algorithm to decompose p into a sum of triangular numbers, and then the total nodes would be the sum of the corresponding k's. However, we want the minimal total nodes.\n\n    #   We can use a BFS-like approach for small p, but p can be up to 200,000.\n\n    #   Let me reframe: We want to minimize the total nodes n = sum_i k_i, subject to sum_i T_{k_i} = p.\n\n    #   This is similar to the coin change problem where coins are triangular numbers, and we want to minimize the sum of the denominations (k_i) for a given amount p.\n\n    #   But note: the denomination here is T_k, and the cost is k. We want to minimize the total cost (nodes) to achieve exactly p.\n\n    #   We can use dynamic programming where dp[i] = minimal nodes to achieve i mutual pairs.\n\n    #   Steps:\n    #       Let dp[0] = 0\n    #       For i from 1 to p:\n    #           dp[i] = a large number\n    #       For k from 2 to k_max (while T_k <= p):\n    #           For s from T_k to p:\n    #               if dp[s - T_k] != large_number:\n    #                   dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #   Then, the minimal n is dp[p].\n\n    #   But note: the triangular numbers are not the usual coins; they are sparse. The maximum k we need is the smallest k such that T_k > p. For p=200,000, k_max = ceil((1+sqrt(1+8*p))/2) = ceil((1+sqrt(1600001))/2) ≈ ceil((1+1264.9)/2) ≈ 633.\n\n    #   Then the inner loop runs from T_k to p (which is 200,000) and k from 2 to 633. The total operations are about 633 * 200,000 = 126,600,000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be slow. However, we must optimize by iterating only over the necessary range.\n\n    #   But note: we are iterating for each k, and for each s from T_k to p. We can reverse the loops to use a 1D array and update in decreasing order to avoid reusing the same component multiple times? Actually, we are allowed to use multiple components of the same size, so it's an unlimited supply.\n\n    #   However, the problem states that the graph can have multiple SCCs, so components can be repeated.\n\n    #   But the above DP is for unlimited supply, so we can use the same component size multiple times.\n\n    #   But wait, the above nested loops (for k and then for s) will work for unlimited supply if we iterate s from high to low (to avoid using the same component multiple times in one iteration). Actually, no: the standard coin change problem for unlimited supply uses increasing order, but for minimizing the number of coins (or here the sum of k_i) we can use any order. However, we are allowed to use unlimited supply, so we can use the same component size multiple times.\n\n    #   But note: the minimal n might be achieved by using many small components. \n\n    #   However, the triangular numbers are not very dense, and the minimal n might be large.\n\n    #   But the problem also requires the maximum number of unidirectional pairs for the minimal n graph.\n\n    #   After computing minimal n (total nodes), how to compute the maximum unidirectional pairs?\n\n    #   In a graph with n nodes and p mutual pairs (from the SCC decomposition), the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). The mutual pairs (both ways) are counted once for each unordered pair {u,v} that is mutually reachable. The unidirectional pairs are the ones where only one direction exists.\n\n    #   The total directed edges in the graph is not fixed. However, to maximize unidirectional pairs, we should minimize the edges that are part of the mutual reachability (i.e., the SCCs) and maximize the edges in one direction between different SCCs.\n\n    #   In the condensation of the graph (which is a DAG), we can have edges from one SCC to another but not back. This ensures that there are no mutual reachabilities between different SCCs.\n\n    #   The number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) is the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) such that there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n    #   This includes:\n    #       - Edges within an SCC: but note, within an SCC, every pair is mutually reachable, so no unidirectional pairs within an SCC.\n    #       - Between two SCCs: if there is an edge from an SCC A to SCC B but not vice versa, then for every node u in A and v in B, the pair (u, v) is unidirectional.\n\n    #   However, the graph might have multiple edges and cycles in the condensation? Actually, the condensation is a DAG, so we cannot have cycles. But note: the mutual reachability condition only holds within an SCC. Between SCCs, we can have directed edges.\n\n    #   To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange the condensation as a complete DAG, i.e., a total order of the SCCs, and direct all edges from an earlier SCC to a later one. Then, for every ordered pair (u, v) where u is in an earlier SCC and v is in a later SCC, there is a path (via the condensation) but not vice versa.\n\n    #   The total number of unidirectional pairs is then the sum over all ordered pairs (A, B) of SCCs (A != B) of |A| * |B|, but only if there is an edge from A to B. In the complete DAG, we have edges from every A to every B with A < B (in the topological order). But note: the mutual reachability within an SCC is fixed (p), and the unidirectional pairs come entirely from between SCCs.\n\n    #   However, we must also consider the edges within the condensation. But note, the problem does not restrict the number of edges. To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should include every possible edge between different SCCs in the direction of the topological order.\n\n    #   Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|) where C_i and C_j are the sizes of the SCCs and the condensation has an edge from C_i to C_j if i < j.\n\n    #   But wait, what if the decomposition into SCCs is fixed (by the requirement to have exactly p mutual pairs)? Then the sizes of the SCCs are fixed (as the solution to the coin change problem). However, there might be multiple ways to decompose p into triangular numbers. We need the decomposition that maximizes the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|).\n\n    #   But note: the problem states that we are to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all p-reachable graphs with the minimal n. Therefore, we must consider all decompositions of p into triangular numbers (with the sum of the k's being n) and then choose the one that maximizes the between-component product sum.\n\n    #   However, the minimal n is fixed, and we have to decompose p into triangular numbers with exactly n nodes (i.e., the sum of the k's is n). \n\n    #   Let the decomposition be k1, k2, ..., km (each ki>=1, sum ki = n, and sum T_{ki} = p).\n\n    #   Then, the between-component product sum is: \n    #       S = (1/2) * [ (sum_{i} ki)^2 - sum_{i} ki^2 ] \n    #   But wait, the complete DAG between m components gives for each pair (i, j) with i != j, the product ki * kj. And the total is (sum ki)^2 - sum ki^2, then divided by 2? Actually, no: the sum_{i<j} ki*kj = ( (sum ki)^2 - sum ki^2 ) / 2.\n\n    #   But note: the condensation is a DAG, and we have a complete order, so yes, we count every pair (i, j) with i < j. And the total is indeed ( (sum ki)^2 - sum ki^2 ) / 2.\n\n    #   However, the sum ki = n (fixed). So the between-component product sum is (n^2 - sum ki^2) / 2.\n\n    #   Therefore, to maximize the between-component product sum, we need to minimize the sum of squares of the ki's.\n\n    #   Why? Because n is fixed, so minimizing the sum of squares maximizes (n^2 - sum ki^2).\n\n    #   So the problem reduces to: given n and p, decompose n into positive integers k1, k2, ..., km (with sum ki = n) such that sum T_{ki} = p, and among all such decompositions, minimize the sum of squares of the ki's.\n\n    #   But note: we also have the constraint that the sum of T_{ki} must be p.\n\n    #   However, we already fixed n as the minimal nodes. And the decomposition must satisfy the mutual pairs condition.\n\n    #   But wait, there might be multiple decompositions of p into triangular numbers with the same total nodes n. We need to choose the one with the smallest sum of squares of the component sizes.\n\n    #   Steps for the second part:\n\n    #       Let n_min = dp[p] (the minimal nodes found by the coin change style DP).\n    #       Then, we need to find all decompositions of p into triangular numbers (each T_k) with the sum of the k's being n_min, and then choose the decomposition that minimizes the sum of squares of the k's.\n\n    #   But note: the coin change DP only finds the minimal nodes, not the actual decomposition. We need to store the decomposition or at least the sum of squares.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can modify the DP to also keep track of the sum of squares. But the state space is p (up to 200,000) and the number of states might be too many.\n\n    #   Given the complexity, perhaps we need to reconsider.\n\n    #   Insight: The decomposition that minimizes the sum of squares for a fixed sum n is when the numbers are as equal as possible. But note: we have the additional constraint that the sum of T_{ki} = p.\n\n    #   However, we already know the minimal n. Now, we want to distribute the n nodes into components such that the sum of T_{ki} = p and the sum of ki^2 is minimized.\n\n    #   But note: T_k = k*(k-1)//2. We can write the constraint as: \n    #       sum_{i} (k_i*(k_i-1)//2) = p\n    #       => sum_{i} k_i^2 - sum_{i} k_i = 2p\n\n    #   And we know sum_{i} k_i = n.\n\n    #   So: sum_{i} k_i^2 = 2p + n.\n\n    #   Therefore, the sum of squares is fixed by p and n! \n\n    #   But wait, is that right? \n    #       Let m be the number of components. Then:\n    #           sum_{i} k_i = n\n    #           sum_{i} T_{k_i} = (sum_{i} k_i^2 - sum_{i} k_i) / 2 = p\n    #       => sum_{i} k_i^2 - n = 2p\n    #       => sum_{i} k_i^2 = 2p + n\n\n    #   So the sum of squares is uniquely determined by p and n. \n\n    #   Therefore, the between-component product sum is:\n    #       S = (n^2 - (2p + n)) / 2 = (n^2 - 2p - n) / 2\n\n    #   But wait, let me verify with the example p=3, n=3:\n    #       S = (3^2 - 2*3 - 3) / 2 = (9 - 6 - 3) / 2 = 0/2 = 0 -> matches the sample.\n\n    #   Example p=4, n=5:\n    #       S = (5^2 - 2*4 - 5) / 2 = (25 - 8 - 5) / 2 = 12/2 = 6 -> matches the sample.\n\n    #   Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n^2 - 2p - n) // 2.\n\n    #   However, note: this formula assumes that the decomposition exists. And indeed, the sum of squares is fixed by the mutual pairs and the total nodes.\n\n    #   But caution: is this always an integer? \n    #       n^2 - n - 2p must be even? \n    #       n^2 - n = n(n-1) is always even, and 2p is even, so their difference is even. So yes.\n\n    #   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n    #       Step 1: Handle p=0 separately: output \"0 0\".\n    #       Step 2: Use dynamic programming to find the minimal n such that p can be represented as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k) and the sum of the k's is n.\n    #       Step 3: If no n is found (shouldn't happen because p<=200000 and T_n for n~900 is huge), then we use the next available n.\n    #       Step 4: Compute the maximum unidirectional pairs as (n*n - 2*p - n) // 2.\n\n    #   However, the DP for Step 2 might be heavy. But note: p is up to 200,000, and the maximal component size k is about 900. We can do:\n\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       For k from 2 to k_max (until T_k > p):\n    #           For s from p down to T_k:\n    #               dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #   Then, n_min = dp[p]\n\n    #   But what if p=0? Then dp[0]=0, and n_min=0.\n\n    #   Let's test with p=3:\n    #       T_2=1, T_3=3.\n    #       dp[0]=0\n    #       For k=2: T_2=1, then for s=1: dp[1]=min(inf, dp[0]+2)=2.\n    #       Then for k=3: T_3=3, then for s=3: dp[3]=min(inf, dp[0]+3)=3.\n    #       So n_min=3.\n\n    #   p=4:\n    #       We need to achieve 4.\n    #       With k=2: dp[1]=2, then for k=2 again: dp[2]=min(inf, dp[0]+2) is not updated because we did k=2 first and then k=2 again? Actually, we are doing unlimited supply, so we should allow using the same component multiple times.\n\n    #       But our DP loop for k=2: updates s=1 to 2, then for k=2 again, we would update s=2 from dp[0]+2=2, then s=3 from dp[1]+2=4, then s=4 from dp[2]+2=4.\n    #       Then for k=3: updates s=3 from dp[0]+3=3, s=4 from dp[1]+3=5, s=5 from dp[2]+3=5, s=6 from dp[3]+3=6.\n    #       So the minimal n for p=4 is min(4 (from two components of size 2), 5 (from one component of size 3 and one of size 1, but wait: our dp does not allow size 1 because k starts from 2? \n\n    #   We forgot size 1: T_1=0. But including size 1 doesn't help because it adds 0 mutual pairs and uses 1 node. \n\n    #   But note: the mutual pairs condition is exactly p. Using a component of size 1 adds 0, so it doesn't change p. So to achieve p=4, we can use two components of size 2 (each giving 1) and one component of size 1 (0) -> total mutual pairs=2, which is not 4.\n\n    #   Actually, the components must be at least size 1, but a component of size 1 contributes 0. So to achieve p=4, we need components that sum to 4 in their T_k values.\n\n    #   Our DP only considers components of size>=2. But a component of size 1 is allowed and contributes 0. So we must include size 1.\n\n    #   However, including size 1 doesn't help in increasing p, so it only increases n. Therefore, to minimize n, we should not use any size 1 components. \n\n    #   But wait, sometimes you might need to use size 1 components to make the total nodes sum to n_min? No, because the minimal n is the sum of the k's. \n\n    #   Actually, the decomposition only includes components of size>=2 if we want to accumulate mutual pairs. But note: the mutual pairs are the sum of T_k for each component, and T_1=0.\n\n    #   We can modify the DP to include components of size 1. But then dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s] + 1) for any s? That would be useless because it doesn't change s.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can ignore components of size 1 because they don't contribute to p. \n\n    #   Therefore, we only need to consider components of size>=2.\n\n    #   But then, for p=4, the minimal n is 5 (two components of size 2 and one of size 1 is not minimal because we can do two components of size 2 and then the mutual pairs is 2, but wait, two components of size 2 give 1+1=2, not 4). \n\n    #   We must achieve exactly 4. So we need components whose T_k sum to 4. The available T_k (for k>=2) are 1, 3, 6, ... \n    #       4 = 1 + 3 -> two components: one of size 2 and one of size 3, total nodes = 2+3=5.\n\n    #   So the minimal n is 5.\n\n    #   Now, let's run the DP for p=4:\n\n    #       k=2: T_2=1 -> dp[1]=2\n    #       k=3: T_3=3 -> dp[3]=min(inf, dp[0]+3)=3, dp[4]=min(inf, dp[1]+3)=2+3=5\n    #       k=4: T_4=6 -> skip because 6>4.\n    #       So dp[4]=5.\n\n    #   This matches.\n\n    #   Therefore, we can do:\n\n    #       Precompute triangular numbers T_k = k*(k-1)//2 for k from 2 up to the smallest k such that T_k > p_max (200000).\n\n    #       Use a DP array of size p_max+1, initialize with a large number (or -1 for not reached).\n\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       For each k from 2 to k_max:\n    #           For s from p_max down to T_k:\n    #               if dp[s - T_k] != -1:\n    #                   dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #       Then for given p, n_min = dp[p]\n\n    #   Then, the maximum unidirectional pairs = (n_min*n_min - 2*p - n_min) // 2\n\n    #   But note: the formula relies on the fact that the sum of squares is 2p + n_min. This is derived from the mutual pairs equation. However, we must ensure that the decomposition exists and that the sum of squares is indeed 2p + n_min.\n\n    #   But the derivation holds: \n    #       Let the decomposition be k1, k2, ..., km. Then:\n    #           sum_{i} T_{k_i} = p\n    #           => (sum_{i} k_i^2 - sum_{i} k_i) / 2 = p\n    #           => sum_{i} k_i^2 = 2p + sum_{i} k_i = 2p + n_min\n\n    #   Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n    #   However, what if there are multiple decompositions with the same n_min but different sum of squares? The derivation shows that the sum of squares is fixed: 2p + n_min. Therefore, the between-component product sum is fixed.\n\n    #   Therefore, the answer for a given p is:\n    #       n_min = dp[p]   (minimal nodes)\n    #       unidirectional = (n_min*n_min - 2*p - n_min) // 2\n\n    #   But note: the sample input p=0: \n    #       We handled p=0 separately as \"0 0\". But our DP would try to compute for p=0: \n    #           dp[0]=0, so n_min=0.\n    #           unidirectional = (0 - 0 - 0)//2 = 0.\n    #       So we can handle p=0 in the same way.\n\n    #   However, the problem states that for p=0, the minimal n is 0. But note: with 0 nodes, there are no mutual pairs (p=0) and no unidirectional pairs. So output \"0 0\".\n\n    #   But the sample input example was given as three separate test cases: 3, 4, 0.\n\n    #   We'll implement the DP for p up to 200,000. The maximum k is about 900.\n\n    #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n    #   Edge: p=0 -> n_min=0, unidirectional=0.\n\n    #   But note: the DP initialization and loop.\n\n    #   However, the above DP does not consider using the same component type multiple times. We are iterating k from 2 to k_max and then updating s from high to low. This is the standard unbounded knapsack.\n\n    #   But wait, the coin change problem for unlimited supply: yes, we are allowed to use unlimited components of the same size.\n\n    #   But note: the minimal n might be achieved by using many small components. \n\n    #   Example: p=1 -> requires one component of size 2 (T_2=1). n_min=2.\n\n    #   Example: p=2 -> two components of size 2: T_2+T_2=2, n_min=4. \n    #       But can we do better? \n    #           Component of size 3: T_3=3 -> too big.\n    #           So n_min=4.\n\n    #   But wait, what if we use one component of size 2 and one component of size 1? Then mutual pairs=1, not 2.\n    #   Or two components of size 2: mutual pairs=1+1=2, nodes=4.\n\n    #   Example: p=5 -> \n    #       5 = 3 + 1 + 1 (but 1 is not allowed in our DP) -> so 3+1+1 is not considered.\n    #       5 = 3 + 1 (not allowed) or 1+1+3 (same) or 1+1+1+1+1 (not allowed) or 3+2 (T_3+T_2=3+1=4) -> not 5.\n    #       5 = 2+2+1 -> not allowed.\n    #       5 = 2+3 -> 1+3=4 -> not 5.\n    #       5 = 3+2 -> 3+1=4.\n    #       5 = 2+2+2 -> 1+1+1=3.\n    #       5 = 4 (T_4=6) -> too big.\n    #       5 = 3+2 -> 4, then add another 1 (not allowed) -> no solution? \n\n    #   Wait, p=5 cannot be represented? Then our DP would return a large number for p=5.\n\n    #   But note: p=5 can be represented by three components of size 2 and one component of size 1? No, because 1 is not allowed. \n    #   Or by one component of size 4 and one component of size 1: mutual pairs=6+0=6 -> too big.\n    #   Or by one component of size 3 and two components of size 1: 3+0+0=3.\n    #   Or by five components of size 2: 1+1+1+1+1=5. So n_min=10.\n\n    #   But wait, T_2=1, so five components of size 2: mutual pairs=5, nodes=10.\n\n    #   So the minimal n for p=5 is 10.\n\n    #   We must ensure our DP can handle that.\n\n    #   The DP for p=5:\n    #       k=2: T_2=1 -> dp[1]=2, dp[2]=4, dp[3]=6, dp[4]=8, dp[5]=10.\n    #       k=3: T_3=3 -> dp[3]=min(6, 0+3=3) -> 3, dp[4]=min(8, dp[1]+3=5) -> 5, dp[5]=min(10, dp[2]+3=7) -> 7.\n    #       k=4: T_4=6 -> dp[6]=min(inf, dp[0]+4=4) -> 4, dp[7]=min(inf, dp[1]+4=6) -> 6, dp[8]=min(inf, dp[2]+4=8) -> 8, dp[9]=min(inf, dp[3]+4=7) -> 7, dp[10]=min(10, dp[4]+4=9) -> 9.\n    #       So for p=5, dp[5]=7 (using two components: one of size 3 (3 nodes) and two of size 2 (2*2=4 nodes) -> total nodes=3+2+2=7).\n\n    #   But wait, mutual pairs: 3 (from size 3) + 1+1 (from two size 2) = 5. Yes, and nodes=7.\n\n    #   So the minimal n is 7.\n\n    #   Therefore, our DP works.\n\n    #   Implementation:\n\n    #       Let p_max = 200000\n    #       k_max = 1\n    #       while T_{k_max} <= p_max:\n    #           k_max += 1\n    #       k_max -= 1  # now T_{k_max} > p_max\n\n    #       dp = [10**9] * (p_max+1)\n    #       dp[0] = 0\n    #       for k in range(2, k_max+1):\n    #           T_k = k*(k-1)//2\n    #           if T_k > p_max:\n    #               break\n    #           for s in range(p_max, T_k-1, -1):\n    #               if dp[s - T_k] != 10**9:\n    #                   dp[s] = min(dp[s], dp[s - T_k] + k)\n\n    #       Then for given p, if p==0: print(\"0 0\")\n    #       else:\n    #           n_min = dp[p]\n    #           if n_min == 10**9:\n    #               # Cannot be achieved? Then we need to use a larger n? \n    #               # But the problem says p up to 200000, so theoretically it should be achievable.\n    #               # We can extend the DP to higher p? But p is given up to 200000.\n    #               # Actually, the maximal p we can achieve with n_min nodes is T_{n_min} (if one component) but we are decomposing arbitrarily.\n    #               # But note: our DP is for exactly p. If p is not achievable, then we must find the minimal n such that p is achievable. \n    #               # However, the problem states that p is between 0 and 200000, and we are to find the minimal n for that p.\n    #               # But the mutual pairs must be exactly p. If p is not achievable by any decomposition, then we cannot form the graph? \n    #               # Actually, the set of achievable p is all integers that are sums of triangular numbers (with repetitions) and the sum of the bases (k's) is the total nodes.\n    #               # But note: the triangular numbers include 0 (for k=1) and then 1,3,6,... So we can achieve any p>=0 by using sufficiently many components of size 2 (each adding 1). \n    #               # Therefore, every p is achievable. But our DP only considers components of size>=2, so we are missing the possibility of using size 1 components? \n    #               # However, using a size 1 component doesn't change p (adds 0) and only increases the node count. So to minimize n, we never use size 1 components. \n    #               # And with components of size>=2, we can achieve any p>=0 by using p components of size 2 (each adds 1) if p>=0. \n    #               # But wait, if p=0, then we don't need any component of size>=2, so n_min=0.\n    #               # For p>=1, we can always use p components of size 2, so n_min = 2*p.\n    #               # But is that minimal? Sometimes we can use fewer nodes by using larger components (which provide more mutual pairs per node). \n    #               # However, if p is not achievable by a combination of components with total nodes < 2*p, then the minimal n is 2*p.\n\n    #               # But our DP already found a way for p=5 with n_min=7 < 10 (which is 2*5). \n\n    #               # Therefore, if our DP returns a large number for p, it means we didn't find a decomposition with components of size>=2. But we know that by using p components of size 2, we can achieve p mutual pairs with n_min=2*p. \n\n    #               # So we can set n_min = 2*p if dp[p] is still 10**9.\n\n    #           Then, unidirectional = (n_min*n_min - 2*p - n_min) // 2\n\n    #   But note: the above formula for unidirectional pairs relies on the sum of squares being 2*p + n_min. This is derived from the mutual pairs equation. However, if we use p components of size 2, then:\n    #       mutual pairs = p * T_2 = p * 1 = p.\n    #       sum of squares = p * (2^2) = 4*p.\n    #       According to the formula: 2*p + n_min = 2*p + 2*p = 4*p -> matches.\n    #       And the between-component product sum = (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = ((2*p)^2 - 4*p) // 2 = (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   But wait, the between-component product sum is also computed by: (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2, which is (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   However, the graph with p components of size 2 (each is a complete graph of 2 nodes) and arranged in a complete DAG between them would have:\n    #       Within each component: no unidirectional pairs (because each component is a SCC of 2 nodes, and the mutual pairs are counted in p).\n    #       Between components: for each pair of components (i, j), there are 2*2=4 unidirectional pairs (since the condensation is complete). But wait, the complete DAG between m components means for each ordered pair (i, j) (i != j), there is an edge from i to j. But in our case, each component is two nodes. The unidirectional pairs between two components (say component i and component j) are: for each node in i and each node in j, the pair (node_i, node_j) is unidirectional. There are 2*2=4 such pairs per ordered pair (i, j) with i < j in the topological order.\n\n    #       Total between-component unidirectional pairs = (number of ordered pairs of components) * 4 = (m*(m-1)) * 4, where m = p (since we have p components).\n\n    #       But note: the between-component product sum we derived was (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #       And (p*(p-1)) * 4 = 4*p^2 - 4*p = 2*(2*p^2 - 2*p) -> not the same.\n\n    #   Let me recalc the between-component product sum properly:\n\n    #       The between-component product sum is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|) [if the condensation is complete]. But in our case, each component has size 2, so |C_i|=2 for all i. Then:\n    #           Sum_{i<j} 2*2 = 4 * (number of unordered pairs of components) = 4 * (C(m,2)) = 4 * (m*(m-1)//2) = 2*m*(m-1)\n\n    #       But note: the condensation is a DAG, and we count every ordered pair (i,j) with i->j. But in a complete DAG, the number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i->j and i<j is m*(m-1). And each such ordered pair contributes |C_i|*|C_j|. So total unidirectional pairs = sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|.\n\n    #       In our example, |C_i|=2 for all i, so total = 2 * (sum_{i<j} 2) = 4 * (number of ordered pairs) = 4 * (m*(m-1)).\n\n    #       But wait, the number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i<j is m*(m-1). And each ordered pair (i,j) contributes 2*2=4. So total = 4*m*(m-1).\n\n    #       Now, m = p (the number of components, each of size 2). So total = 4*p*(p-1).\n\n    #       But our formula from the sum of squares was: (n_min^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #       These two are not equal: \n    #           4*p*(p-1) vs 2*p^2 - 2*p = 2p(p-1)\n\n    #       Clearly, 4*p*(p-1) != 2*p*(p-1).\n\n    #   What went wrong in the derivation?\n\n    #   Revisit the derivation:\n\n    #       We said: the between-component product sum (for the complete DAG) is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i| * |C_j|). This is correct.\n\n    #       And the total number of nodes n = sum_i |C_i| = 2*p.\n\n    #       And the sum of squares = sum_i |C_i|^2 = p * (2^2) = 4*p.\n\n    #       Then, the between-component product sum = (n^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2 = ( (2*p)^2 - 4*p ) // 2 = (4*p^2 - 4*p) // 2 = 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #       But the direct count is 4*p*(p-1).\n\n    #   They are not the same. \n\n    #   Let me expand 2*p^2 - 2*p = 2*p*(p-1). \n    #   And 4*p*(p-1) is four times larger.\n\n    #   Where did the factor of 4 come from in the direct count? \n\n    #   In the direct count, for each ordered pair (i,j) (i<j), we have |C_i| * |C_j| = 2 * 2 = 4. But note: the between-component product sum formula (n^2 - sum_of_squares)//2 is derived from the identity:\n\n    #       (sum_i |C_i|)^2 = sum_i |C_i|^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|\n\n    #       => n^2 = sum_of_squares + 2 * (between-component product sum)\n\n    #       => between-component product sum = (n^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2\n\n    #   So it should be (2*p)^2 - 4*p = 4*p^2 - 4*p, then divided by 2 is 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   But the direct count is 4 * p*(p-1) = 4*p^2 - 4*p, which is twice as much as 2*p^2 - 2*p.\n\n    #   There is a factor of 2 discrepancy.\n\n    #   Let's test with p=1 (one component of size 2):\n    #       n=2, sum_of_squares=4.\n    #       between-component product sum = (2^2 - 4) // 2 = (4-4)//2 = 0.

In the complete DAG, the between-component product sum is the sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j|, and this is 40 in the p=5 case? \n\n    #   But direct count: for each ordered pair (i,j) with i<j, we have |C_i|*|C_j| = 4, and there are C(5,2)=10 unordered pairs, so the sum_{i<j} |C_i|*|C_j| = 10 * 4 = 40.\n\n    #   And the total unidirectional pairs is the sum_{i<j} (|C_i|*|C_j|) (each term being the number of directed edges from i to j) = 40.\n\n    #   But why did I previously think it was 80? Because I counted ordered pairs and multiplied by 4? \n\n    #   Actually, the between-component product sum (for the complete DAG) is defined as the sum_{i<j} (|C_i|*|C_j|), not the sum_{i<j} (|C_i|*|C_j|)*2.\n\n    #   And the unidirectional pairs are exactly these: for each ordered pair (i,j) with i<j, there are |C_i|*|C_j| directed edges from i to j (assuming we put a complete bipartite graph from i to j). \n\n    #   Therefore, the total unidirectional pairs is indeed the between-component product sum = (n^2 - sum_of_squares) // 2.\n\n    #   And the direct count for p=5 (five components) is 40, not 80.\n\n    #   So the formula is correct.\n\n    #   Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n    #       if p == 0:\n    #           print(\"0 0\")\n    #       else:\n    #           Use DP to find minimal n for p (if not found, use n = 2*p)\n    #           Then, unidirectional = (n*n - 2*p - n) // 2\n\n    #   However, note: the derivation of the sum of squares relies on the mutual pairs equation, and the mutual pairs are exactly p. And the sum of squares is 2*p + n.

Correct.\n    #       Between-component product sum = (7^2 - 17) // 2 = (49-17)//2=32//2=16.\n    #       Direct count: \n    #           Components: A (size3), B (size2), C (size2)\n    #           Complete DAG: edges from A to B, A to C, B to C.\n    #           A->B: 3*2=6\n    #           A->C: 3*2=6\n    #           B->C: 2*2=4\n    #           Total=6+6+4=16. Correct.\n\n    #   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n    #       Precompute dp for p up to 200000.\n    #       Then for the given p, output (dp[p], (dp[p]*dp[p] - 2*p - dp[p])//2)\n\n    #   However, note: the minimal n might be large (up to around 2*p) and p is up to 200000, so n could be up to 400000, and the unidirectional pairs could be huge. But the problem constraints say p up to 200000, and we are to output the number.\n\n    #   We must be cautious for performance: the DP has a state size of 200000 and iterates over k from 2 to about 900, so the inner loop runs 200000 * 900 iterations, which is 180e6, acceptable in Pyton if optimized (using PyPy or fast Python might be needed, but 180e6 iterations is about a few seconds in C++ and maybe 10-20 seconds in Python). \n\n    #   But the problem says p up to 200000, and we are doing a double loop: outer loop 900, inner loop 200000 -> 900*200000=180e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in many online judges if implemented in C++ but in Python might be borderline in speed.\n\n    #   We can optimize by breaking early if T_k > p.\n\n    #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n    #   Special note: p=0.\n\n    #   Let's write the code.\n\n    #   IMPORTANT: We must use a large number for initialization, but 10**9 might be too small if the minimal n is large (like 400000). We can use a large number like 10**18, but then memory for dp array might be an issue.\n\n    #   Alternatively, we can use a list of zeros and then update, but we need to know the minimal nodes.\n\n    #   But note: the minimal nodes for p=200000 might be around 630 (since T_630 = 630*629//2 = 195, 630*629//2 = 195, let me compute: 630*629//2 = 201, 630*629=396, 396/2=198, so T_630=198,000). Then to achieve 200000, we might need to use one component of size 630 (198,000) and then some smaller ones to add 2000 more. The total nodes might be around 630 + (some small additions).\n\n    #   But we are iterating k up to 900, so we'll cover it.\n\n    #   Let's hope the judge's p is not the worst-case.\n\n    #   Code:\n\n    p_val = p\n    if p_val == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        exit(0)\n\n    p_max = 200000\n    # If p_val > p_max, then we cannot compute via our DP (but the problem says p up to 200000, so assume p_val<=200000)\n    # Find the maximal k such that T_k <= p_max\n    k = 1\n    T_k = 0\n    while T_k <= p_max:\n        k += 1\n        T_k = k*(k-1)//2\n    k_max = k - 1\n\n    # dp[i] = minimal nodes to achieve exactly i mutual pairs\n    dp = [10**9] * (p_max+1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # Iterate over component sizes from 2 to k_max\n    for size in range(2, k_max+1):\n        mutual_here = size*(size-1)//2\n        if mutual_here > p_max:\n            break\n        # Update dp from high to low to avoid using the same component multiple times in one iteration (unbounded knapsack)\n        for s in range(p_max, mutual_here-1, -1):\n            if dp[s - mutual_here] != 10**9:\n                if dp[s] > dp[s - mutual_here] + size:\n                    dp[s] = dp[s - mutual_here] + size\n\n    # Now, if dp[p_val] is still 10**9, then we use the fallback: use p_val components of size 2.\n    if dp[p_val] == 10**9:\n        n_min = 2 * p_val\n    else:\n        n_min = dp[p_val]\n\n    # Compute the maximum unidirectional pairs\n    # Formula: (n_min*n_min - 2*p_val - n_min) // 2\n    unidirectional = (n_min*n_min - 2*p_val - n_min) // 2\n\n    print(f\"{n_min} {unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()",
