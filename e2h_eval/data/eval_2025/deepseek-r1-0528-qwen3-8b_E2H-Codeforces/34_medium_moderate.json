And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we compute the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of sleep times in all weeks.\n\n Then, the average is S / (number_of_weeks) = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But how to compute S?\n\n We can precompute the prefix sums of the array so that we can quickly get the sum for any contiguous segment.\n\n Alternatively, note that each week is a contiguous segment of k days.\n\n We can compute the total sum S by:\n   S = (sum of first k) + (sum of next k) + ... \n\n But note: we have (n-k+1) segments.\n\n However, we can use the prefix sum array:\n\n Let P[0] = 0, and for i from 1 to n: P[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n Then the sum of the segment from i to i+k-1 is P[i+k] - P[i].\n\n Then S = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n But note: the number of terms is (n-k+1). So we can iterate i from 0 to n-k.\n\n However, note that n and k can be up to 200,000, so we must do this efficiently.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total sum S as:\n\n   S = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) \n        + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_k)\n        + ... \n        + (a_{n-k} + ... + a_{n-1})\n\n But note that each element a_i appears in how many weeks?\n\n The element at index i (0-indexed) will appear in the weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n-k) ?\n\n Actually, the element at index i is included in the weeks that start from j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j must be in [0, n-k] (so j from 0 to n-k).\n\n The condition is: j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j must be at least 0 and at most n-k.\n\n The number of weeks that include a_i is: \n   left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   right_bound = min(i, n - k)   # but wait, the last week that includes a_i must end at or before the last element, so the starting index j must be <= i and j <= n-k (since the segment goes from j to j+k-1, and j+k-1 <= n-1 => j <= n-k)\n\n Actually, the starting index j must satisfy: j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j <= n-k (because the week must fit, the last week starts at n-k).\n\n So the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1? Not exactly, because if i-k+1 is negative then we take 0, and if i is beyond n-k then we take n-k.\n\n Actually, the number of weeks that include a_i is: \n   count_i = min(i+1, n-k+1, k) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that the element a_i is included in (min(i+1, k, n-i)) ? \n\n But wait, let's think:\n\n   The first week that includes a_i is the one starting at index 0 if i < k, then we start from 0 to i. Actually, the condition is that the week must start at an index j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n   The smallest j is max(0, i-k+1) and the largest j is min(i, n-k). Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1, but only if max(0, i-k+1) <= min(i, n-k). Otherwise, 0.\n\n However, note: the starting index j must be in [0, n-k]. So:\n\n   low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   high = min(i, n-k)\n\n   If low > high, then 0, else (high - low + 1).\n\n Then S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * (number of weeks that include a_i)\n\n Then the average = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n This method would be O(n) and each element is processed once.\n\n However, there's another way using prefix sums:\n\n   Let P[0] = 0\n   For i from 1 to n: P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   Then S = 0\n   For i from 0 to n-k:\n        S += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n   Then average = S / (n-k+1)\n\n But note: the above loop runs (n-k+1) times, which is acceptable if n-k+1 is about 200000, and we are doing simple addition.\n\n However, we can avoid the loop by using the formula with counts.\n\n But both are O(n). Let me choose the prefix sum method because it is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read n, k\n   Read list a of n integers\n\n   Precompute prefix sum P of length n+1.\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n        total_sum += (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n   Then average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n However, note: the problem requires the average to be output with at least 6 decimal places.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n   n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   P = [0,3,7,14]\n\n   i=0: P[2]-P[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n   i=1: P[3]-P[1] = 14 - 3 = 11\n\n   total_sum = 7 + 11 = 18\n   total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n   average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> outputs 9.0000000000\n\n   Second example: \"1 1\\n10\"\n   n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n   total_weeks = 1\n   total_sum = 10 (from P[1]-P[0] = 10-0)\n   average = 10.0\n\n   Third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n   n=8, k=2, total_weeks = 7\n   We need to compute the sum of 7 weeks.\n\n   Let me compute manually the first few:\n      week1: 1+2 = 3\n      week2: 2+4 = 6\n      week3: 4+100000 = 100004\n      week4: 100000+123 = 100123\n      week5: 123+456 = 579\n      week6: 456+789 = 1245\n      week7: 789+1 = 790\n\n   Sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201960; 201960+790=202750.\n\n   Average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   Now using prefix sum method:\n\n   P[0]=0, P[1]=1, P[2]=3, P[3]=7, P[4]=100007, P[5]=100130, P[6]=100686, P[7]=200475, P[8]=202750\n\n   Then:\n     i=0: P[2]-P[0]=3\n     i=1: P[3]-P[1]=7-1=6\n     i=2: P[4]-P[2]=100007-3=100004\n     i=3: P[5]-P[3]=100130-7=100123\n     i=4: P[6]-P[4]=100686-100007=679 -> wait, but above week4 was 100000+123=100123. Why 679?\n\n   Wait, let me check the prefix array:\n\n   a = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n   P[0]=0\n   P[1]=1\n   P[2]=1+2=3\n   P[3]=3+4=7\n   P[4]=7+100000=100007\n   P[5]=100007+123=100130\n   P[6]=100130+456=100586   # I did 100130+456=100586, but above I wrote 100686. Correction.\n\n   Then P[7]=100586+789=101375\n   P[8]=101375+1=101376\n\n   Now recalc:\n\n   i=0: P[2]-P[0]=3\n   i=1: P[3]-P[1]=7-1=6\n   i=2: P[4]-P[2]=100007-3=100004\n   i=3: P[5]-P[3]=100130-7=100123\n   i=4: P[6]-P[4]=100586-100007=579\n   i=5: P[7]-P[5]=101375-100130=1245\n   i=6: P[8]-P[6]=101376-100586=790\n\n   Then total_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201960; 201960+790=202750.\n\n   So the prefix sum method is correct.\n\n   However, the above calculation for P[6] was wrong initially. We must compute the prefix correctly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n   P = [0]*(n+1)\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0\n   # We are going to take segments from i=0 to i = n-k (inclusive)\n   for i in range(0, total_weeks):\n        total_sum += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   Format the average to have 10 decimal places (or until no more digits) but the problem says at least 6, and the example uses 10.\n\n   We can use formatting: \"{:.10f}\".format(average)\n\n   But note: the third example output is '28964.2857142857' which has 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n   However, sometimes the float might have more precision, but the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, so 10 digits is safe.\n\n   But note: the total_sum might be very large (n up to 200000, and a_i up to 10^5, so total_sum can be up to 200000 * 10^5 = 2e10, which is within integer range, but then we divide by an integer (total_weeks) and then format.\n\n   However, we must be cautious for floating point precision? But the numbers are integers so the division might be non-integer.\n\n   Since the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, we can rely on Python's float for numbers up to around 1e10 (which is represented exactly in float for integers, but then the division may not be exact).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula with the counts (each element multiplied by its frequency) and then divide by total_weeks. This might be more efficient? Actually, the two methods are both O(n). \n\n   However, the prefix sum method is simpler and clear.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n up to 200000, and we are doing one pass for prefix and then one pass for the segments. The second loop runs (n-k+1) which is about 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, we can also avoid building the entire prefix array by using a single variable and a sliding window. But that is essentially the same as the prefix sum.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the total_sum without building the entire prefix array by:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        current_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n   This is also O(n) and avoids building a prefix array of size n+1.\n\n   Which one is faster? The prefix sum method requires building an array of n+1, but the other method requires a list of n integers. Both are O(n) in time and space.\n\n   Since n can be up to 200000, the memory for the prefix array is 200001 integers, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But if we are concerned about memory, we can use the sliding window.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   Method 1 (prefix array):\n        We build an array P of length n+1, then we do a loop of n-k+1 steps.\n\n   Method 2 (sliding window):\n        We don't build the prefix array, but we do a loop of k to initialize the first window, then n-k steps.\n\n   Actually, the prefix array method is more straightforward and the memory is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says n up to 200000, which is 200,000, so building an array of 200001 integers is about 1.6 MB (each integer in Python might be 24-28 bytes? Then 200001 * 28 = 5.6 MB). That is acceptable.\n\n   But let's use the sliding window method to avoid storing the entire prefix array, and because it is a common technique.\n\n   Steps for sliding window:\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        # First, compute the sum of the first k elements\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n\n        # Then, for each subsequent window (from index 1 to n-k), update the current_sum by subtracting the element that leaves and adding the element that enters.\n        for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n            # Remove the element at index i-1 (because the window now starts at i, so the previous window included a[i-1] but the new one doesn't)\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n   Then compute the average.\n\n   However, note: when k==0, but k>=1 per input, so no problem.\n\n   Also, if k==n, then total_weeks=1, and we do one window.\n\n   Example with n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]:\n        current_sum = 3+4 = 7\n        total_sum += 7 -> 7\n        Then i=1: \n            current_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2] = 7-3+7 = 11\n            total_sum += 11 -> 18\n        Then i goes from 1 to n-k (which is 3-2=1, so the range(1, 1+1) gives i=1 only.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But note: the range is from 1 to n-k (inclusive). The number of iterations is (n-k) because the starting index goes from 1 to n-k (so we have n-k windows after the first one).\n\n   However, note: the total number of windows is (n-k+1). The first window is at i=0, then we do from i=1 to i=n-k (which is the last window). The number of iterations is (n-k) for the for-loop, so total operations is 1 (first window) + (n-k) (for the rest) = n-k+1, which is correct.\n\n   But the above code initializes the first window and then iterates for n-k times, so the total windows processed is (n-k+1).\n\n   However, we can also write:\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n        if total_weeks == 0:\n            # But k<=n, so total_weeks>=1, so skip\n            pass\n\n        # We'll use a list for a, and we have n elements.\n\n        # Edge: if k==0, but k>=1, so no.\n\n        # Initialize the first window\n        current_sum = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            current_sum += a[i]\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n   But note: the above for-loop for the first window is O(k) and then the second loop is O(n). Total O(n).\n\n   This method is efficient and doesn't require storing the entire prefix array.\n\n   Let me test with the third example:\n\n        n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n        First window: i=0 to 1: current_sum = 1+2=3, total_sum=3.\n\n        Then i=1: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[2] = 3-1+4=6 -> total_sum=3+6=9\n        Then i=2: current_sum = 6 - a[1] + a[3] = 6-2+100000=100004 -> total_sum=9+100004=100013\n        Then i=3: current_sum = 100004 - a[2] + a[4] = 100004-4+123=100123 -> total_sum=100013+100123=200136\n        Then i=4: current_sum = 100123 - a[3] + a[5] = 100123-100000+123+456? Wait, no: we are subtracting a[3] (which is 100000) and adding a[4+2-1] = a[5] (which is 456) -> 100123-100000+456 = 579 -> total_sum=200136+579=200715\n        Then i=5: current_sum = 579 - a[4] + a[6] = 579-123+456+789? No: subtract a[4] (123) and add a[5+2-1]=a[6] (789) -> 579-123+789 = 1245 -> total_sum=200715+1245=201960\n        Then i=6: current_sum = 1245 - a[5] + a[7] = 1245-456+1=790 -> total_sum=201960+790=202750\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Now, which method to choose? The sliding window is more memory efficient (only stores the list, and a few variables) and is equally fast.\n\n   However, note: the initial sum for the first window: if k is large (like 200000) then the first window sum is O(k). But k<=n, and n is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n   But we can avoid the initial O(k) by using the prefix array method? Actually, the prefix array method also requires building an array of n+1, and then a loop of n-k+1, but the first window is computed by P[k]-P[0] which is just one array lookup.\n\n   However, the sliding window method must do k additions for the first window, which is acceptable because k<=200000.\n\n   But note: the problem says n,k up to 200000, so k can be 200000, then the first window is 200000 elements. In Python, adding 200000 integers is acceptable? It should be, because 200000 is about 2e5, which is acceptable for modern computers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the entire list and then compute the first window by slicing and summing, but that is what we did.\n\n   Let me choose the sliding window method.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        # If there is only one week, then we just output the first window.\n        if total_weeks == 0:\n            # But k<=n, so this shouldn't happen. But if k>n, but the input says k<=n, so skip.\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        else:\n            # Compute the sum of the first window\n            current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n            total_sum = current_sum\n\n            # If there is more than one week, we slide the window from index 1 to index n-k (inclusive)\n            for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n                # Subtract the element that leaves (the one at the beginning of the previous window) and add the new element (at the end of the new window)\n                current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total_sum += current_sum\n\n            average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n            # Format the average to have 10 decimal places\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   However, wait: the for-loop runs from i=1 to i = total_weeks-1 (because range(1, total_weeks) gives i from 1 to total_weeks-1). But we need to process (total_weeks - 1) windows after the first one.\n\n   And total_weeks = n-k+1, so we process n-k windows.\n\n   This matches: the first window is the one at i=0, then we process from i=1 to i=n-k (which is the last window) but our loop runs from 1 to total_weeks-1 (which is n-k+1-1 = n-k). So the last window is processed when i = n-k.\n\n   Example: n=3, k=2, total_weeks=2, then the loop runs for i=1 to 1 (because range(1,2) gives i=1). Then we process the second window.\n\n   But wait, the second window is the one starting at index 1 (in 0-indexed, the week from day1 to day2). Our array a has indices 0 to n-1.\n\n   In the sliding window, we start with window [0, k-1] (i.e., indices 0 to k-1). Then we move the window by one: remove index0, add indexk (which is index2 in the example). \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the window starting at index i (0-indexed) covers indices [i, i+k-1]. \n\n   We are processing the window starting at index i in the loop? Actually, in the loop, when i is the starting index, then we are at the window starting at i. However, we started with the window at i=0, then we update for i=1, then i=2, etc.\n\n   But in the code, we are updating for the window starting at i (the current i) by subtracting the element at i-1 and adding the element at i+k-1. \n\n   However, note: the window starting at i=1: \n        We remove a[0] (which is the element at index0) and add a[1+k-1] = a[1+2-1] = a[2] (if k=2). \n\n   This is correct because the window [1,2] (if we have 3 days) is the next window.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"8 2 ...\" has 7 windows, so total_weeks=7, then the loop runs from i=1 to i=6 (because range(1,7) gives i=1,2,...,6). Then we process 6 windows, and we already had the first window, so total windows processed is 7.\n\n   However, the example had 8 days, so windows are:\n        [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,6], [6,7] -> 7 windows.\n\n   Our code: \n        current_sum = sum(a[0:2]) -> first window [0,1]\n        Then for i from 1 to 6 (both inclusive): \n            i=1: update to [1,2]\n            i=2: update to [2,3]\n            i=3: update to [3,4]\n            i=4: update to [4,5]\n            i=5: update to [5,6]\n            i=6: update to [6,7]\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, note: the element added at i+k-1: for i=6, k=2, then index = 6+2-1=7, which is the last element.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if k==0? The input says k>=1, so we don't worry.\n\n   What if k==n? Then total_weeks=1, and we don't enter the for-loop. Then total_sum is just the first window.\n\n   Example: n=3, k=3, a=[3,4,7]: \n        total_weeks=1\n        current_sum = 3+4+7=14\n        total_sum=14\n        average=14/1=14.0 -> output 14.0000000000\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the sliding window method.\n\n   However, note: the above code for the sliding window updates the current_sum by subtracting the element at i-1 and adding the element at i+k-1. But the window we are currently at is the one starting at i? Actually, we are updating the window that starts at i (the current i) from the previous window (starting at i-1). \n\n   But note: the previous window was [i-1, i+k-2] and the current window is [i, i+k-1]. So we subtract the element at i-1 and add the element at i+k-1.\n\n   However, in the code, the variable `current_sum` is being reused. Initially, we set it to the first window (starting at 0). Then for the next window (starting at 1), we update by subtracting a[0] and adding a[1+k-1] (which is a[2]). \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, when we update for the window starting at i, we are using the previous window (starting at i-1) and updating to the window starting at i. \n\n   However, we must be cautious: the element we remove is the one at the beginning of the previous window, which is at index i-1, and the element we add is the one at the end of the new window, which is at index i+k-1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   One more edge: k=1, then the window moves one element at a time.\n\n   Example: n=3, k=1, a=[3,4,7]\n        total_weeks=3\n        current_sum = a[0] = 3\n        Then for i=1: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[1] = 3-3+4=4\n        Then for i=2: current_sum = 4 - a[1] + a[2] = 4-4+7=7\n        total_sum = 3+4+7=14\n        average=14/3≈4.6666666667\n\n   Output: 4.6666666667\n\n   But the expected? \n        Week1: 3 -> 3\n        Week2: 4 -> 4\n        Week3: 7 -> 7\n        Average = (3+4+7)/3 = 14/3 ≈4.6666666667.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the sliding window method.\n\n   However, note: the initial window is [0, k-1]. Then the next window is [1, k] (if k>1) but if k=1, then the next window is [1,1] (so we remove a[0] and add a[1]).\n\n   The code is general.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input numbers are at least 1 and up to 10^5, so no negative numbers.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        if total_weeks <= 0:\n            # According to the problem, k<=n, so this won't occur, but for safety?\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        else:\n            # Calculate the sum of the first window\n            current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n            total_sum = current_sum\n\n            # Iterate for the remaining windows: from i=1 to i = total_weeks-1 (which is n-k)\n            for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n                # Remove the element that falls out (the one at the start of the previous window: index i-1)\n                # Add the new element (the one at the end of the current window: index i+k-1)\n                current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total_sum += current_sum\n\n            average = total_sum / total_weeks\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   However, note: the above loop runs for total_weeks-1 times, so the total windows processed is 1 (initial) + (total_weeks-1) = total_weeks.\n\n   But wait, the initial window is the first one, and then we add the next total_weeks-1 windows. So we are adding the first window and then the next total_weeks-1 windows, so the total_sum is the sum of all window sums.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the example with n=3, k=2: \n        total_weeks=2, so the loop runs for i=1 to 1 (one iteration). Then we add the second window.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the list `a` has n elements, and we are accessing a[i+k-1] for i from 1 to total_weeks-1. The maximum i is total_weeks-1 = n-k, then the index is (n-k) + k - 1 = n-1, which is the last element. So we are not going out of bounds.\n\n   Therefore, the code is safe.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input numbers are integers, so no problem.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> 9.0000000000\n   Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\" -> 10.0000000000\n   Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> 28964.2857142857\n\n   We've already verified with the third example.\n\n   However, note the third example output: \n        Expected: 28964.2857142857\n\n   Our code for the third example: \n        n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n        total_weeks=7\n        current_sum = 1+2 = 3\n        Then we add 3, then update 6 times.\n\n        total_sum = 3 + (3-1+4) + (3-2+100000) + (3-4+123) -> wait, no, we update the current_sum and then add that updated current_sum.\n\n        Actually, we do:\n\n        total_sum = 3\n        Then i=1: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[2] = 3-1+4=6 -> total_sum=3+6=9\n        Then i=2: current_sum = 6 - a[1] + a[3] = 6-2+100000=100004 -> total_sum=9+100004=100013\n        Then i=3: current_sum = 100004 - a[2] + a[4] = 100004-4+123=100123 -> total_sum=100013+100123=20",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible consecutive weeks in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all valid weeks and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of length `k` in a sequence of `n` days. Each week is defined by `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The challenge is to compute the sum of sleep times for all these weeks efficiently.\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each week from scratch, we use a sliding window technique. This involves:\n   - Calculating the sum of the first window (first `k` elements).\n   - For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The sliding window approach is chosen for its efficiency, as it processes each element in constant time per window, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n). This is optimal for large inputs (up to 200,000 elements).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of days. This is because each element is processed exactly once during the initial window sum and once during the sliding phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_weeks = n - k + 1\n\nif total_weeks <= 0:\n    print(\"0.0000000000\")\nelse:\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n\n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n\n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of days `n` and the week length `k`. The second line reads the sequence of sleep times.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the total number of weeks (`total_weeks`) as `n - k + 1`. If there are no valid weeks, print `0.0000000000`.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - **Initial Window**: Compute the sum of the first `k` elements (`current_sum`).\n   - **Subsequent Windows**: For each subsequent window, adjust `current_sum` by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. Accumulate these sums in `total_sum`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Divide `total_sum` by `total_weeks` to get the average sleep time, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
