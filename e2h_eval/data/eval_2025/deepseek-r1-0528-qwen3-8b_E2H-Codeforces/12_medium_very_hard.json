The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise), we can think of the houses as arranged in a circle from 1 to n and then back to 1.\n\n The key observation: \n   - We start at house 1.\n   - For each task, we must complete it in order. But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" so we do tasks in order.\n\n However, note that multiple consecutive tasks might be in the same house, so we can stay there.\n\n The challenge: we are moving along a circle. From house x, moving clockwise to house y:\n   - If y >= x, then the distance is (y - x).\n   - If y < x, then we have to go from x to n, then wrap around to y: (n - x) + y.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives output 6.\n\n Steps:\n   Let's break down the example:\n        n=4, m=3, tasks = [3, 2, 3]\n\n   Start at house 1.\n\n   First task: 3\n        From 1 to 3: 3-1 = 2 moves (if 3>=1) -> 2 units.\n\n   Then second task: 2\n        Now we are at 3. We need to go to 2.\n        Since 2 < 3, we can't just subtract. We have two ways? Actually, the ringroad is one-way clockwise.\n        So from 3, we can go: 3->4->1->2. That is 3 moves (because 3 to 4: 1, 4 to 1: 1, 1 to 2: 1 -> total 3).\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute: \n            Option 1: direct clockwise without wrapping: (2 - 3) mod n? But wait, we are only allowed to move clockwise.\n\n        Actually, the rule: moving clockwise from 3 to 2: we go from 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (2nd step), then 1 to 2 (3rd step). So 3 steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the distance as: \n            If we are at current position 'cur', and next task is 'a':\n                if a >= cur: distance = a - cur\n                else: distance = (n - cur) + a\n\n   Then third task: 3\n        From 2 to 3: 3>=2 -> distance = 3-2 = 1.\n\n   Total time: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   But wait, the example also includes an alternative scenario: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n   Let me check that one:\n\n        n=4, m=3, tasks = [2,3,3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        First task: 2\n            From 1 to 2: 2-1 = 1.\n\n        Second task: 3\n            From 2 to 3: 3-2 = 1.\n\n        Third task: 3 -> no movement, or 0.\n\n        Total time: 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n   However, wait: the example output is 2.\n\n   So the approach for one move from current position 'cur' to next task 'a' is:\n\n        if a >= cur: \n            steps = a - cur\n        else:\n            steps = (n - cur) + a\n\n   Then we update the current position to 'a'.\n\n   But note: the example [3,2,3] does not use this formula for the second task because 2<3, so we use (4-3)+2 = 1+2 = 3.\n\n   However, the example [2,3,3] uses 2-1=1, then 3-2=1, then 0.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n        for each task in the list of m tasks:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += (task - current)\n                current = task\n            else:\n                total_time += (n - current + task)\n                current = task\n\n   Let me test with the first example: [3,2,3]\n        Start: current=1\n        task=3: 3>=1 -> add 2, current=3 -> total_time=2\n        task=2: 2<3 -> add (4-3+2)=1+2=3, total_time=5, current=2\n        task=3: 3>=2 -> add 1, total_time=6.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: why did the example [2,3,3] give 2 and not 2+ (from 2 to 3: 1) + (from 3 to 3:0) = 2? \n        In our calculation: \n            Start: current=1\n            task=2: 2>=1 -> add 1, current=2 -> total_time=1\n            task=3: 3>=2 -> add 1, total_time=2\n            task=3: 3>=3 -> add 0, total_time=2.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the ringroad is circular and we are moving clockwise. Our formula for the case when a < current is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we are at 1 and the next task is 4? \n        Since 4>=1, we do 4-1=3, which is correct: 1->2->3->4.\n\n   What if we are at 4 and the next task is 1?\n        Since 1<4, we do (n-4)+1 = (4-4)+1 = 0+1 = 1. But actually, from 4 to 1: we move 4->1 (which is 1 step, because 4->1 is adjacent in the ring? \n        Wait, in a ringroad with n=4, the houses are 1,2,3,4 and then 1. So from 4, the next clockwise is 1. So the distance should be 1.\n\n   But wait, the example above: from 3 to 2 in n=4: \n        We did (4-3)+2 = 1+2=3, but actually the path is 3->4->1->2: that's 3 steps. Correct.\n\n   However, from 4 to 1: \n        According to the formula: (n-4)+1 = (4-4)+1 = 0+1=1. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n   But note: the constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so we need to read the input and process in O(m). This is linear so acceptable.\n\n   However, let's consider if there's a smarter way to avoid recalculating the entire path by simulating each step? \n   The above simulation is O(m) and each step is O(1). \n\n   But note: the problem says that Xenia must complete the tasks in order, and the movement is cumulative.\n\n   However, there is an alternative: we can note that the entire journey is a sequence of moves from the starting point to the first task, then to the second, etc.\n\n   But the above method is already efficient.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n and m from the first line.\n        Read the next line which contains m integers.\n\n        Initialize:\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n\n        For each number in the list of tasks:\n            if the number is greater than or equal to current:\n                total_time += (number - current)\n                current = number\n            else:\n                total_time += (n - current + number)\n                current = number\n\n        Print(total_time)\n\n   However, wait: let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> total_time=6 (correct)\n\n   Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> total_time=2 (correct)\n\n   Another example: n=5, m=2, tasks=[5,1]\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 5 -> 5>=1 -> add 4, current=5.\n        Second task: 1 -> 1<5 -> add (5-5+1)=0+1=1 -> total_time=5.\n\n        How does the movement look?\n            From 1 to 5: 1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps)\n            From 5 to 1: 5->1 (1 step) -> total 5 steps.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a long chain? \n\n        Example: n=10, m=3, tasks=[10,9,8]\n        Start at 1.\n        task1: 10 -> 10>=1 -> add 9, current=10.\n        task2: 9 -> 9<10 -> add (10-10+9)=9, current=9.\n        task3: 8 -> 8<9 -> add (10-9+8)=1+8=9, total_time=9+9+9=27.\n\n        Alternatively, we could think: \n            From 1 to 10: 9 steps (clockwise: 1->2->...->10, 9 steps)\n            From 10 to 9: we have to go 10->1->2->...->9: that's 1 (10->1) then 8 more (from 1 to 9) -> 9 steps.\n            From 9 to 8: 9->1->2->...->8: that's 1 (9->1) then 7 more (from 1 to 8) -> 8 steps? \n\n        But wait, our formula for 9->8: \n            (10-9)+8 = 1+8 = 9.\n\n        However, the actual steps from 9 to 8: \n            In a clockwise ring, from 9 we cannot go backwards. The only way is to go from 9 to 10 (1 step), then from 10 to 1 (another step), then from 1 to 8 (7 steps) -> total 1+1+7 = 9.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. Therefore, we cannot move counterclockwise.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is as above.\n\n   But note: the example in the problem statement says the first example has a sequence: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. \n        Which is 6 steps. And our calculation for the first example was 6.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for task in tasks:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += (task - current)\n                current = task\n            else:\n                total_time += (n - current + task)\n                current = task\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   However, wait: what if we have multiple consecutive same tasks?\n\n        Example: n=10, tasks=[5,5,5]\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 5>=1 -> add 4, current=5.\n        Second task: 5>=5 -> add 0, current=5.\n        Third task: 5>=5 -> add 0, current=5.\n\n        Total_time=4.\n\n        Movement: 1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps) then stay.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the starting point is 1 and the first task is 1? \n        Then: 1>=1 -> add 0, then we are at 1.\n\n   Example: n=10, tasks=[1,2,3]\n        Start at 1.\n        First: 1>=1 -> 0, current=1.\n        Second: 2>=1 -> 1, current=2.\n        Third: 3>=2 -> 1, total_time=2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   However, note the problem statement: \"Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1\". So we don't need to account for the initial position if the first task is 1.\n\n   This seems to work.\n\n   But wait: the example input format might be having multiple test cases? No, the problem says the first line contains n and m, then the next line contains m integers.\n\n   There is only one test case per run.\n\n   However, note: the input example is given as two separate strings: ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] but that is just two examples. Our program reads one test case.\n\n   So we are set.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as two separate inputs? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n        Output:\n            ['6', '2']\n\n   This might be interpreted as two separate test cases. However, the problem statement says:\n\n        The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am.\n\n   So the input is two integers and then a list of m integers.\n\n   The example input is two lines: \n        \"4 3\"\n        \"3 2 3\"\n\n   and \n\n        \"4 3\"\n        \"2 3 3\"\n\n   But the example representation is given as two strings. Our program reads from stdin. \n\n   We assume that the input is provided in the standard way (two lines). \n\n   However, note: the problem may be tested with one test case. \n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples. \n\n   But the problem doesn't specify multiple test cases. So we read one test case.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   Let me submit and hope.\n\n   However, wait: the constraints say n and m up to 10^5. The above loop runs m times and each time does constant time operations. This is efficient.\n\n   But note: the problem might require reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for task in tasks:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += (task - current)\n                current = task\n            else:\n                total_time += (n - current + task)\n                current = task\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   However, wait: the example input is provided as a single string? Or two lines?\n\n   The problem says: the second line contains m integers. So we read two lines.\n\n   But what if the input is given in one line for the tasks? Actually, the problem says: the second line. So we read two lines.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as:\n\n        \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n   This is two lines: the first line is \"4 3\", the second line is \"3 2 3\".\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test with the sample input:\n\n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> output 6.\n\n   Another sample: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> output 2.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But wait: what if the task list has only one element? \n\n        Example: n=10, m=1, task=[5]\n        Then: \n            current=1, task=5 -> 5>=1 -> add 4, current=5.\n            total_time=4.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Edge: n=2, m=1, task=[1]\n        total_time=0.\n\n   Edge: n=2, m=1, task=[2]\n        total_time= (2-1)=1.\n\n   Edge: n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> add 1, current=2.\n        Second task: 1 -> 1<2 -> add (2-2+1)=1 -> total_time=2.\n\n        Actual: \n            From 1 to 2: 1 step (1->2)\n            From 2 to 1: 1 step (2->1) -> total 2 steps.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. The above calculations account for that.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the task list is empty? m=0.\n\n        Then we read n and m, and then a list of 0 integers.\n\n        The for loop will not run, total_time=0, and output 0.\n\n        The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   Similarly, n>=2.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for task in tasks:\n            if task >= current:\n                total_time += (task - current)\n                current = task\n            else:\n                total_time += (n - current + task)\n                current = task\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   I think that's it.\n\n   However, wait: there is an alternative way to compute the same thing without updating current? Actually, we need to update current because the next task depends on the current position.\n\n   We must keep track of the current house.\n\n   But note: the problem requires doing tasks in order, so we must go from the previous task's house to the next task's house.\n\n   The above code does exactly that.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   But wait: what if the first task is 1? Then we don't move, so 0. Correct.\n\n   One more: n=10, tasks=[10, 1, 2]\n        Start at 1.\n        First: 10>=1 -> 9, current=10.\n        Second: 1<10 -> (10-10+1)=1, current=1.\n        Third: 2>=1 -> 1, current=2.\n\n        Total_time=9+1+1=11.\n\n        Actual: \n            1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10: 9 steps.\n            Then from 10: 10->1: 1 step (then we are at 1)\n            Then from 1->2: 1 step.\n\n        Total 9+1+1=11.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is as below.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The ringroad consists of `n` houses arranged in a circle, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be present at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 (the initial position) and initialize `total_time` to 0.\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, move directly to that house by adding the difference between the task location and the current position to `total_time`.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, Xenia must move clockwise from the current position to the end of the ringroad and then continue from the start to the task location. The distance is calculated as `(n - current_position + task_location)` and added to `total_time`.\n3. **Update current position**: After each movement, update the current position to the task location to reflect her new position for the next task.\n4. **Output the result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and ensuring each movement is computed in constant time, leading to an overall linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for task in tasks:\n        if task >= current:\n            total_time += (task - current)\n            current = task\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + task)\n            current = task\n            \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n- **Initial Setup**: The starting position is house 1, and `total_time` is initialized to 0.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n  - If the task is ahead of the current position (or same), the time taken is simply the difference between the task location and the current position.\n  - If the task is behind the current position in the clockwise direction, the time taken involves moving from the current position to the end of the ringroad and then from the start to the task location, computed as `(n - current_position + task_location)`.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated `total_time` is printed, representing the minimal time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.",
