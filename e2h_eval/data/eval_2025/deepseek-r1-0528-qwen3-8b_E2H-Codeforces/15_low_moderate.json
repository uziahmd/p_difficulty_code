They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has 2^n teams. The playoff proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n). In the i-th phase (0-indexed? note: the string s index 0 corresponds to the first phase which has 2^(n-1) games) we have:\n   - If s[i] is '0', then in the matches of that phase the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If s[i] is '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n We are to determine all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to itself) for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Observation:\n The tournament structure is fixed: it's a single elimination bracket. The matches are predetermined by the bracket (the pairing is fixed: first round: consecutive pairs, second round: winners of consecutive initial groups, etc.)\n\n However, the outcome of each match depends on the phase's result string. The challenge is to assign the skills (a permutation) so that a particular team x wins.\n\n Let's denote:\n   total_teams = 2**n\n\n The tournament has n rounds (phases). In the i-th phase (0-indexed, where i=0 is the first round, i=1 is the second, ... i=n-1 is the final), there are 2^(n-i-1) games (each game produces one winner).\n\n How does the bracket work?\n   The bracket is fixed: \n      Round 1: [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], ... \n      Round 2: [winner0_1, winner2_3], [winner4_5, winner6_7], ...\n\n But note: the problem says that in the first phase (i=0) the games are: \n      team1 vs team2, team3 vs team4, ... \n\n However, the catch: we can assign the permutation arbitrarily. So we can assign the skill levels arbitrarily to the teams.\n\n But note: the problem says the skill level permutation is of integers 1 to 2^n (so distinct and covering all numbers).\n\n Conditions for a team x to win:\n   We must assign the skills so that in every match that x participates in, the outcome is favorable (unless the match is against itself, but note: if x is in a match, then we need to arrange so that x wins or loses according to the rule of that phase, but wait: actually, we want x to win the entire tournament, so we require that x wins all its matches.\n\n However, the outcomes of other matches also matter because they determine who x has to beat. Moreover, the outcomes of the matches in each phase are fixed by the rule of that phase (either always the higher skill wins or the lower skill wins) unless we can arrange the skills appropriately.\n\n Alternate approach: simulate the tournament bracket backwards, determining the set of teams that must be beaten (or avoided) by the candidate x.\n\n However, note that the assignment of skills is arbitrary. We can assign the highest skill to x, but sometimes the rules might force x to face a strong opponent.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Understand the bracket: There are n rounds. In round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the number of teams is 2^(n-i). The bracket is fixed: the matches are determined by the initial seeding? Actually, note the problem says:\n        First phase: split into pairs: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), ... \n        Then the next phase: (winner of (1,2) vs winner of (3,4)), (winner of (5,6) vs winner of (7,8)), etc.\n\n 2. Therefore, the bracket is fixed: the teams are initially numbered 1 to 2^n, and the matches are predetermined by the binary representation of the team indices.\n\n 3. We can think of the tournament as a complete binary tree of height n. The leaves are the teams (from 1 to 2^n). Each node represents a match (except the leaves) and the outcome of that match is determined by the phase (the depth from the root) and the two children's skill levels.\n\n 4. But note: the phases are from the bottom up. The first phase (closest to the leaves) is the deepest (with the most matches). The string s[0] corresponds to the first phase (the bottom one) and s[n-1] corresponds to the final (the root).\n\n 5. For a candidate x (which is one of the 1..total_teams) to win, we require that along the path from the leaf corresponding to x to the root, the outcomes of the matches must be such that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) such that there exists a permutation of skill levels \\( p \\) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament's outcome in each phase is determined by a given string \\( s \\), where each character indicates whether the higher or lower-skilled team wins in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured as a single-elimination bracket with \\( n \\) rounds. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase depends on the corresponding character in the string \\( s \\): '1' means the higher-skilled team wins, and '0' means the lower-skilled team wins.\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must win all its matches. Additionally, all teams that \\( x \\) must face must lose their matches in their respective phases according to the rules specified by \\( s \\).\n3. **Simulation**: For each candidate \\( x \\), simulate the tournament by ensuring:\n   - All teams that \\( x \\) must beat in its path to victory are indeed beaten based on the phase rules.\n   - The remaining teams (those not in \\( x \\)'s path) can be arranged such that they lose in their respective phases if needed.\n4. **Bitmask Representation**: Represent the tournament bracket using bitmask operations to efficiently determine the required matches and outcomes for each candidate \\( x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    s = input().strip()\n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    \n    def is_winning(x):\n        x_bit = 1 << (x-1)\n        current_round = 0\n        \n        while current_round < n:\n            num_games = 1 << (n - current_round - 1)\n            num_teams_in_round = total_teams >> current_round\n            games_per_path = num_teams_in_round // 2\n            \n            required_opponents = set()\n            for i in range(games_per_path):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    left = (i << (current_round + 1)) + 1\n                    right = left + 1\n                    if (left & x_bit) or (right & x_bit):\n                        continue\n                    if s[current_round] == '1':\n                        required_opponents.add(left)\n                        required_opponents.add(right)\n                    else:\n                        required_opponents.add(right)\n                        required_opponents.add(left)\n                else:\n                    left = (i << (current_round + 1)) + 1\n                    right = left + 1\n                    if (left & x_bit) or (right & x_bit):\n                        continue\n                    if s[current_round] == '1':\n                        required_opponents.add(right)\n                        required_opponents.add(left)\n                    else:\n                        required_opponents.add(left)\n                        required_opponents.add(right)\n            \n            for opp in required_opponents:\n                if (opp >> (n - current_round - 1)) & 1:\n                    return False\n            current_round += 1\n        \n        return True\n\n    winners = []\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        if is_winning(x):\n            winners.append(str(x))\n    \n    print(\" \".join(winners))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the integer \\( n \\) (number of rounds) and the string \\( s \\) (determining the outcome of each phase).\n2. **Bitmask Simulation**: For each candidate \\( x \\), the function `is_winning` checks if \\( x \\) can win the tournament by verifying that all necessary opponents are correctly defeated in each phase according to \\( s \\).\n3. **Bitmask Operations**: The simulation uses bitmask operations to represent teams and their positions in the tournament bracket. Each bit in an integer represents a team's presence in a specific part of the bracket.\n4. **Phase Check**: For each phase, the function checks if the required opponents (based on \\( s \\)) are not in \\( x \\)'s path and ensures they would lose their matches if \\( x \\) were to proceed.\n5. **Output**: After checking all candidates from 1 to \\( 2^n \\), the code prints the winning integers in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each candidate by leveraging bitmask operations and phase-specific rules, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
