He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numerals) or both integers.\n Then a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (might have leading zeros, but length <= 1000).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to decimal (base 10) first, and then convert that decimal number to Roman numerals.\n    However, note: the input c is given in base a. So we must first convert c (which is a string in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n\n 2. But note: if b is not 'R', then we have two cases:\n    - If both a and b are integers, then we convert the base-a string to base-b (with no leading zeros, and using digits beyond 9 represented by letters as in hexadecimal, but note: base can be up to 25, so we need to represent digits up to 24).\n\n 3. However, note the example: \n        Input: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> Output: \"1111001\"\n        Input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> Output: \"A\"\n\n 4. Important: The input number c is in base a. We must first convert that to base 10? Actually, for the case when b is not R, we can also convert the entire process without going through base 10? But wait, the problem says: \n        \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\"\n\n    However, note that if b is R, then we must use base 10 for the Roman conversion because Roman numerals are defined in base 10.\n\n    But what about when b is an integer? We can convert from base a to base 10 and then from base 10 to base b. However, the problem says the number in base a might be very long (up to 1000 digits) and the value might be huge (like up to 10^1000), but then note the guarantee: \n        \"In any other case (i.e., when we are not dealing with Roman numerals) the number won't be greater than 10^1000\" but wait, actually the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^1510\" for non-Roman? Actually, the problem states:\n\n        \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\"\n\n    However, converting such a big number (up to 10^1510) to base 10 might be problematic because 10^1510 is a very large number and we cannot use standard integer types (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the operations might be slow). \n\n    But note: the input string for c has at most 1000 digits. And the base a is between 2 and 25. So the number is represented by a string of up to 1000 digits in base a. The maximum value is (a^1000) - 1. For a=25, that's 25^1000 which is way beyond the usual limits. However, the problem says that for non-Roman cases the number is not greater than 10^1510. But note: 10^1510 is about 10^1510, and 25^1000 is (25^10)^100 = (2.5e1)^100 = 2.5^100 * 10^100, which is about 10^(100 * log10(2.5)) + 100, which is around 10^103, so 10^1510 is much bigger. \n\n    Wait, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\" \n\n    This means that for non-Roman cases, the number (in base 10) is <= 10^1510. But note: the input c is given in base a (which is between 2 and 25). So we have to read the string and convert it to base 10. However, if the base is 2 and the number has 100",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves handling two main cases: converting from base `a` to base `b` where `b` is an integer, or converting to Roman numerals if `b` is 'R'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the first line to get the bases `a` and `b`. The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input number `c` (which is in base `a`) to its decimal equivalent. This step is necessary whether the target base `b` is an integer or Roman numerals.\n3. **Handling Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. Roman numerals are constructed using specific symbols and rules, including additive and subtractive principles.\n4. **Handling Integer Bases**: If the target base `b` is an integer, convert the decimal number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. Special care is taken to handle digits greater than 9 by using letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n5. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that leading zeros are omitted in the output and handle cases where the input number is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_numeral(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for value, symbol in val:\n        while n >= value:\n            res.append(symbol)\n            n -= value\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a_base = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        a_base = None\n\n    if a_base is None:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n\n    if num_str == \"0\":\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    decimal_value = 0\n    for char in num_str:\n        decimal_value = decimal_value * a_base + int(char, base=a_base) if char.isdigit() else decimal_value * a_base + (ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        result = roman_numeral(decimal_value)\n        print(result)\n        return\n\n    try:\n        b_base = int(b_str)\n    except:\n        print(\"Invalid base\")\n        return\n\n    if b_base < 2:\n        print(\"Base must be at least 2\")\n        return\n\n    if decimal_value == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    digits = []\n    n = decimal_value\n    while n:\n        remainder = n % b_base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n //= b_base\n\n    s = ''\n    for digit in reversed(digits):\n        if digit < 10:\n            s += str(digit)\n        else:\n            s += chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n\n    print(s)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line specifies the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which might be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The number `c` is converted from base `a` to decimal by processing each digit (or character) of `c` and accumulating the value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs. The conversion involves repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For integer target bases, the decimal number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders collected to form the digits of the result in the new base. Digits beyond 9 are represented by letters (A, B, etc.).\n5. **Edge Handling**: Special cases such as zero input or invalid bases are handled to ensure robustness.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
