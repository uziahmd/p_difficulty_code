Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the target string (since we need to form both names).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the third string.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"there won't be any extra letters\", meaning the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names (with the same frequency).\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Here, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". But note the example output says YES because the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n However, let's break down the example:\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> 7 letters\n   Combined: 17 letters.\n\n   The pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> let's count the letters: \n        S: appears in both guest and host? Actually, the example pile has the same set of letters as the combined names.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as a string with multiple test cases? Actually, the example provided is:\n\n    ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n However, the problem says the input consists of three lines.\n\n Let me clarify: the example input format is three lines.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   s1 = first line\n   s2 = second line\n   s3 = third line\n\n   total_string = s1 + s2\n\n   Then, we check if sorted(total_string) == sorted(s3)\n\n But note: what if there are spaces? The problem states: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\"\n\n So no spaces, just uppercase letters.\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n   Example 1:\n      s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n      s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n      total_string = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Now, s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let me sort total_string and s3:\n\n      total_string: sorted(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") \n      s3: sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n   They should be the same?\n\n   Let me count the frequency:\n\n      In total_string: \n          S: 2 (from SANTA and then S in CLAUS? Actually, SANTA has two S? Wait: SANTA: S, A, N, T, A -> so two A's and one S? Actually, let me spell:\n\n          SANTACLAUS: \n            S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1 -> wait, actually:\n            S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, and then DEDMOROZ: D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n          So total: \n            S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n      Now for s3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n          S: 2 (first and last letter of the word? Actually, let's count:)\n          S: appears at the beginning and in CLAUS -> 2?\n          A: in SANTA (two) and then in CLAUS (one) -> 3? \n\n      Wait, that doesn't match.\n\n  Let me recount for s3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n      S: positions 0, 14, 16 -> 3 times? \n      But wait, the example says it is valid.\n\n  Alternatively, let me write the example again:\n\n      Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S,A,N,T,A,C,L,A,U,S? Wait, actually the example input is given as:\n\n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n      But wait, the example input string is written as one string? Actually, the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset of letters in the pile matches exactly with the multiset of letters from the combined names, without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines: the first line is the guest's name, the second line is the host's name, and the third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Letter Counts**: Compare the sorted list of characters from the combined names with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the required letters; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter counts by leveraging sorting, which allows us to compare the sequences irrespective of their original order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = s1 + s2\n    \n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three strings from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace or newline characters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name (`s1`) and the host's name (`s2`) are concatenated into a single string (`combined`).\n3. **Sorting and Comparison**: The characters of the combined string and the pile string (`s3`) are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions of both strings are identical, it confirms that the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities as the combined names, hence printing \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately verify the presence of all necessary letters without any extras, providing an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.",
