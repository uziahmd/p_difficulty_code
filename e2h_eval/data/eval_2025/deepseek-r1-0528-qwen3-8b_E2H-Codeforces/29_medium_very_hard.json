Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to process a series of string replacements (queries) on an initial string of digits, and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, note that the total length of all 'ti' in queries is at most 10^5, but the initial string s can be up to 10^5, and there can be up to 10^5 queries. We cannot do naive replacements (like replacing each occurrence one by one) because the string might become very long after many replacements.\n\n Important: The queries are applied in order. Each query says: replace every occurrence of a digit d in the current string with a string t (which can be empty). But note: if we do the replacement naively, the string could blow up.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"222\", then two queries: \n        \"2->0\", then \"0->7\"\n   First query: \"222\" becomes \"000\", then second query: \"000\" becomes \"777\".\n\n However, note that the second query replaces '0', so the first replacement introduces zeros which then get replaced.\n\n But also note: the replacement is done for every occurrence of the digit. And we have to do the queries in the given order.\n\n The challenge: \n   - The string may become very long (but note: the total length of all ti's is bounded by 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5). However, the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. But note: each query replaces one digit (so initially there are at most 10^5 digits). But after replacement, the string grows, and then we do next replacement. \n\n However, the constraints say that the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5. This means that the expansion from the queries is limited by the fact that we don't use the same digit multiple times? Actually, note: the replacement is done sequentially, and the same digit might appear again and again. But the problem states: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. This is the key: we are only allowed to output 10^5 characters in total for all the replacement strings. \n\n But wait: if we do 10^5 queries, and each ti has average length 1, then 10^5 * 1 = 10^5, so that's acceptable. However, the main issue is that we cannot build a huge string because the replacement of one digit might introduce many new digits that then get replaced by subsequent queries.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We are only interested in the final number modulo 1000000007.\n\n Observation: The operations are independent for each digit. Moreover, the transformation is applied sequentially. We can precompute for each digit (from '0' to '9') what its final representation is, but the catch is that the queries are applied in order and a later query might override an earlier one? Actually, no: the queries are applied in the order given. But note: the same digit might be replaced multiple times in different queries? Actually, the queries are about replacing a specific digit. For example, we might have:\n\n   Query 1: \"1->2\"\n   Query 2: \"2->3\"\n\n Then the digit '1' is first replaced by '2', and then every '2' is replaced by '3'. So the effect is that '1' becomes '3'.\n\n However, the problem says: the queries are written in the order which need to be performed. So we must process them sequentially.\n\n But note: the input string s is transformed by the first query, then the second query is applied to the result of the first, etc.\n\n However, the direct simulation would be too slow if we do:\n\n   for each query:\n        for each occurrence of the digit di in the current string:\n            replace it with ti\n\n Because the string can become very long.\n\n We need a more efficient method.\n\n Idea: Instead of processing the entire string, we can process each digit independently and track the transformation of each digit over the queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied sequentially, and the replacement of one digit might introduce multiple digits (or even the same digit again). So we have to consider the entire transformation chain.\n\n However, the problem is that the queries are applied to the entire string, and the same digit might be replaced in multiple queries.\n\n Let me reframe: We have 10 digits (0-9). Each query is: take a digit d and replace it with a string t (which is composed of digits). Then the next query might change some of the digits in t.\n\n We can precompute for each digit what it becomes after all the queries. But note: the queries are applied in order, so the transformation of a digit depends on the entire sequence of queries.\n\n But note: once a digit is replaced, the replacement string is fixed. Then, if a subsequent query changes one of the digits in the replacement string, that will affect the final outcome.\n\n However, the queries are given and we have to apply them in order. There are up to 10^5 queries, and the initial string is 10^5. We cannot simulate each character.\n\n Alternative approach: dynamic programming or state machine for each digit.\n\n We can process the queries backwards. Why backwards? Because the last query is the one that is applied last, and we want to know the final effect of each digit.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied sequentially, and each query replaces a specific digit. We can think of the transformation as:\n\n   Let f_i(d) be the string that the digit d becomes after the i-th query (and all subsequent queries). But we don't know the subsequent queries.\n\n Alternatively, we can process the queries in reverse order and update the transformation for each digit.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let T be an array (or list) of 10 digits (each representing a mapping from a digit to a string). Initially, T[d] = d (the digit itself).\n\n   Then, we are going to process the queries in reverse order. For each query (d -> t) from last to first:\n\n        For each digit in the original set (0-9), we look at the current transformation (which is the result after all the queries that we have already processed in reverse, i.e., the ones that come after the current one in the forward order). \n\n        Specifically, for each digit c (0-9), we have a current representation (a string) which is the result of applying all the subsequent queries. Now, if the query (d -> t) is applied, then in the current representation of c, every occurrence of the digit d must be replaced by t (as per the current transformation of d? Wait, no: the query (d->t) is being undone? Actually, we are building the transformation from the end to the beginning.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        We start from the last query and go backwards. For each query, we update the transformations for all digits.\n\n        Initially, after all queries, what is the representation of each digit? It is the result of applying all the queries. But we don't know that. Alternatively, we can set up:\n\n        Let F be an array (for digits 0-9) where F[d] is a function (or a string) that represents the transformation of d after all the queries. However, note: the transformation of d is not just a single digit, but a string of digits. Then, when we apply a query (d_i -> t_i) we are replacing every occurrence of the digit d_i in the entire string by t_i. But note: the transformation of d_i might be affected by previous queries (if we process backwards) but actually we are processing backwards and updating the representation of the digits.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            Let ans[d] be the final string for the digit d (after processing all queries). Then, the overall string is the concatenation of ans[c] for each digit c in the initial string.\n\n        How to compute ans[d]?\n\n        We process queries in reverse order. For each query (d0 -> t0) (which is the last query), we update:\n\n            For each digit d in '0' to '9':\n                Let s_d = ans[d]   (this is the current representation of d after processing all the queries that came after this one)\n                Then, in s_d, we must replace every occurrence of the digit d0 by t0 (because the last query is d0->t0, so any d0 in the representation of d should be replaced by t0).\n\n            Then, we set ans[d0] = the string t0? Not exactly: because the representation for d0 is now t0, but then we have to remember that t0 might contain digits that are subject to subsequent queries (which we have already processed in reverse). Actually, we are processing backwards, so we have already updated the representations for the digits that appear in t0 (because we are going from last query to the first). So we can update:\n\n            For each digit d (0-9):\n                ans[d] = the current representation (which includes the effect of the future queries, i.e., the ones that we haven't processed yet in the forward order, but we have processed in reverse)\n\n            Then, when we see a query (d0->t0), we update:\n\n                ans[d0] = t0   [But wait, no: because we are processing backwards, the query d0->t0 was the last one, so the representation for d0 is t0, but then we must also update the other digits: in their representation, every occurrence of d0 must be replaced by t0 (because the last operation was d0->t0)].\n\n            However, note: the query d0->t0 replaces d0 by t0. Then, if we have a digit d, and its current representation is a string that contains d0, then that d0 must be replaced by t0 (because the last operation was d0->t0). But then, if we update the representation for d0 to t0, then we have to update the representations for all digits that currently contain d0.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Initialize an array `mapping` for each digit from '0' to '9'. Let `ans` be a list of 10 strings, where `ans[i]` is the final representation of the digit str(i). Initially, `ans[i] = str(i)`.\n\n            Step 2: Read the queries and store them.\n\n            Step 3: Process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each query (d0 -> t0):\n\n                    For each digit i in range(0,10):\n                        In the current `ans[i]`, we need to replace every occurrence of the digit d0 (which is a char) by the string t0 (which we have to consider as the representation that d0 has been transformed into by the subsequent queries). But wait: actually, the subsequent queries have already been processed (because we are going backwards) so the representation of d0 is already updated to account for the queries after the current one? \n\n                    Actually, we are going to update the representation for d0 first: set `ans[int(d0)] = t0`? No, because the query says to replace d0 by t0, and then the subsequent queries (which we have already processed) have already transformed t0 appropriately? \n\n            Let me explain:\n\n                Suppose we have two queries (in forward order):\n                    Query1: d0 -> t0\n                    Query2: d1 -> t1\n\n                Then, in forward order, we first do Query1, then Query2.\n\n                We are processing backwards: first Query2, then Query1.\n\n                After processing Query2 (the last query), we update:\n\n                    For each digit i, replace every occurrence of d1 in `ans[i]` by `ans[d1]` (which is the representation of d1 after Query2 and all after, but since Query2 is the last, then `ans[d1]` is just the string t1? Actually, no: we haven't updated d1 for Query2 because Query2 is about d1, so we update d1's representation to t1, and then update others.\n\n                Actually, we should do:\n\n                    For each query (in reverse order) we update:\n\n                        Let d0 = the digit in the query (char)\n                        Let t0 = the replacement string\n\n                        Then, we set `ans[int(d0)] = t0`? Not exactly: because the representation for d0 is now t0, but note: in the next (earlier) queries, when we see d0, we will use the current `ans[d0]` (which is t0) and then replace the digits in t0 according to the earlier queries? \n\n                Actually, we are building the transformation from the end. The idea is:\n\n                    The final representation for each digit is built from the last query and then we go backwards.\n\n                Standard solution for such problems (like transforming digits with a series of replacements) is to process the queries in reverse and update the representation for the digit being replaced.\n\n                Steps for reverse processing:\n\n                    Let rep[0..9] be the current representation for each digit (initially rep[i] = str(i))\n\n                    For each query (from last to first): (query is \"d->t\")\n                        d_char = d, t_str = t\n\n                        We update the representation for the digit d: rep[digit(d)] = t_str   (but then we must also update the other digits: because in their representation, there might be the digit d, which now should be replaced by t_str)\n\n                    However, note: the replacement is applied to the entire current representation. So we do:\n\n                        For each digit i (0-9), we update rep[i] by replacing every occurrence of d_char in rep[i] by rep[digit(d_char)] (which is the current representation for d_char). But wait, we just set rep[digit(d_char)] to t_str, so we can update:\n\n                        Actually, we do:\n\n                            Step 1: Set rep[digit(d_char)] = t_str   (this is the direct replacement for d_char)\n\n                            Step 2: Then, for each digit i (0-9), we update rep[i] by replacing every occurrence of d_char in rep[i] by rep[digit(d_char)] (which is t_str). But note: rep[digit(d_char)] is the current representation of d_char, which is t_str.\n\n                        However, note: the representation of d_char might contain digits that have been transformed by later queries (which we have already processed). But that's okay because we are processing backwards.\n\n                    But wait, the above two steps are not independent: we set rep[d_char] = t_str, and then we update every rep[i] by replacing d_char by t_str. But then, we are effectively saying: the digit d_char becomes t_str, and then we propagate that to every other digit.\n\n                    However, the problem is that the total length of all t_str is 10^5, but the representations for digits might become very long. And we have 10 digits, so we are doing 10 updates for each query, and each update might be long.\n\n                    The total length of all representations might be large.\n\n                Alternative: we don't explicitly store the entire representation string for each digit. Instead, we can store the transformation as a function that maps a digit to a value (the numeric value of the representation) and the length (so that we can combine numbers). But note: the problem requires the entire string (with leading zeros) and then the number mod 1000000007.\n\n                However, the problem is that the string might have leading zeros and the numeric value is the entire decimal number. But note: the problem says \"ignore the leading zeros\", but actually the representation is the string of digits (including leading zeros) and then we interpret that as a decimal number (which ignores the leading zeros). But wait, the problem says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\". \n\n                Actually, the problem does not remove the leading zeros from the string during replacement; it says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\" when forming the number. So if the string is \"00123\", then the number is 123.\n\n                But note: the example \"222\" becomes \"000\" then \"777\", and the answer is 777. In the example, the intermediate step produces zeros, but then they are replaced by non-zero digits. However, if we have a final string that is \"000\", then the number is 0.\n\n                So we need to compute the entire number from the final string, but the string can be very long (though the total length of replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion might be exponential? Actually, the problem says the total length of all ti's is 10^5, but the initial string is 10^5, and the replacements might expand the string. However, the constraint is only on the sum of the lengths of the ti's, not on the final string length.\n\n                But note: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. That is, the replacement strings provided in the queries have total length <= 10^5. However, the replacements themselves might generate longer strings because one replacement might be expanded multiple times.\n\n                But the problem says: the initial string has length at least 1 and at most 10^5, and the queries are up to 10^5, and the sum of the lengths of ti's is 10^5.\n\n                We cannot build the entire string if it becomes too long (like billions of digits). Therefore, we must compute the number modulo 1000000007 without constructing the entire string.\n\n                We need to compute the value of the final string (ignoring leading zeros) modulo 1000000007.\n\n                Another idea: we can process the initial string and the queries in a way that we don't expand the entire string.\n\n                We can use dynamic programming that works on the initial string and the queries, but we need to account for the fact that a digit might be replaced by a string that itself contains digits to be replaced.\n\n                However, note that the queries are applied sequentially, and the same digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n                Standard approach for such transformation problems (like https://codeforces.com/contest/828/problem/C) is to use a system of equations for the value and the length of the representation for each digit.\n\n                Let's define for each digit d (0-9) two values:\n\n                  val[d] = the numeric value (mod 1000000007) of the final representation of the digit d.\n                  len[d] = the length (number of digits) of the final representation of the digit d.\n\n                Then, the entire string s is transformed, and we can compute the overall value and length.\n\n                But note: the replacement is applied to the entire string, and the digits are independent. However, the value of a string is computed from left to right.\n\n                How to combine?\n\n                  Suppose we have a digit d, which is replaced by a string t. Then, the value contributed by d is:\n\n                    value = (the value of the entire string t) * (10^(remaining_length)) + ... ?\n\n                Actually, we can process the entire string by breaking it down by the initial digits and the transformations.\n\n                However, the problem is that the transformation of a digit d is itself a string that might be broken into several digits, and those digits are transformed by subsequent queries.\n\n                But note: the queries are applied in order, and the transformation of a digit is defined by the entire sequence of queries. We can precompute for each digit d (0-9) the final representation as a string? But the string might be too long.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n                  Let f(d) be the final representation (as a string) of the digit d. Then, the entire string is the concatenation of f(c) for each digit c in the initial string.\n\n                Then, the number is the integer represented by that concatenated string (ignoring leading zeros, but note: the entire string might have leading zeros, but we ignore them only if they are at the beginning? Actually, the entire string is the decimal representation, so leading zeros are ignored, but the rest are part of the number.\n\n                Example: \"00123\" becomes 123.\n\n                However, the modulus is 1000000007, and the string can be very long. We cannot convert the entire string to an integer if it has millions of digits.\n\n                We need to compute the value of the entire string (with base 10) mod 1000000007.\n\n                We can use:\n\n                  value = 0\n                  for each character c in the final string:\n                      value = (value * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\n                But the final string might be too long (exponentially long in the worst case?).\n\n                But note: the constraint says the total length of all ti's is 10^5, but the expansion is done by the queries. However, the total expansion might be large. But the problem says the sum of the lengths of the ti's is 10^5, but note that the initial string is 10^5, and each digit is replaced by a string, and then the digits in the replacement string are replaced again.\n\n                However, the problem states that the total length of all ti's is 10^5. This is the key: the replacement strings provided are short (each ti is a string of digits, and the total length of all these strings is 10^5). But the expansion factor is the product of the lengths of the replacements? \n\n                Actually, the expansion is multiplicative: one digit can be replaced by a string of length L, then each digit in that string can be replaced by a string of length M, etc.\n\n                The maximum expansion factor might be huge (like 10^5^100000) which is way beyond the limits.\n\n                Therefore, we must use the functional representation (value and length) for each digit.\n\n                Let:\n\n                  MOD = 1000000007\n\n                  For each digit d (0-9), we maintain:\n                    val[d] = the value of the entire final representation of d (mod MOD)\n                    len[d] = the length (number of digits) of the entire final representation of d\n\n                How to update?\n\n                  Initially, for d from 0 to 9:\n                    val[d] = d\n                    len[d] = 1\n\n                  Then, we process the queries in reverse order. For a query (d0 -> t0):\n\n                    Let d0_int = int(d0)\n\n                    Then, the representation for d0 becomes the string t0. But wait, the string t0 is composed of digits, and each digit in t0 has already been transformed by the subsequent queries (which we have processed). So the representation for d0 is the concatenation of the representations of each digit in t0.\n\n                    Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                      val_new[d0] = 0\n                      len_new[d0] = 0\n\n                      For each char c in t0:\n                          digit_c = int(c)\n                          val_new[d0] = (val_new[d0] * pow(10, len[digit_c], MOD) + val[digit_c]) % MOD\n                          len_new[d0] = (len_new[d0] + len[digit_c]) % (MOD-1)   # But wait, the length is just the sum, and we are using modulo for exponentiation, but the modulus for length is not MOD, because we are using it in exponentiation for base 10. However, the length can be huge, but note: the modulus for exponentiation is MOD, and the exponent (length) is used modulo (MOD-1) because of Euler's theorem? But wait, base 10 and modulus 1000000007 is prime, so we can reduce exponents modulo 1000000006 (Euler totient) for base 10? However, the length might be astronomically large, so we must keep the length modulo 1000000006? But note: the length is used as an exponent in base 10, and we are computing:\n\n                              value = (value_so_far * (10^L) + v) % MOD\n\n                      However, the length is not taken modulo MOD, but we cannot compute 10^(a huge number) without modular exponentiation with modulus MOD and exponent reduction modulo φ(MOD) (which is 1000000006). But note: the length is the number of digits, and we are using it as an exponent. So we must store the length modulo 1000000006? But wait, the length is additive and we are combining the digits.\n\n                    But note: the length is just the total number of digits, and we are using it in the exponentiation. However, the exponent (length) can be huge (more than 10^18) so we must store it modulo 1000000006 (the totient of 1000000007) because of Euler's theorem for base 10. But note: Euler's theorem requires the exponent to be reduced modulo φ(MOD) for the base and modulus coprime. 10 and 1000000007 are coprime? Yes, because 1000000007 is prime and doesn't divide 10.\n\n                    However, we are building the value from left to right. The value for a string is:\n\n                          value = 0\n                          for i in range(len(s)):\n                              value = (value * 10 + int(s[i])) % MOD\n\n                    We can break the string into parts, but the standard way is to use:\n\n                          value(t0) = sum_{j=0}^{L-1} (digit_j * 10^(L-1-j)) mod MOD\n\n                    But we are building from the representation of each digit.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can compute the value for a string t0 as:\n\n                          value(t0) = 0\n                          for c in t0:\n                              value(t0) = (value(t0) * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\n                    But then, we must use the updated representations for each digit in t0.\n\n                    Steps for the query (d0 -> t0) in reverse processing:\n\n                      Step 1: For each digit d (0-9), we update: \n                              val[d] = (val[d] * pow(10, len[d0], MOD) + val[d0]) % MOD   ??? \n\n                      No, wait: we are processing the query (d0->t0) in reverse order. This query says that in the forward order, d0 is replaced by t0. But we are building from the end (last query) to the beginning (first query). So the last query is d0->t0, meaning that the final representation for d0 is t0 (and then we update the other digits to account for this: because in the final representation, every d0 is replaced by t0).\n\n                      Actually, we are going to set the representation for d0 to be the string t0, but then we must update the value and length of d0 from the string t0, considering that the string t0 is composed of digits that have already been transformed (by the subsequent queries, which we have already processed).\n\n                      So:\n\n                          Let new_val = 0\n                          Let new_len = 0\n\n                          For each character c in t0:\n                              digit = int(c)\n                              new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD\n                              new_len = (new_len + len[digit]) % (MOD-1)   # But wait, the length is additive, and we are using it in exponentiation. However, the modulus for the exponent is 1000000006 (φ(MOD)), so we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n                      Then, set:\n                          val[d0_int] = new_val\n                          len[d0_int] = new_len\n\n                      Then, we must update the other digits: for each digit d (0-9), we have to update their representations because they might contain d0. But wait, no: in the reverse processing, we are updating the representation for d0 and then we update the other digits by replacing d0 with the new representation (which is t0) in their own representation.\n\n                      However, note: the other digits' representations are built from the current val and len arrays. We don't store the entire string, so we cannot simply replace d0 by t0 in the string. But we have the functional representation.\n\n                      Actually, the representation for a digit d is defined by the entire sequence of queries. The value and length of d are built from the digits in its replacement string (if any) and then the queries that follow. But we are processing the queries in reverse, so we have updated the representations for the digits that were transformed by the queries that occur after the current one.\n\n                      Now, the current representation for d0 is the string t0 (with the subsequent queries applied). But for other digits, their representation is still the one from the last query (i.e., the last query we processed). However, the representation for a digit d is the entire transformation from the beginning until the end. But we are updating the representations for the digits as we go backwards.\n\n                      Actually, we must update all digits that contain d0 in their representation. But wait, we are storing the value and length for each digit independently. How do we update the other digits?\n\n                      Consider: the representation for a digit d is built from the string that is the result of replacing d by the replacement string (if d is replaced) and then applying the subsequent queries. But note: the queries are applied to the entire string. So the representation for d is:\n\n                          If there is a query for d, then it is replaced by the corresponding t, and then the subsequent queries are applied to t.\n\n                      We are processing the queries in reverse, so the last query is the one that directly transforms d0. Then, the query before the last one: if it transforms a digit that appears in t0, then we have already updated that digit.\n\n                      But how do we update the other digits? \n\n                      Actually, we don't update the other digits by replacing d0 in their representation. Instead, we are storing for each digit the value and length that it has after all queries. The entire transformation is fixed by the queries. \n\n                      However, consider: the representation for a digit d is built from the queries that target d or that target digits that d eventually expands to. But we are processing the queries in reverse, so we update the representation for d0 (the digit being replaced) and then we must update the digits that were replaced by a string containing d0.\n\n                      But note: the representation for a digit d is computed from the replacement string (if any) and the subsequent queries. The representation for d is independent of the queries that happen before d's replacement? Actually, no: the replacement for d happens at a certain query, and then the subsequent queries transform the string produced by d's replacement.\n\n                      However, we are processing from the last query to the first. The last query is the one that is applied last, so the representation of a digit d is built from the last query that targets d (if any) and then the subsequent queries (which we have already processed). \n\n                      But wait: the queries are applied in forward order. The last query is the one that is applied last. So the representation for a digit d is:\n\n                          Let Q_d be the set of queries (from the last one to the first) that target d. Then, the representation for d is the result of replacing d by the replacement string from the last query that targets d, and then recursively replacing the digits in that string by the representations (from the subsequent queries) of those digits.\n\n                      We can precompute the final representation for each digit by processing the queries in reverse, but we don't store the entire string, only the value and length.\n\n                      Steps for reverse processing:\n\n                          Let val[0..9] = [0,1,...,9] (each digit d has value d and length 1)\n                          Let len_arr[0..9] = [1]*10\n\n                          We store the queries in a list and then process from last to first.\n\n                          For each query (d0, t0) in reverse_queries:\n\n                              Let d0_int = ord(d0) - ord('0')\n\n                              We are going to update the representation for d0_int to be the string t0 (with the subsequent queries already applied). But wait, no: the string t0 is the replacement string, and then the subsequent queries (which we have processed) have transformed the digits in t0. So we can compute the value and length for the string t0 by:\n\n                                  new_val = 0\n                                  new_len = 0\n                                  for c in t0:\n                                      digit = ord(c) - ord('0')\n                                      # The current representation for this digit is val[digit] and len_arr[digit]\n                                      new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len_arr[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD\n                                      new_len = (new_len + len_arr[digit]) % (MOD-1)   # But note: the length is additive and we are using it in exponentiation, so we must reduce modulo φ(MOD)=1000000006 for the exponent.\n\n                              Then, set:\n                                  val[d0_int] = new_val\n                                  len_arr[d0_int] = new_len\n\n                              Then, we must update the other digits? \n\n                          But wait, the other digits are not updated. The representation for a digit d is built from the last query that targets d. However, if a digit d is never targeted by a query, then its representation remains the initial one.\n\n                          But consider: a digit d might be contained in the replacement string of another digit. Then, when we update the representation for that other digit, we use the updated representation for d? \n\n                          Actually, no: because we are processing the queries in reverse, and the representation for a digit d is only changed if there is a query that targets d. However, the queries are applied sequentially, and a digit d might appear in the replacement string of a query for a different digit, and then we must update the value and length of d? \n\n                          Let me clarify with an example:\n\n                            Initial string: \"12\"\n                            Queries: \n                                Query1: \"1->2\"\n                                Query2: \"2->3\"\n\n                            We process queries in reverse order: first Query2, then Query1.\n\n                            For Query2 (last query): d0='2', t0='3'\n                                new_val for '2': \n                                    c='3' -> digit=3, val[3]=3, len_arr[3]=1\n                                    new_val = (0 * 10^1 + 3) % MOD = 3\n                                    new_len = 1\n                                Then, set val[2]=3, len_arr[2]=1.\n\n                            Then, Query1: d0='1', t0='2'\n                                new_val for '1': \n                                    c='2' -> digit=2, val[2]=3, len_arr[2]=1\n                                    new_val = (0 * 10^1 + 3) % MOD = 3\n                                    new_len = 1\n                                Then, set val[1]=3, len_arr[1]=1.\n\n                            Then, the initial string \"12\": \n                                digit '1': val=3, len=1\n                                digit '2': val=3, len=1\n                                Total value = (3 * 10^1 + 3) % MOD = 33.\n\n                            But the expected transformation:\n\n                                Forward: \n                                    Start with \"12\"\n                                    Query1: replace '1' by '2' -> \"22\"\n                                    Query2: replace '2' by '3' -> \"33\"\n\n                            So 33 is correct.\n\n                          Now, what if a digit appears in the replacement string of a query that is not its own?\n\n                            Example: \n                                Query1: \"1->2\"\n                                Query2: \"2->3\"\n                                Query3: \"3->4\"\n\n                            Reverse processing:\n\n                                Query3: d0='3', t0='4'\n                                    new_val: digit '4' -> val[4]=4, len_arr[4]=1 -> val[3]=4, len_arr[3]=1.\n\n                                Query2: d0='2', t0='3'\n                                    new_val: digit '3' -> val[3]=4, len_arr[3]=1 -> val[2]= (0*10^1+4)=4, len_arr[2]=1.\n\n                                Query1: d0='1', t0='2'\n                                    new_val: digit '2' -> val[2]=4, len_arr[2]=1 -> val[1]=4, len_arr[1]=1.\n\n                            Then, the initial string \"1\" becomes 4.\n\n                            Expected: \n                                Query1: \"1\"->\"2\"\n                                Query2: \"2\"->\"3\"\n                                Query3: \"3\"->\"4\"\n                                So indeed 4.\n\n                          But what if the replacement string for a query contains multiple digits that have been updated?\n\n                            Example:\n                                Query1: \"1->23\"\n                                Query2: \"2->4\", \"3->5\"\n\n                            Reverse processing:\n\n                                Query2: d0='2', t0='4'\n                                    val",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacements on an initial digit string and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing potentially very large intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit in the current string with another string of digits. The key observation is that each query affects the entire string, and subsequent queries can further modify the digits introduced by previous replacements. Directly processing each query by scanning and replacing digits in the string would be too slow for large inputs due to potential exponential growth in string length.\n\n2. **Insight**: Instead of processing the string directly, we can model the effect of all queries on each digit (0-9) individually. For each digit, we track its final value and the length of its representation after all queries. This allows us to compute the overall value of the transformed string by combining the contributions of each digit in the original string.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a reverse processing approach for the queries. Starting from the last query to the first, we update the value and length of the digit being replaced. For each query, the replacement string's value and length are computed based on the current representations of its constituent digits. This ensures that all subsequent transformations (queries applied after the current one) are already accounted for.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each query once in reverse order. For each query, it processes each character in the replacement string once, updating the digit's value and length. Given that the total length of all replacement strings is up to 10^5, the overall complexity is O(N + M), where N is the length of the initial string and M is the sum of lengths of all replacement strings. This is efficient and feasible for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nMOD_exp = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        queries.append((d, t_str))\n    \n    val_arr = [i for i in range(10)]\n    len_arr = [1] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(9, -1, -1):\n        val_arr[i] %= MOD\n        len_arr[i] %= MOD_exp\n        \n    for d_char, t_str in reversed(queries):\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        for char in t_str:\n            digit = int(char)\n            power = pow(10, len_arr[digit], MOD)\n            new_val = (new_val * power + val_arr[digit]) % MOD\n            new_len = (new_len + len_arr[digit]) % MOD_exp\n        val_arr[d_int] = new_val\n        len_arr[d_int] = new_len\n\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        digit = int(char)\n        power = pow(10, len_arr[digit], MOD)\n        result = (result * power + val_arr[digit]) % MOD\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from input. Each query is parsed into a digit and its replacement string.\n2. **Tracking Transformations**: Arrays `val_arr` and `len_arr` store the final value and length of each digit's representation after all queries. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n3. **Reverse Query Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the digit's replacement string is processed to compute its new value and length based on the current transformations of its constituent digits.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The initial string is transformed by replacing each digit with its final representation. The overall value is computed by combining these representations using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the number represented by the transformed string modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations without explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, leveraging modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable.",
