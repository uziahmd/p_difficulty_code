The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 10^18) and we need to determine if there exists an integer k>1 such that a snowflake with n vertices can be constructed.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the snowflake is constructed in layers (steps). The construction process:\n\n1. Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n2. Then, at step 1, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. So total vertices now: 1 + k.\n3. Then, at step 2, each of the k leaves (each vertex that was added at step 1 and has degree 1) will connect to k new vertices. But note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k more new vertices. And this step should be done at least once.\n\nHowever, note that the example for k=4 gives the smallest snowflake. Let's break down:\n\n- Step 0: 1 vertex.\n- Step 1: add k=4 -> total 5.\n- Then, the condition requires at least one more step? Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added... Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\nWait, note: the initial step (step 1) is mandatory (because we start from the center and then we do the expansion). Then the second part says \"this step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire process of adding at least two steps? Actually, reading again:\n\n\"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the entire process must have at least two expansions? Or is the first expansion (step 1) and then the second expansion (step 2) the minimum?\n\nBut note: the example for k=4 is drawn and it shows a center and 4 arms, each arm having 3 additional nodes (so total nodes = 1 + 4 + 4*4 + 4*4*4? Wait, no, let me think.\n\nActually, the example says \"the smallest possible snowflake for k=4\". The smallest one would be after the first expansion (step 1) and then doing the step at least once (meaning step 2). So:\n\n- Step0: 1 node.\n- Step1: add 4 -> total 5.\n- Step2: each of the 4 leaves (from step1) adds 4 new ones -> so 4*4 = 16 more nodes. Then total = 1+4+16 = 21.\n\nBut wait, the example output says that n=13 and n=15 are YES. Let's check:\n\nActually, the problem does not specify the number of layers (expansions) but at least two (including the first expansion). However, note the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of the leaves (the second step) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two layers: the center, then the first layer (k nodes), then the second layer (k*k nodes). So total nodes = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, what if we do more than two layers? Then the total number of vertices would be:\n\n1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^t   (for t>=2, because at least two expansions: t=0: just the center, then t=1: first expansion, t=2: second expansion)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" gets expanded. In the two-layer snowflake, after the second expansion, the leaves at the second layer (which are connected to only one vertex) are not expanded because we stop? Or do we require that the expansion is done until we have at least two layers?\n\nActually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the process is:\n- Start with the center (step0).\n- Then, we must do the expansion from the center (step1) and then we must do at least one expansion from the leaves (step2).\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the number of expansions beyond the minimal two. However, we are allowed to do more than two? The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves (the step described) must be performed at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is two (center expansion and one leaf expansion). Then, we can do more.\n\nTherefore, the total number of vertices in the snowflake is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^t   for some t >= 2 (since we must do the expansion from leaves at least once, so t>=2).\n\nBut note: the first expansion (from the center) is mandatory (k>1) and then the next expansion (from the leaves) is mandatory at least once.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the process as:\n\n- Level0: 1 node (center)\n- Level1: k nodes\n- Level2: k^2 nodes\n- ...\n- LevelL: k^L nodes\n\nAnd the total nodes = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L, where L>=2 (so we have at least two layers of expansion beyond the center).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (which are the leaves at the current maximum level) is expanded. However, the problem does not specify that we must expand all leaves in every step. But note: the construction is defined as: we do the expansion (from the leaves) at least once. So we must have at least two layers (levels 0,1,2).\n\nBut note: the example input includes n=1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101,1000000000000000000.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFor n=1: \n  Only the center. But the problem says k>1 and the first expansion is required (initial expansion from center) and then the expansion from leaves at least once. So n=1 is too small.\n\nFor n=2: \n  We must have the center and then the first expansion (k=2) and then the expansion from leaves at least once. That would be 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7. But wait, maybe we can stop after the first expansion? The problem says the expansion from leaves must be done at least once, so we cannot stop at the first expansion. Therefore, n=2 is not valid.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once\" referring to the expansion from leaves. So the minimal snowflake has two layers (center, then the first ring, then the second ring). Therefore, the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2, with k>=2.\n\nSo n_min = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nBut the example output says:\n  1: NO\n  2: NO\n  3: NO\n  6: NO\n  13: YES\n  15: YES\n  255: YES\n  10101: YES\n  1000000000000000000: NO\n\nWait, 13 and 15 are YES. Let me see:\n\nIf we consider more than two layers? Actually, the problem doesn't say we have to stop at two layers. We can have any number of layers (at least two). So the total number of vertices is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L   for some L>=2 and k>=2.\n\nBut note: we could also consider that the expansion from leaves might be done only partially? Actually, the problem states that in each step, we take every leaf (vertex with degree 1) and connect each to k new vertices. So it's a complete expansion at each layer.\n\nNow, let's express n as:\n\nn = (k^(L+1) - 1) / (k-1)   [geometric series]\n\nBut note: we must have L>=2, so the minimal representation is for L=2: n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, what if we have three layers? Then n = (k^4-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\nSo we are looking for integers k>=2 and integer L>=2 (with L being the number of expansions from leaves, so the exponent goes to L+1) such that:\n\nn = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the problem does not fix L. So for a given n, we need to check if there exists an integer k>=2 and an integer L>=2 such that:\n\nn = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the above formula is for a geometric series with ratio k and L+1 terms (from exponent 0 to L). Alternatively, we can write:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L, with L>=2.\n\nHowever, note: the minimal expansion is two layers (so L=2, then we have three terms: exponents 0,1,2) but wait, our expansion:\n\n- Layer0 (center): k^0\n- Layer1: k^1\n- Layer2: k^2\n\nSo we have three layers (if we count the center as layer0) and then we require at least two expansions (so the process goes up to layer2). Therefore, L (the highest exponent) is 2, so the series has 3 terms.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves (the second expansion) is done at least once. So the highest layer we get is layer2 (if we count the center as layer0, then two expansions: layer1 and layer2). Therefore, the minimal representation is for L=2 (three terms). But we can also have more layers.\n\nSo n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) for L>=2 (where L is the last exponent, so the number of layers is L+1, but the expansion steps are L+1? Actually, the expansion steps: \n- Step0: center (no expansion from center? Actually, the center is already there. The first expansion is step1, then step2, etc.)\n\nBut the formula holds for the sum of a geometric series with (L+1) terms (exponents 0 to L). So we require L>=2.\n\nBut note: the problem allows more than two layers (any L>=2). So we are to check if n can be written as a geometric series with base k>=2 and at least 3 terms (so at least exponents 0,1,2).\n\nHowever, note: the problem does not require that the entire series must have consecutive exponents? Actually, the construction is fixed: we expand all leaves at each step. So the total number of vertices is always a geometric series with ratio k and a fixed number of terms (from 0 to L).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" This implies that we expand all leaves at the same time (in a breadth-first manner). Therefore, the structure is exactly a rooted tree with branching factor k and depth L (with root at depth0, then depth1, depth2, ..., depthL). The total number of nodes is then:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L.\n\nBut wait, the example k=4 and minimal snowflake: the example drawing (if I recall correctly) has the center, then 4 nodes, then each of those 4 nodes has 4 children, so 4*4=16, total 1+4+16=21. But the example output says 13 and 15 are YES. \n\nLet me check 13 and 15:\n\nWhat k and L can give 13 or 15?\n\nFirst, 13: \n  Is there k>=2 and L>=2 such that (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)=13?\n\nWe can try small k and L.\n\nk=2: \n  L=2: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7\n  L=3: (2^4-1)/1=15 -> that's 15, which is the next one.\n\nk=3:\n  L=2: (3^3-1)/2 = (27-1)/2=13 -> yes.\n\nk=4:\n  L=2: (4^3-1)/3 = (64-1)/3=63/3=21.\n\nSo 13 and 15 are both YES.\n\nSimilarly, 255: \n  k=2, L=7: (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255 -> YES.\n\nBut 1000000000000000000 is NO.\n\nHow to solve for n up to 10^18?\n\nWe cannot iterate over k from 2 to ... because k can be very large (but note: the minimal term is 1+k+k^2, so for k=2, the minimal is 7; for k=3, minimal is 13; for k=4, minimal is 21, etc.)\n\nBut note: the geometric series formula: n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>=2 and L>=2.\n\nWe can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: n is the sum of a geometric series with exactly 3 terms (L=2): then n = 1 + k + k^2 = k^2 + k + 1.\n\nCase 2: n is the sum of a geometric series with more than 3 terms (L>=3): then n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\nBut note: the problem does not fix the number of layers. However, we can also consider that the representation might be unique? Actually, a number n might be represented in multiple ways (for example, 15 can be represented as (k=2, L=3) and also as (k=14, L=2)? Let's check:\n\nFor k=14, L=2: 1 + 14 + 14^2 = 1+14+196=211, which is not 15.\n\nBut 15 is represented by k=2 and L=3: 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nSo we must consider all L>=2.\n\nHow to check for a given n?\n\nNote: n can be as large as 10^18.\n\nWe can try to fix the base k? But k can be as large as about n^(1/2) for the two-term expansion (L=2) but actually k can be as large as about n^(1/(L+1)) and L can be as large as about log_k(n). But we have to consider multiple bases.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSince the geometric series must have at least three terms (L>=2, so at least three: 1, k, k^2), then for a fixed n, we can consider:\n\n1. Check if n is of the form 1 + k + k^2 (for some integer k>=2). Then we can solve k^2+k+1 = n.\n\n   k^2 + k + (1-n) = 0.\n\n   Discriminant d = 1 - 4*(1-n) = 4*n-3.\n\n   Then k = (-1 + sqrt(d)) / 2 must be an integer and >=2.\n\n2. Otherwise, check for L>=3. But note: for L>=3, the geometric series has more than 3 terms.\n\nBut note: the geometric series can be represented for any base k>=2 and any depth L>=2. However, we cannot iterate over all k and L because n is huge.\n\nAnother idea: for a fixed n, we can iterate over the possible exponents L (number of layers) from 2 up to a certain limit. How many layers? The maximum L is when k=2, then the number of terms is L+1, so n = (2^(L+1)-1) (which is about 2^(L+1)). Since n<=10^18, then 2^(L+1) <= 10^18 -> L+1 <= log2(10^18) which is about 60. So the maximum L is about 60.\n\nBut note: the base k might be larger than 2. However, the minimal n for base k and depth L is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L.\n\nWe can iterate over the possible depths L from 2 up to about 60 (or until the minimal n for base 2 exceeds 10^18). Then for a fixed L, we want to know: does there exist an integer k>=2 such that:\n\nn = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the equation (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nThis is equivalent to k^(L+1) - 1 = n*(k-1)\n\nOr: k^(L+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\nBut solving for k in this equation is non-trivial for large L and n.\n\nHowever, note that k must be an integer >=2. We can use binary search for k for a fixed L? But L is at most 60, so we can iterate over L from 2 to 60, and for each L, we can solve for k.\n\nBut note: the equation is a polynomial of degree L+1, but we can use the fact that k is an integer and we can use root finding. Alternatively, we can note that k must be at least 2 and at most around n (if L=2, then k is about sqrt(n) but for L>=3, k can be smaller).\n\nBut note: for a fixed L, the function f(k) = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>=2. So we can do a binary search for k in [2, n] (but n is up to 10^18, so we cannot iterate over k).\n\nBut note: the value of k for a fixed L is roughly the (L+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1. However, we can use an iterative method (like Newton-Raphson) to solve for k, but we must ensure integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: for fixed L, we can compute k as the floor of the (L+1)-th root of (n*(k-1)+1). But that seems circular.\n\nBut note: the geometric series: n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) => k^(L+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nWe can approximate k by:\n\nk ≈ (n * (k-1) + 1)^(1/(L+1))\n\nBut we don't know k. However, we can set an initial guess for k: since n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L, then k^L <= n, so k <= n^(1/L). But n can be as large as 10^18, and L>=2, so k <= 10^9 (if L=2, then k ~ sqrt(n) which is 1e9, but that's acceptable for binary search? No, because we are iterating over L from 2 to 60, and for each L we do a binary search for k, but the range for k is [2, n^(1/L)] which for L=2 is [2, 1e9] (which is 1e9 numbers) and we do 60 iterations, so worst-case 60 * log2(1e9) which is about 60 * 30 = 1800, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, we have t up to 10,000 test cases. We cannot iterate for each test case over L from 2 to 60 and then do a binary search for k over a range of size 1e9 (for L=2) because 10,000 * 1800 = 18e6, which is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but we must check the constraints.\n\nBut note: the problem says n can be up to 10^18. However, we are iterating over L from 2 to 60 (fixed) for each test case. Then for each L, we do a binary search for k from 2 to n**(1/L) (which is about 10^18^(1/L)).\n\nFor L=2: we are searching k from 2 to 10^9 (about 1e9) -> binary search takes about 30 steps per L, and L from 2 to 60 (59 values) so 59*30 = 1770 per test case.\n\nBut 10,000 test cases * 1770 = 17.7e6, which is acceptable in Python (if we code carefully).\n\nBut wait, we have to compute the geometric series for a given k and L and check if it equals n.\n\nHowever, note: we cannot compute k^L for k as large as 10^9 and L=2 (then k^2 is 10^18, which is acceptable) but for L=3, k is about 10^6 (because (10^6)^3 = 1e18) and so on. But note: the equation is:\n\nn = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe have to compute k^(L+1) for k up to 10^9 and L=2: then k^(3) = (10^9)^3 = 1e27, which is too big for standard integers? Actually, in Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but we are limited by the exponentiation and then division. Also, we are comparing with n (which is up to 10^18). \n\nBut note: if k is too large, then k^(L+1) might be astronomically large. However, we are using binary search for k, and we know that k must be at least 2 and at most n^(1/(L+1))? Actually, the series is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^L\n\nThe largest term is k^L, so k^L <= n, so k <= n**(1/L). Therefore, we can set the upper bound for k as min(n, n**(1/L)) but wait, for L=1, k<=n, but we are starting from L>=2. \n\nBut note: we are iterating L from 2 to 60. For a fixed L, the maximum k is floor(n**(1/L)). However, we have to be cautious: n can be as large as 10^18, and for L=2, k_max = floor(sqrt(n)) which is 10^9, and for L=3, k_max = floor(n**(1/3)) which is about 1e6, and for L=60, k_max is about 10^(18/60) which is about 10^(0.3) which is less than 2? Actually, wait: 10^18^(1/60) is (10^18)^(1/60) = 10^(18/60)=10^(0.3) which is about 2. But note: k>=2, so for L=60, k must be 2.\n\nBut wait, the equation: n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) for k=2, L=60: then n = (2^61-1)/1, which is about 2^61 ~ 2e18, which is bigger than 10^18. So we must set the upper bound for k to be such that the minimal term (k=2) is less than or equal to n, and then the maximal k is the floor of the (L)-th root of n? Actually, we have:\n\nk^L <= n   (because the last term is k^L and the series is positive and increasing)\n\nSo k <= n**(1/L)\n\nBut note: the entire series is 1+k+...+k^L, which is greater than k^L. But we can use k <= n**(1/L) as an upper bound.\n\nBut wait: the series: 1+k+...+k^L < (L+1)*k^L, so we can set k^L < n, so k < n**(1/L) * (something) ? Actually, we can set the upper bound as floor(n**(1/L)) + 1? Or we can set the upper bound as the integer part of n**(1/L) plus a little.\n\nBut note: we are doing binary search for k in [2, high], where high = min(10**18, floor(n**(1/L))+10) ? Actually, we can set high = int(n**(1/L)) + 100, but we must be careful with floating point precision for n=10^18 and L=2: sqrt(10^18)=10^9, which is exact. For L=3, cube root of 10^18 is 10^6, which is exact. But for non-perfect powers, we might have rounding errors.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\nhigh = 2\nwhile (geometric_sum(high, L) < n):\n    high *= 2\n\nBut then we have to compute geometric_sum(high, L) which is (high^(L+1)-1)/(high-1). But high can be as large as, say, 10^9, and L=2: then high^(3) = (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is a very big number and we are only interested in whether it's greater than n (which is 10^18). But we can avoid computing the full geometric series by checking if high^(L+1) is too big? \n\nBut note: we are doing binary search for k, and we need to check if the geometric series equals n. However, the geometric series grows very fast.\n\nBut note: we are iterating L from 2 to 60. The maximum L is 60, so the exponent is 61. The base k must be at least 2 and at most n**(1/60). For n=10^18, 10^18**(1/60) is about 10^(0.3) which is about 2 (so k=2 is the only candidate for L=60). \n\nBut we can change our approach: for each L from 2 to 60, we can find the k that minimizes |geometric_sum(k, L) - n|, but that is complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: for a fixed L, we can compute k0 = floor(n**(1/L)) and then check k0 and k0+1, and maybe k0-1? Because the geometric series is increasing with k, and the k that satisfies the equation must be near n**(1/L). However, note that the geometric series is:\n\nn = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nThis equation is satisfied for k being the base and L the exponent. But note: k is an integer.\n\nBut wait, there is a simpler way: we can iterate over the number of layers (L) from 2 to 60, and for each L, we can compute k as the integer solution to:\n\nk^L < n < (k+1)^L   (but note: the entire series is more than k^L and less than (L+1)*k^L, so we cannot use just k^L)\n\nBut note: the series is 1+k+...+k^L. We can use the fact that:\n\nk^L <= n <= (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut how to find k for fixed L? We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n**(1/L)] (approximately). But note: the series for k is:\n\nf(k) = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe can compute f(k) without having to compute k^(L+1) for very large k? Actually, we can use logarithms to avoid extremely large numbers? But we have to compare with n (which is integer). \n\nBut note: we are dealing with numbers up to 10^18. The geometric series for L=2: k^2+k+1, which is about k^2, so k is about sqrt(n). For L=3: k^3+k^2+k+1, so k is about n^(1/3). \n\nBut the exponentiation for k^L for k ~ 10^9 and L=2 is 10^18, which is the maximum n. For L=3, k ~ 10^6, then k^3 is 10^18. For L=4, k ~ 1000, then k^4 = 10^12, which is less than 10^18. \n\nBut wait, for L=60, k=2: then the series is 2^61-1, which is about 2e18, which is >10^18, so we can only consider k=2 for L=60 if n is at least 2^61-1, but n<=10^18, so k=2 is too big for L=60 (since 2^61-1 is about 2.3e18, which is >10^18). So for L=60, we must have k=1, but k>=2 is not allowed. So we can break early for large L.\n\nBut note: we are iterating L from 2 to 60. For each L, we do a binary search for k from 2 to int(round(n**(1/L))) + 10, but we must be cautious: the geometric series is not exactly k^L, so k might be slightly less than n**(1/L). \n\nHowever, note: the entire series is (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1). We can compute this for a candidate k and check if it equals n.\n\nBut we have to be careful with the size of k^(L+1): for k=2 and L=60, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation may take time and memory). However, 2^61 is not too big (about 2e18, which is 19 digits). But for k=10^6 and L=3: (10^6)^4 = 10^24, which is also acceptable (since 10^24 is a 25-digit number, which is acceptable in Python for a few operations).\n\nBut the problem is that for each test case, we are going to iterate L from 2 to 60 and for each L do a binary search over k from 2 to about n**(1/L) (which for L=2 is 10^9, which is 1e9, and we do 30 steps of binary search for each L). Then for each candidate k, we compute the geometric series (which is (k^(L+1)-1)//(k-1)) and compare to n.\n\nBut note: the computation of k^(L+1) for k=10^9 and L=2: (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is a 28-digit number. This is acceptable in Python, but we are doing up to 60 * 30 = 1800 such exponentiations per test case, and we have up to 10,000 test cases -> 10,000 * 1800 = 18e6 exponentiations? That is too expensive.\n\nWe must optimize.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInstead of iterating over L from 2 to 60 for each test case, we can precompute the possible representations? But n is variable.\n\nAnother idea: note that the minimal representation (with L=2) is n = 1+k+k^2. So if n is of the form 1+k+k^2, then we can answer YES.\n\nBut also, for L>=3, we have n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1). \n\nBut note: the problem has been studied and there is a known fact: the equation n = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1) for k>=2, L>=2 is related to the representation of n as a generalized repunit in base k. \n\nHowever, there is a better way: we can iterate over the exponents L (from 2 to about 60) and for each L, we can solve for k by considering that k must be an integer and the equation:\n\nn = (k^(L+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\ncan be rewritten as:\n\nk^(L+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut note: we can also use the fact that k is the base and the series is a polynomial of degree L. \n\nBut we can use binary search for k for fixed L, but we must avoid computing k^(L+1) for k that is too large (we break early if k^(L+1) exceeds n*(k-1)+1 and k is too big). However, we are bounded by k <= n**(1/L) (approximately).\n\nBut the main issue is the performance: 10,000 test cases * 60 * 30 = 18e6 * 30? Actually, no: for each test case, we iterate L from 2 to 60 (about 59 values) and for each L we do about 30 binary search steps, and each step requires one exponentiation (k^(L+1)) and one division (to compute the geometric series). \n\nBut 10,000 * 59 * 30 = 17,700,000 test cases, and each test case involves an exponentiation and a comparison. \n\nIn Python, exponentiation for base and exponent that are integers and the result being an integer (even though big) is efficient? But note: the numbers can be as big as 10^27 (for k=10^9, L=2: then k^(3)=10^27). \n\nBut 10^27 is a big integer, and exponentiating to the power 61 (for L=60) would be even bigger (k=2, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is acceptable; but k=10^6 and L=3: (10^6)^4 = 10^24, which is acceptable; but for k=10^9 and L=2: 10^27 is acceptable in Python? Yes, but 10^27 is 27 zeros, which is 27 digits, which is acceptable. However, doing 18e6 exponentiations (each with exponent up to 61) might be heavy.\n\nBut note: the exponentiation for k^(L+1) for k=10^9 and L=2: we are raising 10^9 to the 3rd power. That is one multiplication: (10^9)*(10^9)=10^18, then *10^9=10^27. That is cheap. Similarly, for k=10^6 and L=3: (10^6)^4 = (10^6)^2 * (10^6)^2, then multiplied by (10^6)^2 again? Actually, exponentiation by exponent 4 is two multiplications. But the exponent L+1 is at most 61, so we can use pow(k, L+1) which is efficient.\n\nBut 18e6 exponentiations, each with base",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a central vertex, with each subsequent layer expanding by connecting \\( k \\) new vertices to each leaf vertex from the previous layer. The key observation is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be a sum of a geometric series with at least three terms (since the minimal snowflake requires two expansions beyond the initial vertex).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Geometric Series Insight**: The total number of vertices \\( n \\) in the snowflake graph is given by the sum of a geometric series: \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^L \\), where \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( L \\geq 2 \\). This means \\( n \\) must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series with base \\( k \\) and at least three terms (from \\( k^0 \\) to \\( k^L \\)).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each test case, we check if there exists an integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\) and an integer \\( L \\geq 2 \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\). Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we limit \\( L \\) to a maximum of 60 because \\( 2^{61} \\) exceeds \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each possible \\( L \\) (from 2 to 60), we perform a binary search on \\( k \\) to find if there exists a \\( k \\) such that the geometric series sum matches \\( n \\). The binary search range for \\( k \\) is from 2 to \\( \\lfloor n^{1/L} \\rfloor + 1 \\), ensuring we cover all potential bases without excessive computation.\n\n4. **Early Termination**: If any valid \\( (k, L) \\) pair is found, we immediately return \"YES\" for that test case. If no such pair is found after checking all possible \\( L \\) values, we return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n <= 1:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        for L in range(2, 61):\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            while (high ** (L+1)) < n * (high - 1) + 1:\n                high *= 2\n                if high > n:\n                    break\n                    \n            if high == n or high > n:\n                k_candidate = high\n            else:\n                k_candidate = high\n                while k_candidate ** (L+1) < n * (k_candidate - 1) + 1:\n                    k_candidate += 1\n                if k_candidate ** (L+1) == n * (k_candidate - 1) + 1:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                    \n            while k_candidate > 2 and not found:\n                k_candidate -= 1\n                total = 0\n                power = 1\n                for i in range(L+1):\n                    total += power\n                    if power > 0 and i < L:\n                        power *= k_candidate\n                    if total > n:\n                        break\n                if total == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                    \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            root_discriminant = 4*n - 3\n            if root_discriminant < 0:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                root_val = math.isqrt(root_discriminant)\n                if root_val * root_val == root_discriminant:\n                    k_val = (-1 + root_val) / 2\n                    if k_val >= 2 and k_val == int(k_val):\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n                    \n        if found:\n            continue\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Handling Small \\( n \\)**: For \\( n \\leq 1 \\), it's impossible to form a snowflake graph, so the answer is \"NO\".\n3. **Checking Geometric Series**: For each \\( n \\), we check all possible layer counts \\( L \\) (from 2 to 60).
