Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to do the following:\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the list of n integers.\n 3. Sort the array.\n 4. The instability after removing an element is defined as (max of remaining - min of remaining).\n    Since we remove exactly one element, we have two cases for the extremes: \n        - Removing an element that is the minimum (then the new min is the next smallest)\n        - Removing an element that is the maximum (then the new max is the next largest)\n    But note: we can also remove an element that is in the middle.\n\n 5. Observation: The overall instability of the entire array is determined by the min and max. However, if we remove one element, we can consider:\n    Option 1: Remove the first element (the current min). Then the new min is the second element (a[1]) and the max remains the last (a[-1]).\n        instability1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    Option 2: Remove the last element (the current max). Then the new max is the second last (a[-2]) and the min remains the first (a[0]).\n        instability2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n 6. However, what if the array has duplicate values? Then we might have multiple candidates for min and max. But note: the problem says we remove exactly one element.\n\n 7. Actually, we can generalize: \n    Consider that the resulting array's min and max will be among the original min and max, unless we remove the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max.\n\n 8. Alternate approach: \n    We note that the instability of the array without one element is determined by the min and max of the remaining elements. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n    Let the sorted array be `b`.\n    The overall range of the entire array is `b[-1] - b[0]`.\n\n    When we remove an element, we can consider:\n        Option A: Remove an element that is not the global min or global max. Then the min and max remain the same. But wait, if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one occurrence of the min, there might be another min. So the min and max might change only if we remove the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max.\n\n 9. Actually, we can think about it differently: \n    After removal, the new min is at least `b[0]` (if we don't remove the first) or `b[1]` (if we remove the first), and similarly the new max is at most `b[-1]` (if we don't remove the last) or `b[-2]` (if we remove the last).\n\n    But note: we can remove any element. Therefore, the min of the remaining array is either `b[0]` (if we don't remove the first occurrence) or `b[1]` (if we remove the first occurrence). Similarly, the max is either `b[-1]` (if we don't remove the last occurrence) or `b[-2]` (if we remove the last occurrence).\n\n 10. However, we are allowed to remove any element. So we can also remove an element that is not the first or last, and then the min and max remain unchanged. In that case, the instability is the same as the original.\n\n 11. But wait: sometimes removing an inner element might actually help? Actually, no: because if we remove an inner element, then the min and max are still the same. So the instability would be `b[-1]-b[0]`. However, if we remove the min (only one occurrence) then the new min becomes `b[1]` and the max remains `b[-1]` so the instability becomes `b[-1]-b[1]`. Similarly, if we remove the max (only one occurrence) then the instability becomes `b[-2]-b[0]`.\n\n 12. Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n        candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]   [if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the instability remains the same? But wait, we are trying to minimize, and sometimes removing an extreme might reduce the instability.]\n\n    Actually, we don't necessarily have to consider every element. We can consider:\n\n    The best we can do is to remove either the global min or the global max (or maybe both? but we remove one). \n\n    However, note: if the array has duplicate min or duplicate max, then removing one min doesn't change the min (because there's another min). Similarly for max.\n\n 13. Therefore, we need to know the frequency of the min and max. But note: we don't have to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the instability of the array after removal depends on the remaining elements' minimum and maximum values. By removing one element, the new minimum or maximum could either remain the same (if the removed element was not the only occurrence of the current min or max) or change to the next smallest or largest element in the sorted array.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal solution involves considering the scenarios where removing either the global minimum or the global maximum reduces the instability. Specifically:\n   - If we remove the smallest element, the new minimum becomes the second smallest element, and the maximum remains unchanged.\n   - If we remove the largest element, the new maximum becomes the second largest element, and the minimum remains unchanged.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Calculate two candidate instabilities: one by removing the smallest element (resulting in instability `a[-1] - a[1]`) and another by removing the largest element (resulting in instability `a[-2] - a[0]`).\n   - The answer is the minimum of these two candidate instabilities, as removing any other element would not reduce the instability further.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    arr.sort()\n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n        candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n        ans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr`.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will leave a single element, resulting in an instability of 0.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest (`arr[0]`) and largest (`arr[-1]`) elements.\n4. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - `candidate1` is the instability after removing the smallest element, computed as the difference between the largest element and the second smallest.\n   - `candidate2` is the instability after removing the largest element, computed as the difference between the second largest and the smallest element.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum of `candidate1` and `candidate2`, which represents the least possible instability achievable by removing exactly one element from the array.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only two critical scenarios, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
