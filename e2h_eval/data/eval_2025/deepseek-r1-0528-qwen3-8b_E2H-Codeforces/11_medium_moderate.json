A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n The meaning:\n   n: number of friends\n   k: number of bottles\n   l: milliliters per bottle\n   c: number of limes\n   d: slices per lime\n   p: grams of salt\n   nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (per friend for one toast)\n   np: grams of salt needed per toast\n\n Conditions for a toast:\n   Each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters ...\", but wait, let me read again:\n\n   \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n This means that for one toast (for one friend) you need:\n   - nl ml of drink\n   - 1 slice of lime\n   - np grams of salt\n\n However, they want to make as many toasts as possible, and all friends must drink the same amount.\n\n So, if we let T be the number of toasts per friend, then the total requirements are:\n   Total drink = n * T * nl   (because each of the n friends makes T toasts, so each requires T * nl ml)\n   Total lime slices = n * T   (each toast requires one slice, and there are n*T toasts in total? Actually, note: the toast is per friend. But the problem says \"each friend\" needs nl, a slice, and np for one toast. So for T toasts per friend, we need T slices per friend, and for n friends, that's n * T slices.\n   Total salt = n * T * np\n\n However, wait: the example input \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" gives 2.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Input: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n Steps from the example:\n\n   Total drink = 4 * 5 = 20 ml.\n   Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. But note: the example says \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\".\n\n   However, note: the example does not say the total number of toasts is 6. It says the total toasts (without considering the number of friends) is 6. Then because there are 3 friends, we divide by 3 to get 2 per friend.\n\n   But wait: the requirement for one toast is for one friend. So if we have 6 toasts, then that would be 6 slices of lime and 6 * 1 grams of salt. And also, 6 * 3 = 18 ml of drink.\n\n   However, we have 3 friends. How do we distribute the 6 toasts? We can't have different numbers per friend. So we must have an integer T (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n      Total drink required = 3 * T * 3 <= 20   -> 9T <= 20 -> T <= 20/9 ~ 2.22 -> T=2 (since T must be integer and we take floor)\n\n   Alternatively, we can think in terms of the limiting factors:\n\n   From drink: maximum toasts (across all friends) is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )? \n\n   Actually, no: the drink requirement for T toasts per friend is n * T * nl. So the maximum T from drink is floor( (k * l) / (n * nl) ).\n\n   Similarly, from lime slices: total slices available is c * d. Each toast (across all friends) requires one slice. Since there are n * T toasts, we require n * T <= c * d -> T <= (c*d) / n.\n\n   From salt: total salt available is p. Each toast requires np grams (for all friends: n * T * np). So T <= p / (n * np).\n\n   Then the maximum T that satisfies all conditions is the minimum of these three values (taking integer parts? Actually, we are to output an integer, and the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", so we take the floor of the limiting factor).\n\n   However, note: the example calculation:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 -> floor(20/9)=2 (if we use the condition for T from drink: T <= 20/(3*3)=20/9 -> 2.22 -> 2)\n        Lime: 10*8 = 80 slices -> 80 / (3*T) >= 1? Actually, we have 80 slices and we need 3*T slices. So T <= 80/3 -> 26.66... -> 26, but we are constrained by drink to 2.\n        Salt: 100 grams -> 100 / (3*T * 1) >= 1? Actually, we have 100 grams and need 3*T grams. So T <= 100/3 -> 33.33...\n\n   Then T = min( floor(20/9), floor(80/3), floor(100/3) )? But wait, the example says the answer is 2.\n\n   However, note: the example does:\n\n        Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters -> enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts (this is the total toasts for all friends combined? No, wait: 20/3 is 6.66... so 6 toasts? But then they say \"min(6,80,100)\" and then divide by 3.\n\n   Let me re-read the example explanation:\n\n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\n   Here, the way they calculated:\n\n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (meaning 6 toasts in total for all friends? But wait, if each toast is for one friend, then 6 toasts would be for 6 friends, but we have 3 friends. Actually, the example is calculating the total number of toasts (across all friends) that can be made from the drink? \n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n        The drink: 20 ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. So the total number of toasts (not per friend, but overall) that can be made is 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> 6.\n\n        Similarly, the limes: each toast requires one slice, and we have 80 slices, so 80 toasts.\n\n        The salt: 100 grams, each toast requires 1 gram, so 100 toasts.\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the drink: 6 toasts.\n\n        Now, since there are 3 friends, we have to divide the total toasts by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend? But wait, if we have 6 toasts and 3 friends, then each friend gets 2 toasts.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams for a toast\". So if we make 6 toasts, then we are serving 6 drinks (each drink being nl ml) and 6 slices, and 6*np grams of salt. But we have 3 friends. How is this distributed?\n\n        The key is: we cannot have a fractional toast. And we must serve the same number of toasts to each friend.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of toasts (across all friends) must be divisible by the number of friends? Not necessarily: we are just making as many as we can, and then each friend gets the same number. So the total toasts must be T_total, and then we require that T_total is a multiple of n? Actually, no: because we are making toasts for each friend individually. The condition is that each friend gets the same number of toasts, say t. Then the total toasts is n * t.\n\n        So the constraints become:\n\n            n * t * nl <= k * l   (total drink)\n            n * t <= c * d         (total lime slices)\n            n * t * np <= p       (total salt)\n\n        Then t (the number of toasts per friend) must satisfy:\n\n            t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n            t <= (c * d) / n\n            t <= p / (n * np)\n\n        And t must be an integer (but we are to output the maximum integer t that satisfies these conditions).\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the maximum t from each resource:\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [using integer division? But wait: we can only use whole toasts]\n\n        However, note: the example uses real numbers and then takes the floor. But the example does:\n\n            drink: 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> then floor to 2.\n\n        But wait, the example explanation used:\n\n            total toasts from drink = 20/3 = 6.66 -> 6 (which is the maximum total toasts, i.e., n*t_total = 3*t = 6 -> t=2).\n\n        So actually, the example first computed the total toasts (across all friends) that can be made from drink: (k*l) / (nl) -> 20/3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts.\n\n        Then, the total toasts must be at most 6, and since there are 3 friends, the maximum t (toasts per friend) is floor(6 / 3) = 2.\n\n        But wait, that doesn't match the direct formula above. The direct formula above for drink was: t <= 20/(3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor is 2.\n\n        And the other two:\n\n            t <= (c*d)/n = (10*8)/3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor 26\n            t <= p/(n*np) = 100/(3*1) ≈ 33.33 -> floor 33\n\n        Then t = min(floor(20/9), floor(80/3), floor(100/3)) = min(2,26,33)=2.\n\n        Alternatively, if we compute the total toasts from drink: (k*l) / nl = 20/3 -> floor(20/3)=6. Then the per-friend toasts is 6 // n = 6//3=2.\n\n        But wait, is that always correct? What if the drink constraint gives 6 total toasts, but the lime constraint gives 80 toasts (so no problem) and salt 100, then we can only do 6 toasts. But 6 toasts must be divided equally among 3 friends: 6 / 3 = 2 per friend.\n\n        However, what if the total toasts from drink is 7? Then 7 // 3 is 2 (floor division) but 3*2=6, which uses 6 ml (from drink: 6*3=18<=20) and leaves 2 ml unused. But the example calculation for drink was 20/3=6.66 -> 6 toasts, so we took floor(20/3)=6. Then we divide by n to get 2.\n\n        Now, consider: the drink constraint is on the total toasts (across all friends) being at most floor((k*l)/nl). Then the per-friend toasts is floor((k*l)/nl) // n? \n\n        But wait, the condition is: n * t * nl <= k * l. This is equivalent to t <= (k*l)/(n*nl). So the maximum integer t is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)).\n\n        Similarly, the lime condition: n * t <= c*d  => t <= (c*d)/n => floor((c*d)/n) but wait, note: the total lime slices is c*d, and we need n*t slices. So the maximum t is floor((c*d)/n) ?\n\n        Actually, no: because n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d) / n. Since t must be integer, we take floor((c*d) / n) ? But note: (c*d) might not be divisible by n. For example, if we have 5 slices and 2 friends, then t <= 5/2 = 2.5 -> t=2. Then 2*2=4 <=5, which is acceptable.\n\n        Similarly for salt: t <= p/(n*np) -> floor(p/(n*np)).\n\n        So the answer is the minimum of:\n\n            t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [but wait: (k*l) might not be divisible by (n*nl)? Actually, we are taking the floor of the division? Or we can use floor division?]\n\n        However, note: the condition is n*t*nl <= k*l. The maximum integer t is floor((k*l) / (n*nl)). But we can use integer floor division.\n\n        But wait, in Python, for positive integers, floor division is the same as truncation.\n\n        However, let me check with the example: (k*l) = 20, n*nl=9 -> 20//9 = 2.\n\n        Similarly, for lime: (c*d)=80, n=3 -> 80//3 = 26 (since 3*26=78 <=80, but 3*27=81>80 -> so 26 is correct).\n\n        For salt: p=100, n*np=3*1=3 -> 100//3 = 33 (because 3*33=99<=100, 3*34=102>100).\n\n        Then t = min(2,26,33)=2.\n\n        But wait, the example explanation did:\n\n            total toasts from drink = 20/3 = 6.66 -> 6, then divided by 3 (number of friends) to get 2.\n\n        In our method, we are directly computing the per-friend toasts from the drink: 20/(3*3)=2.22 -> floor 2.\n\n        So both methods yield the same result.\n\n        However, note: the drink condition is: n * t * nl <= k * l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl). So the maximum t is the floor of (k*l)/(n*nl).\n\n        Similarly, the lime condition: n * t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d) / n -> maximum t is floor((c*d)/n) ?\n\n        Wait, no: the condition is n*t <= c*d. Then the maximum t is floor((c*d)/n) if we are taking the floor? Actually, no: the condition is n*t <= c*d, so t <= (c*d) / n. The maximum integer t is floor((c*d)/n) only if we are using real division and then taking floor. But note: if (c*d) is not divisible by n, then we can still have t as an integer until the product exceeds.\n\n        Actually, the condition for lime: we have c*d slices, and we need n*t slices. So the maximum t is floor((c*d) / n) ? \n\n        Example: n=3, c*d=80 -> 80/3≈26.66, floor(80/3)=26. Then 3*26=78<=80 -> valid. But 3*27=81>80 -> invalid. So yes, the maximum t for lime is floor((c*d)/n) is not exactly: because floor((c*d)/n) is 26, but note: the condition is n*t <= c*d, and 26 is the largest integer t satisfying that.\n\n        However, wait: the condition is n*t <= c*d, which is equivalent to t <= (c*d)/n. The maximum integer t is indeed floor((c*d)/n) because:\n\n            t_max = floor((c*d)/n)   [because (c*d)/n might not be integer, and we take the integer part without exceeding]\n\n        But wait: no, the condition is n*t <= c*d, and we are solving for t. The maximum integer t is the floor of (c*d)/n? \n\n            Let x = (c*d)/n, then the maximum integer t is floor(x). Because if we take t = floor(x), then n*t <= c*d, and if we take t = floor(x)+1, then n*(floor(x)+1) > c*d.\n\n        Similarly for drink: condition is n*t*nl <= k*l, which is t <= (k*l)/(n*nl). The maximum integer t is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)).\n\n        For salt: condition is n*t*np <= p, which is t <= p/(n*np). The maximum integer t is floor(p/(n*np)).\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            t = min( floor((k*l)/(n*nl)), floor((c*d)/n), floor(p/(n*np)) )\n\n        But wait, in the example:\n\n            drink: floor((4*5)/(3*3)) = floor(20/9)=2\n            lime: floor((10*8)/3)=floor(80/3)=26\n            salt: floor(100/(3*1))=floor(100/3)=33\n\n            then t = 2.\n\n        Another sample: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\n            Input: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n            Calculate:\n\n                drink: floor((100*10)/(5*4)) = floor(1000/20)=50\n                lime: floor((1*19)/5)=floor(19/5)=3 (because 5*3=15<=19, 5*4=20>19)\n                salt: floor(90/(5*3))=floor(90/15)=6\n\n            Then t = min(50,3,6)=3.\n\n            The expected output is 3.\n\n        Another sample: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n            drink: floor((1000*1000)/(10*50)) = floor(1000000/500)=2000\n            lime: floor((25*23)/10)=floor(575/10)=57\n            salt: floor(1/(10*1))=floor(1/10)=0\n\n            Then t = 0.\n\n        However, the example output is 0.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # but wait: (k*l) might be less than (n*nl)? Then (k*l)//(n*nl) would be 0, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: we are doing integer floor division. But if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl), then floor division is the same as math.floor for positive numbers.\n\n            But wait: in Python, for positive integers, a//b is the floor of a/b.\n\n            Similarly, for lime: t_lime = (c * d) // n   # but wait: is that correct? \n\n            Condition: n * t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d)/n. The maximum integer t is the floor of (c*d)/n? \n\n            Example: c*d=5, n=2 -> 5//2=2, and 2*2=4<=5 -> valid. Then next t=3: 2*3=6>5 -> invalid. So yes.\n\n            Similarly, for salt: t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n            Then answer = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n        But wait: the drink condition: we have (k*l) and we are dividing by (n*nl). However, note: the drink condition is n*t*nl <= k*l. We can rewrite: t <= (k*l) / (n*nl). Then the maximum integer t is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)).\n\n        However, note: (k*l) // (n*nl) is integer floor division. But if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl), then we are effectively taking the floor.\n\n        But wait: what if (k*l) is 10 and (n*nl) is 3? Then 10//3=3, and 3*3=9<=10 -> valid. But 4*3=12>10 -> invalid. So yes, that matches.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the drink condition is on the total drink. But note: the total drink required is n*t*nl. We have k*l ml. So we require n*t*nl <= k*l.\n\n        But the expression (k*l) // (n*nl) gives the maximum t? \n\n            t_max_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl)   if we are using integer floor division?\n\n        Actually, no: because (k*l) // (n*nl) is the floor of (k*l)/(n*nl). And that is the maximum integer t.\n\n        But wait, let me check: \n\n            t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n            Then the maximum integer t is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)).\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if (k*l) is divisible by (n*nl), then exact, otherwise floor]\n\n        However, note: we must ensure that we are not doing integer division with negative numbers, but the problem states positive integers.\n\n        But wait: the condition for drink is n*t*nl <= k*l. The floor division (k*l)//(n*nl) is the same as floor((k*l)/(n*nl)) for positive integers.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: we can use real division and then take floor, but the numbers are integers and within 1000, so we can do:\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n        But wait: what if (k*l) < (n*nl)? Then (k*l)//(n*nl) is 0, which is correct.\n\n        Similarly for the others.\n\n        But wait: in the drink condition, if (k*l) is 10 and (n*nl) is 3, then (k*l)//(n*nl)=10//3=3, but 3*3=9<=10 -> valid.\n\n        However, note: the condition is n*t*nl <= k*l. With t=3: n=5, nl=2, then n*t*nl=5*3*2=30. Then 30<=10? No. \n\n        Wait, I see a mistake: \n\n            In the example above, we set n=5, k=100, l=10, nl=4: then drink condition: 5*t*4 <= 100*10 -> 20*t <=1000 -> t<=50, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the drink condition formula: \n\n            We have k bottles, each l ml -> total drink = k*l ml.\n\n            Each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml. But if we are making t toasts per friend, then each friend uses t * nl ml. And there are n friends, so total drink used is n * t * nl.\n\n            Condition: n * t * nl <= k * l.\n\n            Then t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\n        So the calculation for drink is correct.\n\n        However, the sample I was thinking with (k*l)=10, (n*nl)=3: \n\n            Condition: n*t*nl <= 10 -> t <= 10/(n*nl). But wait, I didn't specify n and nl. Let me set n and nl arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, the example I did was: \n\n            t_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl)\n\n        But k=1, l=10, n=?, nl=?.\n\n        Let me clarify: the input parameters are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n        So the drink condition is: n * t * nl <= k * l.\n\n        Then t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\n        So the maximum t is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)).\n\n        However, note: the example with n=5, k=100, l=10, nl=4: \n\n            (k*l)=1000, (n*nl)=20 -> 1000//20=50.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            t_lime = (c * d) // n\n            t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n            ans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n        But wait: what if (n*nl) is zero? The problem states positive integers, so no.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n            t_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n            t_lime = (10*8) // 3 = 80//3 = 26\n            t_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 100//3 = 33\n\n            min(2,26,33)=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n            t_drink = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000//20=50\n            t_lime = (1*19) //5 = 19//5=3\n            t_salt = 90//(5*3)=90//15=6\n\n            min(50,3,6)=3 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n            t_drink = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000//500=2000\n            t_lime = (25*23) //10 = 575//10=57\n            t_salt = 1//(10*1)=1//10=0\n\n            min(2000,57,0)=0 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example output is 0, and we get 0.\n\n        But note: the condition for salt: n*t*np <= p. With t=0: 10*0*1=0<=1 -> valid.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, data)\n                # Compute the three values\n                drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # This is the maximum t from drink\n                lime_limit = (c * d) // n            # This is the maximum t from lime (since n*t <= c*d)\n                salt_limit = p // (n * np)            # This is the maximum t from salt\n\n                ans = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n                print(ans)\n\n        But wait: is the lime condition correctly represented? \n\n            Condition: we need n * t slices of lime (because each toast requires one slice and there are n*t toasts). \n            We have c*d slices. So we require n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d)/n.\n\n            Then the maximum integer t is floor((c*d)/n). \n\n            However, note: (c*d) might not be divisible by n. Our calculation (c*d)//n is the floor of (c*d)/n, which is correct.\n\n        Similarly, for drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)), which is the maximum t.\n\n        And for salt: p // (n*np) is floor(p/(n*np)), which is the maximum t.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the drink condition: the total drink is k*l. The total required for t toasts per friend is n * t * nl. So we require n*t*nl <= k*l.\n\n        Our calculation for drink: (k*l) // (n*nl) is the maximum t. But note: if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl), then we are effectively truncating the real value.\n\n        Example: k*l=10, n=3, nl=3 -> n*nl=9. Then (10//9)=1. Then 3*1*3=9<=10 -> valid. But if we had k*l=8, then 8//9=0, then 3*0*3=0<=8 -> valid, but if we try t=1: 3*1*3=9>8 -> invalid. So 0 is correct.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n            t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            t2 = (c * d) // n\n            t3 = p // (n * np)\n            print(min(t1, t2, t3))\n\n        But wait: what if one of the denominators (like n*nl) is zero? The problem states positive integers, so no.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the numbers are at least 1, so n>=1, nl>=1 -> n*nl>=1, so no division by zero.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n            print(min((k * l) // (n * nl), (c * d) // n, p // (n * np)))\n\n        Let me run the sample: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> outputs 2.\n\n        But wait, what if we have a situation where the drink condition is the limiting factor, but the drink condition calculation is done differently?\n\n        Let me test with the example: n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Then: \n                drink: 1*1 // (1*1) = 1\n                lime: 1*1//1=1\n                salt: 1//(1*1)=1\n                ans=1.\n\n        This is correct: one friend, one bottle of 1 ml, one lime, one gram of salt. Each toast requires 1 ml, one slice, and 1 gram. So one toast.\n\n        Another test: n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=2, np=1.\n\n            drink: 1*1 // (1*2)=1//2=0\n            lime: 1*1//1=1\n            salt: 1//(1*1)=1\n            ans=0.\n\n        Correct: because the drink requirement per toast is 2 ml, but we only have 1 ml. So no toast.\n\n        But wait, the condition: n*t*nl <= k*l -> 1*t*2 <= 1 -> 2*t<=1 -> t<=0.5 -> so t=0.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example explanation used a different way (total toasts and then divide by n). But our direct method is equivalent.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        There is one more edge: when the denominator is large, but the numerator is small, then we get 0.\n\n        We'll submit this.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the numbers are positive and not exceeding 1000, so we don't have to worry about overflow.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            t_lime = (c * d) // n\n            t_salt = p // (n * np)\n            print(min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt))\n\n        However, wait: the example calculation in the problem statement for the first sample did:\n\n            total toasts from drink = 20/3 = 6 (then divided by 3 to get 2). \n\n        But our method for drink was (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n        Why is there a discrepancy? \n\n        Note: the total toasts from drink (without considering friends) is (k*l) // nl? \n\n            In the example, (k*l) // nl = 20 // 3 = 6 (if we were to use integer division for total toasts). \n\n        But then the condition for drink is that the total toasts (across all friends) is at most (k*l)//nl? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: n*t*nl <= k*l.\n\n        We can also express the condition in terms of total toasts (let T_total = n*t):\n\n            T_total * nl <= k*l   -> T_total <= (k*l) // nl   [if we use integer division, but note: we can only have integer toasts]\n\n        Then the maximum T_total is (k*l) // nl (if we use integer floor division). Then the per-friend toasts t is T_total // n.\n\n        Then the answer would be: min( (k*l)//nl // n, (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) ) ?\n\n        But wait, the drink condition: T_total = n*t, and T_total <= (k*l)//nl (using integer division) is not the same as n*t*nl <= k*l.\n\n        Actually, if we set T_total = n*t, then the condition is T_total * nl <= k*l.\n\n        Then the maximum T_total is floor(k*l / nl). Then the maximum t is floor(floor(k*l / nl) / n) ?\n\n        Example 1: k*l=20, nl=3 -> floor(20/3)=6. Then t = floor(6/3)=2.\n\n        Example 2: k*l=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally in the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make such that all friends have the same number of toasts, and the available resources are not exceeded.\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts per friend is constrained by the most limiting resource. We calculate the maximum possible toasts from each resource:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each friend needs `nl` milliliters per toast, so the maximum toasts per friend is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice, so the maximum toasts per friend is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so the maximum toasts per friend is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum of these three values, as the smallest value determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n    t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t_lime = (c * d) // n\n    t_salt = p // (n * np)\n    print(min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast, and salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Calculation**: Computes how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each friend's requirement per toast.\n   - **Lime Calculation**: Determines the maximum toasts by dividing the total lime slices by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt Calculation**: Finds the maximum toasts by checking the total salt against the per-friend requirement.\n3. **Result Determination**: The minimum value among the three calculations gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are used efficiently without exceeding any constraint.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is optimal and correct for the given problem conditions.",
