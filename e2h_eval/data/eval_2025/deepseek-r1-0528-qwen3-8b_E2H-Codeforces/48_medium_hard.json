He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numerals) or both integers.\n Then, a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is an integer (i.e., not 'R'):\n    - First, convert the given string c from base a to an integer (base 10).\n    - Then, convert that base 10 integer to base b (which is an integer between 2 and 25). We must omit leading zeros.\n\n 2. If b is 'R':\n    - Convert the given string c from base a to base 10.\n    - Then, convert that base 10 integer (which is guaranteed to be <= 300010 and not zero) to a Roman numeral.\n\n However, note: the input for base a may have digits beyond 9? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So the string c can contain digits from '0' to '9' and letters from 'A' to ... (up to representing a-1). But note: the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, so the digits can go up to 24, which would be represented by 'X' or higher letters? Actually, the example uses base 12 and digit 'A' (which is 10).\n\n Important: The input c is a string that may have leading zeros and length up to 1000. But note the guarantee: if Roman, then the number is <= 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps for converting from base a (integer) to base 10:\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10 to base 2: 1 in base10 is \"1\" in base2.\n   Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 16 to base 10: 5 (hex?) but wait, base 16: the string \"5\" is 5 in hex, which is 5 in decimal. Then convert 5 to Roman: \"V\"\n\n But note: the problem says the integer c is given in base a. So if base a is 16, then the string \"5\" is the digit 5, which in base16 is indeed 5.\n\n However, what if the base is 12 and the string is \"A\"? Then we need to interpret 'A' as 10.\n\n Steps for base a (integer base) conversion:\n\n Let n = 0\n For each character in the string c (from left to right, i.e., most significant first):\n   d = char_to_digit(char)\n   n = n * a + d\n\n But note: the input c may have leading zeros, so we should consider that.\n\n However, the problem says: the number is non-negative and may have leading zeros, but its length doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n But wait: what if the base a is 10 and the string is \"0000\"? Then we have 0. However, the problem says that when Roman is included the number is not zero. So if b is 'R', then we don't have to worry about zero. But if b is integer, then we might have zero? Actually, the problem says: \"non-negative integer c\", so it can be zero. However, the conversion to base b: if the number is zero, then the output should be \"0\" (unless the base is something, but note: base b is at least 2, so 0 is represented as \"0\").\n\n But wait: the problem says \"omit leading zeros\", so if the number is zero, we output \"0\".\n\n Steps for base 10 to base b (integer base, between 2 and 25):\n\n We'll convert the base10 integer to base b by repeatedly dividing by b, and then map the remainders to the corresponding digits (which are either digits '0'-'9' or letters 'A'-'Z').\n\n Steps for base10 to Roman:\n\n We are guaranteed the number is between 1 and 300010.\n\n We can use the standard method of subtractive notation for Roman numerals.\n\n Standard Roman numerals use the following symbols:\n\n M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a list of tuples:\n\n roman_numerals = [\n    (1000, \"M\"),\n    (900, \"CM\"),\n    (500, \"D\"),\n    (400, \"CD\"),\n    (100, \"C\"),\n    (90, \"XC\"),\n    (50, \"L\"),\n    (40, \"XL\"),\n    (10, \"X\"),\n    (9, \"IX\"),\n    (5, \"V\"),\n    (4, \"IV\"),\n    (1, \"I\")\n ]\n\n Then, for a given number, we can repeatedly subtract the largest possible value and append the corresponding symbol.\n\n Example: 58 -> 50 (L) and 8 (VIII) -> \"LVIII\"\n\n But note: the problem says that the number is at most 300010, which is more than 300000. However, the maximum is 300010, so we need to handle numbers up to 300010.\n\n However, standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 500000 or 1000000. But note: 300010 is 300,010. How do we represent that?\n\n Actually, the problem does not specify the exact representation for numbers above 3999? But note: the problem states that the number is at most 300010. \n\n According to historical facts, sometimes a bar is used above the symbols for thousands, but the problem says \"the same system as described\" and the example goes up to 300010.\n\n However, the problem's guarantee is that the number is <= 300010. We can break down 300010 as:\n\n 300000: traditionally, one might use C with a bar (meaning 100,000) but that is not standard. Alternatively, we can use MMM (for 3000) but that only goes up to 3000 without bars. Actually, the problem does not specify beyond 3999, but note that the maximum is 300010.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, we can use the standard additive method for numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, we extend by using multiple M's.\n\n But wait, 300000 is 3 * 100000. We don't have a standard symbol for 100000, so we can use a bar? However, the problem says \"the same system as described\" and the example doesn't cover such large numbers.\n\n Alternatively, note: the example inputs are small. The example includes:\n   '5 R\\n4' -> IV\n   '12 13\\nA' -> A\n\n And the other examples are small.\n\n Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we can assume that we need to represent numbers from 1 to 300010.\n\n However, the standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 100000. So we have to represent 100000 as C followed by a bar? But the problem does not mention bars.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the Romans sometimes wrote large numbers by repetition: 500000 would be MMMMM (but that's 5000) no, wait: 1000000 is one million, but our number is only 300010.\n\n Actually, 300010 is 300,000 + 10. We can represent 300,000 as three hundred thousand, which is written as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC? That would be 300 ones? No, that's too many.\n\n Let me check: actually, the standard way to write 400000 is CD (for 400) but extended by thousands? Or we can use the same pattern: \n\n 300000 = 3 * 100000, and since there's no symbol for 100000, we can use C (which is 100) and then a bar (meaning multiply by 1000) but that is not standard.\n\n However, looking at the problem statement: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but that's for base representation, not for Roman.\n\n After checking the problem statement again: the problem says that the input for Roman is guaranteed to be <= 300010 and not zero.\n\n We can use the following approach for Roman numerals:\n\n We break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones, but we also consider that we can represent thousands by repeating 'M'. \n\n However, the standard subtractive principle applies only for the basic set (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). For numbers above 3999, the Romans did not have a standard way, but since our number is only up to 300010, we can do:\n\n 300010 = 300000 + 10\n\n How to write 300000? We can write it as 300 thousands, i.e., 300 * 1000. But 1000 is M, so 300000 is MMM repeated 300 times? That would be 300 Ms, which is acceptable? But 300010 would then be 300 Ms and then an X.\n\n However, 300 Ms is a lot, but the problem doesn't restrict the length. But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break it down.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for the thousands part, use the same rules but with M.\n\n Actually, let's define the Roman numeral mapping for all numbers from 1 to 300010 by using the standard subtractive principle for the entire range. However, the standard subtractive principle is defined for the basic set, and for numbers above 3999, we can use a bar above the M to represent 10000, but the problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the representation for numbers above 3999, but our maximum is 300010, we can use the following:\n\n Break the number into groups of thousands, hundreds, etc. But note: 300010 is 300 thousands and 10.\n\n We can write:\n\n 300000 = 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. So we can use 300 * 1000, but that is 300 Ms? Actually, that is 300 * M, which is 300000.\n\n However, that would be 300 'M's. We can avoid that by using a more compact representation? Actually, the standard way to write 4000 is XL (no, wait: 4000 is usually written as MMMM or sometimes with a bar). But the problem says \"the same system as described\", meaning the subtractive principle for the same set.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the example numbers are small, we can assume that the Roman numeral conversion is for numbers in the range [1, 300010] and we can use the standard subtractive principle for the entire range by extending the mapping to include larger values.\n\n Actually, the problem's example does not include such a large number.\n\n Let me think: 300010 is 300000+10. We can break down:\n\n 300000: we can represent as 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. So we use the same symbols as for thousands, but we can use the rule: for every 1000, use one M. So 300000 is 300 * 1000, so 300 Ms? That's 300 characters. Alternatively, we can use the subtractive principle for thousands? Actually, the subtractive principle is only for the basic set. There is no standard symbol for 5000 or 10000.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the same system as described\". The description says that the subtractive principle is used for the base system (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). So we can only use M for thousands, and then the same subtractive principle applies.\n\n However, for numbers above 3999, the subtractive principle still applies for the lower digits, but the thousands part is just additive. So:\n\n 4000: would be MMMM (or sometimes IV with a bar, but the problem doesn't specify). Since the problem does not specify, and the example inputs are small, we must rely on the fact that the number is at most 300010, which is 300010, so we can use:\n\n 300010 = 3 * 100000 + 10, but we don't have a symbol for 100000, so we break it as 300 * 1000 + 10 = 300 * M + X.\n\n But 300 * M is 300 Ms. That is acceptable because the problem doesn't restrict the length.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more efficient representation? Actually, the problem says \"the same system\", and the system doesn't have a symbol for 100000, so we have to use M repeated.\n\n However, note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300010. So we can write:\n\n 300010 = 3 * 100000 + 0*10000 + 0*1000 + 10, but again, no symbol for 100000.\n\n So, let's stick to the standard: use M for 1000, and then the rest of the digits (hundreds, tens, ones) use the subtractive principle.\n\n Therefore, we break the number into:\n\n thousands_part = number // 1000\n remainder = number % 1000\n\n Then, convert the thousands_part to Roman numerals (using M's) and then the remainder.\n\n But wait, the standard subtractive principle for thousands? Actually, the subtractive principle is only applied for the basic set (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). So for thousands, we don't use subtractive? Actually, the subtractive principle is used for any place: so 4000 would be written as MMMM, but sometimes they use a bar above the M to mean 10000, and then 4000 would be IV (with a bar) but that is not standard.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the example inputs are small, we will assume that the Roman numeral representation for numbers above 3999 is done by simply writing the thousands part as M's and then the rest.\n\n But wait, 4000 is typically written as MMMM (four thousand) or sometimes as IV (with a bar) meaning 4000. However, the problem says the same system as described, and the described system only has the subtractive principle for the basic set. The basic set includes M (1000). So for thousands, we can use:\n\n 1000: M\n 2000: MM\n 3000: MMM\n 4000: MMMM (or we could use the subtractive principle? but the next higher is nothing, so no)\n\n However, the problem also says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed\", meaning for 4 (IV) and 9 (IX), but for thousands, the next higher is nothing, so no subtractive.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the same system as described\", and the described system has the symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, M. So for thousands, we only have M. Therefore, 4000 is MMMM.\n\n Similarly, 9000 is MMMMMM? No, wait: 9000 is MMMMMMMMMM? Actually, 9000 is 9 * 1000, so MMMMMMMMMM? That would be 9 Ms.\n\n However, the subtractive principle is only for the immediate next higher symbol. In the case of 9000, we don't have a symbol for 10000, so we cannot use subtractive. Therefore, we must use additive.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base\". In the case of 9000, the higher base is 10000, which we don't have. So we cannot use subtractive.\n\n Therefore, we must represent 300010 as:\n\n 300000: 300 * 1000 = 300 Ms\n 10: X\n\n So the entire string is 300 times 'M' and then 'X'. \n\n However, 300 Ms is 300 characters. The problem says the input string c has length at most 1000, but the output for Roman numeral might be long. But 300010 is the maximum, so the worst-case output is 300 Ms (300 characters) plus the rest (max 4 characters for the last part) so about 304 characters. This is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says the input c is a string of length at most 1000, but the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, so the number c in base a is at most 10^1000 (if base 10) but wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\" — wait, that is a typo? Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10**1510\", which is a very big number, but when converting to base b (integer) we are limited by the base10 integer being at most around 10**1510, which is huge. However, the Roman numeral case is handled separately and the number is at most 300010, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the first line: split into tokens. Two tokens: first is a, second is b.\n    - If the second token is 'R', then b is Roman, else convert the second token to integer.\n\n 2. Read the next line: the string c.\n\n 3. Convert c from base a to base10 integer:\n\n    Let base_a = int(first_token)\n\n    We need to map each character to a digit:\n\n        For digits '0' to '9': use int(char)\n        For letters: starting from 'A' (which is 10) up to the base_a-1. But note: the base_a is at least 2 and at most 25.\n\n    However, if base_a <= 10, then we only have digits 0 to base_a-1, so we don't have letters.\n\n    Steps for conversion from base a to base10:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in c:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            elif 'A' <= char <= chr(ord('A') + base_a - 10 - 1):\n                # The letter part: base 10 starts at 'A' (10) so the first letter is 10, then 11, etc.\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            else:\n                # This should not happen because the base a is at most 25, and the string c is given in base a.\n                digit = 0\n\n            num = num * base_a + digit\n\n    But note: the string c might have leading zeros. This method works.\n\n 4. Now, if b is an integer (not 'R'):\n\n        Convert the base10 integer (num) to base b.\n\n        Special case: if num is 0, then output \"0\".\n\n        Otherwise, we convert by repeatedly dividing by b.\n\n        We need to map the remainders to digits. The digits are from 0 to b-1.\n\n        But note: if the base b is greater than 10, then we use letters: \n            '0' to '9' and then 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, etc.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            s = ''\n            n = num\n            if n == 0:\n                s = '0'\n            else:\n                while n:\n                    r = n % b\n                    n = n // b\n                    # Map r to a character\n                    if r < 10:\n                        s = str(r) + s\n                    else:\n                        s = chr(ord('A') + r - 10) + s\n\n        However, note: the base b is between 2 and 25, so the maximum digit is 24, which is represented by 'X' (since 10->'A', 24->'X').\n\n        But wait: base 25: then we need digits from 0 to 24. The letters go from 'A' to 'Y' (since 10->'A', 24->'Y'). Because: \n            'A' is 10, then 10->'A', 11->'B', ... 24->'Y'\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            digits = []\n            if n == 0:\n                digits.append('0')\n            else:\n                while n:\n                    r = n % b\n                    n //= b\n                    digits.append(str(r) if r < 10 else chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n            Then reverse digits to get the correct order.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build the string from the last remainder to the first.\n\n        Example: \n            num = 10, base = 16 -> \n            n=10, r=10, then n=0. Then we map 10 to 'A'. So the string is 'A'.\n\n        But wait: the example input \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12: 'A' is 10, so base10: 10*12^0 = 10. Then base13: 10 in base13 is represented by 'A'. So output 'A'.\n\n        However, the example input is: \"12 13\\nA\", and output is 'A'.\n\n        But note: the input is given in base a (here 12) and the string is \"A\", which is valid because base12 uses digits up to 11, so 'A' is 10.\n\n        Then we convert 10 (base10) to base13: \n            n=10, r=10, n=0. Then we map 10 to 'A'. So output is 'A'.\n\n 5. If b is 'R':\n\n        We have the base10 integer (num) and we want to convert it to a Roman numeral.\n\n        We'll use the subtractive principle with the following mapping:\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n\n        But wait, our number can be up to 300010. The above mapping only goes down to 1. However, 300010 is 300000+10. We don't have a symbol for 100000, so we break 300000 as 3 * 1000, which is \"MMM\" for 3000, but wait: 3000 is \"MMM\", but 300000 is 3000 * 100? Actually, no: the mapping above is for the standard Roman numerals (thousands are represented by M). So 300000 is 300 * 1000, so we can break it as:\n\n        We can use the same mapping for thousands? Actually, the above mapping does not break the number arbitrarily. It breaks the number by the largest possible symbol.\n\n        The standard way is to break the number by the largest possible value, then subtract, and so on.\n\n        But 300000 is less than 1000000 (if we consider M as 1000, then 1000000 would be a new symbol, but we don't have one). So we break:\n\n        We start with the largest value in the list: 1000 (M). Then 300000 / 1000 = 300, so we would output 300 'M's? But that is not efficient. The subtractive principle is only for the adjacent values.\n\n        However, the mapping we have does not include values above 1000. But wait, the list includes (1000, \"M\") and then the next is (900, \"CM\") which is 900, which is less than 1000. So for 300000, we will take 300000 // 1000 = 300, and then subtract 300 * 1000 from the number, and then use the next symbol? But the next symbol is 900, which is not applicable.\n\n        Actually, the standard algorithm for Roman numerals:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            roman_map = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n            roman_str = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_map:\n                # While n is at least value, subtract value and append symbol\n                count = n // value\n                roman_str += symbol * count\n                n -= value * count\n            return roman_str\n\n        However, this algorithm does not use the subtractive principle in the same way. Actually, it does: the subtractive principle is built into the mapping (like CM for 900). But for 3000, we don't have a mapping for 3000, so we use 1000 three times: \"MMM\".\n\n        But wait, 4000 would be \"MMMM\", and 9000 would be \"MMMMMMMMMM\" (nine Ms). That is acceptable because we don't have a symbol for 10000.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we don't need to worry about numbers above 3999 (except that 300010 is above 3999). \n\n        Let's test the algorithm with 300010:\n\n        Step1: 300010 // 1000 = 300, then subtract 300000, remainder 10.\n        Then, we use the next symbol: 900 -> skip because 10 < 900.\n        Then 500 -> skip.\n        Then 400 -> skip.\n        Then 100 -> skip.\n        Then 90 -> skip.\n        Then 50 -> skip.\n        Then 40 -> skip.\n        Then 10: 10 // 10 = 1, then subtract 10, remainder 0. Then append \"X\".\n\n        So the result is \"M\"*300 + \"X\".\n\n        But 300 Ms and an X: that's 301 characters. The problem does not restrict the output length, so it's acceptable.\n\n        However, we can optimize the thousands part? Actually, we can use a different mapping for thousands? But the problem says the same system as described, and the described system only has M for 1000.\n\n        But note: the subtractive principle for thousands? Actually, the subtractive principle is only for the immediate next higher symbol. The next higher symbol for 1000 is 5000 (which we don't have) or 10000 (which we don't have). So we cannot use subtractive.\n\n        Therefore, we use the above algorithm.\n\n        However, the above algorithm does not use the subtractive principle for non-standard thousands. But wait, the subtractive principle is only for the standard set. So we are good.\n\n        But wait: what about the number 4? It uses \"IV\", which is subtractive. The algorithm uses the mapping (4, \"IV\") so it will use \"IV\" for 4. Similarly, 9 uses \"IX\".\n\n        The algorithm is standard.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, and we are using the same mapping as the standard Roman numerals for numbers up to 3999, and then for the thousands part we use M's.\n\n        But 300010 is 300000+10, and 300000 is 300 thousands, so we break the number by the largest value (1000) and then the remainder (10) is broken by the next largest (10). \n\n        However, the algorithm breaks the number by the largest value available, which is 1000, then 900, then 500, etc. So for 300000, it breaks it as 300 * 1000, which is 300 Ms. \n\n        But 300 is broken as 300//1000 = 0, then 300//900=0, ... until 300//1000=0, then 300//100=3, so we would break 300 as 3 hundreds? \n\n        Wait, no: the algorithm goes in descending order. The first mapping is (1000, 'M'), so 300000 is broken as 300000 // 1000 = 300, so we subtract 300000 and add 300 'M's.\n\n        Then we are left with 10, and then we break 10 with (10, 'X').\n\n        But wait, the algorithm uses the same mapping for the entire number. The mapping is fixed. We don't break the thousands separately.\n\n        However, the mapping includes 1000, so the algorithm will use the 1000 part first.\n\n        Let me run through 300010:\n\n        n = 300010\n        Check (1000, 'M'): 300010 // 1000 = 300, so we add \"M\"*300 and subtract 300000 -> n becomes 10.\n        Then check (900, 'CM'): 10 < 900 -> skip.\n        Then (500, 'D'): 10 < 500 -> skip.\n        Then (400, 'CD'): skip.\n        Then (100, 'C'): skip.\n        Then (90, 'XC'): skip.\n        Then (50, 'L'): skip.\n        Then (40, 'XL'): skip.\n        Then (10, 'X'): 10//10=1, so we add \"X\" and subtract 10 -> n becomes 0.\n\n        So the result is \"M\"*300 + \"X\".\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the algorithm does not break the number by thousands, hundreds, etc. explicitly. It uses the entire mapping.\n\n        However, the mapping must include all the standard values. We have:\n\n        M: 1000\n        CM: 900\n        D: 500\n        CD: 400\n        C: 100\n        XC: 90\n        L: 50\n        XL: 40\n        X: 10\n        IX: 9\n        V: 5\n        IV: 4\n        I: 1\n\n        This covers all numbers from 1 to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, we use the M's for the thousands.\n\n        But 300010 is above 3999, so we use M's for the thousands.\n\n        However, the algorithm will work because the mapping starts with the largest value (1000) and then goes down.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a number like 4000? The algorithm would break 4000 as:\n\n        4000 // 1000 = 4, so we subtract 4000 and add \"M\"*4 -> \"MMMM\", and then we break the remainder 0.\n\n        But 4000 is typically written as \"MMMM\", which is acceptable.\n\n        However, there is a more common practice to use a bar above the M for 10000, but the problem does not specify, so we use the simple way.\n\n        But note: the problem says the same system as described. The described system uses the subtractive principle for the base set, and the base set includes M (1000). So we are following the described system.\n\n        There is one more thing: the problem says the number is not zero when converting to Roman. So we don't have to handle zero.\n\n 6. Edge cases:\n\n     - When the base a is 1? But the input says a>=2.\n     - When the base b is 1? But the input says b>=2 or 'R'.\n     - When the input number is 0: then output \"0\" (for base b integer) or if b is 'R' then the problem guarantees non-zero, so we don't have to handle 0 in Roman.\n\n 7.

The problem doesn't specify. \n                # The example uses uppercase. Let's assume uppercase only.\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could either be an integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting this base 10 number to the desired output base (either an integer base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (`a`) and the target base (`b`). The target base can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input number from the source base (`a`) to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its decimal value, and accumulating the total value using the formula: `num = num * base_a + digit`.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base 10 number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. Digits greater than 9 are represented by letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to symbols. The conversion involves iterating through the mapping in descending order, subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    base_a = int(a_str)\n    base_b_type = b_str\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    num = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        else:\n            d = 0\n        num = num * base_a + d\n        \n    if base_b_type == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n        res = \"\"\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while num >= value:\n                res += symbol\n                num -= value\n        print(res)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(base_b_type)\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n = num\n            while n:\n                r = n % base_b\n                n //= base_b\n                if r < 10:\n                    digits.append(str(r))\n                else:\n                    digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n            digits.reverse()\n            print(''.join(digits))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input specifies the source base (`a`) and the target base (`b`).

Each character in the input string is processed to determine its decimal value, which is then used to compute the total value.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: For numbers up to 300,010, the base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding Roman symbols.\n   - **Integer Base**: The base 10 number is converted to the target integer base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.
