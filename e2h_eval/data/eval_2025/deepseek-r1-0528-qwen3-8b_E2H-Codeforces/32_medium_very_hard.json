    "thought": "\n We are to remove exactly one element from the array and minimize the instability (max-min) of the resulting array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` with `n` elements. After removing one element, we have an array of `n-1` elements.\n\n The instability is defined as (max element in the remaining array) - (min element in the remaining array).\n\n We note that the instability of the entire array is `max(a) - min(a)`. Removing one element might:\n   - Remove the current maximum, then the new maximum is the next largest.\n   - Remove the current minimum, then the new minimum is the next smallest.\n\n However, note that sometimes the minimum and maximum might be repeated. Therefore, we cannot simply remove one occurrence of the global min or max.\n\n Approach:\n\n Consider two strategies for removal:\n\n 1. Remove the global minimum (if there are multiple, then we remove one occurrence and the next minimum might still be the same? Actually, if we remove one occurrence, the new minimum is the smallest value that remains. But if there are multiple minima, then even after removing one, the minimum might stay the same. Similarly for maximum.\n\n So, let's sort the array and consider the following:\n\n After sorting, let the array be `b[0] <= b[1] <= ... <= b[n-1]`.\n\n Then, the original instability is `b[n-1] - b[0]`.\n\n Now, when we remove an element, we can consider removing one element from the sorted array and then the new array's min and max would be:\n\n Option 1: Remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the min and max remain the same.\n\n But wait, we are allowed to remove any one element. The goal is to minimize the instability.\n\n We can consider two types of removals that actually change the min or max:\n\n   a) Removing an element that is the global minimum (if the array has at least one occurrence of the minimum) but note: if we remove one occurrence and there is another minimum, then the minimum remains the same. So the instability becomes `b[n-1] - b[1]` (because the smallest element is still `b[0]` but we removed one occurrence, so the next smallest is `b[1]`). However, if we remove the only minimum, then the new minimum is `b[1]` (if we remove `b[0]` and there was only one `b[0]`).\n\n But wait, we don't know how many minima there are. Similarly for the maximum.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what are the candidate arrays we can get?\n\n We can remove one element and the resulting array's min and max can only be:\n\n   Case 1: The new minimum is `b[0]` and the new maximum is `b[n-1]` (if we don't remove the global min or global max) -> then instability is `b[n-1]-b[0]` (same as original). But we are trying to minimize, so this is not helpful.\n\n   Case 2: Remove the global minimum (so the new minimum is the next smallest value). Then the instability is `b[n-1] - b[1]` (if we remove one occurrence of `b[0]` and there is at least one more `b[0]` then the minimum remains `b[0]`, but if we remove the last occurrence of `b[0]`, then the minimum becomes `b[1]`).\n\n Similarly, Case 3: Remove the global maximum (so the new maximum is the next largest value). Then the instability is `b[n-2] - b[0]` (if we remove one occurrence of `b[n-1]` and there is at least one more `b[n-1]` then the maximum remains `b[n-1]`, but if we remove the last occurrence, then the maximum becomes `b[n-2]`).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can also remove an element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability doesn't change. Therefore, the best we can do is by considering removals that either remove the minimum or the maximum (or both, but then we have two possibilities).\n\n Actually, we must consider:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove an element that is the global minimum (and it is the only minimum) -> then the new minimum becomes the next smallest (which is the second element, but if there are duplicates then we need to check).\n\n But note: the array is sorted. We can consider:\n\n Let's define:\n   candidate1: Removing the first occurrence (at index0) of the minimum. Then the new min is b[1] (if there are duplicates, then the minimum might still be b[0] if there's another at index0? Actually, if we have [1,1,3,7], then removing the first 1 leaves [1,3,7] so the min is still 1. \n\n So we cannot simply look at the first and last. We need to consider:\n\n   The instability after removal of an element at position i (in the sorted array) is:\n        instability_i = max(b[n-1], b[i+1]) - min(b[0], b[i-1])   [if we remove b[i]]\n\n But wait, if we remove an element in the middle, then the min and max of the entire array might be determined by the endpoints.\n\n Actually, we can break down:\n\n   If we remove an element, the min of the remaining array is:\n        if b[0] is removed and there's no other b[0] (i.e., the first occurrence is unique and we remove it) then the new min is b[1]. Otherwise, the min is still b[0].\n\n   Similarly, the max of the remaining array is:\n        if b[n-1] is removed and there's no other b[n-1] then the new max is b[n-2]. Otherwise, the max is still b[n-1].\n\n However, we are allowed to remove any one element. The key observation: the only removals that can reduce the instability are those that remove either the global min or the global max (or both). Why? Because if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the min and max of the entire array remain the same, so the instability remains `b[n-1]-b[0]`.\n\n Therefore, we can consider:\n\n   candidate1: Remove an element that is the global min (and it is the only min) -> then instability = b[n-1] - b[1]\n   candidate2: Remove an element that is the global max (and it is the only max) -> then instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is both the min and the max? (like in the case [1,1,1,...,1]) then removing one element: \n   Then the min and max remain the same (if n>2) because there are still mins and maxes. However, note that if the array is all ones, then after removing one element, the array is all ones, so instability=0.\n\n Actually, we can also consider:\n\n   candidate3: Remove an element that is the min and also the max (if the array has only one distinct value). Then the instability is 0 (if n>=2, then after removing one, we have n-1 which is at least 1, but if n-1>=1 then the array has at least one element, and if all are the same then max-min=0).\n\n But note: the problem says we remove exactly one element.\n\n However, the above two candidates (candidate1 and candidate2) are not complete because:\n\n   Example: [1,2,3,4,5] -> remove 1: then instability=4; remove 5: then instability=4. But what if we remove 2? Then instability=5-1=4. Similarly, removing 3: 5-1=4. So no improvement.\n\n But consider: [1,2,100,101] -> remove 1: then instability=101-2=99; remove 101: then instability=100-1=99; remove 2: then instability=101-1=100; remove 100: then instability=101-1=100. So the best is 99.\n\n How do we compute the candidate for removing an element that is the min? Actually, we should consider:\n\n   When we remove the first occurrence of the minimum, then the new min is the smallest value that appears in the remaining array. Since the array is sorted, the remaining array's min is:\n\n        if the first element is removed and the next element is greater than the first element, then the new min is the next element. But if there are duplicate min, then the min remains.\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Let the sorted array be `b`.\n\n   We consider two cases:\n\n   Case A: Removing an element that is the minimum (but not necessarily the last occurrence of the minimum). Then the new min is the smallest value that is >= the old min (which is the next distinct value or the same if duplicates exist). However, we are allowed to remove one occurrence. The effect on the min is:\n\n        If we remove one occurrence of the minimum, then the new min is:\n            - If there is at least two min (i.e., the first element is repeated) then the min remains `b[0]`.\n            - Else (only one occurrence) then the new min becomes `b[1]`.\n\n   Similarly, for the max.\n\n   But note: we don't know which occurrence to remove. Actually, we can consider:\n\n        candidate_min = \n          if the first k elements are equal (k>=2), then removing one of them does not change the min, so the instability becomes `b[-1] - b[0]` (same as original) OR we can remove the first occurrence and then the min becomes the next distinct value? Actually, no: if we remove one of the duplicates, the min remains the same.\n\n   Therefore, the removal of the minimum (any occurrence) will not change the min if there is at least two min. So the instability after removing a min (if there are duplicates) is `b[-1] - b[0]` (same as original). But wait, that's not helpful. We want to minimize.\n\n   Actually, we should consider: what if we remove the minimum and the minimum appears only once? Then the min becomes the next value. Similarly, if we remove the maximum and the maximum appears only once, then the max becomes the previous value.\n\n   However, we are allowed to remove any element. We are not forced to remove the global min or max. But note: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain the same.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum among:\n\n        candidate1: The instability if we remove the global min (if the min appears only once, then new min is b[1]; if there are duplicates, then the min remains and the instability is b[-1]-b[0])\n        candidate2: The instability if we remove the global max (if the max appears only once, then new max is b[-2]; if there are duplicates, then the max remains and the instability is b[-1]-b[0])\n        candidate3: The instability if we remove an element that is not the min or max? -> same as original, so we don't consider.\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min (and there are duplicates) but then the max remains? Then the instability is the same as original. Similarly for max.\n\n   However, note: we are trying to minimize. So we want the minimum among:\n\n        candidate1: \n           if the first occurrence of b[0] is the only one, then instability_after_remove_min = b[-1] - b[1]\n           else, instability_after_remove_min = b[-1] - b[0]   (same as original)\n\n        candidate2:\n           if the last occurrence of b[-1] is the only one, then instability_after_remove_max = b[-2] - b[0]\n           else, instability_after_remove_max = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n   However, wait: what if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the instability is the same as the original. So we don't need to consider that.\n\n   But note: what if the array has multiple distinct values and we remove an element that is the min (with duplicates) and then the max is unchanged, so the instability is the same as the original. Similarly, we can also remove the max (with duplicates) and the instability remains the same. But there is a possibility that by removing an element that is not the min or max we might actually change the min or max? No, because the min and max are still the same.\n\n   However, consider an array that has more than two distinct numbers. For example: [1,2,3,4,5]. The original instability is 4.\n\n   If we remove the min (1) and there is only one 1, then the instability becomes 4 (since 5-2=3? Wait: no, wait the array becomes [2,3,4,5] -> max=5, min=2 -> 5-2=3. So 3 is less than 4.\n\n   But wait, in the example [1,2,3,4,5]: \n        candidate1: remove 1 (the min) -> instability = 5-2 = 3.\n        candidate2: remove 5 (the max) -> instability = 4-1 = 3.\n\n   So the answer is 3.\n\n   Now, let's test the above logic:\n\n        candidate1: since the first element is unique (only one 1), then instability_after_remove_min = 5-2 = 3.\n        candidate2: since the last element is unique (only one 5), then instability_after_remove_max = 4-1 = 3.\n\n        Then the answer is min(3,3)=3.\n\n   Another example: [1,1,3,7] (from the example). \n        Original: 7-1=6.\n\n        candidate1: remove one of the 1's (there are two, so duplicates). Then the min remains 1, so instability_after_remove_min = 7-1 = 6.\n        candidate2: remove 7 (only one occurrence, so the max becomes 3). Then instability_after_remove_max = 3-1=2.\n\n        Then the answer is 2.\n\n   But wait, what if we remove the other 1? Then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability=6. So the candidate1 is 6 if we remove a duplicate min? Actually, no: we are allowed to remove one element. The condition for candidate1 is: if we remove a min and there are duplicates, then the min remains. So the instability is the same as the original. But note: we are not forced to remove the first occurrence. We can choose which one to remove. However, the problem says \"remove exactly one element\", so we can choose which one. Therefore, we are free to choose the removal that minimizes the instability.\n\n   In the example [1,1,3,7]: \n        We can remove the 7 to get [1,1,3] -> instability=3-1=2.\n        Or we can remove one of the 1's to get [1,3,7] -> instability=7-1=6.\n\n   So we want the minimum over all removals. Therefore, we should consider:\n\n        candidate1: the instability if we remove an element that is the min (any occurrence) -> but if there are duplicates, then removing one occurrence of min does not change the min, so the instability is the same as the original? Not necessarily: because we are allowed to choose which removal to do. Actually, we are trying to minimize the instability. So we would choose the removal that gives the smallest instability.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider:\n\n        Option 1: Remove an element that is the min (if there are duplicates, then we can remove one and the min remains, so the instability is the same as the original). But wait, we are not forced to remove a min. We can remove any element.\n\n   Actually, we can break the array into segments:\n\n        The instability after removing an element at position i (0-indexed) is:\n            new_min = b[0] if i==0 and the next element is not the same? Actually, no: we remove one element and the new array is the sorted array without the element at i.\n\n        The new min is:\n            if i==0 and b[0] == b[1] (then the min remains) OR if i==0 and b[0] < b[1] then the new min becomes b[1] (because we removed the first element and the next smallest is b[1]).\n        Similarly, the new max is:\n            if i==n-1 and b[n-1] == b[n-2] then the max remains, else if i==n-1 and b[n-1] > b[n-2] then the max becomes b[n-2].\n\n        However, we can also remove an element in the middle. Then the min is still the first element and the max is still the last element? \n\n        Actually, the min and max of the entire array (without the removed element) is:\n            min_value = \n                if we remove an element that is the smallest, then the next smallest is considered. Otherwise, the smallest is still the first element.\n            Similarly for the max.\n\n        But note: if we remove an element that is not the smallest, the smallest remains. Similarly for the largest.\n\n        Therefore, the instability after removing an element at index i is:\n\n            Let left_min = b[0] if the removed element is not the first occurrence of the minimum? Actually, we can compute:\n\n            The new min is:\n                if the removed element is the first element (i==0) and b[0] < b[1] (then the new min is b[1]), otherwise the min is b[0] (unless we remove all occurrences of b[0], but we remove only one).\n\n            Similarly, the new max is:\n                if the removed element is the last element (i==n-1) and b[n-1] > b[n-2] (then the new max is b[n-2]), otherwise the max is b[n-1].\n\n        However, wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but it is the minimum? Then the min is still the first element (if the first element is still present). Similarly, if we remove an element that is not the last but is the maximum, then the max is still the last element.\n\n        Therefore, the instability for a removal at index i is:\n\n            new_min = b[0] if i != 0 or (i==0 and there exists at least one other b[0] (duplicate)) else b[1] (if i==0 and no duplicate)\n            But wait, if we remove an element at index i (which might be in the middle) and that element is the minimum, then the min might still be b[0] (if there is another b[0] somewhere). So we cannot base it solely on the index.\n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n            We know the array is sorted. The resulting array's min is the smallest value that appears. Similarly, the max is the largest value that appears.\n\n            So, if we remove an element, the new min is:\n                if the removed element is greater than the current min, then the min remains b[0].\n                if the removed element is the min and it is the only min, then the new min is the next value (which is the first value that is greater than b[0]).\n\n            Similarly for the max.\n\n        Therefore, we can consider:\n\n            candidate_instability(i) = max(b[n-1], b[i+1] if i < n-1 else -10**18) - min(b[0], b[i-1] if i>0 else 10**18)\n\n        But wait, that's not correct. Actually, we cannot use the adjacent element for min and max because the entire array is sorted, so:\n\n            The min of the remaining array is:\n                if the removed element is the first occurrence of the minimum, then the next smallest is the next distinct value (if any) or if there are duplicates then the min remains the same.\n\n        Actually, we can precompute:\n\n            Let the array be sorted: b[0] to b[n-1]\n\n            The instability after removing the element at index i is:\n\n                low = b[0] if there exists at least one occurrence of b[0] that is not removed, else the next smallest value (which is the smallest value in the array that is >= b[0] and not removed). But we remove only one element.\n\n            We can break the array into two parts: the left part and the right part.\n\n            Actually, a simpler idea: iterate over the possible removals that can change the min or max? But note n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over all removals.\n\n        We note that the only removals that change the min or max are those that remove the current min or the current max (if they are unique). Otherwise, the instability remains the same.\n\n        But wait, consider: [1,2,3,4,5]. Removing the min (1) changes the min to 2. Removing the max (5) changes the max to 4. Removing the element 3 (which is the median) does not change the min or max.\n\n        However, what if we remove an element that is the min (and there are duplicates) but then the max is unchanged? Then the instability is the same. Similarly for max.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = (if the first occurrence of the min is the only min) then (b[-1] - b[1]) else (b[-1]-b[0]) [but wait, if there are duplicates, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so the instability is the same as the original, which is (b[-1]-b[0])]\n\n            candidate_remove_max = (if the last occurrence of the max is the only max) then (b[-2] - b[0]) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n        But wait, we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not forced to remove the min or max. However, if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability remains the same as the original. So the minimal instability must be at most the original, and we have two candidates that might be lower.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove one element. We can choose the removal that minimizes the instability.\n\n        Therefore, we can consider:\n\n            candidate1: remove the min (if it is unique) -> then instability becomes (b[-1] - b[1])\n            candidate2: remove the max (if it is unique) -> then instability becomes (b[-2] - b[0])\n            candidate3: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and candidate3? But candidate3 is the original, so we don't need to consider separately.\n\n        Actually, we must consider that sometimes removing the min (if it is duplicated) doesn't help, but removing the max (if it is duplicated) might help? No, because if the min is duplicated, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so the instability remains the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min and then the max is unchanged? Then the instability is the same as the original. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max and the min is unchanged, then the instability is the same as the original.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum between:\n\n            candidate1: (if the first occurrence of the min is the only min) then (b[-1] - b[1]) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n            candidate2: (if the last occurrence of the max is the only max) then (b[-2] - b[0]) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n        And then take the minimum of these two.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has only two elements? [1,2]: \n            Remove 1: [2] -> instability=0.\n            Remove 2: [1] -> instability=0.\n\n            According to our method:\n                candidate1: remove min (1) -> is the min unique? yes, then instability = 2-? the next smallest is 2? Actually, we remove the min, so the new min is the next element? But wait, the array becomes [2] -> min=2, max=2 -> instability=0.\n                candidate2: remove max (2) -> is the max unique? yes, then instability = 1-1=0.\n\n            So the answer is min(0,0)=0.\n\n        How do we compute candidate1 for [1,2]?\n            candidate1: remove the min (1) -> the new min is the smallest in the remaining array. The remaining array is [2] -> min=2, max=2. So instability=0.\n            But according to our formula: (if the min is unique) then (b[-1]-b[1]). Here, b = [1,2] -> b[-1]=2, b[1] is out of bounds. \n\n        So we must be careful.\n\n        We can reframe:\n\n            Let the sorted array be b.\n\n            After removal, the array has n-1 elements.\n\n            The instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n            We can consider two possibilities for the min and two for the max? Actually, we can consider:\n\n            The remaining array's min is either b[0] (if we didn't remove the only occurrence of b[0]) or the next distinct value (if we did remove the only occurrence of b[0]). Similarly for the max.\n\n            But note: we remove exactly one element.\n\n            Let:\n\n                left_bound = b[0]   # the smallest value\n                right_bound = b[-1]  # the largest value\n\n            Then, the instability if we remove an element x is:\n\n                new_min = \n                    if x == left_bound and the count of left_bound is 1, then the new_min is the next smallest value (which is the smallest value in the array that is > left_bound). But wait, the array is sorted, so the next smallest value is b[1] (if n>=2). However, if we remove x and x is the only left_bound, then the new_min is the next value (which is b[1]). But if there are multiple left_bound, then the new_min is still left_bound.\n\n                Similarly, new_max = \n                    if x == right_bound and the count of right_bound is 1, then the new_max is b[-2]. Otherwise, the new_max is right_bound.\n\n            But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the min or max? Then the min and max remain the same.\n\n            However, what if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates? Then the min remains, and the max remains (unless we remove the max too, but we are removing one element). So the instability is the same.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal instability is:\n\n                candidate1 = (if we remove the min and the min is unique) then (b[-1] - b[1])   [because the new_min becomes b[1] and the new_max remains b[-1]]\n                candidate2 = (if we remove the max and the max is unique) then (b[-2] - b[0])   [because the new_max becomes b[-2] and the new_min remains b[0]]\n\n            But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min (unique) and the array has more than two elements? Then the min becomes b[1] and the max remains b[-1]. Similarly, if we remove the max (unique) then the min remains b[0] and the max becomes b[-2].\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. But if we remove an element that is the min (unique) then the instability becomes (b[-1] - b[1]). Similarly, if we remove the max (unique) then (b[-2]-b[0]). But what if we remove an element that is the min (unique) and also the max? Then the array becomes [b[1] ... b[-2]] and the instability is (b[-2]-b[1]). But that is not covered by candidate1 or candidate2.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3,4,5] and remove 1 and 5? But wait, we remove only one element.\n\n            Actually, we remove one element. So we cannot remove both.\n\n            Therefore, we have two independent candidates: removing the min (if unique) or removing the max (if unique). But note: sometimes the min and max are the same (all elements equal). Then removing one element: the instability is 0.\n\n            How do we account for that?\n\n            Actually, we can consider:\n\n                candidate_remove_min = (if the frequency of b[0] is 1) then (b[-1] - b[1]) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n                candidate_remove_max = (if the frequency of b[-1] is 1) then (b[-2] - b[0]) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n            Then the answer is min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max)\n\n            But wait, what if the array has all elements equal? Then:\n\n                candidate_remove_min: frequency of b[0] is n (>=2) -> then candidate_remove_min = (b[-1]-b[0]) = 0 (since b[-1]==b[0])\n                candidate_remove_max: frequency of b[-1] is n (>=2) -> then candidate_remove_max = (b[-1]-b[0]) = 0.\n\n            Then answer=0.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1] -> remove one 1: [1,1] -> instability=0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3,4,5] -> \n                candidate_remove_min: frequency of 1 is 1 -> candidate_remove_min = 5-2 = 3.\n                candidate_remove_max: frequency of 5 is 1 -> candidate_remove_max = 4-1 = 3.\n                Then answer=3.\n\n            Example: [1,1,3,7] -> \n                candidate_remove_min: frequency of 1 is 2 -> candidate_remove_min = 7-1=6.\n                candidate_remove_max: frequency of 7 is 1 -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1=2.\n                Then answer=2.\n\n            Example: [1,100000] (n=2) -> \n                candidate_remove_min: frequency of 1 is 1 -> candidate_remove_min = 100000-? but wait, the array has two elements: [1,100000] -> remove 1: [100000] -> instability=0. But according to our formula: \n                    candidate_remove_min = (if unique) then (b[-1]-b[1]) -> b[1] is out of bounds (index1 is the last element) -> we need to handle the case when n==2.\n\n            We must be cautious about indices.\n\n            Let's redefine:\n\n                candidate_remove_min = \n                    if the first occurrence of the min is the only min (i.e., the frequency of the first element is 1) then:\n                        new_min = b[1]   (if n>=2, then b[1] exists) and new_max = b[-1] (unless we remove the max too, but we are only removing one element). But wait, if we remove the min and the min is unique, then the new array's min is the next smallest element (which is b[1]) and the max is the same as before (unless the element we remove is also the max, but if the array has more than one distinct value then we assume the min and max are different).\n\n                However, in the two-element array [1,100000]: \n                    candidate_remove_min: remove 1 (the min) -> the array becomes [100000] -> instability=0.\n\n                How do we compute that? \n\n                We can say:\n\n                    candidate_remove_min = \n                        if the array has at least two distinct values and the min is unique, then (b[-1] - b[1])\n                        if the array has only one distinct value (then b[0]==b[-1]), then removing the min (which is the same as the max) leaves an array of n-1 elements, all the same, so instability=0.\n\n                But wait, we can generalize:\n\n                    The instability after removing the min (if the min is unique) is: \n                        new_min = b[1] (if n>=2, but if n==1 then we cannot remove, but n>=2) and the max is still the global max (unless the element removed was the max too, but then the array has only one element and the min and max are the same).\n\n                Actually, if we remove the min and the min is unique, the new array's min is the next smallest distinct value (if exists) or if the array has only one distinct value then the array becomes empty? No, n>=2, so after removal we have at least one element.\n\n                Actually, we can compute the instability after removing the min (if unique) as:\n\n                    new_min = b[1] (if n>=2, then b[1] exists) and new_max = b[-1] (unless the element we removed is the only max, but note: we are removing the min, which is the smallest, and the max is the largest. They are different unless the array has only one distinct value, but then the min is not unique? Actually, if the array has only one distinct value, then the min is not unique (because n>=2) so we don't consider candidate_remove_min in that case.\n\n                Wait, in the case of [1,1] (n=2): \n                    Then the min is not unique, so candidate_remove_min = (b[-1]-b[0]) = 1-1=0.\n\n                But wait, if we remove one 1 from [1,1] then the array becomes [1] -> instability=0.\n\n                So the formula for candidate_remove_min is:\n\n                    if the frequency of the min is 1:\n                        if n==2: then the array has two distinct values? Actually, if n==2 and the min is unique, then the array has two distinct values. Then removing the min: the array has one element (the max) -> instability=0.\n                        if n>2: then the new min is b[1] and the max is b[-1] -> instability = b[-1]-b[1]\n\n                Similarly, for candidate_remove_max:\n\n                    if the frequency of the max is 1:\n                        if n==2: then removing the max leaves one element (the min) -> instability=0.\n                        if n>2: then the new max is b[-2] and the min is b[0] -> instability = b[-2]-b[0]\n\n                Then the answer is the minimum of:\n\n                    candidate_remove_min (if the min is unique) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n                    candidate_remove_max (if the max is unique) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n                But wait, we can combine:\n\n                    candidate_remove_min = (if freq(min)==1) then (if n==2 then 0 else (b[-1]-b[1])) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n                    candidate_remove_max = (if freq(max)==1) then (if n==2 then 0 else (b[-2]-b[0])) else (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n                Then the answer is min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max)\n\n            However, note: in the two-element array [1,2]: \n                candidate_remove_min: min is 1, unique -> then n==2 -> candidate_remove_min=0.\n                candidate_remove_max: max is 2, unique -> then n==2 -> candidate_remove_max=0.\n\n            Then answer=0.\n\n            Example [1,3,3,7] (n=4): \n                candidate_remove_min: min=1, unique -> then n>2 -> candidate_remove_min = 7-3=4.\n                candidate_remove_max: max=7, unique -> then n>2 -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1=2.\n                Then answer=2.\n\n            Example [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5):\n                candidate_remove_min: min=1, unique -> candidate_remove_min=5-2=3.\n                candidate_remove_max: max=5, unique -> candidate_remove_max=4-1=3.\n                Then answer=3.\n\n            Example [1,1,3,7] (n=4):\n                candidate_remove_min: min=1, frequency=2 -> candidate_remove_min = 7-1=6.\n                candidate_remove_max: max=7, frequency=1 -> candidate_remove_max=3-1=2.\n                Then answer=2.\n\n            Example [1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can only potentially reduce the instability if the removed element is either the current minimum or the current maximum (and they are unique). If there are duplicates of the minimum or maximum, removing one occurrence does not change the min or max values, so the instability remains the same as the original array.\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal instability is achieved by either:\n   - Removing the unique minimum element, which sets the new minimum to the next smallest value (if it exists), thus reducing the instability to `(max - next_min)`.\n   - Removing the unique maximum element, which sets the new maximum to the next largest value (if it exists), thus reducing the instability to `(next_max - min)`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily identify the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - Check the frequency of the first and last elements in the sorted array. If the first element is unique, consider the instability after its removal. Similarly for the last element.\n   - For arrays with two elements, removing either the min or max results in a single-element array with zero instability.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 10^5`. The subsequent checks and calculations are done in constant time, making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    total_instability = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n    \n    if arr[0] != arr[1]:\n        candidate_min = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    else:\n        candidate_min = total_instability\n        \n    if arr[-1] != arr[-2]:\n        candidate_max = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    else:\n        candidate_max = total_instability\n        \n    answer = min(candidate_min, candidate_max)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing either element results in a single-element array with zero instability.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n4. **Instability Calculation**:\n   - **Unique Minimum**: If the first element is unique (i.e., `arr[0] != arr[1]`), the instability after removing the minimum is calculated as `arr[-1] - arr[1]`.\n   - **Non-Unique Minimum**: If the minimum is not unique, removing one occurrence does not change the minimum, so the instability remains `arr[-1] - arr[0]`.\n   - Similarly for the maximum element.\n5. **Result**: The minimal instability is the smaller value between the two candidates (removing unique min or unique max). This result is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the relevant scenarios where removing an element actually affects the instability, leveraging sorting and simple conditional checks to arrive at the solution.",
