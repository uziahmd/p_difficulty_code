A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. Total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into 'd' slices. So total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. We have 'p' grams of salt.\n\n For one toast:\n   - Drink needed: nl milliliters (per toast)\n   - Lime needed: 1 slice\n   - Salt needed: np grams\n\n But note: the condition is that each friend must drink the same amount and make the same number of toasts.\n\n Let x be the number of toasts per friend.\n\n Then, total toasts = n * x.\n\n Constraints:\n  - The total drink required for n*x toasts is (n*x) * nl <= total_drink = k*l.\n  - The total lime slices required is (n*x) * 1 <= total_slices = c*d.\n  - The total salt required is (n*x) * np <= p.\n\n So, the maximum number of toasts per friend, x, is limited by:\n\n  x <= (k*l) / (n * nl)   [from drink]\n  x <= (c*d) / (n)        [from lime]   because each toast requires one slice and we need n*x slices in total.\n  x <= p / (n * np)       [from salt]\n\n However, note: the total toasts is n*x, so the constraints can be written in terms of the total toasts T = n*x.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the maximum toasts per friend as:\n\n  x = min( (k*l) // (n * nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n * np) )\n\n But wait: the drink constraint: total drink needed for T toasts is T * nl, and T = n*x, so T <= (k*l) / nl -> x <= (k*l)/(n*nl)\n\n Similarly, for lime: T = n*x <= c*d -> x <= (c*d)/n\n\n For salt: T * np <= p -> x <= p/(n*np)\n\n However, note: the division here must be integer and we are making whole toasts. Since we cannot have a fraction of a toast, we take the floor.\n\n But note: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n Calculation:\n   Total drink: 4*5 = 20 ml\n   Drink constraint: 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so x <= 2 (since we take integer part? Actually, the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning integer toasts.)\n\n However, the example does:\n\n   Drink: 20 ml, each toast needs 3 ml -> 6 toasts (because 20//3 = 6) but wait, 6 toasts require 18 ml, which is less than 20.\n\n But note: the condition is per toast. The drink constraint per toast is 3 ml, so total toasts from drink is floor(20/3)=6.\n\n Then, the lime: 10*8=80 slices -> 80 toasts, but then we divide by the number of friends (each toast is for one friend? Actually, the problem states: each friend needs one slice per toast they make. So if there are n friends and each makes x toasts, then the total toasts is n*x and we require n*x <= 80.\n\n Similarly, salt: 100 grams, each toast requires 1 gram, so 100 toasts, then n*x <= 100.\n\n Then the limiting factor is the drink: 6 toasts. Then since there are 3 friends, each friend can make at most 6 // 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n So we can also think:\n\n  total_toasts_possible = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )   [but note: the drink is in milliliters and we need nl per toast, so total drink needed for T toasts is T * nl, so T_max_drink = (k*l) // nl (if we use integer division, but note: we can't exceed the total drink)]\n\n However, wait: the example uses 3 ml per toast, and 20 ml -> 20//3 = 6 (using integer floor division). But note: if the drink wasn't enough, we would use floor division.\n\n But the problem states: they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n  Let T_total = total number of toasts (for the entire group).\n\n  Then, T_total must satisfy:\n      T_total <= (k * l) // nl   [actually, we should use floor division because you can't use a fraction of a toast? But note: the drink might not be divisible by nl. Example: 20 ml, 3 ml per toast -> 6 toasts (since 6*3=18<=20, 7*3=21>20)]\n\n  Similarly, T_total <= c * d   [each toast requires one lime slice]\n        T_total <= p // np       [if np=1, then p//np = 100, but if np=2, then 100//2=50]\n\n  However, note: the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice and np grams. And the friends must drink the same amount. So the total toasts T_total must be divisible by n? Not necessarily: because the problem doesn't say that the toasts are distributed equally in the sense that the total toasts must be divisible by n. Actually, each friend makes the same number of toasts, say x. Then T_total = n*x.\n\n  Therefore, T_total must be a multiple of n. But we are to maximize x, so we are effectively maximizing T_total (which is n*x) under the constraints and then dividing by n.\n\n  However, note: the constraints are on the entire group. We can also compute:\n\n      max_drink_toasts = (k * l) // nl   [maximum toasts from drink]\n      max_lime_toasts = c * d            [maximum toasts from lime]\n      max_salt_toasts = p // np          [maximum toasts from salt]\n\n  Then the maximum total toasts T_total that the group can make is min(max_drink_toasts, max_lime_toasts, max_salt_toasts).\n\n  But wait: the example: \n      drink: 20//3 = 6\n      lime: 80\n      salt: 100//1 = 100\n      Then T_total = min(6, 80, 100) = 6.\n\n  Then, since there are 3 friends, each friend can make 6 // 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n  However, consider: what if the total toasts (6) is not divisible by n? Then we cannot have each friend making the same integer number of toasts? \n\n  But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" per toast. And they all drink the same amount. So the total toasts must be divisible by n? Actually, no: because we are distributing the resources. We are making T_total toasts, and each toast is for one friend. But the condition is that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So T_total must be divisible by n.\n\n  However, the example didn't require divisibility because 6 was divisible by 3.\n\n  What if the total toasts available is 7? Then we cannot have 3 friends each making an integer number of toasts (because 7 is not divisible by 3). But note: the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning we are going to set x as the maximum integer such that:\n\n      n*x <= min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n\n  Actually, we don't require the total toasts to be exactly the minimum of the three, but we can only use up to the minimum. And then we must have n*x <= that minimum. But we are allowed to use less than the total available if we cannot use all because of divisibility? \n\n  However, the problem does not require that we use the entire resource. We are to maximize x (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n      n*x <= (k*l) // nl   [actually, we can use floor division for the drink? But note: the drink requirement is nl per toast. So if we make T_total toasts, we require T_total * nl <= k*l. We can use real numbers for the condition? But the problem says positive integers.\n\n  Let's reframe without requiring T_total to be the absolute maximum from the resources, but rather the maximum T_total that is a multiple of n and satisfies:\n\n      T_total * nl <= k*l\n      T_total <= c*d\n      T_total * np <= p\n\n  Then, we can compute:\n\n      T_total_max = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )   [but note: for drink, we can use floor division because if T_total * nl <= k*l, then T_total <= (k*l) / nl, so maximum integer T_total is floor((k*l)/nl). Similarly for salt: p // np (floor division). For lime: we don't divide by anything except the integer count.]\n\n  However, wait: the drink condition: T_total * nl <= k*l -> T_total <= k*l / nl. Since T_total must be an integer, the maximum T_total is floor(k*l / nl). Similarly, for salt: T_total <= p / np -> floor(p / np). For lime: T_total <= c*d (an integer).\n\n  Then, we are to find the maximum multiple of n (i.e., T_total must be divisible by n) that is <= min(floor(k*l/nl), c*d, floor(p/np)).\n\n  But note: the example: min(6,80,100)=6. Then the maximum T_total that is divisible by 3 and <=6 is 6. Then x = 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n  Another example: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n  Input: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n  Calculate:\n      Drink: (100*10) // 4 = 1000//4 = 250\n      Lime: 1*19 = 19\n      Salt: 90 // 3 = 30\n\n      T_total_max = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n\n      Now, we need the maximum multiple of 5 (n=5) that is <=19 -> 15 (because 15 is the largest multiple of 5 that is <=19). Then x = 15 // 5 = 3.\n\n  But the example output is 3.\n\n  However, let me check with the example: \n      \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n      The example output is 3.\n\n  But wait: the example input format is: \n      ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\n  So our method works.\n\n  But note: the example says: \n      Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n      Output: 3\n\n  However, there's a twist: the example input is given as a list of strings, but we read one line.\n\n  But wait: is it always necessary to take the multiple of n? The problem says \"each friend needs ...\", and they all drink the same amount. So the total toasts must be divisible by n.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      total_drink = k * l\n      total_lime_slices = c * d\n      total_salt = p\n\n      max_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // nl   # floor division: how many toasts can be made from drink?\n      max_toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices     # each toast requires one slice\n      max_toasts_by_salt = total_salt // np      # floor division\n\n      total_max_toasts = min(max_toasts_by_drink, max_toasts_by_lime, max_toasts_by_salt)\n\n      # Now, we need to find the maximum multiple of n (the number of friends) that is <= total_max_toasts.\n      # How to compute that? \n      #   Let x = total_max_toasts // n   ? But wait: that gives the number of toasts per friend if we use the entire total_max_toasts? \n      #   Actually, no: because total_max_toasts might not be divisible by n.\n\n      # We want the maximum x such that n*x <= total_max_toasts.\n      # Then x = total_max_toasts // n   (because if we do integer division, then n * (total_max_toasts // n) <= total_max_toasts, and it's the largest multiple of n not exceeding total_max_toasts)\n\n      # But wait: let me test: \n      #   Example 1: total_max_toasts=6, n=3 -> 6//3=2 -> correct.\n      #   Example 2: total_max_toasts=19, n=5 -> 19//5=3 (since 5*3=15<=19, and 5*4=20>19) -> correct.\n\n      # However, note: the above calculation for total_max_toasts was using floor division for drink and salt, and integer for lime.\n\n      # But wait: is the drink constraint correctly represented by floor division? \n      #   Condition: n*x <= total_max_toasts, where total_max_toasts is the minimum of:\n      #       (k*l) // nl   -> this is the maximum number of toasts from drink (because each toast requires nl, so we can have at most floor(k*l/nl) toasts from drink)\n      #       c*d           -> integer, so no issue.\n      #       p // np        -> same as drink.\n\n      # Therefore, we can compute:\n\n      #   total_max_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n\n      #   Then, x = total_max_toasts // n\n\n      # However, wait: the drink and salt are computed by floor division, and the lime is exact. But the condition for drink is: we require n*x * nl <= k*l. \n\n      #   We have: n*x * nl <= n * (total_max_toasts // n) * nl <= total_max_toasts * nl <= (k*l) // nl * nl <= k*l   [since (k*l)//nl * nl <= k*l]\n\n      #   Similarly for salt: n*x * np <= total_max_toasts * np <= (p//np) * np <= p.\n\n      #   And for lime: n*x <= total_max_toasts <= c*d.\n\n      # Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n  However, note: the example \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" (third sample)\n\n      Input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\n      n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n      Drink: (1000*1000) // 50 = 1000000 // 50 = 20000\n      Lime: 25*23 = 575\n      Salt: 1 // 1 = 1\n\n      total_max_toasts = min(20000, 575, 1) = 1\n\n      Then x = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n      Output: 0 -> matches the example.\n\n  But wait, there's a potential issue: the drink and salt constraints are calculated with floor division, but the condition for drink is actually:\n\n      The total drink used is (n*x)*nl = 10*x*50 = 500*x.\n\n      We must have 500*x <= 1000*1000 = 1000000 -> x <= 2000, which is more than 0.\n\n      Similarly, salt: 10*x*1 <= 1 -> x<=0.1 -> so x=0.\n\n      So the limiting factor is the salt.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      Read the 8 integers from stdin.\n\n      n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n      total_drink = k * l\n      max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl   # integer floor division\n\n      total_lime_slices = c * d\n      max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n\n      max_toasts_salt = p // np\n\n      total_max_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\n      x = total_max_toasts // n\n\n      Print(x)\n\n  However, wait: the example first sample:\n\n      Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n      n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n      total_drink = 4*5 = 20\n      max_toasts_drink = 20 // 3 = 6\n\n      total_lime_slices = 10*8 = 80\n      max_toasts_lime = 80\n\n      max_toasts_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n\n      total_max_toasts = 6\n      x = 6 // 3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n  But wait: why did we use floor division for drink and salt? Because the resources are discrete. We cannot use a fraction of a toast.\n\n  However, note: the drink condition: if we have 20 ml and each toast requires 3 ml, then we can only make 6 toasts (not 6.66...). Similarly, salt: if we have 100 grams and each toast requires 1 gram, then 100 toasts.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  But what if the drink was 21 ml? Then 21//3=7, which is correct.\n\n  However, consider: what if the drink is 19 ml? Then 19//3=6 (same as 20//3). That's correct because 6*3=18<=19, and 7*3=21>19.\n\n  So the code is:\n\n      data = input().split()\n      if not data:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          n = int(data[0]); k = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); c = int(data[3]); d = int(data[4]); p = int(data[5]); nl = int(data[6]); np = int(data[7])\n          total_drink = k * l\n          max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n\n          total_lime_slices = c * d\n          max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n\n          max_toasts_salt = p // np\n\n          total_max_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\n          x = total_max_toasts // n\n\n          print(x)\n\n  But wait: is the condition for the drink and salt correctly represented by floor division? \n\n  For drink: condition is that the total drink used is (n*x)*nl <= k*l. We are computing the maximum toasts from drink as k*l//nl. Then we are saying that the maximum total toasts (without considering the other constraints) is k*l//nl. Then we take the minimum of the three. Then we divide by n (integer division) to get x.\n\n  However, note: the drink condition in terms of x: n*x <= k*l / nl. The maximum integer n*x that satisfies that is n * (floor(k*l/(n*nl)))? \n\n  But wait, we are not. We are taking the total toasts (T_total = n*x) and the condition is T_total <= k*l//nl (which is the maximum toasts from drink). Then we are setting T_total_max = min(...). Then x = T_total_max // n.\n\n  Is that equivalent to the condition that n*x <= k*l//nl? \n\n      We have T_total_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n\n      Then x = T_total_max // n.\n\n      Then n*x = n * (T_total_max // n) <= T_total_max <= (k*l)//nl.\n\n      So the condition holds.\n\n  However, is it the maximum? \n\n      We are taking the minimum of the three maximums (each representing the maximum toasts from one resource). Then we are taking the maximum multiple of n that is <= that minimum. \n\n      This is the maximum number of toasts the entire group can have (in multiples of n) without exceeding any resource.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> Output: 2\n\n  Example 2: \n      Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> Output: 3\n\n  Example 3: \n      Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> Output: 0\n\n  It matches.\n\n  However, wait: what if the drink constraint is not the limiting factor? Consider:\n\n      n=2, k=1, l=10, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=5, np=1\n\n      total_drink = 10 -> max_toasts_drink = 10//5 = 2\n      total_lime_slices = 100 -> max_toasts_lime = 100\n      max_toasts_salt = 10//1 = 10\n\n      total_max_toasts = 2\n\n      Then x = 2//2 = 1.\n\n      Check: \n          Each friend makes 1 toast -> total toasts=2.\n          Drink: 2*5 = 10 <= 10 -> ok.\n          Lime: 2 slices <= 100 -> ok.\n          Salt: 2*1 = 2 <= 10 -> ok.\n\n      Correct.\n\n  Another test: \n      n=2, k=1, l=9, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=5, np=1\n\n      total_drink = 9 -> max_toasts_drink = 9//5 = 1\n      total_lime_slices = 100\n      max_toasts_salt = 10\n\n      total_max_toasts = 1\n      x = 1//2 = 0\n\n      Correct: because with 9 ml, we can only make 1 toast (5 ml) and then we have 4 ml left. But we have two friends, so we cannot split the toast (each friend must make the same number). Therefore, each friend makes 0 toasts.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is:\n\n      Read the 8 integers.\n\n      n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n      total_drink = k * l\n      max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n\n      total_lime_slices = c * d\n      max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n\n      max_toasts_salt = p // np\n\n      total_max_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\n      x = total_max_toasts // n\n\n      print(x)\n\n  But wait: what if the drink or salt is zero? The problem says positive integers, so minimum 1. So no division by zero.\n\n  However, note: if nl is large such that k*l < nl, then max_toasts_drink = 0, then total_max_toasts=0, then x=0.\n\n  Similarly, if np is large such that p < np, then max_toasts_salt=0.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Let's run the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> [3,4,5,10,8,100,3,1]\n      n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n      total_drink = 20, max_toasts_drink=20//3=6\n      total_lime_slices=80, max_toasts_lime=80\n      max_toasts_salt=100//1=100\n      total_max_toasts=min(6,80,100)=6\n      x=6//3=2 -> prints 2.\n\n  Example 2: \n      Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> [5,100,10,1,19,90,4,3]\n      total_drink=1000, 1000//4=250\n      total_lime_slices=1*19=19\n      max_toasts_salt=90//3=30\n      total_max_toasts=min(250,19,30)=19\n      x=19//5=3 -> prints 3.\n\n  Example 3: \n      Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> [10,1000,1000,25,23,1,50,1]\n      total_drink=1000000, 1000000//50=20000\n      total_lime_slices=25*23=575\n      max_toasts_salt=1//1=1\n      total_max_toasts=min(20000,575,1)=1\n      x=1//10=0 -> prints 0.\n\n  Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then distribute these toasts equally among all friends.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on three constraints: the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and each friend must make the same number of toasts.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total amount of each resource available.\n   - Determining the maximum number of toasts possible for each resource individually.\n   - The smallest of these maxima will be the overall constraint (since all resources must be sufficient).\n   - Finally, dividing this constraint by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves straightforward arithmetic operations:\n   - Multiply the number of bottles by the volume per bottle to get the total drink.\n   - Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime to get the total lime slices.\n   - Use integer division to find the maximum toasts each resource can support.\n   - The smallest of these values is the limiting factor.\n   - Divide the limiting factor by the number of friends (using integer division) to get the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    \n    max_toasts_salt = p // np\n    \n    total_max_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    \n    x = total_max_toasts // n\n    \n    print(x)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, volume per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink required per toast, and salt required per toast.\n2. **Calculating Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiplied from the number of bottles and volume per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Multiplied from the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: Divided into maximum toasts using integer division.\n3. **Finding Limiting Factor**: The smallest value among the maximum toasts each resource can support determines the overall constraint.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The limiting factor is divided by the number of friends (using integer division) to ensure each friend makes an equal number of toasts.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by focusing on the most restrictive resource, ensuring optimal distribution among friends.",
