And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we compute the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of all sleep times for all weeks.\n\n Then the average is S / (number_of_weeks) = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: Each week is a contiguous subarray of length k.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to compute the sum for each week and then sum them up.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n and k.\n 2. Read the list of n integers.\n 3. If k == 0, then we have no week? But k>=1 per constraints.\n 4. We can precompute the prefix sum to quickly get the sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints are up to 200,000 elements. So we need an O(n) solution.\n\n We can do:\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0\n\n   But how to compute the sum of all weeks?\n\n   Consider: \n     Week1: [0:k] -> sum = a0+a1+...+a_{k-1}\n     Week2: [1:k+1] -> sum = a1+a2+...+a_k\n     ...\n\n   We can use a sliding window:\n\n   Let window_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n   Then for the next window, subtract a0 and add a_k.\n\n   We can do:\n\n     total = 0\n     current_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n     total += current_sum\n     Then for i from k to n-1:\n         current_sum = current_sum - a[i-k] + a[i]\n         total += current_sum\n\n   Then the average is total / total_weeks\n\n But wait: Is that correct?\n\n Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n   total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n   First window: [3,4] -> 7\n   Second window: [4,7] -> 11\n   total = 7+11 = 18\n   average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> which matches the example.\n\n However, note: the example output was '9.0000000000'\n\n But the problem says: \"the answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\"\n\n We can use floating point arithmetic, but note the numbers are integers and the division might be integer division in Python if we use integers. \n\n However, we are dividing two integers: total (which is integer) by total_weeks (integer). But note that the total_weeks is n-k+1, which is integer.\n\n But we must output a float with formatting to have at least 6 decimal places.\n\n But wait: what if there are many windows? The total might be very large? However, the constraints say n, k up to 200000 and ai up to 10^5.\n\n Maximum total for one week: 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, so worst-case total for all windows: (n-k+1) * (max_week_sum) but note we are summing over windows and each element is counted multiple times.\n\n Actually, we are doing a sliding window and the total we compute is the sum of all windows. Each element a[i] will appear in (min(i+1, k, n-i, ...)) actually:\n\n   The first element appears in the first k windows? Actually, the element at index i will appear in (n - i) windows? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, the window that includes a[i] must start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). So the number of windows that include a[i] is: \n        left = i - (k-1) ??? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula: \n        total = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a[i] * (number of windows that include a[i])\n\n   The number of windows that include a[i] is: \n        L = max(0, i - k + 1) is the first window that includes a[i]? Actually, the windows that include a[i] are those that start from 0 to i (if we consider the window starting at s, then s<=i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then determining the average across all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all contiguous subarrays (weeks) of length `k` in a sequence of `n` days. Each week's sleep time is the sum of `k` consecutive days. The challenge is to compute these sums efficiently for large `n` (up to 200,000) without resorting to a brute-force method, which would be too slow.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to compute the sum of each week (subarray of length `k`) in linear time. The initial window sum is calculated for the first `k` elements. As we slide the window one element at a time from left to right, we adjust the window sum by subtracting the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. This adjustment allows us to compute each subsequent window sum in constant time.\n\n3. **Summing Week Sums**: After computing all window sums, we sum them up. The total number of weeks is `n - k + 1`. The average sleep time is then obtained by dividing the total sum of all weeks by the number of weeks.\n\n4. **Output Precision**: The result must be printed with a precision of at least six decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of each week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`. If there are no weeks (`k > n`), the result is trivially zero.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum**: The initial window sum is computed for the first `k` elements. For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the next element in the sequence. This adjustment ensures each window sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: The sums of all windows are accumulated into `total_sum`.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is derived by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks. The result is formatted to ten decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.",
