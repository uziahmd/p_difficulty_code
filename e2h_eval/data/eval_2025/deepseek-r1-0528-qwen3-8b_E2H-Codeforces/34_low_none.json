And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

Specifically, an element at position i (0-indexed) \n will appear in the weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(n-k, i). Actually, the number of weeks that include ai is:\n   count_i = min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1+i)   ... This direct formula is tricky.\n\n Instead, we can use a sliding window and cumulative sums.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list a.\n 2. Compute the prefix sum array for a: \n      Let prefix[0] = 0, and for i from 1 to n: prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n 3.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then determining the average across all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all contiguous subarrays (weeks) of length `k` in a sequence of `n` days. Each week's sleep time is the sum of `k` consecutive days. The challenge is to compute these sums efficiently without recalculating for overlapping windows repeatedly.\n2. **Intuition**: Using a prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. The prefix sum array is built by storing cumulative sums up to each index in the original array. This setup helps in quickly accessing the sum of any subarray by subtracting the prefix values at the boundaries.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the original array up to index `i-1`. This allows O(1) sum queries for any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: Iterate through each possible starting index of a week (subarray of length `k`), use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the current window, accumulate these sums, and then compute the average.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time for constructing the prefix sum array and another O(n) pass to compute the sums of all windows. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the prefix sum array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        window_sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n        total_sum += window_sum\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), followed by `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix array is built such that `prefix[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times array. This allows efficient calculation of any subarray sum.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible starting index of a week, the sum of the window (subarray of length `k`) is computed by subtracting the prefix value at the start index from the prefix value at the end index (inclusive). These sums are accumulated into `total_sum`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is obtained by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`). The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the prefix sum technique to minimize repeated calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
