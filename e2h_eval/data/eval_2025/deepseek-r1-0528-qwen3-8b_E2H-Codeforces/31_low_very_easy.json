Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n  We want the minimum number of cards. So we want to use as few cards as possible to get a total of -S.\n\n 4. Consider:\n    - If S == 0, then we don't need any additional cards -> answer 0.\n\n 5. Otherwise, we have to make up the difference D = -S (so we need to get a total of D from the new cards).\n\n 6. The maximum absolute value for a card is x, meaning each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative) to the total.\n\n 7. We can think greedily: \n    - To minimize the number of cards, we would like to use as large (in absolute value) as possible cards.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require that we use only positive or negative, but we can mix.\n\n    However, note that we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n 8. Actually, we can consider two cases: \n    Case 1: D is positive. Then we need to add positive cards (or negative cards that together with positive ones cancel out? Actually, we can use negative cards too, but then we have to compensate with more positive ones). \n\n    But note: we are free to choose any numbers. So the best way is to use as many x's as possible until we get to a point where we can adjust with one more card.\n\n    Alternatively, we can note:\n\n    Let k be the number of cards. Then the maximum positive sum we can get is k*x, and the maximum negative is -k*x.\n\n    We need to have k*x >= |D| and also the remainder (after subtracting multiples of x) must be within the range of one card? Actually, no: we are allowed to choose any integers, so we can break the total into any combination.\n\n    However, note: we are not limited to only x and -x, but we can use any integer. But the minimal number of cards is determined by the fact that we can use the largest step (x) as much as we can.\n\n    Actually, we can use the following:\n\n    Let k_min = ceil(|D| / x) if we were only allowed to use one sign? But wait, we can mix positive and negative. However, the problem is symmetric.\n\n    But note: we are not restricted to only one sign. However, if we need to achieve a positive D, then we can use positive cards. Similarly, for negative D, we use negative cards.\n\n    However, there is a catch: we might be able to use both positive and negative cards to get the same effect with fewer cards? \n\n    Example: In the second sample: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        Current sum S = -4, so D = 4.\n        Maximum per card is 3 (absolute value). \n        If we use two cards: we can use two 2's (but note: 2 is within [-3,3]), then 2+2=4. But wait, why can't we use one card of 4? \n        Because 4 exceeds x=3. So we cannot use a single card. Then we use two cards: each card can be at most 3, so 3+1=4? But wait, we can use two cards: [3,1] -> but 1 is allowed. However, the problem says \"minimum number\", so two is the answer.\n\n    But wait, the example output is 2.\n\n    However, consider: we could use two cards: one 3 and one 1, but actually we can use two cards: two 2's. So two is the minimum.\n\n    How to compute?\n\n    We note that we can use both positive and negative. But actually, the minimal number of cards must be at least ceil(|D| / x) because each card can change the sum by at most x (in absolute value). However, we can also use negative steps if D is negative? Actually, no: if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value from -x to x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero after adding some number of cards. The additional cards can have values ranging from -x to x. The goal is to find the smallest number of such cards whose sum equals the negative of the current sum of the found cards.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by how much the current sum deviates from zero. Each additional card can contribute at most ±x to the sum. Therefore, the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of the absolute value of the current sum divided by x. However, if the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards. If this sum is zero, the answer is zero. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of the sum and divide it by x, rounding up to the nearest integer. This gives the minimum number of cards required to balance the sum to zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_total = abs(total)\n        k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Absolute Value Handling**: If the sum is non-zero, the absolute value of the sum is taken to determine the magnitude of the deficit or surplus that needs to be balanced.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards required is calculated by performing a ceiling division of the absolute sum by `x`. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations. Specifically, `(abs_total + x - 1) // x` effectively computes the ceiling of `abs_total / x`.\n5. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with a constant time complexity for the calculations after reading the input.",
