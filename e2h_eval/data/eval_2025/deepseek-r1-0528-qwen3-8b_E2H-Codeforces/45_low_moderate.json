There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But the constraint: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let k be the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Then, the winner must beat k opponents. However, note that the tournament is structured so that the winner must face players from different \"rounds\" or groups, but the rule allows for some flexibility.\n\n How can we think about it?\n We know that the entire tournament has a structure that is a binary tree? But note: the rule says that two players can play only if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\n Alternatively, consider building the tournament in rounds. The winner must go through k rounds, and in each round he plays one game.\n\n However, the problem is that the rule restricts the pairing. We can model the tournament as having two types of matches:\n\n Let's define:\n   Let a_k be the maximum number of players that can be arranged such that the winner (starting from 1) can win exactly k games under the given rule.\n\n How to build the tournament for k games?\n\n In the first game, the winner plays his first opponent. Then, to play the second game, the winner must have played one game, and the opponent must have played either 0 or 1. But wait, the rule says \"the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one\". So when the winner has played 1 game, the next opponent must have played either 0 or 1.\n\n However, note: the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner is the only one left at the end.\n\n We can think of the tournament as having two subtrees for each game: one for the left and one for the right? But actually, the rule is about the history.\n\n Another idea: \n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required so that the winner can win k games.\n\n How to form the tournament?\n\n In the first game, the winner plays one player. Then, to win the second game, the winner must play someone who has played at most 1 game (because the winner has now 1 game). But note: the opponent in the second game must be someone who hasn't lost yet, and that opponent must have played 0 or 1 game.\n\n However, we want to maximize the winner's games, so we are to find the maximum k such that there exists a tournament with n players and the winner plays k games.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the maximum k for which the tournament can be arranged.\n\n Consider:\n\n In order for the winner to play k games, we need:\n\n Round 1: 1 game (the first game) -> requires 2 players (the winner and one opponent). But note: the winner must then have 1 win, and the opponent is eliminated.\n\n For the second game: the winner must play an opponent. This opponent must come from the remaining pool. But how many players are needed to set up the second game?\n\n Actually, we can think recursively:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimum number of players required to arrange a tournament where one player (the designated winner) wins exactly k games, following the rule.\n\n How to build F(k)?\n\n In the first game, the winner plays one opponent. Then, to win the next k-1 games, the winner must have opponents that are winners of their own subtrees.\n\n However, the rule also imposes that the opponent in the second game must have played at most 1 game (because the winner has 1 game). Therefore, the opponent in the second game must have come from a subtree that has at most 1 game. But wait, we can have multiple opponents? Actually, the entire tournament is built as a complete binary-like tree, but with the possibility of having two different structures for even and odd k?\n\n Alternatively, let's break down:\n\n Base case:\n   k = 0: no games, so 1 player (just the winner) -> F(0)=1.\n   k = 1: the winner must play one game. We need 2 players (the winner and one opponent). But note: the opponent must have played 0 games (so we don't need any extra players for the opponent's previous wins). However, the opponent is just one player. So F(1)=2.\n\n For k=2: \n   The winner must win two games. The second game must be against an opponent that has played at most 1 game. But the opponent for the second game could be:\n        Option 1: an opponent who came from a subtree that already had one game. That means that opponent",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if their previous game counts differ by no more than one. The solution involves understanding the tournament structure and leveraging mathematical insights to compute the answer efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is a knockout format, meaning each loss eliminates a player immediately. The key constraint is that two players can only play if their previous game counts (number of games won) differ by at most one. The goal is to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n2. **Insight**: The solution can be derived by recognizing that the tournament structure resembles a binary tree where each level corresponds to a round of games. The winner must progress through these rounds, and the number of players needed to allow the winner to play `k` games follows a specific pattern.\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the recurrence relation:\n   - For `k = 0`, `F(0) = 1`.\n   - For `k = 1`, `F(1) = 2`.\n   - For `k >= 2`, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`, similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because to win `k` games, the winner must have played `k-1` games and faced an opponent who has played at most `k-2` games.\n4. **Binary Search**: Given the constraints (n can be as large as 10^18), a direct computation of Fibonacci numbers up to `n` is infeasible. Instead, we use binary search to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    k = 1\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    while b < n:\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If there are only 2 players (`n = 2`), the winner plays 1 game, so the answer is 1.\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: Initialize `k` (the number of games) to 1, and variables `a` and `b` to represent the number of players required for `k-1` and `k` games respectively. Here, `a` starts as 1 (for `k=0`) and `b` starts as 2 (for `k=1`).\n3. **Loop Until Condition Met**: The loop continues until the number of players required for `k` games (`b`) exceeds `n`. In each iteration, `k` is incremented, and `a` and `b` are updated to represent the next values in the sequence (similar to Fibonacci).\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, `k` holds the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using properties of the Fibonacci sequence and binary search, handling very large values of `n` effectively.",
