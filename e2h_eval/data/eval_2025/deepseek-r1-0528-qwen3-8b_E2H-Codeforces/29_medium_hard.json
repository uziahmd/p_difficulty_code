Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to process a series of string replacements (queries) on an initial string of digits, and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, note that the total length of all 'ti' in queries is at most 10^5, but the initial string s can be up to 10^5, and there can be up to 10^5 queries.\n\n Important: The replacements are done sequentially. But if we try to do each query by scanning the entire string and replacing every occurrence of a digit, the cost might be too high because the string might become very long (each replacement might expand or contract the string). In fact, the total length of the string after all replacements could be huge (exponentially growing in the worst case) so we cannot build the entire string.\n\n Instead, we need to process the queries backwards and use dynamic programming or state propagation to compute the final value without building the entire string.\n\n Idea:\n We are to compute the number represented by the final string, modulo 1000000007.\n\n Let F(s) be the number represented by the string s (ignoring leading zeros, but note: the string might have leading zeros, but the number is formed by the entire string as if it were written; however, if the string is empty, then 0).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"ignore leading zeroes\" in the sense of representing the number? Actually, the example: \n   \"replace 3 by an empty string\": \"123123\" becomes \"1212\", which is 1212, not 1212 with leading zeros removed from the whole number (which it isn't anyway).\n\n But note: the problem says \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\". This means that if the string is \"00012\", then the number is 12? Actually, no: the example does not remove zeros from the middle. The rule is: the entire string is taken as the decimal representation. However, if the string is empty, then 0. Also, if the string has leading zeros, then we don't drop them unless the entire string is zeros? Actually, the problem says \"ignore leading zeroes\", meaning that if there are leading zeros, then they are not considered part of the number? \n\n But note: the example input \"123123\" and then replace 2 by 00 gives \"10031003\". Then 10031003 is the number. Similarly, replacing 3 by empty string in \"123123\" gives \"1212\".\n\n However, consider a string that starts with zeros. For example, initial string \"00\", then a query doesn't change it. Then the number is 0? But wait, the problem says: ignore leading zeros. So if the string is \"00\", then we ignore the leading zeros? Then the number would be 0. But note that the string is built from the replacements, and the replacements might put zeros in the beginning. \n\n Actually, the problem does not say that the entire string must be interpreted as having leading zeros. It says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\" (meaning, the usual interpretation of numbers: leading zeros are dropped). But note: the example output for the third sample: \n   Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n   Output: 777\n\n Steps for third sample:\n   Start with \"222\"\n   First query: 2->0 -> becomes \"000\"\n   Second query: 0->7 -> becomes \"777\"\n\n   Now, if we had started with \"000\", then the number would be 0? But wait, the problem says \"ignore the leading zeros\", so we would get 0? But the output is 777.\n\n Wait, let's read the problem again: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\n The key is: the entire string s is the decimal representation. But then it says \"ignore the leading zeroes\" — this is ambiguous.\n\n However, looking at the example: \n   Example 1: \"123123\" becomes \"10031003\" -> which is 10031003.\n   Example 2: \"123123\" becomes \"1212\" -> which is 1212.\n\n And the third example: \"222\" becomes \"777\", which is 777.\n\n Now, what if we have a string that becomes \"000\"? Then the number should be 0. But the problem says: ignore the leading zeros. So if the entire string is zeros, then we have one zero? Or if we have a mix?\n\n Actually, the problem does not specify that we remove all leading zeros until the first non-zero. But note: the standard way to represent a number from a string of digits is to remove any leading zeros, unless the string is all zeros then we leave one zero.\n\n However, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\" — meaning we don't consider them. But the example does not remove zeros that are in the middle.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\". This is the same as: if the string is empty, then 0; otherwise, remove the leading zeros until the first non-zero, but if there are no non-zeros then the number is 0.\n\n But wait: the example \"123123\" becomes \"10031003\", which has zeros in the middle and at the beginning? Actually, in the example, the transformation from \"123123\" to \"10031003\" does not remove the zeros that are inserted in the middle.\n\n However, note that the problem does not say that the entire process of replacements might lead to a string with leading zeros, and then we remove them. The problem says: \"the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007\", and the decimal representation ignores leading zeros.\n\n So the intended meaning is: \n   Step 1: Build the string s after all replacements (without any removal of zeros).\n   Step 2: Convert that string to a number by ignoring the leading zeros (so if the string is \"000123\", then the number is 123).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require building the entire string (because the string might be too long). Therefore, we must compute the number without building the entire string.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can process the queries backwards and for each digit, we want to know what it becomes at the end. But note: the queries are applied in order, and later queries can refer to digits that were introduced by previous queries.\n\n We are going to use a transformation for each digit (from '0' to '9') to a string (which is the result of replacing that digit by the given ti, but then each character in ti is replaced by the result of the subsequent queries). However, since the queries are applied in order, we need to process from last to first.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We'll store for each digit (0-9) the current transformation. Initially, the transformation for each digit d is just the string d (or the identity).\n\n 2. We process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each query (d -> t), we update the transformation for d: \n        new_transformation[d] = the transformation of each character in t (using the current transformations) concatenated.\n\n    But note: the transformation for a digit d is defined by the latest query for d? Actually, the queries are applied in order, and if a later query changes a digit that was introduced by an earlier query, then we have to account for that.\n\n    However, we are processing backwards, so we start from the last query and go to the first. For each digit d, we remember the transformation that will be applied to it at the end (after all queries). Then, when we see a query for d, we update the transformation for d by replacing every occurrence of a digit x in the string t by the transformation that x will undergo in the future (i.e., the transformation we have stored for x at the time we process the query backwards).\n\n 3. After processing all queries backwards, we have for each digit d a string (which is the expansion of d through all the queries). Then, we traverse the initial string s and for each digit d, we know what string it becomes. Then we can compute the entire number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, the catch: the expansion of a digit might be a long string, and the entire string might be too long to build explicitly (because the total length of expansions might be huge). But note the constraint: the total length of all ti in the queries is <= 10^5. Also, the initial string is <= 10^5.\n\n But observe: we are storing for each digit (0-9) a string (the transformation). The total length of these strings might be large, but note that the sum of lengths of ti is 10^5, and we are doing at most 10^5 queries, so the total stored transformation strings might be acceptable.\n\n However, the problem is that the transformation for a digit might be a string that itself contains digits that are transformed, and so on. But we are processing backwards, and the transformation for a digit d at step i is defined by the query at step i (if any) and then the transformations of the subsequent steps.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order, and the same digit might appear in multiple queries. However, the problem states that the queries are given in the order to be performed.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let trans[d] for d in '0' to '9' be a string. Initially, trans[d] = d.\n\n   Then, for each query (from last to first) of the form \"d->t\":\n        We set temp = ''\n        For each char c in t:\n            temp += trans[int(c)]   # But wait, we have stored trans for digits, and we are processing backwards so we have the final transformation for each digit.\n\n        However, we are processing backwards, so when we process a query, we are updating the transformation for d to be the expansion of t (with each character expanded by the current known transformations). Then, for the next (earlier) query, we have the updated transformation for d.\n\n   But wait, the queries might override a previous definition for d? Yes, because we are processing backwards, we start with the last query and update the transformation for d. Then, when we process an earlier query for d, we use the current transformation (which includes the effect of all subsequent queries).\n\n   However, note: the queries are applied in order, and if a digit d is queried multiple times, then the last query for d is the one that applies, and then the following queries (which are none, because we are processing backwards) do not change d. Then, the next time we see a query for d (earlier) we update d to the string that results from applying the last query and then the subsequent ones (but we already processed the subsequent ones). \n\n   But actually, the queries are given in the order of application, so the last query for a digit d is the one that will be applied last, and then no more changes to d. Therefore, when processing backwards, we update d to the transformation that includes the last query and then the subsequent queries (which we've already updated) and then we go to the next (earlier) query.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Read n queries.\n\n     Let trans = {str(i): str(i) for i in range(10)}   # mapping from digit char to string\n\n     queries = []   # list of queries, each query is (digit_char, replacement_string)\n\n     Then, for i from n-1 down to 0:\n          d, t = queries[i]\n          # We are going to update the transformation for d: \n          # We want to replace every character in t by its current transformation (which accounts for all queries after this one)\n          new_t = \"\"\n          for char in t:\n              # For each char, we use the current transformation for that char (which is stored in trans[char])\n              new_t += trans[char]\n\n          # Then, we set trans[d] = new_t\n\n     Then, after processing all queries backwards, we have the final transformation for each digit.\n\n     Now, we need to compute the number from the initial string s.\n\n     However, we cannot simply concatenate the transformations for each digit in s and then convert to a number because the string might be too long.\n\n     We must compute the number modulo 1000000007 without building the entire string.\n\n     How?\n\n        We can treat the entire string as a sequence of digits, but note: the transformation for a digit d is a string that may contain multiple digits. Then, the entire string is the concatenation of the transformations of each digit in the original s.\n\n        We can compute the number by processing the string from left to right, but we have to account for the fact that the expansion of a digit might be multiple digits, and the position (power of 10) of each digit in the expansion depends on the entire length of the expansion that comes after.\n\n     Alternatively, we can precompute the total length of the expansion for each digit (from the transformation) and then use that to compute the power of 10 for each segment.\n\n     However, note: the expansion of a digit d is a string that itself contains digits that are expanded. But we have stored the expansion as a string. But we also need to know the numeric value of the expansion and the length (for the power of 10).\n\n     We can store for each digit two things: \n        value[d]: the numeric value of the expansion of d modulo 1000000007\n        len[d]: the length of the expansion of d (in terms of digits)\n\n     Then, when we have the initial string s, we can traverse it and for each digit d, we know:\n        The expansion of d is a string of length L = len[d], and the value V = value[d].\n\n        But note: the entire string is built by concatenating the expansions. The entire number is:\n\n        ... (we are going to process from left to right, and the leftmost digit has the highest power)\n\n        Actually, we can process from right to left (least significant digit first) and use the lengths to determine the power of 10 for the entire expansion.\n\n     Steps for computing the number:\n\n        Let total_length = 0\n        We traverse the initial string s from left to right, but we need to know the length of the entire expansion to the right of the current digit.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Let mod = 1000000007\n\n          We'll create an array for the value and length for each digit (0-9). We have already computed the transformation for each digit (as a string) and we can compute the value and length from that string.\n\n          But note: the expansion of a digit d is a string that is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in the query. So we can compute:\n\n            value[d] = 0\n            len[d] = 0\n\n          Then, for the base case (no query, i.e., the identity transformation): \n            value[d] = int(d) % mod, and len[d] = 1.\n\n          Then, for each query (processed backwards) we update:\n\n            value[d] = 0\n            len[d] = 0\n            for char in t:\n                value[d] = (value[d] * (10 ** len[char]) + value[char]) % mod\n                len[d] = len[d] + len[char]\n\n          But wait, we cannot use 10 ** len[char] directly because len[char] can be large (and the exponentiation would be expensive and we cannot use pow(10, len[char], mod) for the value because the value of the expansion is built by the digits and their positions.\n\n          Actually, we have to break down the expansion:\n\n          The expansion of d is the concatenation of the expansion of each char in t.\n\n          Example: d='2', t=\"00\", then expansion of '2' is the expansion of '0' and then the expansion of '0'. \n\n          How to compute the value of the expansion?\n\n            Let the expansion of d be s1 s2 ... sk (each si is a digit string). Then the value is:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each digit in the expansion (from left to right):\n                value = (value * 10 + int(digit)) % mod\n\n          But we can use the stored value and length for each segment.\n\n          Specifically, if we have two segments A and B (where A is the expansion of a part and B the expansion of the rest), then the value for A+B is:\n\n            value(A+B) = (value(A) * (10^(length(B))) + value(B)) % mod\n\n          So, we can define:\n\n            value[d] = 0\n            len[d] = 0\n\n          Then, for each query (from last to first):\n\n            We set for digit d:\n                value[d] = 0\n                len[d] = 0\n                for each char c in t:\n                    value[d] = (value[d] * pow(10, len[c], mod) + value[c]) % mod\n                    len[d] = (len[d] + len[c]) % (mod-1)   # but wait, we are using mod arithmetic for exponents? Actually, the modulus for the exponent is not mod, because 10^(a+b) mod mod is not the same as 10^(a mod (mod-1)) * 10^(b mod (mod-1)) mod mod? \n\n          However, note: we are only interested in the value modulo 1000000007, and the length is used to compute the power of 10. The length can be very large (exponential in the number of queries) but we cannot store the full length as an integer because it might be astronomical.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total length of all ti is <= 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5, but the expansion might be huge. However, we are only storing the length modulo something? Actually, we need the exact length to compute the power of 10 for the entire expansion. But the length can be huge (exponential) and we cannot store the entire length.\n\n          Alternate idea: we don't need the entire length, but we need to compute 10^(L) mod mod, where L is the length of the expansion. However, the length L might be too big to represent as an integer (it could be exponential). But note: we are storing the value and the length for each digit. The length is needed for two things:\n\n            - To compute the value of the expansion: we break the expansion into parts and use the lengths.\n\n          However, we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of modular exponentiation? But note: Euler's theorem requires that 10 and mod are coprime, and mod=10^9+7 is prime, so Euler totient is mod-1. But the exponentiation base 10 and modulus mod: we can reduce the exponent modulo (mod-1) only when the exponent is used in the exponentiation for base 10. However, the length L is the total number of digits, and we need to compute 10^L mod mod. But L can be huge (like 10^100000) and we cannot compute that directly.\n\n          But note: we are storing the value of the expansion (which is the number) modulo mod, and the length (the number of digits) modulo (mod-1) for the exponent? \n\n          However, the value computation uses the length only to compute 10^(len[c]). We can precompute the powers of 10 modulo mod for exponents up to ...? But the exponents (lengths) are too big.\n\n          We must avoid storing the full length. Instead, we can store the length as a modular exponent base for 10? But note: the length is used only to compute 10^(L) mod mod, and we can use Euler's theorem: 10^L mod mod = 10^(L mod (mod-1)) mod mod, provided that L >= 0 and mod is prime (so 10 and mod are coprime). However, we must be cautious: if L is the length, then we can store L_mod = L mod (mod-1) (Euler's theorem requires exponent reduction modulo totient(mod)=mod-1). But note: if L is 0, then 10^0=1. And if L>=mod-1, then we can reduce the exponent modulo mod-1.\n\n          However, the problem is: the length L might be extremely large (exponential in the number of queries) and we cannot compute it as an integer. But we can store L mod (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation.\n\n          But wait: is that valid? Euler's theorem says: \n            If a and n are coprime, then a^phi(n) ≡ 1 (mod n)\n\n          So, 10^L mod mod = 10^(L mod (mod-1)) mod mod, provided that L >= (some value) and we are working modulo mod. However, this holds even for very large L.\n\n          However, note: the exponentiation for 10^L mod mod can be done with exponent L_mod = L mod (mod-1). But we must be careful: if L is the length, then we are going to use it in the formula:\n\n            value[d] = (value[d] * (10^(len[c])) + value[c]) % mod\n\n          and we need 10^(len[c]) mod mod, and we can compute it by:\n\n            power = pow(10, len[c] % (mod-1), mod)\n\n          BUT: wait, Euler's theorem requires that the exponent can be reduced modulo phi(mod)=mod-1 only if the base (10) and mod are coprime. They are, so yes.\n\n          However, there is a caveat: if the exponent is 0, then 10^0=1. Also, if the exponent is negative, but we are dealing with positive exponents.\n\n          So, we can store for each digit d:\n            val[d] = the numeric value of the expansion of d modulo mod\n            exp_len[d] = the length of the expansion of d modulo (mod-1)   [for the purpose of exponentiation base 10 modulo mod]\n\n          Then, for each query (from last to first):\n\n            For the given query (d, t):\n\n            Let L = 0\n            Let V = 0\n\n            For each char c in t:\n                # The current transformation for c is stored in val[c] and exp_len[c]\n                # The power factor for the entire expansion of c is 10^(exp_len[c]) mod mod, but wait: we are going to use the expansion of c as a contiguous block. When we append the expansion of c to the current value, we need to shift the current value by the length of c's expansion.\n\n                # So, we do:\n                #   V = (V * (10^(exp_len[c])) + val[c]) % mod\n                #   L = (L + exp_len[c]) % (mod-1)   [but note: we are storing the length modulo mod-1 for exponentiation]\n\n            Then set val[d] = V, exp_len[d] = L.\n\n          However, note: the expansion of d is the concatenation of the expansions of the characters in t. The above loop does that.\n\n          But wait: the value of the expansion is computed by:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each expansion part (each char c in t) we do:\n                value = value * (10^(len(c))) + value(c)\n\n          And the total length is the sum of the lengths.\n\n          We must store the length modulo (mod-1) for the exponentiation. But note: the length is used only for exponentiation, and we can reduce the exponent modulo (mod-1). However, the length itself is additive. So we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation, but note: the length is also used in the exponentiation base 10. And Euler's theorem tells us that 10^k mod mod = 10^(k mod (mod-1)) mod mod.\n\n          However, we must note: the length is the actual number of digits, and we are breaking the expansion into parts. The exponentiation by the length is independent of the digit sequence, so storing the length modulo (mod-1) is safe.\n\n          But there is a catch: the length might be 0 (empty string). Then, we set val[d] = 0 and exp_len[d] = 0.\n\n          Then, we must update the initial string s:\n\n          We traverse the initial string s (which is a string of digits). For each digit d in s:\n\n            We know the expansion for d: which is a string of length exp_len[d] (modulo mod-1) and value val[d].\n\n          Then, the entire number is the concatenation of the expansions for each digit in s.\n\n          We can compute the entire number by processing from right to left (to avoid having to know the total length in advance) or from left to right.\n\n          Let's do from left to right:\n\n            We start with:\n                current_value = 0\n                current_modulus = 1   # but we don't have a modulus for the entire number, but we are building the number from left to right.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                result = 0\n                total_length = 0   # but we don't know the total length, and we cannot store the entire string.\n\n            Instead, we can use the fact that the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions. We can process the initial string s from left to right, and for each digit d:\n\n                result = (result * (10^(exp_len[d])) + val[d]) % mod\n\n            But wait, is that correct?\n\n            Example: s = \"12\", and suppose:\n                expansion of '1' is \"3\" (so val[1]=3, exp_len[1]=1)\n                expansion of '2' is \"4\" (so val[2]=4, exp_len[2]=1)\n\n            Then, \n                Start: result = 0\n                Process '1': result = (0 * (10^1) + 3) = 3\n                Process '2': result = (3 * (10^1) + 4) = 34\n\n            Which is correct.\n\n            But what if the expansion of a digit is multi-digit? Example: \n                s = \"1\", and query: 1->12, then the expansion of '1' is \"12\", so val[1]=12, exp_len[1]=2.\n\n            Then, the entire string is \"12\", and the number is 12.\n\n            Using the formula: \n                result = (0 * (10^2) + 12) = 12.\n\n            Another example: two digits, s=\"12\", and \n                '1' expands to \"12\", '2' expands to \"34\"\n\n            Then, the entire string is \"1234\", and the number is 1234.\n\n            Using the formula:\n                result = 0\n                Process '1': result = (0 * (10^2) + 12) = 12\n                Process '2': result = (12 * (10^2) + 34) = 12*100 + 34 = 1234.\n\n            That is correct.\n\n          However, note: the expansion for a digit d is stored as val[d] and exp_len[d]. We must compute these for all digits from 0 to 9.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            mod = 1000000007\n            mod_exp = mod - 1   # because mod is prime, and for base 10, we can reduce exponents modulo mod_exp\n\n            # Initialize for each digit d in '0' to '9'\n            val = [0] * 10\n            exp_len = [0] * 10   # store the length modulo mod_exp (for exponentiation) and the actual value modulo mod\n\n            For d from 0 to 9:\n                val[d] = d\n                exp_len[d] = 1   # because the length of the digit d is 1\n\n            Then, read the queries and store them.\n\n            Then, process the queries in reverse order (from last to first):\n\n                For each query (d_str, t_str) in reversed(queries):\n                    d = int(d_str)   # but wait, the query is given as a digit, so d_str is a string of one digit.\n\n                    # We are going to update the transformation for the digit d.\n\n                    # The new expansion for d is the concatenation of the expansions of each character in t_str.\n\n                    # But note: t_str is a string of digits.\n\n                    total_val = 0\n                    total_len = 0   # in terms of exponent (mod mod_exp)\n\n                    for char in t_str:\n                        c = int(char)\n                        # Append the expansion of c to the expansion of d.\n                        # We need to shift the current total_val by the length of c's expansion (which is exp_len[c] mod mod_exp) and then add val[c].\n\n                        # Compute factor = 10^(exp_len[c]) mod mod\n                        factor = pow(10, exp_len[c], mod)   # This is 10 raised to the length of c's expansion, modulo mod.\n\n                        total_val = (total_val * factor + val[c]) % mod\n                        total_len = (total_len + exp_len[c]) % (mod_exp)   # but note: the length is additive, and we are storing modulo mod_exp for the exponentiation? \n\n                    # But wait: the total_len is the sum of the lengths, and we are going to use it for the next queries (for digits that reference d). However, the exponentiation for the next query will use the total_len (modulo mod_exp) to compute the factor for d.\n\n                    # However, the length is the actual number of digits. But when we do the exponentiation, we use the length modulo mod_exp. But the length itself is stored modulo mod_exp (because we are only interested in the exponent for 10 mod mod). \n\n                    # But note: the length is used only in exponentiation, and we can reduce the exponent modulo mod_exp (by Euler). So storing total_len modulo mod_exp is sufficient.\n\n                    val[d] = total_val\n                    exp_len[d] = total_len   # which is modulo mod_exp\n\n            Then, we process the initial string s:\n\n                result = 0\n                for each char in s:\n                    d = int(char)\n                    factor = pow(10, exp_len[d], mod)   # 10 raised to the length of d's expansion, modulo mod\n                    result = (result * factor + val[d]) % mod\n\n                print(result)\n\n          However, wait: what if the expansion of a digit is empty? For example, query \"3->\" (empty string). Then, in the backward processing, we update the digit 3:\n\n                t_str = \"\" (empty string)\n                Then, total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\n                Then, val[3]=0, exp_len[3]=0.\n\n          Then, when processing the initial string: if we have a '3', then we use factor = 10^0 = 1, and then result = (result * 1 + 0) % mod, which is adding 0. So effectively, we remove the digit 3.\n\n          Example: \"123123\" with query \"3->\" (empty string). Then, the expansion for 3 is empty, so the entire string becomes the expansion of '1','2','1','2','3' -> but wait, the last '3' is replaced by empty string. \n\n          But in our method, we are storing the expansion for each digit independently. Then, when we process the initial string, we expand each digit.\n\n          For the example \"123123\": \n            The expansion for '1' is 1 (val[1]=1, exp_len[1]=1)\n            The expansion for '2' is 2 (val[2]=2, exp_len[2]=1)\n            The expansion for '3' is 0 (val[3]=0, exp_len[3]=0)\n\n          Then, the entire number is:\n\n            Start: result=0\n            '1': result = (0 * 10^1 + 1) = 1\n            '2': result = (1 * 10^1 + 2) = 12\n            '3': result = (12 * 10^0 + 0) = 12\n            '1': 12 * 10^1 + 1 = 121\n            '2': 121 * 10^1 + 2 = 1212\n            '3': 1212 * 10^0 + 0 = 1212\n\n          That matches the example.\n\n          But note: the example input \"123123\" and query \"3->\" yields 1212.\n\n          However, what if the expansion of a digit is multi-digit and then we have a digit that is updated in a later query? \n\n          Example: \n            s = \"2\", and two queries: \n                Query1: 2->00\n                Query2: 0->7\n\n          We process the queries backwards:\n\n            First (last) query: \"0->7\"\n                d = 0, t_str = \"7\"\n                For char '7': c=7, val[7]=7, exp_len[7]=1 (initially)\n                Then, val[0] = (0 * (10^1) + 7) % mod = 7\n                exp_len[0] = 1\n\n            Then, the next query (first): \"2->00\"\n                d=2, t_str=\"00\"\n                For each '0' in \"00\": \n                    factor0 = 10^(exp_len[0]) = 10^1 = 10\n                    For the first '0': \n                        total_val = 0 * 10 + 7 = 7\n                        total_len = 0 + 1 = 1\n                    For the second '0':\n                        total_val = 7 * 10 + 7 = 77\n                        total_len = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n                So, val[2]=77, exp_len[2]=2.\n\n            Then, processing s=\"2\": \n                result = (0 * (10^2) + 77) % mod = 77.\n\n          The example output is 77, but the sample input was:\n\n            Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n\n          Expected output: 777.\n\n          Why? Because the initial string is \"222\", so we have three 2's.\n\n          For the first query (2->0) and then (0->7). But wait, the sample input has two queries: \n            \"2->0\"\n            \"0->7\"\n\n          But note: the sample input is:\n\n            Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n\n          So the queries are two: first query \"2->0\", then second query \"0->7\".\n\n          Then, processing backwards:\n\n            First (last) query: \"0->7\"\n                d=0, t_str=\"7\"\n                val[0] = 7, exp_len[0]=1\n\n            Then, the first query: \"2->0\"\n                d=2, t_str=\"0\"\n                Then, for the '0': \n                    factor = 10^(exp_len[0]) = 10^1 = 10\n                    val[2] = (0 * 10 + 7) % mod = 7\n                    exp_len[2] = 1\n\n          Then, processing s=\"222\":\n\n            First '2': result = (0 * 10^1 + 7) = 7\n            Second '2': result = (7 * 10^1 + 7) = 77\n            Third '2': result = (77 * 10^1 + 7) = 777\n\n          So that matches.\n\n          However, the sample input was given as:\n\n            ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n          And the expected outputs are:\n\n            ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n          Now, the third sample: \"22",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacements on an initial digit string and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to their exponential growth.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Backward Processing of Queries**: We process the queries in reverse order. This allows us to determine the final transformation for each digit by considering all subsequent queries first. For each query, we update the transformation of the specified digit by replacing each character in its replacement string with its current (already processed) transformations.\n2. **Dynamic Value and Length Tracking**: For each digit, we maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the transformed digit string modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The length of the transformed digit string modulo 1000000006 (since 10^k mod 1000000007 can be simplified using Euler's theorem, which requires exponents modulo φ(1000000007) = 1000000006).\n3. **Efficient Computation**: When processing each query, we compute the new value and length for the digit by combining the values and lengths of each character in its replacement string. This involves modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.\n4. **Final Number Calculation**: After processing all queries, we compute the final number by processing each digit in the original string. For each digit, we use its precomputed value and length to update the result, shifting the current result by the appropriate power of 10 and adding the digit's value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nmod_exp = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_str = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        queries.append((d_str, t_str))\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    exp_len = [0] * 10\n    \n    for d in range(10):\n        val[d] = d\n        exp_len[d] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries) - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_str, t_str = queries[i]\n        d = int(d_str)\n        total_val = 0\n        total_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            c = int(char)\n            factor = pow(10, exp_len[c], mod)\n            total_val = (total_val * factor + val[c]) % mod\n            total_len = (total_len + exp_len[c]) % mod_exp\n        \n        val[d] = total_val\n        exp_len[d] = total_len\n    \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d = int(char)\n        factor = pow(10, exp_len[d], mod)\n        result = (result * factor + val[d]) % mod\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values, including the initial string and the list of queries. Each query specifies a digit and a replacement string.\n2. **Digit Transformations**: For each digit from 0 to 9, we initialize its value to the digit itself and its length to 1 (since a single digit has a length of 1).\n3. **Backward Query Processing**: We process each query in reverse order. For each query, we update the transformation of the specified digit by combining the transformations of each character in its replacement string. The new value is computed by shifting the current value by the length of each character's transformation and adding the character's value. The new length is the sum of the lengths of all characters' transformations.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, we compute the final number by processing each digit in the original string. For each digit, we shift the current result by the length of its transformation and add its value, all modulo 1000000007.\n5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the number represented by the transformed string modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string by leveraging modular arithmetic and backward processing, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
