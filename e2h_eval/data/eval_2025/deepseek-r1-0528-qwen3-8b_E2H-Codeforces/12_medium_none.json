The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can think of the ring as:\n   From house i, moving clockwise: \n      next house is (i % n) + 1, but note: if i == n, then next is 1.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise.\n\n Important: The tasks must be done in the given order. After completing a task, she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i, but note the condition: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" is automatically satisfied by processing the tasks in order? Actually, the problem says: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" This means that the tasks are given in increasing order of index, but the house numbers might not be increasing.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to do the tasks in increasing order of house number, but the tasks are given in an order (from first to last) and she must complete them in that order.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1\". Then for the i-th task, she must be in house a_i and have completed all tasks with indices < i.\n\n Therefore, we can process the tasks one by one, starting at house 1, and then update our current house to the location of the last task.\n\n But wait: what if the next task is behind us? Since it's a ring, we can go clockwise.\n\n Observation: We are allowed to traverse the ring arbitrarily. So from a current house, we can either go forward (clockwise) or backward? \n\n However, note: the problem says the ringroad traffic is one-way and clockwise. But wait: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the ringroad is one-way. \n\n But note: the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n Steps: \n   Start at 1 -> 2 (time 1) -> 3 (time 2) -> 4 (time 3) -> 1 (time 4) -> 2 (time 5) -> 3 (time 6)\n\n Why did they go from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2 to 3? Because after the first task (at house 3), the next task is at house 2. Since we are at 3 and the next task is at 2, we cannot go counterclockwise because the ring is one-way. So we must go from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps.\n\n Alternatively, if we had gone from 3 to 2 directly, that would be counterclockwise which is not allowed. So we must go clockwise.\n\n Therefore, the movement is only clockwise. So from house x, the next house is (x % n) + 1, and then we can keep going until we complete the cycle.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order\", and the movement is one way clockwise. So the distance from house x to house y (if we are only allowed to move clockwise) is:\n\n   If y >= x: then distance = y - x\n   If y < x: then distance = (n - x) + y\n\n But wait, we can also consider the entire ring as having n houses. The clockwise distance from x to y is:\n   Let d = (y - x) % n\n   But if d is negative, we add n and then take modulo n? Actually, we can do:\n\n   If we are at x and want to go to y, then we can compute the clockwise distance as:\n        if y >= x: d = y - x\n        else: d = n - x + y\n\n However, note that we can also break the journey into two parts: \n        from x to the end (n) and then from 1 to y.\n\n But wait, there's another way: \n        d = (y - x) % n\n   But if (y-x) is negative, then (y-x) % n will be positive. However, let's test:\n\n   Example: n=4, x=3, y=2.\n        (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3, which matches: 3 steps (3->4->1->2).\n\n   Similarly, x=1, y=3: (3-1)%4=2 -> 2 steps.\n\n   So the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) % n, but if negative we adjust by adding n and then taking modulus? Actually, we can use:\n\n        distance = (y - x) % n\n        if distance < 0: distance += n   # but modulus operation in Python for negative numbers gives a positive result? Actually, no: \n        In Python, (y-x) % n is computed as: \n            (y-x) % n = (y-x + k*n) % n for some k to bring it in [0, n-1].\n\n        But wait: (2-3) % 4 = (-1 % 4) = 3 (because -1 + 4 = 3, and 3 mod4 is 3).\n\n        So we can simply use: distance = (y - x) % n\n        However, note: if (y-x) is positive and less than n, then (y-x)%n is y-x, which is correct.\n\n        But also, if (y-x) is negative, then (y-x)%n is (y-x + k*n) such that 0 <= (y-x+k*n) < n.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at x and y is the same? Then (y-x)=0, so distance=0.\n\n        However, note: we don't necessarily need to compute the distance for the entire journey? We are going to do multiple tasks.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We are starting at house 1. Then we have a sequence of task locations: a1, a2, ..., am.\n\n   We need to travel from the current house to the next task's house, and then from that task's house to the next, etc.\n\n   But note: after the last task, we don't need to move, so we only care about the moves between tasks.\n\n   However, the problem does not require to return to the start.\n\n   We can simulate:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n\n        for each task_location in the list of tasks:\n            distance = (task_location - current) % n\n            if distance < 0:\n                distance += n   # but actually the modulus already made it positive, so we can just use modulus and then take the minimum representation? \n            However, wait: the modulus operation in Python for (task_location - current) % n gives a nonnegative value. And that value is the clockwise distance? \n\n        But wait: the modulus operation gives the shortest distance? Actually, in a ring of n houses, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y-x) % n, but note that if (y-x) is positive and greater than n, then modulus will reduce it. However, in our case, since y and x are between 1 and n, the difference (y-x) is between -(n-1) and (n-1). \n\n        So we can compute the clockwise distance from current to task_location as:\n            d = (task_location - current) % n\n            But wait: if task_location < current, then (task_location - current) is negative, and then adding n until positive? Actually, the modulus operation in Python does that.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for (a % n) when a is negative: \n            a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n        For example, a=-1, n=4: floor(-1/4) = floor(-0.25) = -1, so (-1) % 4 = -1 - 4*(-1) = -1+4 = 3.\n\n        So we can compute d = (task_location - current) % n. But wait, if (task_location - current) is positive, then (task_location - current) % n might be (task_location - current) if (task_location - current) < n, but if (task_location - current) >= n, then we get the modulus. However, in our problem, task_location and current are between 1 and n, so the maximum positive difference is n-1, so (task_location - current) % n is just (task_location - current) (which is <= n-1). \n\n        But wait, what if current=1, task_location=3, n=4: (3-1)=2 %4 -> 2, which is correct.\n\n        However, what if current=3, task_location=2, n=4: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4=3, which is the clockwise distance (3 steps).\n\n        So the formula for the clockwise distance from current to task_location is: d = (task_location - current) % n, but if negative we add n? Actually, the modulus already does that.\n\n        BUT: wait, what if the distance is negative? The modulus operation handles that.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives a value in [0, n-1]. And that value is the clockwise distance? \n\n        Actually, no: the clockwise distance from x to y is defined as the number of steps moving clockwise. We can also compute it as:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            if d == 0: then 0?\n            But wait, if y==x, then d=0, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives the remainder. But the clockwise distance should be the minimal steps in the clockwise direction. \n\n        But wait, in a ring, the clockwise distance from x to y is unique and defined as above.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation does give the clockwise distance in the ring when we consider the ring as cyclic. \n\n        But there is a caveat: the modulus operation gives the smallest nonnegative residue. The clockwise distance from x to y is (y-x) mod n, but if (y-x) is negative, then (y-x) mod n is (y-x+n) mod n, which is the same as (y-x+n) (since y-x+n is positive and less than n? Not necessarily: if y-x+n is greater than n, we would subtract n again? Actually, no: because (y-x) is negative, say y-x = -k (k>0), then (y-x) mod n = (-k) mod n = n - (k mod n). But k = x-y, and since x>y, k=x-y, and then the clockwise distance is (n - (x-y)) = n - k.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute without modulus: \n            if task_location >= current:\n                d = task_location - current\n            else:\n                d = n - current + task_location\n\n        Which is the same as (task_location - current) % n? Let me check:\n\n        Case 1: task_location >= current: \n            d1 = task_location - current\n            d2 = (task_location - current) % n -> since task_location - current is between 0 and n-1, then d2 = d1.\n\n        Case 2: task_location < current:\n            d1 = n - current + task_location\n            d2 = (task_location - current) % n = (task_location - current + n) % n, but note that (task_location - current + n) is positive and less than n? \n            Because task_location - current is negative, and adding n makes it positive. But is (task_location - current + n) < n?\n            Since task_location < current, then task_location - current <= -1, so task_location - current + n <= n-1, so yes, (task_location - current + n) % n = task_location - current + n.\n\n        So both methods are equivalent.\n\n        However, the modulus method is simpler.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python for positive numbers doesn't change the value, and for negative numbers adds n until positive. \n\n        However, there is a catch: if the difference is exactly n, then (task_location - current) % n becomes 0. But task_location and current are between 1 and n, so the maximum absolute difference is n-1. So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance as (task_location - current) % n, but wait: when task_location >= current, we get a positive number, and when task_location < current, we get a positive number (by adding n). \n\n        However, note: if we use modulus, we are effectively computing the clockwise distance.\n\n        But wait: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n        Let's break down:\n\n            n=4, m=3, tasks = [2,3,3]\n\n            Start at 1.\n\n            Task1: 2\n                d1 = (2-1) % 4 = 1 %4 = 1 -> time 1, then current becomes 2.\n\n            Task2: 3\n                d2 = (3-2) % 4 = 1 %4 = 1 -> time 2, then current becomes 3.\n\n            Task3: 3\n                d3 = (3-3) % 4 = 0 -> time 2, then current becomes 3.\n\n            Total time = 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Now, the first example: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n            Start at 1.\n\n            Task1: 3\n                d1 = (3-1) %4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> time 2, current=3.\n\n            Task2: 2\n                d2 = (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> time 2+3 = 5, current=2.\n\n            Task3: 3\n                d3 = (3-2) %4 = 1 %4 = 1 -> time 5+1=6.\n\n            Total time=6.\n\n        So the modulus method works.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the tasks must be completed in order, and the example includes multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n        Therefore, code:\n\n            Read n, m\n            Read the list of m integers\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for each task in the list:\n                # Compute the clockwise distance from current to task\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait: if task is behind, modulus gives positive, but what if the modulus result is 0? It's okay.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation as defined above gives the clockwise distance.\n\n                But wait: is that always the minimal clockwise distance? Yes, because we are forced to go clockwise.\n\n                Then update:\n                    total_time += d\n                    current = task\n\n            Print(total_time)\n\n        Let me test with a simple case: n=3, tasks=[1,2,3]\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Task1: 1 -> d = (1-1)%3 = 0 -> total_time=0, current=1.\n            Task2: 2 -> d = (2-1)%3=1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n            Task3: 3 -> d = (3-2)%3=1 -> total_time=2.\n\n            Expected: 1->2 (1 step) then 2->3 (1 step) -> total 2 steps. Correct.\n\n        Another test: n=3, tasks=[3,2,1]\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Task1: 3 -> d=(3-1)%3=2%3=2 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            Task2: 2 -> d=(2-3)%3=(-1)%3=2 -> total_time=4, current=2.\n            Task3: 1 -> d=(1-2)%3=(-1)%3=2 -> total_time=6.\n\n            But wait, what's the actual path?\n                Start at 1.\n                To go to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n                Then from 3 to 2: 3->1->2 (2 steps) [because we cannot go backwards, so from 3 we go 3->1 (1 step) then 1->2 (1 step) -> 2 steps]\n                Then from 2 to 1: 2->3->1 (2 steps)\n\n                Total: 2+2+2=6.\n\n            However, note: the problem says that the tasks must be done in order. There is no requirement to minimize the overall travel beyond the given order.\n\n            But wait, is there a shorter way? Actually, the problem forces us to go clockwise. So from 3 to 2: we must go 3->1->2 (2 steps). From 2 to 1: we must go 2->3->1 (2 steps). So 6 is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives 2, and our code produces 2.\n\n        However, wait: in the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", the example output is 6, and our code produces 6.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for task in tasks:\n                # Compute the clockwise distance from current to task\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait: if (task - current) is negative, modulus adds n, so d is the clockwise distance.\n                # However, note: if (task - current) is positive, we get (task-current) which is the direct clockwise steps.\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = task\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait: is this always the minimal? \n\n        Consider: we are only allowed to move clockwise. Therefore, from any house, the only way to reach a target house is to move the computed clockwise distance.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives the minimal positive clockwise distance (the direct clockwise path). There is no shorter way.\n\n        But wait: what if we do more than one full circle? The modulus operation gives the minimal distance, so we don't need to do more than one circle.\n\n        Therefore, the above code should be correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation gives the distance in the range [0, n-1]. But sometimes, if we are at x and want to go to y, we might consider going clockwise and then if we overshoot, we wrap around. The modulus operation captures that.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation does not account for the fact that we might have multiple circles? Actually, the problem does not require to minimize the number of circles. The minimal time is achieved by taking the direct clockwise route.\n\n        However, there is an issue: the modulus operation gives the distance for one circle. But if we are at x and y is behind x, then the clockwise distance is n - (x - y) but wait, no: we defined it as (y-x) % n, which is (y-x+n) % n, and if (y-x+n) is less than n, then modulus is (y-x+n). But if (y-x+n) is greater than n, then modulus would reduce it? \n\n        However, note: the maximum absolute difference is n-1, so (y-x) is in [-n+1, n-1]. Therefore, (y-x+n) is in [1, 2*n-1]. Then modulus by n: \n            (y-x+n) % n = (y-x+n) - n * floor((y-x+n)/n)\n\n        But note: (y-x+n) is positive and less than 2*n, so floor((y-x+n)/n) is either 0 or 1.\n\n        Example: y-x+n >= n? \n            When y-x+n >= n  => y-x >=0. But if y>=x, we don't use the modulus version because we use the positive branch. \n\n        Actually, we are using modulus for both cases. But wait, our formula (task_location - current) % n works for both.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (a % n) where a is negative: \n            a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n        For example, if a = -1, n=4: floor(-1/4) = -1, so (-1) %4 = -1 -4*(-1) = 3.\n\n        But if we have a = -5, n=4: \n            floor(-5/4) = floor(-1.25) = -2, so (-5) %4 = -5 -4*(-2) = -5+8=3.\n\n        However, in our problem, the difference (task_location - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        So for negative values, the modulus gives a value between 1 and n-1 (because the smallest negative is -n+1, then (-n+1)%n = (-n+1 + n) % n? Actually, no: \n            (-n+1) % n = ( -n+1 ) % n = ( -n+1 + n ) % n = 1 % n = 1.\n\n        But wait, let me do: \n            a = -n+1, then floor(a/n) = floor((-n+1)/n) = floor(-1 + 1/n) = -1 (since 1/n is between 0 and 1, so -1 + fraction, floor is -1).\n            Then a % n = (-n+1) - n * (-1) = -n+1 + n = 1.\n\n        Similarly, for a = -n, then (-n)%n = 0, but in our problem the minimum difference is -n+1, so we don't get 0 from negative unless the difference is exactly -n? But our numbers are from 1 to n, so the minimum difference is -n+1.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus operation gives the correct clockwise distance.\n\n        However, wait: what if we are at current and want to go to task_location, and task_location is the same as current? Then d=0.\n\n        But note: if we have consecutive same tasks, we don't move.\n\n        One more test: n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1]\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Task1: 5 -> d=(5-1)%5=4 -> time=4, current=5.\n            Task2: 4 -> d=(4-5)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=8, current=4.\n            Task3: 3 -> d=(3-4)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=12, current=3.\n            Task4: 2 -> d=(2-3)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=16, current=2.\n            Task5: 1 -> d=(1-2)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=20.\n\n            Actual path: \n                1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps) then 5->1->2->3->4 (4 steps) then 4->5->1->2->3 (4 steps) then 3->4->5->1->2 (4 steps) then 2->3->4->5->1 (4 steps)\n                Each segment is 4 steps, and 5 segments: 5*4=20.\n\n            This matches.\n\n        But wait, is there a shorter way? No, because we must go clockwise.\n\n        However, note: we can also consider that after the first task, we are at 5. Then from 5, to go to 4, we must go 5->1->2->3->4 (4 steps). Similarly for the others.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        BUT WAIT: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the ringroad is one-way. The example above shows that the modulus operation gives the correct clockwise distance.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives the distance for one full circle? Actually, no, because the modulus operation gives the minimal positive clockwise distance. In the example above, from 5 to 4, the minimal clockwise distance is 4 (because 5->1->2->3->4). There's no shorter way.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for a in arr:\n                # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to a\n                # We can also use: if a >= current: d = a - current\n                #                else: d = a - current + n   (but wait, then we are adding n even if a>=current? No, so better to use modulus for simplicity, but modulus works for both.\n\n                # However, note: the modulus operation for positive differences is the same as the direct subtraction, and for negative we get the positive value by adding n until positive and then taking modulus (which is equivalent to adding n once).\n\n                # But wait: is (a - current) % n the same as (a - current + n) % n? \n                # Yes, because (a - current) % n is the same as (a - current + k*n) % n for any integer k.\n\n                # However, the modulus operation in Python does the right thing.\n\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                # But wait: if a==current, then d=0, which is correct.\n\n                ans += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But wait: there is a potential pitfall. The modulus operation for negative numbers is well-defined, but note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined as the remainder (nonnegative). \n\n        However, we must be cautious: the modulus operation might not be the same as the clockwise distance if the distance is large? But note the constraint: a and current are in [1, n], so (a - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        But wait, what if n=10**5, and a=1, current=10**5? Then (1-100000) % 100000 = (1-100000) % 100000 = (-99999) % 100000 = 1 (because -99999 + 100000 = 1). \n        That is the clockwise distance from 100000 to 1: \n            From 100000, we go to 1 (clockwise): 100000->1 (1 step). \n        So 1 is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example above: from 100000 to 1: the clockwise distance should be 1? \n            The houses are arranged in a circle: 1,2,...,100000, then back to 1.\n            From 100000, the next house is 1. So yes, 1 step.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus operation is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a=100000 and current=1? \n            d = (100000-1) % 100000 = 99999 % 100000 = 99999.\n\n        That's the clockwise distance from 1 to 100000: \n            1->2->...->100000: 99999 steps.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation is defined for any integers, and we are using the modulus base n. \n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        BUT WAIT: the problem constraints: n up to 10^5, m up to 10^5, so the modulus operation is efficient.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers: the example above showed that (a - current) % n works.\n\n        One more edge: n=2, tasks=[2,1]\n\n            Start at 1.\n            Task1: 2 -> d=(2-1)%2=1 -> time=1, current=2.\n            Task2: 1 -> d=(1-2)%2= (-1)%2=1 -> time=2.\n\n            Actual: 1->2 (1 step) then 2->1 (1 step). Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can submit the code.\n\n        However, wait: I just realized that the modulus operation might be slightly more expensive than an if statement, but n and m are 10^5, and modulus is O(1), so it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"do not use %lld specifier\", but we are in Python.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for a in tasks:\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                # However, wait: what if d==0? Then we don't move. That's correct.\n                total_time += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> 6, Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> 2.\n\n        But wait, the second example: \n            n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n            Step1: a=2, current=1 -> d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n            Step2: a=3, current=2 -> d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            Step3: a=3, current=3 -> d=0 -> total_time=2.\n\n            Output 2.\n\n        Example 1: \n            n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            Step1: a=3, current=1 -> d=(3-1)%4=2 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            Step2: a=2, current=3 -> d=(2-3)%4= (-1)%4=3 -> total_time=5, current=2.\n            Step3: a=3, current=2 -> d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=6.\n\n        It works.\n\n        However, wait: there is a possibility to optimize the calculation by avoiding modulus for positive differences? \n\n        But modulus is fast and the numbers are small. \n\n        But note: the modulus operation for positive numbers is the same as the number, and for negative numbers we add n until positive. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if a >= current:\n                d = a - current\n            else:\n                d = a - current + n\n\n        This is the same and avoids modulus.\n\n        Which is faster? In terms of computational cost, modulus for positive numbers is the same as the number, and for negative numbers modulus requires one division. \n\n        But the problem constraints are 10^5 operations, so both are acceptable.\n\n        However, let me try with the alternative:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for a in tasks:\n                if a >= current:\n                    d = a - current\n                else:\n                    d = a - current + n\n                total_time += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        This produces the same results.\n\n        But wait: what if a < current, then d = a - current + n. Example: a=2, current=3, n=4 -> d=2-3+4=3. Correct.\n\n        This is the same as (a - current) % n.\n\n        I prefer the if-else method because it avoids modulus and might be slightly faster for positive numbers (though modulus for positive is just the identity).\n\n        However, the modulus method is concise.\n\n        I'll choose the modulus method for clarity.\n\n        But wait: the modulus method and the if-else method are mathematically equivalent for the given range.\n\n        However, note: the modulus method might be confusing because the modulus operation is defined for all integers, but the problem only uses numbers in [1, n]. \n\n        But the problem says: \"The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n\", so a and current are in [1, n]. \n\n        Therefore, we can use either.\n\n        I'll stick with the modulus method.\n\n        However, wait: there is a potential issue with the modulus method: \n            What if the difference (a - current) is exactly -n? \n            Then (a - current) % n = 0, but the clockwise distance from current to a (where a = current - n) would be n? \n\n        But note: a is in [1, n] and current is in [1, n], so the minimum difference is (1-n) and the maximum is (n-1). Therefore, (a - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        Then (a - current) % n is in [0, n-1] and the distance is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            cur = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for t in tasks:\n                # Calculate the clockwise distance from cur to t\n                d = (t - cur) % n\n                # But wait: what if d==0? Then we don't move. That's correct.\n                ans += d\n                cur = t\n            print(ans)\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for (t-cur) % n is correct, but note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined as:\n\n            (a % n) = a - n * floor(a / n)\n\n        And we've shown that for the range [-n+1, n-1] it gives the correct clockwise distance.\n\n        But wait, let me test with a negative that is not covered: \n            n=4, a=1, current=3: (1-3) %4 = (-2)%4 = 2 (because -2 + 4*1 = 2, and 2<4). \n            Clockwise from 3 to 1: 3->4->1 (2 steps). Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation might be implemented with a conditional in some languages, but in Python it's well-defined.\n\n        Let me submit the modulus version.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the ringroad is one-way, and we are only moving clockwise. The modulus operation gives the minimal clockwise distance, which is the actual distance we must travel.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the sum of these distances.\n\n        However, wait: the example \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" and \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" work.\n\n        But wait, I just saw the sample input format: \n            Input: \n                ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n            Output: \n                ['6', '2']\n\n        Our code outputs 6 and 2.\n\n        However, wait: the problem states that initially Xenia is in house 1, and the first task is the first element in the list.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as a string in the example, but the actual input is two integers and then a list of m integers.\n\n        We are reading the input correctly.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        One last note: the problem constraints say that m can be up to 10^5, so we are doing a single pass, which is O(m). \n\n        This is efficient.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            if not data:\n                print(0)\n                exit(0)\n\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for a in tasks:\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                total_time += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait, what if n is 1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, the problem says: 2<=n<=10^5.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n            Output: 6\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"4 3\\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a ringroad where houses are arranged in a clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between neighboring houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be present at a specific house. The challenge is to compute the minimal time taken to move from her current house to the next task's house, considering she can only move clockwise.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal time to move from house `current` to house `task` in a clockwise direction can be calculated using modular arithmetic. Specifically, the distance `d` is `(task - current) % n`. This formula works because if `task` is ahead of `current`, the distance is simply the difference; if `task` is behind, the distance is adjusted by adding `n` (the total number of houses) to wrap around the ring.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each task in sequence, updating the current house and accumulating the time taken for each move. The time for each move is computed using the modular arithmetic approach described above.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is optimal given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        d = (a - current) % n\n        total_time += d\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) with total time initially set to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the clockwise distance from the current house to `a` using `(a - current) % n`. This handles both cases where `a` is ahead or behind `current` by leveraging modular arithmetic.\n   - **Update Time and Position**: Add the computed distance to the total time and update the current house to `a`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
