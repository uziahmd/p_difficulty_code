They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has 2^n teams. The playoff proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n). In the i-th phase (0-indexed? note: the string s index 0 corresponds to the first phase which has 2^(n-1) games) we have:\n   - If s[i] is '0', then in that phase each match is won by the team with the lower skill.\n   - If s[i] is '1', then in that phase each match is won by the team with the higher skill.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then the next phase (if there are more than one team left) has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n We are to find all integers x (which are the team skills) such that there exists a permutation p (which assigns distinct skill levels from 1 to 2^n) for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Important: the initial bracket is fixed: the teams are arranged in order (team1, team2), (team3, team4), ... and so on.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation: The outcome of the tournament is determined by the results string s and the assignment of the skill values to the teams. However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily (as long as they form a permutation).\n\n But note: the initial bracket is fixed by the input order? Actually, the problem does not specify the initial ordering of the teams beyond the fact that the first phase pairs are (1,2), (3,4), ... (so the initial seeding is by the natural order of the team numbers). However, the team numbers are just labels for the skills. But wait: the problem says \"the i-th team has skill p_i\", and p is a permutation of [1, 2^n]. So we are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily to the initial teams.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the team with skill x\" must win. So we can assign the skills arbitrarily, but we must assign the entire set {1, 2, ..., 2^n} to the teams.\n\n Alternate interpretation: We are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily to the teams. Then, we have to decide which teams (by their skill value) can be the champion.\n\n But note: the bracket structure is fixed: the matches are predetermined by the initial arrangement (first two teams play, next two, etc.). However, because we can assign the skills arbitrarily, we can choose which team (which originally was at position i) gets which skill.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let total_teams = 2**n.\n\n The tournament goes through n rounds (phases). In round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), there are 2^(n-i-1) games (each game produces one winner). The winner of each game in round i will advance to the next round.\n\n However, the outcome of each game in round i is determined by s[i]:\n   - If s[i] == '0': then the team with the lower skill wins the game.\n   - If s[i] == '1': then the team with the higher skill wins the game.\n\n We need to check for a given x (a number between 1 and total_teams) whether there is an assignment of the skills (a permutation p) such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n How to check for a fixed x?\n\n Since n is up to 18 (so total_teams up to 2^18 = 262144) and we cannot iterate over all permutations, we must use a smarter method.\n\n Insight:\n\n The tournament can be seen as a binary tree (with 2^n leaves). Each leaf is a team. Each internal node is a game. The outcome of the game at a node depends on the phase (depth) and the result s[i] (where i is the depth index).\n\n However, note: the rounds are from the first round (closest to leaves) to the final. The rounds are numbered from 0 to n-1 (with round 0 being the first round). The root is the champion.\n\n The key is to determine the necessary conditions on the skill of the champion (x) and the other teams.\n\n Alternatively, we can think about the following:\n\n In order for a particular team (with skill x) to win the tournament, it must win all its games. Moreover, the outcomes of the games in the subsequent rounds depend on the fixed pattern s.\n\n But note: we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can arrange the other teams (with skills != x) arbitrarily in the bracket.\n\n However, the bracket is fixed: the initial pairing is (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), ... (in terms of the original indices). But we can assign the skill x to any original team? Actually, no: we are told that the team with skill x must win. But note: the problem does not specify which original team is assigned the skill x. So we can choose which leaf (original team) gets the skill x.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: can we assign the skill x to one of the leaves (and the rest arbitrarily) such that, when we simulate the tournament according to the rules (with the fixed bracket and the given s), the team with skill x wins?\n\n However, we are free to assign the other skills arbitrarily. So we can control the relative strengths of the other teams.\n\n Conditions for x to win:\n\n 1. In the round where a team must face another team, if the rule says the higher skill wins, then x must be the highest in that part of the bracket? Or maybe we can set the other teams appropriately.\n\n But note: the bracket structure is fixed (the matches are predetermined). The tournament is single elimination and the bracket is a complete binary tree.\n\n We can model the tournament as a binary tree with 2^n leaves. The root is the final winner.\n\n Each node (game) in the tree is associated with a round (or depth) d (from 0 to n-1). The outcome of the game at depth d is determined by s[d] (if d=0, then the first character of s; d=1, the second, etc.).\n\n How does the outcome work?\n\n At a given game (node) at round d, the two children (the two teams that reached this game) have two skills, say a and b. Then:\n   - If s[d] == '0' (meaning lower skill wins): then the winner is min(a, b).\n   - If s[d] == '1' (meaning higher skill wins): then the winner is max(a, b).\n\n Now, we wish to know: can we assign the entire set of skills (all numbers from 1 to 2^n) to the leaves such that the team with skill x wins the tournament?\n\n Note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which leaf gets x, and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n However, the bracket structure (the parent-child relationships) is fixed. The matches are predetermined: for example, the first match is between the first two leaves.\n\n Steps for checking a candidate x:\n\n We can consider the entire bracket as a binary tree. The champion must come from one of the leaves. But we can choose which leaf to assign x.\n\n However, we must also satisfy the condition that in every match along the path from the chosen leaf to the root, the outcome (according to s) leads to x winning.\n\n But note: we can assign the other skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set the skills of the other leaves arbitrarily (but distinct) and then the skills of the internal nodes are determined by the outcomes (but actually the internal nodes don't have independent identities; we only care about the leaves and the propagation).\n\n However, the problem is that the assignment must be a permutation of [1, 2^n]. So we have to assign distinct numbers.\n\n We can think recursively. Let's define:\n\n   Let F(node, required_min, required_max) be a function that, given a node (a game) and the requirement that the winner of this node must be at least some value and at most some value (or alternatively, we can think in terms of the constraints on the winner of the subtree), and the current node's round (so we know the rule) and the available numbers, but that seems too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can note:\n\n For the champion to be x, in every match that x participates in (from the leaf to the root) the outcome must be favorable for x. Additionally, we must ensure that in the matches that x doesn't participate in, we can assign the other teams such that the winners of the subtrees eventually meet x in the next round.\n\n However, we can use a recursive approach that considers the entire bracket as a set of segments (like the standard way to solve bracket problems).\n\n We can break down the bracket into rounds. The tournament is played in rounds (phases) from round 0 to round n-1.\n\n In round i (0-indexed), the number of games is 2^(n-i-1). Each game is between two winners of the previous round (except the first round, which is the initial assignment).\n\n But note: the first round: the games are between consecutive leaves.\n\n We can think from the root backwards. However, the problem is symmetric: we are free to assign the entire set of numbers arbitrarily.\n\n Another idea: Instead of fixing the leaf for x, we can consider the entire tournament and the constraints that the champion must satisfy.\n\n Conditions for x to win:\n\n 1. The path from the champion to the root must be such that at each round, the outcome (given by s) allows x to win.\n\n However, we can choose the initial leaf arbitrarily. So we can choose a leaf (say at position k) and then set the skill of that leaf to x, and then set the other leaves arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed. The matches are predetermined. For example, if we choose a leaf that is in the left half of the bracket, then the matches that x must win are the ones in its own half until the final.\n\n However, we can also consider: what are the necessary conditions on x?\n\n Let the rounds be from 0 to n-1. In round 0, the bracket is split into 2^(n-1) games. Each game is between two consecutive teams (leaves). Then the winner of the game advances.\n\n Now, we can consider the entire tournament as having the following properties:\n\n - The champion must be the winner of the entire bracket.\n\n - In the final (round n-1) the two teams that reach the final are the winners of the top half and bottom half of the bracket.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed: the matches are predetermined.\n\n However, since we can assign arbitrarily, we can arrange for x to be in any leaf.\n\n Let's denote the bracket as a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves. The root is the champion.\n\n The champion must win n games (one per round). In each round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1) the outcome of the match that the champion plays is determined by s[i].\n\n What are the constraints on x?\n\n Consider the entire path from the champion's leaf to the root. Along this path, the matches occur in rounds 0,1,...,n-1. At round i (0-indexed), the rule is s[i]. \n\n Now, at each match (on the path), x must be compared with the opponent. The opponent is the winner of the other subtree.\n\n But we can assign the rest arbitrarily. So we can set the other teams arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and from 1 to 2^n excluding x).\n\n However, we must ensure that x wins the tournament. This means:\n\n  - In the first round (round 0): the opponent (the adjacent team) must be such that the outcome (given by s[0]) favors x.\n\n    If s[0] == '1' (higher skill wins), then x must be greater than the opponent.\n    If s[0] == '0' (lower skill wins), then x must be less than the opponent.\n\n  - Then, in the next round (round 1): the opponent is the winner of a subtree of size 2^(n-2) (since the entire bracket is 2^n, and we've eliminated one half in the first round? Actually, the bracket is fixed: the two teams that meet in the second round are the winners of two adjacent first-round games.\n\n But note: the entire bracket is fixed. The structure is: \n   Round 0: 2^(n-1) games, each between two consecutive leaves (so the bracket is ordered).\n\n However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the opponents arbitrarily (except that we must use distinct numbers and include x).\n\n But wait: the assignment must cover the entire set. So the constraints might come from the necessity that in the other parts of the bracket, we can arrange the numbers so that the opponents in each round are set appropriately.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Let the entire set of skills be S = {1, 2, ..., 2^n}. We assign x to one of the leaves (say leaf i). Then we have to assign the remaining 2^n-1 numbers arbitrarily to the other leaves.\n\n The tournament progresses as follows: at each round, we compare two numbers (from the two halves of the bracket) and the outcome is determined by the rule.\n\n The key is: to have x win, the following must hold:\n\n 1. In the first round, the immediate opponent (adjacent in the initial bracket) must be chosen such that the outcome (s[0]) is satisfied. Then, in the next round, the opponent is the winner of the next two teams, and so on.\n\n However, we can set the entire bracket arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set the entire bracket to be favorable for x, except for the constraint that the numbers must be distinct and cover the entire set.\n\n But note: sometimes we are forced to have a high or low number in a particular part of the bracket.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n   We can simulate the tournament backwards (from the root to the leaves) and determine the constraints on the champion's value and the constraints on the values in the subtrees.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the known solution for similar problems (like CodeForces problems on bracket determination). \n\n Known approach for similar problems (e.g., \"Bracket Sequence\"):\n\n   We can compute for each node (game) the minimum and maximum skill that can be the winner of that subtree, given that we can assign the skills arbitrarily (from the available numbers) to the leaves of that subtree.\n\n However, note: the entire set is fixed (from 1 to 2^n). And we have to use each number exactly once.\n\n But wait: the entire set is fixed, but we are free to assign arbitrarily. However, we are going to assign the same set to the entire bracket. So the set of numbers that appear in the entire bracket is fixed.\n\n However, we can break the problem: we are going to assign the numbers arbitrarily, so we can choose which numbers go to which part of the bracket.\n\n But note: the entire bracket uses all numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let the entire set be T = {1, 2, ..., 2^n}.\n\n   We wish to know if there exists an assignment such that the champion is x.\n\n   We can also think: what is the minimal and maximal value that the champion can take?\n\n   Actually, we can use a recursive function that, for a segment (subtree) of the bracket, returns the range of possible winners (min and max) for that segment.\n\n   The entire tournament is a segment of 2^n leaves. The champion must be the winner of the entire bracket.\n\n   However, we are constrained by the entire set T.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Let f(l, r, d) be a function that, for a segment [l, r] (0-indexed, with l and r being the indices of the leaves in the current segment, and d the current round index (from 0 to n-1)), returns the interval [min_value, max_value] of the skill that the winner of this segment must have.\n\n     But note: the entire set T is fixed and we are assigning distinct numbers. However, the segment [l, r] is a contiguous set of leaves in the initial bracket? Actually, the bracket is fixed: the initial bracket is the entire set of leaves, and then the matches are fixed.\n\n     Actually, the bracket is fixed: the first half of the bracket is the first 2^(n-1) teams, and the second half is the next 2^(n-1). But our assignment is arbitrary.\n\n     However, we can use a divide and conquer method that breaks the bracket into two halves.\n\n     The root (final) requires that the winner is the one that wins the entire bracket.\n\n     But the catch: the assignment must use the entire set T. So the numbers used in the left half and the right half must be disjoint.\n\n     We can use the following:\n\n        Let F(segment) = [low, high] meaning that the winner of this segment must be at least low and at most high (if we are to have the entire assignment consistent) and also the set of numbers we use in this segment must be a subset of T.\n\n     However, we don't know the exact set, but we know the entire set is {1,2,...,M} (where M=2^n). We can use the idea of \"available\" numbers, but that state is too large.\n\n Another known approach (from problems like \"Drazil and His Happy Friends\" or \"Bracket Sequence\") is to use the following:\n\n   We can consider the entire tournament and the fixed rules. The outcome of the tournament is determined by the relative ranking of the numbers. However, we can choose the assignment arbitrarily.\n\n   We can ask: what is the set of numbers that can be the champion?\n\n   Conditions:\n\n   Let the rounds be from 0 to n-1 (with 0 being the first round). In round i, the rule is s[i].\n\n   The champion must be the winner of the entire bracket.\n\n   Consider the following:\n\n     In the first round, the champion must either be the smallest or the largest in its first match, depending on s[0].\n\n     Then, in the second round, the champion must be the smallest or the largest in the entire left half (if the champion is in the left half) or the right half (if the champion is in the right half) of the bracket? Actually, the bracket is fixed: the champion must win all rounds.\n\n   However, we can choose the initial leaf arbitrarily.\n\n   We can consider the entire bracket as having two halves: left and right. The champion must come from one half (say left) and then defeat the right half's winner (or vice versa) in the final.\n\n   The outcome in the final (round n-1) is determined by s[n-1]. Then, the outcome in the semifinal (round n-2) is determined by s[n-2], and so on.\n\n   Now, let's define:\n\n     Let L and R be the two halves (each of size 2^(n-1)). The champion must be either the winner of L or the winner of R.\n\n   But we can choose the leaf arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the champion to be in L or R.\n\n   However, the entire set of numbers is fixed. So the numbers in L and R must be disjoint and together form the entire set.\n\n   Now, we can determine the constraints for the champion:\n\n   Case 1: Champion is in L.\n\n     Then, in the final (round n-1) the champion (from L) must defeat the winner of R.\n\n     The rule for the final is s[n-1] (the last character of the string).\n\n        - If s[n-1] == '1' (higher skill wins), then the champion (from L) must be greater than the winner of R.\n        - If s[n-1] == '0' (lower skill wins), then the champion (from L) must be less than the winner of R.\n\n     Similarly, the champion must win all the rounds in L (from the leaf to the semifinal) and the winner of R must be the winner of its own half.\n\n   But note: the entire assignment must be consistent: the numbers in L and R are disjoint and cover the entire set.\n\n   How to assign the numbers to L and R?\n\n   We are free to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which numbers go to L and which to R, as long as they are distinct and cover the entire set.\n\n   Then, the constraints for the champion (if it is in L) are:\n\n     Condition 1: The champion must win its own half (L) according to the rules from round 0 to round n-2 (i.e., the first n-1 rounds, but note the rounds are applied from the leaves upward).\n\n     Condition 2: In the final, the champion (from L) must be compared with the winner of R (which is the maximum or minimum of R, depending on the rule for the final).\n\n   However, we can also consider the entire process as:\n\n     The champion must be able to be the winner of its own half (L) and then be able to defeat the winner of the other half (R) according to the final rule.\n\n   Similarly, if the champion is in R.\n\n   Therefore, we can split the problem:\n\n     Step 1: Determine the set of numbers that can be the winner of the entire bracket.\n\n     Step 2: But note: we can choose the leaf arbitrarily, so the champion can be any number that satisfies the condition for being the winner of the entire bracket.\n\n   However, the entire bracket requires that the champion must be the winner of the entire set.\n\n   We can use the following algorithm:\n\n     Let M = 2**n.\n\n     We are going to consider the entire bracket as a complete binary tree with M leaves.\n\n     We can use dynamic programming (DP) that works on the entire set of numbers? That is too expensive (state space is too big).\n\n   Another idea: we can determine the necessary conditions on x by simulating the tournament from the leaves to the root, but we can choose the assignment arbitrarily. The key is that we can set the opponents arbitrarily (as long as distinct) and we want to know if x can be the champion.\n\n   We can try to assign the entire set in a way that x wins. We can use the following:\n\n     In the entire tournament, we have n rounds. The champion must be compared with n opponents (one per round). But note: the opponents are the winners of the other branches.\n\n     However, we can set the entire bracket arbitrarily. So we can set the numbers in the other branch (the one that the champion does not belong to in the first round) to be very high or very low as needed.\n\n     Specifically, for the champion to win:\n\n        In round 0 (first round): \n            if s[0]=='1': then the opponent must be < x.\n            if s[0]=='0': then the opponent must be > x.\n\n        Then, in round 1 (second round): the opponent is the winner of a subtree of two leaves (so two teams). We can set those two teams arbitrarily (from the remaining numbers). Then, we can set the winner of that subtree to be either the smallest or the largest available number (depending on the rule for round 1 and the desired outcome).\n\n     But note: the entire set is fixed, so we cannot use numbers arbitrarily without considering the whole assignment.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces problem \"The Tournament\"):\n\n        We can determine the set of candidates by considering the tournament bracket and the fixed rules.\n\n   Insight:\n\n     The tournament bracket can be represented as a binary tree. The champion must be the one that, in each match it participates in, wins according to the rule.\n\n     Moreover, the bracket is fixed: the matches are predetermined.\n\n     We can determine the minimal and maximal skill that the champion must have.\n\n     Let A = the entire set {1, 2, ..., M}.\n\n     We can consider the following:\n\n        Let F(round, side) be the set of numbers that can be the winner of the subtree starting at a given node and at a given round.\n\n     But we can use a simpler idea:\n\n        We can simulate the tournament from the leaves to the root, but we are free to assign the numbers arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the numbers in the other branches optimally.\n\n        For the champion to win, the following must hold:\n\n          In the first match (round0): \n            if s[0]=='1', then x must be greater than the number in the first match (the immediate opponent). But note: we can choose the opponent arbitrarily (from the remaining numbers). So we can set the opponent to be the smallest available number (other than x). Then, for x to win, we require that there exists a number y (not x) such that y < x (if s[0]=='1') OR y > x (if s[0]=='0'). But wait: we are free to assign the entire set, so we can always choose an opponent that satisfies the condition (unless there is no number above or below x in the entire set, but note: the set is {1,...,M} and x is one of them, so there is always at least one number above and one below unless M=1).\n\n        However, we must also consider the entire path.\n\n        In fact, the champion must win n matches. In each match i (0-indexed), the rule is s[i]. The opponent in match i is the winner of a subtree of size 2^(n-i-1). \n\n        The key is: we can choose the numbers arbitrarily, so we can set the entire subtree (opponent branch) to be as favorable as possible.\n\n        Specifically, for the champion to win match i:\n\n          - If s[i]=='1', then we need the champion's number (x) to be greater than the opponent's number (which is the winner of the subtree). But we can set the subtree to have a winner that is as small as possible (so that x is greater than it). However, we must remember that the subtree has 2^(n-i-1) leaves and we are assigning distinct numbers.\n\n          - Similarly, if s[i]=='0', we need x to be less than the opponent, so we set the subtree winner to be as large as possible.\n\n        But note: the entire set of numbers must be used. However, we can postpone the assignment of numbers to the opponent's branch until we know the required constraint.\n\n        Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for x to win is:\n\n          There exists an assignment of the entire set of numbers such that:\n\n            For round i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n              Let t_i be the winner of the opponent's subtree (which has 2^(n-i-1) leaves).\n\n              Then, \n                if s[i]=='1': x > t_i\n                if s[i]=='0': x < t_i\n\n          And the t_i must be chosen from the available numbers (distinct) and the entire set is partitioned appropriately.\n\n        Now, note: the opponent's subtree in round i has 2^(n-i-1) leaves. The minimal possible value for t_i (if we want to minimize it) is the smallest 2^(n-i-1) numbers (excluding x and the numbers already used) but wait: we haven't assigned the entire set.\n\n        However, we can use a greedy assignment:\n\n          We start from the champion's leaf and then assign the numbers in the opponent's branches to be either as small as possible (for s[i]=='1') or as large as possible (for s[i]=='0').\n\n        But note: the same number cannot be used twice.\n\n        We can simulate the tournament from the champion's leaf to the root, and for each round, we determine the minimal and maximal value that the champion's number must be compared to.\n\n        Actually, we can determine the constraints on x by considering the entire tournament as a sequence of comparisons.\n\n        We can define:\n\n          Let L_i be the minimal value that the opponent in round i (if we want to minimize the constraint on x) must have, and R_i be the maximal value.\n\n          Then, for x to win round i:\n\n            if s[i]=='1': x must be greater than the opponent's value. To make it easier for x, we would set the opponent's value as low as possible. However, the opponent's value is determined by the entire subtree. But note: we can set the entire subtree arbitrarily (as long as distinct and from the available numbers). The minimal value we can assign to the entire subtree (to minimize the opponent's value) is the minimal 2^(n-i-1) numbers (excluding x and the numbers we have already used). But wait: we are building the entire assignment.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a backward induction that determines the range of values that x must have to win.\n\n        We can define two arrays:\n\n          low[i] = the minimal value that x must have to win the tournament, given that we are at round i and we have the freedom to assign the entire rest of the numbers optimally.\n\n          high[i] = the maximal value that x must have.\n\n        But wait, we are free to choose the leaf, so the path from the leaf to the root might matter.\n\n        Actually, the rounds are fixed, but the leaf is chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, the champion must be able to win the entire bracket from any leaf? Not necessarily: we can choose the leaf arbitrarily. But the condition on x is independent of the leaf? Actually, no: the bracket structure (the matches) is fixed, so the rounds that x participates in are fixed by the leaf.\n\n        However, we can choose the leaf arbitrarily. So we can choose a leaf that is in a favorable position for x.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for x to win is: there exists a leaf (position) in the bracket such that, if we assign x to that leaf, then we can assign the rest of the numbers so that x wins all rounds.\n\n        How to determine if there exists a leaf and an assignment?\n\n        We can consider the entire bracket and the fixed rules. The tournament is deterministic once the numbers are assigned.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          Let the bracket be broken down into rounds. The champion must be the winner of the entire bracket.\n\n          We can simulate the tournament from the leaves to the root for a fixed assignment, but we are free to assign.\n\n        Known similar problem: \"The Tournament\" (CodeForces) or \"Bracket Sequence\". \n\n        Actually, I recall a problem where we are given a bracket and a set of booleans (or strings) for each round, and we ask which teams can be the champion. The solution is to use a segment tree and then determine the range of values that the champion must have.\n\n        Here's a known solution for a similar problem (from CodeForces) \"DZY Loves Division\" or \"Bracket Sequence\", but not exactly.\n\n        After some thought, here's a simpler idea:\n\n          The tournament can be seen as a series of 2^n-1 games. The champion must win n games. The outcomes of these games are determined by the rules.\n\n          The necessary condition for x to win is that it must be able to win all its n matches. In each match i (0-indexed), the opponent is the winner of a subtree of size 2^(n-i-1). The outcome of the match is determined by s[i].\n\n          In match i, the champion must be compared with a value that is the winner of the subtree. The winner of the subtree is the minimum or maximum of the subtree, depending on the rules in the subtree.\n\n          But note: the entire set of numbers is fixed. We can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we can set the subtree to have the minimal possible winner (if we want to help the champion win) or the maximal (if we want to hurt it). However, we want to know if there exists an assignment that lets x win.\n\n          Therefore, for each round i, we can choose the winner of the opponent's subtree to be:\n\n            If s[i]=='1' (champion needs to be greater), then we can choose the opponent's subtree to have a winner as small as possible (so that x is greater) provided that the smallest available number (after removing x and the numbers used in the champion's own path) is <= x-1.\n\n            Similarly, if s[i]=='0', then we can choose the opponent's subtree to have a winner as large as possible (so that x is less) provided that the largest available number is >= x+1.\n\n          However, we must reserve numbers for the entire bracket.\n\n        We can use a greedy method:\n\n          Let available = sorted list of numbers from 1 to M, and then remove x.\n\n          Then, we simulate the tournament from the champion's leaf to the root, and at each round i, we need to assign a winner to the opponent's subtree.\n\n          But note: the opponent's subtree has 2^(n-i-1) leaves. The minimal winner we can assign to that subtree is the minimal 2^(n-i-1) numbers from the available set (excluding the numbers we've already used). Similarly, the maximal winner is the maximal 2^(n-i-1) numbers.\n\n          However, we are free to choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we can choose any 2^(n-i-1) numbers for that subtree.\n\n          Then, for round i:\n\n            if s[i]=='1': we need the champion's x to be greater than the winner of the opponent's subtree. The minimal winner we can assign to the opponent's subtree is the smallest available number. But wait, we are not forced to use the smallest available numbers; we can choose any set. However, to make it easier for x, we want the opponent's winner to be as small as possible.\n\n            But note: the entire set of numbers must be used, so we have to use all numbers. However, we can use the following:\n\n            Let's define:\n\n              Let A = the set of numbers not including x.\n\n            We will need to assign numbers to the entire bracket (including the champion's own path and the opponent's paths).\n\n            However, the champion's own path (excluding the champion) has 2^n - 1 - (number of leaves in opponent's subtrees) numbers? Actually, the entire bracket has 2^n leaves. The champion's leaf is one. The other leaves are divided into the opponent's subtrees.\n\n            We can simulate the tournament by considering the rounds and the required constraints.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following approach (known from problems like \"The Final Countdown\"):\n\n          We can determine the minimal and maximal skill level that the champion must have by considering the entire tournament and the rules.\n\n          Let F(i, j) be the minimal and maximal skill level that can be the winner of the bracket defined by the segment [i, j] (with j-i+1 = 2^k leaves) and the rules from round i to the end.\n\n          But note: the rounds are fixed (string s), and the bracket is fixed (the initial bracket is the entire set, and the matches are predetermined).\n\n        However, there is an easier way:\n\n          We can consider the following: the tournament is fixed, and the outcome is determined by the relative ordering of the numbers. We can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so the only constraint is that the relative order of the numbers in the champion's path must satisfy the rules.\n\n          In fact, the condition for x to win is that there exists a way to assign the entire set such that:\n\n            For each round i (from 0 to n-1), the comparison between x and the winner of the opponent's subtree is favorable (according to s[i]).\n\n          And the winner of the opponent's subtree is the minimum or maximum of that subtree, depending on the rules in that subtree.\n\n          But wait: the rules apply to every game in the subtree. So the winner of the opponent's subtree is determined by the rules from round i to n-1 (for that subtree). \n\n          However, we can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we can choose the entire subtree to be either the smallest or largest numbers, but we must respect the rules in the subtree.\n\n          Therefore, the winner of the opponent's subtree in round i (which is a bracket of size 2^(n-i-1)) must be:\n\n            If the rule for the final round of that subtree (the root of the subtree) is known, then the winner is the minimum or maximum of the entire set of numbers in the subtree.\n\n          But note: the subtree has its own rounds (from round i to round n-2) and its own rule string (a suffix of s). However, we are given the entire string s for the entire tournament.\n\n          Let t = n - i - 1 + i? Actually, the rounds for the opponent's subtree are from round i to round n-2 (if we consider the entire tournament has n rounds, then the opponent's subtree has n-i-1 rounds). \n\n          Then, the winner of the opponent's subtree is determined by the rules in s[i:] (but only the first n-i-1 characters? Actually, the entire tournament has n rounds, and the opponent's subtree has n-i-1 rounds (from round i to round n-1-1) because the final round (n-1) is the root of the entire tree).\n\n          However, the rules for the entire tournament are given by the string s (of length n). The rounds in the opponent's subtree are the rounds i, i+1, ..., n-2 (if we count from 0 to n-1). \n\n          Then, the winner of the opponent's subtree is:\n\n            Let r = n-i-1 (the number of rounds in the subtree).\n\n            Then, the winner is the minimum or maximum of the numbers in the subtree, depending on the rules (specifically, the last rule in the subtree's rounds matters for the final of the subtree? Actually, no: the entire subtree's bracket is fixed, and the winner is determined by the entire sequence of rules in the subtree.\n\n          But note: the entire set of rules is given by s, and the subtree's games are from round i to round n-2 (if we consider the entire tournament has rounds 0 to n-1, then the subtree has rounds i to n-2). The final game of the subtree is round n-2.\n\n          However, we can use the following property:\n\n            The",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skill levels \\( p \\) (a permutation of integers from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament's outcome is governed by a string \\( s \\) which dictates the result of each phase: if \\( s_i \\) is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament involves \\( 2^n \\) teams arranged in a fixed bracket. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one champion remains. The key insight is that for a team with skill \\( x \\) to win, it must win all its matches in every phase, and the outcomes of these matches must align with the given string \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For \\( x \\) to be a winning integer, it must be possible to assign the remaining \\( 2^n - 1 \\) numbers (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\) excluding \\( x \\)) to the other teams such that \\( x \\) wins all its matches. This involves ensuring that in each phase, \\( x \\) can defeat its opponents based on the rules specified by \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking for each \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\) whether it can win the tournament by verifying the following:\n   - **Phase Conditions**: For each phase \\( i \\), if \\( s[i] \\) is '1', \\( x \\) must be greater than the winner of the opposing subtree. If \\( s[i] \\) is '0', \\( x \\) must be less than the winner of the opposing subtree.\n   - **Subtree Winners**: The winners of the opposing subtrees must be chosen from the remaining numbers such that they meet the conditions derived from \\( s \\). This is checked by ensuring the necessary numbers are available for assignment.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\), and for each \\( x \\), it verifies the conditions for all \\( n \\) phases. The complexity is \\( O(2^n \\times n) \\), which is feasible since \\( n \\) is at most 18 (so \\( 2^{18} = 262,144 \\) numbers to check).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    min_val = 1\n    max_val = total_teams\n    \n    def can_win(x):\n        used = set([x])\n        current_min = 1\n        current_max = total_teams\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            num_games_in_round = 1 << (n - i - 1)\n            half_size = num_games_in_round\n            if s_str[i] == '1':\n                required_winner = 'max'\n            else:\n                required_winner = 'min'\n                \n            if required_winner == 'min':\n                candidate = current_min\n                while candidate in used:\n                    candidate += 1\n                used.add(candidate)\n                if candidate >= x:\n                    return False\n            else:\n                candidate = current_max\n                while candidate in used:\n                    candidate -= 1\n                used.add(candidate)\n                if candidate <= x:\n                    return False\n                    \n        return True\n\n    winning_integers = []\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        if can_win(x):\n            winning_integers.append(str(x))\n            \n    print(\" \".join(winning_integers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \\( n \\) (number of phases) and a string \\( s \\) (determining the outcome of each phase).\n2. **Initialization**: The total number of teams is \\( 2^n \\).
