For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. The notes are in a circular list of 12: \n ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']? Wait, note: the example says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n But wait, let me check: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H -> that's 12 notes.\n\n However, note that the example input \"A B H\": \n   According to the problem, after H comes C, and before C is H. So the circle is: ... H, C, C#, ...\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11). Let's define the mapping:\n\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n    Then:\n        C -> 0\n        C# -> 1\n        D -> 2\n        D# -> 3\n        E -> 4\n        F -> 5\n        F# -> 6\n        G -> 7\n        G# -> 8\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we have to consider all permutations (orderings) of the three notes.\n\n 3. For each ordering (x, y, z), we can compute the distances (in semitones) from x to y and from y to z, and then from x to z (but note: the circle is modulo 12).\n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance from a lower tone to an upper one. But because it's cyclic, we might have two ways to measure: the smallest positive distance or the entire circle?\n\n    But the example: between E and C: they say 8 semitones. How?\n        E is at 4, C is at 0. \n        Going forward from E: 4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->0: that's 8 steps (from E to next E is 12, but we don't go that way because we take the direct upward? Actually, the problem states: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap around? \n\n    However, the example says: \"between E and C is 8 semitones\" — which is actually going from E to F to F# to G to G# to A to B to H to C: that's 8 steps. \n\n    But wait, the example also says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones\". So if we are going from C to E, we don't wrap: from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones.\n\n    The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we consider the absolute minimal upward path? Actually, no: because from E to C, the upward path would be from E to C via the top? That doesn't make sense. \n\n    Let me re-read: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n    Actually, the example says: between E and C is 8 semitones. So they are considering the entire circle? But note: the chord definition orders the notes so that the distances are 4 and then 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). \n\n    Important: the chord definition says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" — meaning the entire span from X to Y must be 4, and then from Y to Z must be 3. \n\n    But note: the circle has 12 semitones. The total from X to Z should be 7, but what if we go beyond 12? \n\n    Actually, the definition does not require that the entire chord fits within an octave. But the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically, so we can map the notes to numbers modulo 12.\n\n    However, the distance from E to C: \n        We can compute the distance from E (4) to C (0) by two ways:\n          Forward: (0 - 4) mod 12 = -4 mod 12 = 8 (if we consider the positive direction from E to C: we go from 4 to 0, but 0 is equivalent to 12, so 12-4=8).\n        Similarly, from C to E: (4 - 0) mod 12 = 4.\n\n    So the distance between two notes a and b (with numbers a, b) can be defined as:\n        d = (b - a) % 12\n        But if negative, we adjust: actually, we want the smallest nonnegative distance in the circle? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". This implies that we are only concerned with the upward direction. But in a circle, the upward direction from a higher note to a lower note is wrapping around.\n\n    Example: E to C: we have to go from E (which is higher than C in the natural scale) but the circle goes ... E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C, ... so from E to C we go through the next 8 notes (including the wrap). \n\n    So the rule: \n        Let a, b be two notes with numbers n1, n2 (from 0 to 11). Then the upward distance from n1 to n2 is (n2 - n1) % 12, but if negative, we add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, we want the positive distance in the circle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute: \n            d = (n2 - n1) % 12\n            But if d is negative, then we do d += 12, then d %= 12? Actually, modulo operation for negative: we can use (n2 - n1 + 12) % 12, but wait: \n                (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8, which is correct for E to C (if we are taking from E (4) to C (0): (0-4+12)%12 = 8)\n\n        However, the problem says: from the lowest to the uppest. But in our example, E is higher than C in pitch? Actually, in the musical scale, E is above C. But when we are on E and we want to go up to C, we actually wrap around. \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are always going upward. In the example, from E to C: we are going from a higher note to a lower note? That doesn't fit. \n\n        Let me clarify the example: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" — this is because they are defining the distance from E to C as the upward journey from E to the next C (which is 12 semitones from E to E, but then we stop at C which is 8 semitones above E). \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\".\n\n        So the same two notes: C and E. \n            From C (0) to E (4): 4 semitones (upward, without wrapping).\n            From E (4) to C (0): 8 semitones (because we go from E to the next C, which is 8 semitones upward from E: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C, that's 8 steps).\n\n        Therefore, the distance from a note a to note b is defined as the smallest nonnegative number of semitones to go from a to b in the upward direction, possibly wrapping around.\n\n        Formula: \n            d = (b - a) % 12\n            But if (b - a) is negative, then we add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, we can do: \n            d = (b - a) % 12\n            If d < 0: d += 12\n\n        However, modulo operation for negative: \n            We can do: d = (b - a) % 12\n            But in Python, if (b - a) is negative, then (b-a)%12 gives a result in [0,11] by adding 12 until positive? Actually, no: \n                Example: (0-4)%12 = -4 %12 = 8 (in Python, -4 %12 gives 8). So we can simply do: (b - a) % 12, and if the result is negative, we adjust by adding 12 until positive, but the modulus already gives a positive.\n\n        Actually, in Python, the modulus for negative is defined such that: \n            (a % b) has the sign of b, but here we are doing (b - a) % 12. \n\n        Let me test: \n            (4 - 0) % 12 -> 4 %12 = 4\n            (0 - 4) % 12 -> (-4) %12 = 8 (because 12 * ceil(-4/12) is 0? Actually, the formula for modulus is: a % b = a - b*floor(a/b). For negative: \n            floor(-4/12) = floor(-0.333) = -1, so -4 - 12*(-1) = -4 + 12 = 8.\n\n        So we can compute the distance from note a (with value x) to note b (with value y) as: (y - x) % 12, and if negative, it becomes positive by adding 12 (because of modulus). But wait, the modulus operation already does that.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the uppest. But in our computation, we are computing the upward distance from x to y as (y-x) mod 12, which might be the long way if y < x. \n\n        But that matches the example: from E (4) to C (0): (0-4)%12 = 8, which is the upward distance (wrapping).\n\n        So we'll define a function to convert a note name to a number, and then a function to compute the distance from note a to note b (in semitones, the upward distance) as (b_num - a_num) % 12, but wait: if we do (b_num - a_num) % 12, then for a_num=4, b_num=0, we get 8. That's correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are to check all orderings.\n\n        Conditions for major: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n            d(x, y) = 4\n            d(y, z) = 3\n\n        Conditions for minor: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n            d(x, y) = 3\n            d(y, z) = 4\n\n        But note: the entire chord must be considered. Also, the third distance (from x to z) should be 7 in both cases (because 4+3=7). However, the circle is 12, so we can also have the possibility of going the other way? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the chord is defined by having the distances 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) in sequence. But note: the entire chord spans 7 semitones. However, in the circle, the remaining part is 5 semitones (12-7=5). \n\n        But we don't need to worry about the entire circle because the definition is based on the ordering of the three notes. \n\n        Steps for the algorithm:\n\n        1. Map the input notes to numbers.\n        2. Generate all permutations of these three numbers (there are 6).\n        3. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n            Check if (distance from a to b == 4 and distance from b to c == 3) OR (distance from a to b == 3 and distance from b to c == 4)\n            But note: the distance function we defined is the upward distance (so from a to b: (b - a) % 12, etc.)\n\n        4. However, wait: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's break down:\n\n            Notes: C#, B, F.\n\n            Mapping:\n                C# -> 1\n                B -> 10\n                F -> 5\n\n            One valid ordering: B, C#, F.\n\n            Distance from B to C#: (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9 %12 = 3? Actually, wait: we defined the distance from a to b as (b - a) % 12. So from B (10) to C# (1): (1 - 10) % 12 = -9 %12 = 3. \n            Then from C# (1) to F (5): (5 - 1) %12 = 4.\n\n            So the condition for minor is met: 3 and then 4.\n\n            But wait, the example says the ordering is \"B C# F\", so the first distance is from B to C# (3 semitones) and then from C# to F (4 semitones). Correct.\n\n        5. However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, so we don't know the starting point. We must consider all starting points and all directions? Actually, we are generating all permutations, so we consider every possible ordering.\n\n        But wait: the chord has three distinct notes, and the problem says the chord is an unordered set. So we have 3! = 6 permutations.\n\n        6. We must check for each permutation if the two conditions (major or minor) are satisfied.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous: no chord is both major and minor.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Create a list of the 12 notes in order.\n\n        Step 2: Read the input string, split into three tokens.\n\n        Step 3: Map each token to a number. But note: the input might have sharps and naturals, and the note names are given as: \n                ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n        Step 4: For the three numbers, generate all 6 permutations.\n\n        Step 5: For each permutation (x, y, z):\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12   [if negative, modulus will fix it to be in [0,11]]\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n            Then check if (d1 == 4 and d2 == 3) OR (d1 == 3 and d2 == 4)\n\n        Step 6: If we find at least one permutation that satisfies the major condition, then output \"major\". If we find one for minor, then output \"minor\". If none, then \"strange\".\n\n        However, note: the entire chord must be considered. But wait, what if there are multiple orderings? The problem says the chord is defined by being able to order the notes so that the condition holds. So if any ordering satisfies, then we can call it major or minor.\n\n        But wait: what if a chord satisfies both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, let me test with a known chord:\n\n        Example 1: C E G -> major\n            C:0, E:4, G:7\n\n            Permutation (0,4,7): \n                d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major found.\n\n            Other permutations? We don't need to check all because we break as soon as we find one? Actually, we can break early: if we found one major, we can output major and exit. Similarly for minor.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a chord that can be ordered in two different ways? For example, is there a chord that is both major and minor? The problem says no, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, let me test with a minor chord: C Eb Gb? Actually, no, standard minor is like C, Eb, G. But wait, the example was C# B F.\n\n        Example 2: minor chord: A C E (minor chord: A minor: A, C, E). \n            A:9, C:0, E:4\n\n            We need to find an ordering: \n                One ordering: A, C, E: \n                    d1 = (0-9)%12 = (0-9) = -9 %12 = 3\n                    d2 = (4-0)%12 = 4 -> minor.\n\n            Another ordering: C, E, A:\n                    d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(9-4)%12=5 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            Another ordering: E, A, C: \n                    d1 = (9-4)%12=5, d2=(0-9)%12=3 -> not 3 and then 4 (because first is 5, second is 3) -> doesn't match.\n\n            But wait, the condition requires the first two distances to be 3 and then 4, or 4 and then 3. Here, we have 5 and then 3, which is neither.\n\n            However, what if we consider the circle and the fact that the chord is cyclic? \n\n            Actually, the definition says: \"an unordered set\" and then we can order the notes arbitrarily. But the ordering must be the one that gives the consecutive distances.\n\n            But note: the example \"C# B F\" was reordered as \"B C# F\". So we are allowed to start at any note and then the next two.\n\n            However, the entire chord must be considered in the circle. The problem does not specify that the ordering must be increasing in pitch without wrapping. It just says \"order the notes\".\n\n            But wait: the definition says: \"the distance along the musical scale\", which is the circle. And the example from E to C is 8 semitones (wrapping). \n\n            So the ordering is not necessarily the natural increasing order. We can start anywhere and then go in the circle.\n\n            But note: the chord must be ordered so that the two consecutive distances (as defined) are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). \n\n            In the case of A minor (A, C, E): \n                We found one ordering (A, C, E) that gives 3 and then 4. So it's minor.\n\n            Now, what about the same chord in a different ordering? For example, if we start at C: (C, E, A) -> d1=4, d2=5 -> not minor nor major.\n\n            What if we start at E: (E, A, C) -> d1=5 (from E to A: (9-4)=5), then from A to C: (0-9)%12=3 -> so we have 5 and then 3 -> not matching.\n\n            But wait, is there another ordering? We have 6 permutations:\n\n            Permutations of [9,0,4]:\n                (9,0,4): d1= (0-9)%12=3, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> minor -> valid.\n                (9,4,0): d1=(4-9)%12=-5%12=7, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n                (0,9,4): d1=(9-0)%12=9, d2=(4-9)%12= (4-9)%12= -5%12=7 -> no.\n                (0,4,9): d1=4, d2=5 -> no.\n                (4,9,0): d1=9, d2= (0-9)%12=3 -> no.\n                (4,0,9): d1= (0-4)%12=8, d2=(9-0)%12=9 -> no.\n\n            So only one ordering works.\n\n        Example 3: A B H (example input, which is strange)\n\n            A:9, B:10, H:11\n\n            Permutations:\n\n            (9,10,11): d1= (10-9)=1, d2=1 -> no.\n            (9,11,10): d1=(11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)= -1 %12=11 -> no.\n            (10,9,11): d1=(9-10)= -1 %12=11, d2=(11-9)=2 -> no.\n            (10,11,9): d1=(11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)= -2 %12=10 -> no.\n            (11,9,10): d1=(9-11)= -2 %12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n            (11,10,9): d1=(10-11)= -1 %12=11, d2=(9-10)= -1 %12=11 -> no.\n\n            So it's strange.\n\n        However, wait: what if we consider the circle and the possibility of going the long way? \n\n        But note: the definition uses the upward distance (the minimal upward path? Actually, no: the example from E to C was 8, which is the long way. But the problem does not say minimal. It says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are allowed to wrap. \n\n        Our method: (y-x)%12 gives the upward distance (possibly wrapping) and that's exactly what we want.\n\n        But wait: in the example (9,10,11): \n            d1 = (10-9)=1, d2= (11-10)=1 -> so 1 and 1, which is neither 3 nor 4.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        mapping = {\n            'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11\n        }\n\n        However, note: the input note names might be given with '#' and without. The example: 'C#', 'B', 'F'\n\n        But wait: the example input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n        We can split the input and then map each token.\n\n        But note: what if the input has a note that is not in the mapping? The problem says the input is 3 space-separated notes in the given notation.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Example: Input \"C E G\"\n\n        Steps:\n\n        tokens = ['C','E','G']\n        numbers = [mapping[token] for token in tokens]\n\n        Then, from the numbers, we generate all permutations.\n\n        Then, for each permutation (a,b,c):\n\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12   -> but wait, if (b-a) is negative, modulus makes it positive. However, the modulus operation in Python for negative is defined as above.\n\n            Then check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) or (3,4)\n\n        But wait: what if the distances are computed correctly even when the numbers are negative? \n\n        Example: from note 10 (B) to 1 (C#): (1-10) %12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3 (correct).\n\n        However, note: the circle is 12, and the distances are modulo 12, but the condition for major/minor is fixed (4 and 3, or 3 and 4). \n\n        But wait: what if we have a chord that is a major triad but the distances wrap more than once? Actually, the modulus ensures we get the smallest positive representation (in the range [0,11]) of the upward distance.\n\n        However, the condition requires exactly 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). \n\n        Example: a major triad: the entire chord spans 7 semitones. But if we wrap, then the distances we are computing are the upward distances (which might be more than 7 for the entire chord? Actually, no: because the entire chord is three distinct notes, the maximum upward distance for two adjacent notes is 11 (if we go from a high note to a low note). \n\n        But note: the condition is only on the two consecutive steps. \n\n        However, the problem does not require the entire chord to be within an octave. \n\n        One more thing: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, so we are allowed to assign any order. \n\n        Let me test a chord that is a major triad but the notes are not in the typical order. For example, G B D (which is a G major: G, B, D). \n\n        G:7, B:10, D:2\n\n        Let's compute the distances:\n\n        One ordering: G, B, D: \n            d1 = (10-7)%12=3, d2=(2-10)%12= (2-10) = -8 %12=4 -> minor? \n\n        Wait, that's minor. But G major should be:\n\n            Major: root, major third (4 semitones above root), and perfect fifth (7 semitones above root). \n\n            G major: G, B, D.\n\n            From G to B: G(7) to B(10) is 3 semitones? That's a minor third. \n\n            Actually, wait: G to B: \n                G, G#, A, A#, B -> that's 4 semitones? \n\n            Let me count: \n                G -> G# (1), G#->A (2), A->A# (3), A#->B (4) -> 4 semitones.\n\n            So why did we get 3? \n\n            Because our mapping: \n                G:7, then the next note after G is G#=8, then A=9, then A#=10, then B=10? \n\n            Wait, wait: the mapping I provided:\n\n                'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11.\n\n            So B is 10, and G is 7. Then (10-7)=3. But wait, that would imply that from G (7) to B (10) is 3 semitones? \n\n            Actually, the notes in between: from G (7) to G# (8) is 1, then to A (9) is 2, then to A# (10) is 3, then to B (11) is 4? \n\n            But wait, our mapping has B as 10, but according to the list, after A (9) comes B (10) and then H (11). \n\n            So the note after A is B, which is 10. Then from G (7) to B (10): \n                7 -> 8 (G#), 8->9 (A), 9->10 (B): that's 3 steps, so 3 semitones.\n\n            But wait, in music, a major third is 4 semitones. \n\n            Let me check: \n                C major: C, E, G -> C to E: 4 semitones (C->C#->D->D#->E: 4). \n                Similarly, G major: G, B, D -> G to B: \n                    G -> G# (1), G#->A (2), A->A# (3), A#->B (4) -> 4 semitones.\n\n            But in our mapping, G is 7 and B is 10. The difference is 3, but that's because the mapping is linear and the circle is modulo 12. \n\n            How many semitones from G (7) to B (10)? \n                We count the number of steps: \n                    Step0: G (7)\n                    Step1: G# (8) -> 1 semitone\n                    Step2: A (9) -> 2\n                    Step3: A# (10) -> 3\n                    Step4: B (11) -> 4\n\n            But wait, in our mapping, the note B is at index 10, but the note A# is at index 10? \n\n            Correction: the mapping I provided is:\n\n                'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11.\n\n            So B is 10 and A# is not present? \n\n            Wait, the problem says the 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n            So there is no A#. Instead, after A comes B, and then H (which is the seventh note of the chromatic scale, sometimes called B-flat or something?).\n\n            Actually, in some countries, H is used for B-flat. But in our problem, the note after A is B (which is the same as B in the key of C, but in the key of G, the third is B, which is the same as the second sharp in the key of G?).\n\n            Actually, the note B is the same as the second B in the chromatic scale. In the key of G, the notes are: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#. But wait, no: the key of G major: G, A, B, C#, D, E, F#. So the third of G is B.\n\n            However, the distance from G to B: \n                G -> G# (if we consider sharps) -> but wait, in the chromatic scale, the notes are:\n\n                C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, H? \n\n            Wait, the problem states: 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n            So there is no A#. Then how do we represent an A#? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H.\" and the list is fixed.\n\n            But wait, the example input: \"C# B F\" and \"A B H\", so we have B and H as distinct notes.\n\n            In standard music, B is the seventh note of the diatonic scale and H is the German/Bernhardt/Henley symbol for B-flat (or sometimes B double flat). \n\n            However, in our mapping, we have:\n\n                B -> 10\n                H -> 11\n\n            So in the example, the chord \"C# B F\": \n                C#:1, B:10, F:5.\n\n            And the ordering was B, C#, F: \n                From B(10) to C#(1): (1-10)%12 = -9%12=3 -> 3 semitones. \n                From C#(1) to F(5): (5-1)%12=4 -> 4 semitones.\n\n            This is minor.\n\n            Now, let's check G major: G, B, D.\n\n            G:7, B:10, D:2.\n\n            The distances in the ordering (G, B, D): \n                (10-7)%12=3, (2-10)%12= (2-10) = -8 %12=4 -> so it would be minor by our condition.\n\n            But wait, in music, G major is a major chord. \n\n            Why the discrepancy?\n\n            Because the definition in the problem says: \n                Major: distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and from Y to Z is 3 semitones.\n\n            In our example, from G to B: 3 semitones (because our mapping says B is 10, and G is 7, and (10-7)=3). But wait, in reality, the interval from G to B is a major third, which is 4 semitones.\n\n            What's the issue? \n\n            The issue is that the mapping does not use sharps for all the accidentals. \n\n            In the problem's list, the note after D is D# (3), then E (4), then F (5), then F# (6), then G (7), then G# (8), then A (9), then B (10), then H (11).\n\n            So the note B (10) is the same as the diatonic B. \n\n            But in the key of G, the third is B, which is diatonic. \n\n            However, the distance from G to B: \n                G (7) to G# (8) is 1, to A (9) is 2, to A# (not present) -> wait, but the problem doesn't have A#. \n\n            Actually, the problem's list does not include A#. So the note between A and B is missing. \n\n            But wait, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n            So the note after A is B, and then H. \n\n            How many semitones from G to B? \n                We have to consider the entire circle.\n\n            Let me write the circle:\n\n                0: C\n                1: C#\n                2: D\n                3: D#\n                4: E\n                5: F\n                6: F#\n                7: G\n                8: G#\n                9: A\n                10: B\n                11: H\n\n            Now, from G (7) to B (10): \n                We can go: \n                  7 (G) -> 8 (G#) -> 9 (A) -> 10 (B): that's 3 steps, so 3 semitones.\n\n            But wait, that's 3 semitones from G to B? \n\n            However, in standard music theory, the distance from G to B is a major third, which is 4 semitones. \n\n            The problem's note list does not include A# (which is the enharmonic equivalent of Bb). \n\n            So in this system, the note B is the same as the note that is 3 semitones above G? \n\n            That means the problem's note system is not using the standard Western music theory? \n\n            Let me check the problem statement: \n                \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\"\n\n            And the example: \"the chord 'C E G' is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones.\"\n\n            In our mapping: \n                C:0, E:4 -> 4 semitones (correct: C->C#->D->D#->E: 4)\n                E:4, G:7 -> (7-4)=3 -> 3 semitones. \n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale. This allows us to perform arithmetic operations on the notes.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (orderings) to consider every possible sequence of the notes.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes (in semitones) using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale. Check if these distances match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n4. **Decision Making**: If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    mapping = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `notes_list` defines the 12 distinct musical notes in order. The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique integer from 0 to 11.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into three individual note names, which are then converted to their corresponding integers using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: The `permutations` function from the `itertools` module generates all possible orderings of the three input notes. Each permutation is a tuple of three integers representing the notes' positions in the chromatic scale.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic. This ensures that the distances wrap around correctly if the notes cross the boundary between H and C.\n5. **Condition Checking**: The distances are checked against the criteria for major and minor chords. If a major chord condition is met, `found_major` is set to `True`. Similarly, a minor chord condition sets `found_minor` to `True`.\n6. **Output Decision**: Based on the flags `found_major` and `found_minor`, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met. The problem guarantees that no chord is both major and minor, so only one flag will be set if a valid chord is found.",
