    "thought": "\n We are to remove exactly one element from the array and minimize the instability (max-min) of the resulting array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` with `n` elements. After removing one element, we have an array of `n-1` elements.\n\n The instability is defined as (max element in the remaining array) - (min element in the remaining array).\n\n We note that the instability of the entire array is determined by the maximum and minimum values.\n\n However, when we remove one element, we might remove either the current maximum, the current minimum, or an element in between.\n\n Since we can only remove one element, the best candidate removals are those that might help reduce the overall range.\n\n Consider: \n   Let `min_val = min(a)` and `max_val = max(a)`.\n\n If we remove the minimum element, then the new array's minimum becomes the next smallest value (which is the second smallest). Similarly, if we remove the maximum, the new array's maximum becomes the next largest (second largest). Alternatively, if we remove an element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum, then the minimum and maximum of the entire array remain the same, so the instability remains `max_val - min_val`.\n\n Therefore, the candidate solutions are:\n   1. Remove the minimum -> instability = max_val - (the next smallest value after min_val)\n   2. Remove the maximum -> instability = (the next largest value before max_val) - min_val\n\n But note: there might be multiple occurrences of the minimum and maximum.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the global min and max.\n 2. Also, we need to know the next min and next max (if they exist) for the case where we remove one occurrence of the min or max.\n\n However, note: if we remove the min, the new min is the smallest value that is not removed. Similarly for the max.\n\n But what if the array has duplicates? Then even after removing one occurrence of the min, there might still be a min present (so the min doesn't change). So we need to consider:\n\n Let:\n   sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n Then, the instability without removal is `sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[0]`.\n\n Now, if we remove one element, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Remove an occurrence of the global min (if there is at least one). Then the new min might be the next distinct value? Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let's define:\n     Let `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` be the first and last index of the min and max? Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   We can also consider:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the first element (the min) -> then the new min is `a[1]`? But wait, what if there are duplicates? Then we need to know the next smallest value that is greater than the min.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let `b = sorted(a)`\n   Then, the instability if we remove an element at index i is:\n\n      instability_i = max(b[n-1], b[i+1]) - min(b[0], b[i-1])   ??? \n\n   But wait, we are removing one element, so the array becomes n-1 elements. However, note that the min and max of the entire array might change if we remove the current min or max.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Option A: Removing an element that is the global min -> then the new min is the next smallest distinct value? Not necessarily. We have to consider the next smallest value in the entire array that is not the global min.\n\n   Actually, the instability after removal is:\n        new_min = min_val if there is another min (i.e., count(min_val) > 1) else the next smallest value (which is the smallest value greater than min_val)\n        new_max = max_val (unless we remove the max, then it changes)\n\n   But wait, if we remove a min that is duplicated, then the min remains min_val. Similarly for max.\n\n   However, note: we are only removing one element. So:\n\n   We can consider two cases:\n\n   Case 1: The removed element is the global min (and note that if there are multiple mins, then the min remains the same unless we remove all of them, but we are only removing one).\n\n   Actually, we can compute:\n\n   Let:\n     candidate1 = max_val - (the smallest element that is >= min_val and not equal to min_val)   [if we remove one min and there are no other mins, then the new min is the next smallest]\n     But wait, if we remove one min and there are multiple mins, then the min is still min_val. So we cannot simply say \"remove one min\" leads to candidate1.\n\n   We need to know:\n\n   What is the next smallest value in the entire array? Similarly, the next largest?\n\n   We can precompute:\n\n     Let `min_after_remove_min` = the smallest value in the array if we remove one occurrence of the min? Actually, if we remove one min, then the new min is:\n        if there is at least one more min (i.e., the frequency of min_val is more than 1), then the min remains min_val.\n        else, the new min is the next smallest value (which is the smallest value strictly greater than min_val).\n\n   Similarly, for the max.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We don't have to remove a min or max necessarily. However, removing an element that is not the min or max won't change the min or max, so the instability remains `max_val - min_val`. Therefore, the minimal instability must be at most `max_val - min_val` (if we don't remove a min or max, we get the same, but maybe we can get lower by removing a min or max).\n\n   Actually, the minimal instability is the minimum among:\n\n     candidate1 = max_val - (min_val if there are at least two min_vals else the next smallest value)\n     candidate2 = (max_val if there are at least two max_vals else the next largest value) - min_val\n     candidate3 = max_val - min_val   [but note: we are allowed to remove an arbitrary element, so if we remove an element that is not min or max, we get the same as the original? Actually, yes. But wait: if we remove an element that is not min or max, then the min and max of the array remain the same, so the instability is the same as the original. However, we might have an option to remove an element that is min or max and get a lower instability, so we are looking for the minimum over these possibilities.]\n\n   However, note: the original instability is `max_val - min_val`. And we are allowed to remove one element. So the answer is the minimum of:\n\n     candidate1: remove one min (if available) -> instability = max_val - (new_min)\n     candidate2: remove one max (if available) -> instability = (new_max) - min_val\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is both min and max? (i.e., the array has all same elements) then both candidates become the same.\n\n   Example: [1,1,1] -> remove one 1, then the array is [1,1] -> instability 0.\n\n   However, note: the original instability was 0, and after removal we have 0. But our candidate1: \n        new_min = 1 (because there are two 1's left) -> instability = 1 - 1 = 0.\n        candidate2: same.\n\n   But also note: we can remove any element. In the case of all same, we don't have to remove a min or max specifically? Actually, we can remove any. But the result is the same.\n\n   However, there's a catch: we don't have to remove a min or max. But if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the instability is the same as the original. So in the example [1,3,3,7] (original instability 6), if we remove a 3, the instability is still 6 (because min=1, max=7). So we have to consider only removals that are min or max, because they can potentially reduce the instability.\n\n   But wait, let me check: \n        Original array: [1, 3, 3, 7] -> instability 6.\n        Removing the 1: [3,3,7] -> instability 4 (7-3=4).\n        Removing the 7: [1,3,3] -> instability 2 (3-1=2).\n        Removing a 3: [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n   So the minimal instability is 2.\n\n   So the candidates are:\n\n        candidate1: remove one occurrence of the min -> then the new array's min is the next smallest value (if we remove the only min) OR remains the same (if there are duplicates). Similarly for max.\n\n   How to compute the next smallest and next largest?\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Sort the array.\n\n        Then, the next smallest value (after min) is the smallest value in the array that is greater than min_val. But how to get that quickly?\n\n        Similarly, the next largest value is the largest value less than max_val.\n\n   However, we don't necessarily need the next distinct value. We need the minimum value in the array if we remove one occurrence of min_val. But if there are duplicates, then the min remains min_val. So:\n\n        Let sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n        Let min_val = sorted_a[0]\n        Let max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n\n        Count_min = number of min_val in the array.\n        Count_max = number of max_val in the array.\n\n        Then:\n\n        candidate1: \n            if Count_min > 1:\n                Then after removing one min, the min remains min_val, so the instability becomes max_val - min_val (same as original) but wait, no: because we removed one min, but the max is still max_val. However, note: the min might be the same, so the range is the same. But wait, we are trying to minimize the instability. Removing an element that is not affecting the min or max doesn't help.\n\n            Actually, if we remove one min and there are duplicates, then the min remains the same, so the instability is max_val - min_val.\n\n        But wait, that doesn't help. So we should only consider removing the min if there is no duplicate? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n        The goal is to minimize instability. \n\n        If we remove a min and there is another min, then the min doesn't change. Then the instability remains (max_val - min_val). \n\n        Similarly, if we remove a max and there is another max, the instability remains (max_val - min_val).\n\n        But if we remove a min and there isn't another min, then the min increases to the next smallest value (which is the next distinct value). Similarly for max.\n\n        Therefore, the two candidates are:\n\n          candidate1: \n            if there is at least one occurrence of min_val and at least one occurrence of the next smallest value (which is the smallest value greater than min_val) then we can consider removing one min (if there is only one min) and then the min becomes the next smallest.\n\n          candidate2: similarly for max.\n\n        However, note: we can also remove an element that is not the min or max and then the instability remains the same as the original. But that doesn't help if the original is already the minimum we can get? Actually, we are trying to minimize.\n\n        So the minimal instability we can get is:\n\n          candidate = min( \n            (max_val - min_val) if (Count_min > 1 and Count_max > 1) then this candidate doesn't help? Actually, we have to consider all possibilities.\n\n        Actually, we have three types of removals:\n\n          Type A: Remove an element that is not the min and not the max -> instability remains (max_val - min_val)\n\n          Type B: Remove one min (only one occurrence) -> then the new min is the next smallest value (let that be next_min) and the max remains max_val -> instability = max_val - next_min\n\n          Type C: Remove one max (only one occurrence) -> then the new max is the next largest value (next_max) and the min remains min_val -> instability = next_max - min_val\n\n        But wait, what if the array has multiple mins? Then Type B removal (removing one min) doesn't change the min, so the instability remains (max_val - min_val). Similarly for Type C.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider:\n\n          candidate1: if we remove one min and there is only one min, then candidate = max_val - next_min\n          candidate2: if we remove one min and there are multiple mins, then candidate = max_val - min_val   [but wait, we are allowed to remove any element. So we are comparing different removals. However, we are trying to find the minimal instability, so we want the minimum over all removals.\n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n          Possibility 1: Remove an element that is the global min (and there is exactly one min) -> then instability = max_val - next_min\n          Possibility 2: Remove an element that is the global min (and there are multiple mins) -> then instability = max_val - min_val\n          Possibility 3: Remove an element that is the global max (and there is exactly one max) -> then instability = next_max - min_val\n          Possibility 4: Remove an element that is the global max (and there are multiple maxes) -> then instability = max_val - min_val\n          Possibility 5: Remove an element that is neither -> then instability = max_val - min_val\n\n        But note: Possibility 1 and 3 might yield a lower instability than Possibility 2,4,5.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n\n          candidate_B = if the frequency of min_val == 1: max_val - next_min else None   [we will compare only the valid ones]\n          candidate_C = if the frequency of max_val == 1: next_max - min_val else None\n          candidate_default = max_val - min_val   [which is the same as Possibility 2,4,5]\n\n        However, we must consider that Possibility 2 and 4 are just the default, so we don't need to consider them separately because they are the same as candidate_default.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Let base_instability = max_val - min_val\n\n          candidate_remove_min = base_instability   # if we remove a min but there are duplicates, then base_instability remains.\n          if the first occurrence of min_val is the last occurrence (meaning only one min):\n              candidate_remove_min = max_val - sorted_a[1]   # because after removing the only min, the new min is the next element (which is the smallest non-min)\n\n          Similarly, candidate_remove_max = base_instability\n          if the last occurrence of max_val is the first occurrence (meaning only one max):\n              candidate_remove_max = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\n          Then, the answer is the minimum among base_instability, candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max?\n\n        But wait, base_instability is the same as candidate_remove_min (when there are duplicates) and candidate_remove_max (when there are duplicates). \n\n        However, note: base_instability is the instability if we remove an element that is not min or max, or if we remove a min that has duplicates (then the min remains) OR remove a max that has duplicates (then the max remains). \n\n        So the minimal instability is:\n\n            ans = min(base_instability, \n                     (max_val - sorted_a[1]) if (Count_min == 1) else base_instability, \n                     (sorted_a[-2] - min_val) if (Count_max == 1) else base_instability)\n\n        But wait, base_instability might be the same as the other candidates. We are taking the minimum.\n\n        Example: [1,3,3,7] \n          base_instability = 6\n          Count_min = 1 -> candidate_remove_min = 7 - sorted_a[1] = 7-3 = 4\n          Count_max = 1 -> candidate_remove_max = sorted_a[-2] - 1 = 3-1 = 2\n          Then ans = min(6,4,2) = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Another example: [1,1,2,3]\n          base_instability = 3-1 = 2\n          Count_min = 2 -> candidate_remove_min = base_instability (2)\n          Count_max = 1 -> candidate_remove_max = sorted_a[-2] - 1 = 2-1 = 1\n          Then ans = min(2, 2, 1) = 1.\n\n        Check: [1,1,2,3] -> remove the 3 (the only max) -> [1,1,2] -> instability 2-1=1. Correct.\n\n        Another example: [1,1,1] \n          base_instability = 0\n          Count_min = 3 -> candidate_remove_min = 0\n          Count_max = 3 -> candidate_remove_max = 0\n          Then ans = 0.\n\n        Another example: [1,2,3,4]\n          base_instability = 3\n          Count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 4 - sorted_a[1] = 4-2=2\n          Count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = sorted_a[-2]-1 = 3-1=2\n          Then ans = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n        But wait, let me check: [1,2,3,4] -> remove 1: [2,3,4] -> instability 2; remove 4: [1,2,3] -> instability 2; remove 2: [1,3,4] -> instability 3; remove 3: [1,2,4] -> instability 3. So the minimal is 2.\n\n        However, what if the array is [1,2,2,3]?\n          base_instability = 3-1=2\n          Count_min=1 -> candidate_remove_min = 3 - sorted_a[1] = 3-2=1\n          Count_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = sorted_a[-2]-1 = 2-1=1\n          Then ans = min(2,1,1)=1.\n\n        Check: [1,2,2,3] -> remove 1: [2,2,3] -> instability 1; remove 3: [1,2,2] -> instability 1; remove a 2: [1,2,3] -> instability 2. So the minimal is 1.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n\n          Step 2: \n            Let sorted_a = sorted(a)\n            min_val = sorted_a[0]\n            max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n\n          Step 3: Count the frequency of min_val and max_val? Actually, we can use:\n\n            Count_min = 1\n            Count_max = 1\n\n            # But we can also check by looking at the first and last runs.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            Count_min = 0\n            for x in a:\n                if x == min_val:\n                    Count_min += 1\n\n            Similarly for max_val.\n\n          However, we can use:\n\n            Count_min = len([x for x in a if x == min_val])\n            Count_max = len([x for x in a if x == max_val])\n\n          But note: n can be up to 10^5, and we have two passes, which is acceptable.\n\n          But we can also use:\n\n            Count_min = 0\n            Count_max = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == min_val:\n                    Count_min += 1\n                if num == max_val:\n                    Count_max += 1\n\n          Step 4: \n            candidate1 = base_instability   # if we remove a min that is duplicated, then instability remains base_instability.\n            candidate2 = base_instability    # same for max.\n\n            if Count_min == 1:\n                candidate1 = max_val - sorted_a[1]   # because sorted_a[1] is the next smallest (since the first element is min and there's only one)\n            if Count_max == 1:\n                candidate2 = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\n          Then answer = min(base_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        However, note: base_instability is the original range. And candidate1 and candidate2 are only defined when we remove the unique min or unique max.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has only two elements? \n\n          Example: [1,2] -> n=2.\n\n          base_instability = 1.\n\n          Count_min = 1 -> candidate1 = 2 - sorted_a[1] = 2-2=0? \n          But wait, sorted_a = [1,2] -> sorted_a[1]=2, so candidate1=2-2=0.\n\n          Count_max=1 -> candidate2 = sorted_a[-2] - 1 = 1-1=0.\n\n          Then answer = min(1,0,0)=0.\n\n          Check: [1,2] -> remove 1: [2] -> instability 0; remove 2: [1] -> instability 0. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,2]?\n\n          base_instability = 2-1=1.\n          Count_min=1 -> candidate1 = 2 - sorted_a[1] = 2-2=0.\n          Count_max=2 -> candidate2 = base_instability (1)\n\n          Then answer = min(1,0,1)=0.\n\n          Check: [1,2,2] -> remove 1: [2,2] -> instability 0. Correct.\n\n        But wait, in [1,2,2] the max is 2 and appears twice, so Count_max=2. Then candidate2 = base_instability (1). But we can remove a max (one of the 2's) and the array becomes [1,2] -> instability 1. However, we can also remove the min (the 1) and get [2,2] -> instability 0. So the candidate1 (removing the min) gives 0, and candidate2 (removing a max) gives 1. Then the minimum is 0.\n\n        However, note: our candidate1 is defined for removing the min, and candidate2 for removing the max. But in the case of [1,2,2], we are allowed to remove any element. So we must consider both possibilities.\n\n        But wait, our candidate1 is computed as 0, and candidate2 is 1, and base_instability is 1. Then we take the minimum.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, what if the array is [2,1,2] (same as [1,2,2])? \n\n        But note: sorted_a = [1,2,2]. The next smallest value after min is 2, which is correct.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We need to sort the array, then:\n\n          base_instability = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[0]\n\n          Count_min = number of times sorted_a[0] appears in the array.\n          Count_max = number of times sorted_a[-1] appears in the array.\n\n          candidate1 = base_instability\n          candidate2 = base_instability\n\n          if Count_min == 1:\n              candidate1 = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1]   # because the next smallest is at index1? But wait, if the array is [1,2,3,4] then sorted_a[1] is 2, and that is the next smallest.\n\n          However, what if the array has duplicates and the next smallest is not at index1? \n\n          Example: [1,1,2,3] -> sorted_a=[1,1,2,3]. \n          Here, Count_min=2, so we don't use candidate1 from removal of min (because we have duplicates). But if we had [1,2,2,3] then Count_min=1, so candidate1 = 3 - sorted_a[1] = 3-2=1.\n\n          But wait, in [1,2,2,3], the next smallest after 1 is 2. But the array is [1,2,2,3] and sorted_a[1] is 2. That is correct.\n\n          However, what if the array is [1,3,5,7] (all distinct)? Then Count_min=1, so candidate1 = 7 - 3 = 4, candidate2 = 5-1=4, base_instability=6, then answer=4.\n\n          But wait, in [1,3,5,7]: \n            Removing 1: [3,5,7] -> instability 4.\n            Removing 7: [1,3,5] -> instability 4.\n            Removing 3: [1,5,7] -> instability 6.\n            Removing 5: [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n          So the minimal is 4.\n\n        So the code:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          sorted_a = sorted(a)\n          min_val = sorted_a[0]\n          max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n          base_instability = max_val - min_val\n\n          # Count min and max\n          count_min = 0\n          count_max = 0\n          for num in a:\n              if num == min_val:\n                  count_min += 1\n              if num == max_val:\n                  count_max += 1\n\n          candidate1 = base_instability\n          candidate2 = base_instability\n\n          if count_min == 1:\n              # Then the next smallest value is sorted_a[1] (since the first element is the only min)\n              candidate1 = max_val - sorted_a[1]\n\n          if count_max == 1:\n              candidate2 = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\n          ans = min(base_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n          print(ans)\n\n        However, wait: what if the array has length 1? But the problem states n>=2.\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: Input \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n            sorted_a = [1,3,3,7]\n            base_instability = 6\n            count_min = 1 -> candidate1 = 7 - sorted_a[1] = 7-3=4\n            count_max = 1 -> candidate2 = sorted_a[-2] - 1 = 3-1=2\n            ans = min(6,4,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n          Example 2: Input \"2\\n1 100000\"\n            sorted_a = [1,100000]\n            base_instability = 99999\n            count_min=1 -> candidate1=100000 - sorted_a[1] = 100000-100000=0\n            count_max=1 -> candidate2=sorted_a[-2]-1 = 1-1=0\n            ans=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,2,3,4] as above? \n          sorted_a = [1,2,3,4]\n          base_instability=3\n          count_min=1 -> candidate1=4-2=2\n          count_max=1 -> candidate2=3-1=2\n          ans=min(3,2,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n        One more: [1,1,2,3] (as above) -> \n          sorted_a=[1,1,2,3]\n          base_instability=2\n          count_min=2 -> candidate1 remains 2\n          count_max=1 -> candidate2= sorted_a[-2]-1 = 2-1=1\n          ans=min(2,2,1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, in [1,1,2,3] the max is 3 (only one occurrence). Then we can remove the 3 and the array becomes [1,1,2] -> instability 1. Correct.\n\n        However, note: in [1,1,2,3] we can also remove one of the 1's? Then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 2. So why is candidate1=2 (which is the base_instability) and candidate2=1, so the minimum is 1. Correct.\n\n        But wait, candidate1 is defined as base_instability (which is 2) when count_min>1. However, if we remove one min (one of the 1's) and there are duplicates, the min remains 1, so the instability is 3-1=2. So candidate1=2 is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we can remove exactly one element. We are considering removals of min and max. But what if we remove an element that is neither min nor max? Then the instability is base_instability. So the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n          candidate_remove_min (if applicable) and candidate_remove_max (if applicable) and base_instability.\n\n        But note: base_instability is the same as candidate_remove_min (if we remove a min with duplicates) and candidate_remove_max (if we remove a max with duplicates). So we don't need to consider base_instability separately because:\n\n          candidate_remove_min (if duplicates) = base_instability\n          candidate_remove_max (if duplicates) = base_instability\n\n        Then we are taking the minimum of base_instability, candidate_remove_min (if unique), candidate_remove_max (if unique). But base_instability is included in the candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max when duplicates exist.\n\n        However, we can simplify: \n\n          candidate_min_removal = base_instability\n          if count_min == 1:\n              candidate_min_removal = max_val - sorted_a[1]\n\n          candidate_max_removal = base_instability\n          if count_max == 1:\n              candidate_max_removal = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\n          Then the answer is min(candidate_min_removal, candidate_max_removal)\n\n        Because base_instability is already considered in the candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal (when duplicates exist, they are set to base_instability). And when they are unique, we set them to the new value.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither min nor max? Then the instability is base_instability. But note: base_instability is the same as candidate_min_removal (if duplicates) and candidate_max_removal (if duplicates). And if both min and max are unique, then candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal are set to lower values, so we take the minimum of those two.\n\n        Actually, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n          candidate_min_removal (if we remove a min, which may be the same as base_instability if duplicates) and candidate_max_removal (if we remove a max, which may be the same as base_instability if duplicates) and also base_instability (if we remove an element that is neither). But note: base_instability is always one of the candidates (because if we remove an element that is not min or max, we get base_instability, and if we remove a min with duplicates, we get base_instability, same for max). So we can just take the minimum of candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal.\n\n        However, consider: what if we remove an element that is neither min nor max, but the base_instability is higher than candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal? Then we don't need to consider base_instability because we are already getting a lower value by removing the min or max.\n\n        But wait, the problem is: we can choose any one element. So we must consider:\n\n          candidate_min_removal: the instability if we remove one min (if available)\n          candidate_max_removal: the instability if we remove one max (if available)\n          candidate_neither: base_instability\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum of candidate_min_removal, candidate_max_removal, and base_instability.\n\n        But note: base_instability is the same as candidate_min_removal (if duplicates) and candidate_max_removal (if duplicates). So we can just compute:\n\n          ans = min(candidate_min_removal, candidate_max_removal, base_instability)\n\n        But wait, if we have duplicates, then candidate_min_removal = base_instability, and candidate_max_removal = base_instability, so base_instability is already included. However, if we have no duplicates for min and max, then candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal are the two candidates and base_instability is the third.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          candidate_min_removal = base_instability\n          if count_min == 1:\n              candidate_min_removal = max_val - sorted_a[1]\n\n          candidate_max_removal = base_instability\n          if count_max == 1:\n              candidate_max_removal = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\n          ans = min(candidate_min_removal, candidate_max_removal)\n\n        Why? Because base_instability is included in candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal when duplicates exist. But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither min nor max? Then the instability is base_instability. However, note: if we remove an element that is neither, then the min and max remain the same. But base_instability is the same as the original. However, if we have duplicates, then candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal are set to base_instability (so the minimum is base_instability). And if we don't have duplicates, then we are comparing two values that are <= base_instability (because removing the min or max can only reduce the instability or leave it the same). \n\n        But wait, is candidate_min_removal (when min is unique) always <= base_instability? \n\n          base_instability = max_val - min_val\n          candidate_min_removal = max_val - sorted_a[1]\n\n          Since sorted_a[1] >= min_val, then candidate_min_removal <= base_instability.\n\n        Similarly, candidate_max_removal = sorted_a[-2] - min_val <= base_instability.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of candidate_min_removal and candidate_max_removal, because base_instability is the worst-case scenario (when we don't remove a min or max, or when we remove a min/max that is duplicated) and the two candidates are always <= base_instability.\n\n        However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4]? \n          candidate_min_removal = 4-2=2, candidate_max_removal=3-1=2, base_instability=3. Then min(2,2)=2, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,1,1,1] (all ones)? \n          Then base_instability=0, count_min=4 -> candidate_min_removal=0, count_max=4 -> candidate_max_removal=0, then answer=0.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          sorted_a = sorted(a)\n          min_val = sorted_a[0]\n          max_val = sorted_a[-1]\n          base_instability = max_val - min_val\n\n          # Count min and max\n          count_min = 0\n          count_max = 0\n          for num in a:\n              if num == min_val:\n                  count_min += 1\n              if num == max_val:\n                  count_max += 1\n\n          candidate_min_removal = base_instability\n          if count_min == 1:\n              candidate_min_removal = max_val - sorted_a[1]\n\n          candidate_max_removal = base_instability\n          if count_max == 1:\n              candidate_max_removal = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\n          ans = min(candidate_min_removal, candidate_max_removal)\n\n          print(ans)\n\n        Let me test with [1,2,3,4] -> 2, [1,3,3,7] -> 2, [1,1,2,3] -> 1, [1,100000] -> 0, [1,2,2,3] -> 0, [1,2] -> 0.\n\n        However, wait: [1,2,2,3] -> \n          sorted_a = [1,2,2,3]\n          base_instability = 2\n          count_min=1 -> candidate_min_removal = 3 - sorted_a[1] = 3-2=1\n          count_max=1 -> candidate_max_removal = sorted_a[-2] - 1 = 2-1=1\n          ans = min(1,1)=1.\n\n        But wait, in [1,2,2,3] we can remove the 1 and get [2,2,3] -> instability 1, or remove the 3 and get [1,2,2] -> instability 1, or remove a 2 and get [1,2,3] -> instability 2. So the minimal is 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example [1,2,2,3] has two 2's, so when we remove a 2,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially reduce the instability if the removed element is either the current minimum or maximum (especially if they are unique). If the removed element is neither the min nor the max, the instability remains unchanged. Therefore, the minimal instability will be the smallest value obtained by considering the removal of the unique minimum, the unique maximum, or any other element (which doesn't change the instability).\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If the array has a unique minimum, removing it will set the new minimum to the next smallest element, thus reducing the instability.\n   - Similarly, if the array has a unique maximum, removing it will set the new maximum to the next largest element, again reducing the instability.\n   - If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum or maximum, removing one instance won't change the min or max, so the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - First, sort the array to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - Calculate the base instability (original max - original min).\n   - Count the occurrences of the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - If the minimum occurs only once, compute the instability after its removal by subtracting the next smallest element from the original maximum.\n   - Similarly, if the maximum occurs only once, compute the instability after its removal by subtracting the original minimum from the next largest element.\n   - The answer is the minimum value among the base instability and the computed values from removing the unique min or max.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time.\n   - Counting the occurrences of min and max takes O(n) time.\n   - The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\nmin_val = sorted_a[0]\nmax_val = sorted_a[-1]\nbase_instability = max_val - min_val\n\ncount_min = sum(1 for num in a if num == min_val)\ncount_max = sum(1 for num in a if num == max_val)\n\ncandidate_min_removal = base_instability\nif count_min == 1:\n    candidate_min_removal = max_val - sorted_a[1]\n\ncandidate_max_removal = base_instability\nif count_max == 1:\n    candidate_max_removal = sorted_a[-2] - min_val\n\nans = min(candidate_min_removal, candidate_max_removal)\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting and Initial Values**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest (`min_val`) and largest (`max_val`) elements. The base instability is calculated as the difference between these two values.\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: The code counts how many times the minimum and maximum values appear in the array.\n4. **Candidate Instabilities**: \n   - If the minimum value occurs only once, the instability after removing it is computed by subtracting the next smallest element (from the sorted array) from the original maximum.\n   - Similarly, if the maximum value occurs only once, the instability after removing it is computed by subtracting the original minimum from the next largest element.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum value between the base instability and the two computed values from removing the unique min or max (if applicable).\n6. **Output**: The minimal instability value is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the relevant scenarios (removing unique min or max) to find the optimal solution.",
