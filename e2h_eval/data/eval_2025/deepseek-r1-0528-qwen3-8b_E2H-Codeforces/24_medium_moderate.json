She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r.\n\n The cursor starts at `pos` (which is between 1 and n) and there are n tabs.\n\n Operations allowed in one second:\n   - Move the cursor left: from current tab i to max(i-1, a), where a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs (initially 1, then as we close tabs, a increases).\n   - Move the cursor right: from current tab i to min(i+1, b), where b is the current maximum index of unclosed tabs (initially n, then decreases as we close tabs).\n   - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor: sets a to the current cursor's position (so the new minimum becomes the cursor's index). This operation does not move the cursor, but it changes the boundaries.\n   - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor: sets b to the current cursor's position.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.\"\n\n After closing some tabs, the boundaries a and b change. But note: the goal is to leave only the tabs from l to r.\n\n Observation:\n   We must close all tabs < l and all tabs > r.\n\n There are two types of closure: closing left and closing right.\n\n The idea:\n\n Case 1: If the entire range [l, r] is already the set of open tabs (i.e., the current open tabs are exactly [1, n] but we want [l, r] and if l==1 and r==n, then nothing is needed) then answer 0.\n\n Actually, note: initially all tabs are open. Then we close those outside [l, r]. So we need to close:\n   - All tabs with index < l (if any)\n   - All tabs with index > r (if any)\n\n But note: the problem doesn't require to keep the other tabs (like from 1 to l-1 and from r+1 to n) so we must close them.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can consider two main operations: closing left and closing right. Also, we can move the cursor arbitrarily (within the current boundaries) to set up for these closures.\n\n Let's define:\n   We need to close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r).\n\n We have two ways to close the left part: \n   Option 1: Move the cursor to a tab that is at least l (maybe even beyond) and then close the left part? Actually, when closing the left part, the operation closes all tabs to the left of the cursor. So to close the left part (all tabs < l), the cursor must be at a position >= l. Similarly, to close the right part (all tabs > r), the cursor must be at a position <= r.\n\n However, note: we can also do multiple moves and multiple closures. But the problem is asking for the minimum seconds.\n\n We can think of the following strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: \n   - First, close the left part. Then close the right part.\n   - Steps: \n        Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (or maybe even beyond? but note: we don't need to go beyond because closing left from a position >= l will close all < l). Then close the left part (which takes 1 second). Then move the cursor from `l` to `r` (if necessary) and then close the right part (1 second).\n\n   But wait: after closing the left part, the boundaries change: the minimum index becomes the cursor's position (if we closed left) and the maximum remains the same until we close the right. Then when we close the right part, we must be at a position <= r.\n\n Strategy 2:\n   - First, close the right part. Then close the left part.\n\n Strategy 3:\n   - Maybe we can close both without moving the cursor? For example, if the cursor is already in [l, r] and we are going to close both sides, but note: we cannot close both sides from the same position unless we are at the boundary. Actually, we can only close one side per operation.\n\n Another possibility: sometimes we don't need to move the cursor to the exact boundary. \n\n Example: \n   Input: \"6 3 2 4\"\n\n   Steps in the example: \n      shift the mouse to 2 -> 1 second (from 3 to 2: one move left)\n      close left: 1 second (now tabs [3,6] are open, so boundaries become a=2, b=6)\n      shift the mouse from 2 to 3: 1 second\n      shift from 3 to 4: 1 second\n      close right: 1 second\n\n   Total: 5 seconds.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do:\n      Move to 4 (right): 1 second (from 3 to 4)\n      Close right: 1 second (now tabs [3,4] remain? Actually, no: closing right from 4 would close [5,6] but leaves [3,4] and also the left part [1,2] is still open? But wait, we haven't closed the left part. Then we must close the left part from somewhere.\n\n   So we must close both parts. \n\n   After closing the right part (from 4), the boundaries become a=1, b=4. Then we can move to 2 (from 4: two moves left) and then close the left part. That would be: \n        Move from 3 to 4: 1\n        Close right: 1\n        Move from 4 to 2: 2 moves (because from 4->3->2: two moves)\n        Close left: 1\n        Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do:\n        Move from 3 to 2: 1\n        Close left: 1 -> now only tabs [2,6] are open (but we wanted [2,4], so we still need to close [5,6])\n        Then move from 2 to 4: 2 moves (2->3->4)\n        Close right: 1 -> total 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n   Or, maybe we can combine: \n        From 3, move to 2 (1 second), close left (1 second) -> then the cursor is at 2, and the boundaries are [2,6]. Then we can close the right part from 2? But closing right from 2 would close [3,6] which is too much (we want to leave [2,4]). So we must not do that.\n\n   So we have to make sure that when we close the right part, we are at a position <=4.\n\n Therefore, we must move the cursor to 4 (from 2) and then close the right.\n\n But note: the example solution says 5 seconds.\n\n However, the example input \"6 3 1 3\" gives 1 second.\n\n Why? \n   Input: 6 3 1 3\n   We start with cursor at 3. We need to leave [1,3]. The tabs 4,5,6 must be closed.\n\n   Operation: close all tabs to the right of the cursor (at 3) -> that will close [4,6]. Then we are done. So 1 second.\n\n   What about the left part? There's no left part to close (since l=1, so we don't need to close anything below 1). So only the right part.\n\n   Similarly, if we have to close the left part only, we can do one second.\n\n So the answer depends on whether we need to close the left part, the right part, or both.\n\n Let me break down:\n\n   Let left_needed = (l > 1)   [i.e., there are tabs to the left of l that need to be closed]\n   Let right_needed = (r < n)   [i.e., there are tabs to the right of r that need to be closed]\n\n   Then, we have three cases:\n\n   Case 1: Neither left nor right needed -> answer 0.\n\n   Case 2: Only one side is needed.\n\n        Subcase 2a: Only left needed (left_needed and not right_needed). Then we must move the cursor to l (or beyond? actually, we can just move to l, then close left). But note: the cursor might be already in the range [l, n] (since we don't need to close the right). \n\n            Steps: \n                If the cursor is already at a position >= l, then we can close the left part (1 second). \n                Otherwise, we need to move the cursor from `pos` to at least l (so that when we close the left part, we don't accidentally close too much). \n\n            However, note: if the cursor is to the right of l, then we can just move to l (if we are at a position greater than l, we can move left until we hit l). Then close the left (1 second). \n\n            But what if the cursor is to the left of l? Then we have to move to l (so we move right from `pos` to l, which is (l - pos) moves) and then close the left (1 second). \n\n            However, wait: if the cursor is to the left of l, then we are at a tab that is less than l, so we are in the part we want to close? But note: we are going to close the left part from a position that is >= l. So we must first move to l (which is to the right). \n\n            But note: the initial state has all tabs open. The cursor is at `pos`. We are going to leave [l, r] (which includes l and excludes the left part). So if `pos` is less than l, then we are in the part we must eventually close, but we can move to l (then we are safe) and then close the left.\n\n            Similarly, for the right part: if only the right part needs to be closed, then we must move the cursor to r (if it's not already there) and then close the right.\n\n            Therefore, for only left needed: \n                moves = abs(pos - l) + 1   (because we move from `pos` to `l` (abs(pos-l) moves) and then 1 second to close left.\n\n            But wait, what if we are already at a position >= l? Then we don't need to move to l necessarily. We can close the left from a position that is >= l. However, if we are at a position greater than l, we might not need to move to l? Actually, we can close the left from any position >= l. But if we are at a position p (>= l), then we can close the left (without moving) and that would close all tabs < l (which is what we want). \n\n            However, consider: what if the cursor is at a position greater than l? Then we don't need to move to l to close the left part. We can just close the left from the current position. \n\n            So:\n\n                For only left needed:\n                    If pos >= l: then we can close the left without moving (so 1 second).\n                    Else (pos < l): we need to move from pos to l (which is (l - pos) moves) and then 1 second to close left.\n\n                But wait: what if we don't need to go exactly to l? We just need to be at a position >= l. \n\n                However, if we are at a position p (>= l) we can close the left. So we don't necessarily have to go to l. We can stop at any position >= l.\n\n                But note: if the cursor is at a position p (>= l) but not necessarily l, then we can close the left. \n\n                Now, if we are already at a position >= l, we don't need to move at all (only the closure operation). \n\n                However, if we are at a position < l, we must move to at least l (so that we are at a position >= l) and then close.\n\n                So the steps for only left needed:\n\n                    if pos >= l:\n                        seconds = 1   (just close the left)\n                    else:\n                        seconds = (l - pos) + 1   (first move to l, then close)\n\n            Similarly, for only right needed:\n\n                    if pos <= r:\n                        seconds = 1\n                    else:\n                        seconds = (pos - r) + 1   (first move to r, then close)\n\n   Case 3: Both left and right are needed.\n\n        Then we must do both closures. However, we can choose the order and the path.\n\n        There are two orders: left then right, or right then left.\n\n        Let's consider:\n\n        Order 1: Left first, then Right.\n\n            Step 1: Move the cursor to l (if necessary) to close the left part. But note: after closing the left part, the boundaries change: the minimum index becomes the cursor's position (which we set to l). Then we need to move from l to r (if necessary) to close the right part.\n\n            However, after closing the left part, the boundaries become [l, b] (where b was originally n, then we might reduce the right part later). But note: we are going to close the right part from a position <= r. So we must be at a position <= r.\n\n            Steps for left then right:\n\n                Part A: Move from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` < l, then we move right; if `pos` > l, then we move left). The number of moves is |pos - l|.\n\n                Then, we close the left part (1 second). Now the boundaries are [l, n] (or [l, original_b] but since we haven't closed the right, the right boundary is still n).\n\n                Then, we must move from l to r. Since we are at l, and we need to get to r (which is >= l), we can move right by (r - l) steps.\n\n                Then, we close the right part (1 second).\n\n                Total: |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\n            But wait: what if we don't need to go all the way from l to r? Actually, to close the right part we must be at a position <= r. We can close the right part from any position <= r. So we don't necessarily have to go to r. We can stop at l (if l<=r) and then close the right? \n\n            However, note: if we are at l (and l <= r) then we are at a position <= r, so we can close the right part from l. \n\n            So actually, after closing the left part, we don't necessarily need to move from l to r. We can stay at l and then close the right part. \n\n            Therefore, the steps for left then right:\n\n                Move from `pos` to `l`: |pos - l| seconds.\n                Close left: 1 second.\n                Then, if we are at l (which is <= r) we can directly close the right part (without moving) if we are at a position <= r? \n\n            But wait: the condition for closing the right part is that the cursor must be at a position <= r. Since l <= r, we are good. So we don't need to move from l to r.\n\n            However, what if we are at l and we want to close the right part, but the current boundaries are [l, n] (because we closed the left) and we want to leave [l, r]. Then we can close the right part from l (closing [l+1, n]) and that would leave [l, n] but we want [l, r]. \n\n            But note: we cannot close the right part from l and then have [l, n] because the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" from l would close [l+1, ...] up to the current maximum (which is n). We don't want to leave [l, n] if r < n. So we must not close beyond r.\n\n            Actually, the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" from the current cursor position (which is l) will close all tabs from [l+1, current_max] (which is n). But we only want to leave [l, r]. So we must ensure that after closing the right part, the remaining tabs are [l, r]. \n\n            How can we avoid closing beyond r? \n\n            We cannot use the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" from l to leave [l, r] because that operation closes everything to the right of l (including from l+1 to r and beyond). Then we would leave [l] and the rest from l+1 to n would be closed, but we actually want to leave [l, r]. \n\n            This is a problem.\n\n            Therefore, we must not close the entire right part from l. We must close only the part beyond r.\n\n            But note: the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" does not allow partial closure. It closes everything to the right of the cursor.\n\n            So we must be at a position such that the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" will only remove the ones beyond r. \n\n            How can we do that? \n\n            We must be at a position i such that i <= r and then the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" will remove [i+1, b] (where b is the current maximum). But note: we have already closed the left part (so the current maximum is still n). Then we remove [i+1, n]. We want to leave [l, r]. \n\n            So if we are at i (<=r), then after closing the right part, the remaining tabs are [l, i] (from the left closure) and then we remove [i+1, n] so the final set is [l, i]. But we need [l, r]. Therefore, i must be at least r? \n\n            Actually, no. We want to leave [l, r]. We can only close the entire segment to the right. \n\n            Alternatively, we can consider: after closing the left part, we don't necessarily have to close the right part from the current position (l). We can move to r and then close the right part? But wait, if we are at r, then closing the right part from r would close [r+1, n] (if any) and leave [l, r] (because we've already closed the left part). \n\n            So the correct steps for left then right:\n\n                Step 1: Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (|pos-l| moves).\n                Step 2: Close left (1 second). Now the boundaries are [l, n].\n                Step 3: Move the cursor from `l` to `r` (r-l moves, because we are going right from l to r).\n                Step 4: Close right (1 second).\n\n                Total: |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\n            But wait, we could do:\n\n                Step 1: Move the cursor from `pos` to `r` (if we do right first) then close right, then move to `l` and close left.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Move from `pos` to a position that is between l and r (say x) and then close both sides? But note: we can only close one side per operation.\n\n            However, note: we must close the left part (all < l) and the right part (all > r). \n\n            But we can also consider: \n\n                We can close the right part from a position that is <= r, and then the left part from a position that is >= l.\n\n            In the two-step process (left then right) we must end up at a position <= r to close the right part. And we started from `pos`. \n\n            What if we do:\n\n                Option A: Left first then Right.\n\n                Option B: Right first then Left.\n\n            Option B (Right first then Left):\n\n                Step 1: Move from `pos` to `r` (|pos-r| moves, but note: if we are going to the right, we move from `pos` to `r`; if we are to the left, we move from `pos` to `r` (which is to the right, so if `pos`<r then we move right, if `pos`>r then we move left)).\n                Step 2: Close the right part (1 second). Now the boundaries are [1, r].\n                Step 3: Move from `r` to `l` (|r-l| moves? Actually, we are at `r` and we need to go to `l` (which is <= r). So we move left: (r-l) moves.\n                Step 4: Close the left part (1 second).\n\n                Total: |pos-r| + (r-l) + 2.\n\n            Now, we must choose the minimum of the two orders.\n\n            However, note: we might also consider that we don't necessarily have to go to the exact boundary? \n\n            Actually, we must go to the boundaries because:\n\n                To close the left part, we must be at a position >= l (so that we don't close the [l,?] part that we want to keep). But if we are at a position >= l, we can close the left part. Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a position <= r.\n\n            Therefore, we must be at a position >= l to close the left part, and at a position <= r to close the right part.\n\n            But note: we can do:\n\n                Option C: Move to a common point and then do two closures? \n\n            However, we cannot do two closures without being at the appropriate positions. \n\n            Actually, we must be at a position >= l for the left closure and <= r for the right closure. \n\n            But note: the two closures are independent. We can do:\n\n                Option D: \n                    Move from `pos` to a position x (which is between l and r) and then:\n                    - If x >= l, we can close the left part (if we haven't already) but wait, we might have already closed one side.\n\n            However, the problem is: we have to close the left part and the right part. We cannot skip one.\n\n            Another idea: \n\n                We can also consider that we might close one side without moving to the boundary if we are already in the appropriate half. \n\n            Let me compare the two orders:\n\n            Order 1 (Left then Right):\n                Steps: \n                    Move from `pos` to `l`: d1 = |pos-l|\n                    Close left: 1\n                    Move from `l` to `r`: d2 = r-l\n                    Close right: 1\n                    Total1 = d1 + d2 + 2\n\n            Order 2 (Right then Left):\n                Steps:\n                    Move from `pos` to `r`: d3 = |pos-r|\n                    Close right: 1\n                    Move from `r` to `l`: d4 = r-l   (because we are moving left from r to l: r-l moves)\n                    Close left: 1\n                    Total2 = d3 + d4 + 2\n\n            But wait, in Order 1, after closing the left part, we are at `l` and then we move to `r` (which is r-l moves). In Order 2, after closing the right part, we are at `r` and then we move to `l` (which is r-l moves). \n\n            However, note: the movement in Order 1 from `l` to `r` is (r-l) moves, and in Order 2 from `r` to `l` is (r-l) moves (same distance). \n\n            Therefore, the two totals are:\n\n                Total1 = |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2\n                Total2 = |pos-r| + (r-l) + 2\n\n            Then we take the minimum of Total1 and Total2.\n\n            But wait: is there a possibility that we can do better by not going to the boundaries?\n\n            Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\n            Then:\n\n                Order1: |5-3| + (8-3) + 2 = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9.\n                Order2: |5-8| + (8-3) + 2 = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10.\n\n            So we choose 9.\n\n            But let me simulate:\n\n            Order1 (Left then Right):\n\n                Start at 5.\n                Move left to 3: 2 moves (5->4->3)\n                Close left: now the boundaries are [3,10] (we close [1,2])\n                Then move from 3 to 8: 5 moves (3->4->5->6->7->8)\n                Close right: closes [9,10] -> done.\n\n                Total: 2+1+5+1 = 9.\n\n            Order2 (Right then Left):\n\n                Start at 5.\n                Move right to 8: 3 moves (5->6->7->8)\n                Close right: closes [9,10]\n                Then move from 8 to 3: 5 moves (8->7->6->5->4->3)\n                Close left: closes [1,2]\n\n                Total: 3+1+5+1 = 10.\n\n            So the above formula works.\n\n            However, note: we might also consider that after closing one side, the other closure might be done from a closer position? \n\n            But wait: in the above example, we did the entire movement. \n\n            Another possibility: \n\n                We can do:\n\n                Option E: \n                    Move to the closer boundary and then do the closure, then move to the other boundary and do the other closure.\n\n                But the two orders we considered are essentially these two possibilities.\n\n            However, there is another possibility: \n\n                What if we do:\n\n                    Move from `pos` to a point between l and r, then close one side, then move to the other boundary and close the other.\n\n                But note: we must be at a position >= l to close the left, and <= r to close the right.\n\n                So we must go to at least l to close the left, and at most r to close the right.\n\n            But wait: we don't necessarily have to go to the boundaries. We can close the left part from any position >= l. Similarly, the right part from any position <= r.\n\n            However, if we are at a position x (l <= x <= r) then we can close the left part (if we haven't already) and the right part (if we haven't already). But we cannot do two closures without moving between them? Actually, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Move from `pos` to a point x (within [l, r]).\n                Step 2: Close the left part (if we are at x, then we close [1, x-1] -> but note: we want to close [1, l-1] and leave [l, x] and then we still have to close the right part from x? But wait, we are at x (which is >= l) and we can close the left part. Then we have to close the right part from x (if x <= r) then we close [x+1, n]. But then the remaining tabs are [l, x] and [x+1, r] is still open? No, because we haven't closed the right part. \n\n            Actually, we must close the entire left and the entire right. \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Move from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is to the left of `l`, then we move to `l`; if `pos` is to the right, we can move to `l` or maybe we don't need to?).\n\n            But note: we must close the left part (all < l). So we must be at a position >= l to close the left part. Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a position <= r.\n\n            Therefore, we must at least be at a position in [l, r] to close both? Actually, no: we can close the left part from a position >= l (which may be beyond r? But if we are beyond r, then we are at a position > r, then we cannot close the right part from that position because we must be <= r. \n\n            Actually, we cannot close the right part from a position > r. Similarly, we cannot close the left part from a position < l.\n\n            So the plan is:\n\n                We must visit the set [l, r] (at least the boundaries) to perform the closures.\n\n            But note: the operations do not require being exactly at the boundary to close the entire segment. They require being at a position that is the boundary for the closure.\n\n            So the minimal steps for both closures are:\n\n                We must get to a position >= l (to close left) and a position <= r (to close right). \n\n                However, we can do:\n\n                    Option 1: Visit l and then r (in either order) and then close.\n\n                But we might also consider: \n\n                    We can close the left part from a position that is >= l (not necessarily l) and then the right part from a position that is <= r (not necessarily r). \n\n                However, we must also account for the fact that after closing one side, the boundaries change and we might have a shorter path for the next closure.\n\n            However, note: the problem constraints are small (n<=100). But we are trying to find an optimal solution.\n\n            After analysis, the two orders (left then right, and right then left) are the two natural orders.\n\n            But wait: what if we can interleave movements? \n\n            Actually, we can consider that we might move to a point between l and r and then do one closure, then move to the other boundary and do the other. \n\n            Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\n            What if we do:\n\n                Move from 5 to 3 (left) -> 2 moves, then close left (1) -> now at 3, boundaries [3,10].\n                Then, instead of moving all the way to 8, we can move from 3 to 5 (which is within [3,8])? But we don't need to do anything else until we close the right part. But we are at 5 (<=8) so we can close the right part from 5: that would close [6,10] and leave [3,5] (but we need [3,8]). \n\n            So that doesn't work.\n\n            Alternatively, we must close the entire right part (from 9 to 10) and leave [3,8]. \n\n            So we must be at a position <=8 to close the right part, but we must also ensure that we don't close too much of the desired part? Actually, the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" will close everything from [current_cursor+1, current_max]. We want to leave [3,8]. \n\n            So if we are at 5, then closing the right part from 5 will close [6,10] (which is acceptable because we want [3,8] and 6..10 are beyond 8). \n\n            But wait: we are at 5, and we close the right part: that removes [6,10] -> then the set becomes [3,5] (because we already closed the left part [1,2]). But we wanted [3,8]! \n\n            So we must not have closed the left part until we are ready to leave the entire left part. \n\n            Actually, the closure operations are irreversible and set the boundaries. \n\n            The key: we must close the left part (removing [1, l-1]) and the right part (removing [r+1, n]). \n\n            So we must remove two separate segments.\n\n            The operation for closing the left part removes everything to the left of the cursor (at that moment). Similarly for the right.\n\n            Therefore, we must:\n\n                Remove [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n            We can do this by:\n\n                Either:\n                  - Closing the left part from a position i (>= l) so that it removes [1, i-1] (which must include [1, l-1] and possibly more? But we don't mind if it removes more, because we are going to leave [l, r] anyway. However, if we remove more than [1, l-1] then we might remove some part we want? But we want to leave [l, r] so we don't want to remove [l, ...] except for the right part separately.\n\n            Actually, the closure operations remove everything to the left (or right) of the cursor at that time. So if we close the left part from a position i (>= l), then we remove [1, i-1]. But we only want to remove [1, l-1]. \n\n            Therefore, we must be at a position i such that i-1 == l-1? That is, i = l. Because if we are at i (>=l) then we remove [1, i-1]. We don't want to remove more than [1, l-1] because then we would remove [l, i-1] which we want to keep? \n\n            Wait, no: the desired set is [l, r]. So we must keep [l, r] and remove [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. \n\n            Therefore, when we close the left part, we must not remove any part of [l, r]. \n\n            How do we ensure that? \n\n            We must close the left part from a position that is exactly l? \n\n            Actually, if we are at a position i (>= l) and we close the left part, then we remove [1, i-1]. We want to remove [1, l-1]. So we must have i-1 = l-1, i.e., i = l. \n\n            Similarly, for the right part: we must be at a position j (<= r) and then we remove [j+1, n]. We want to remove [r+1, n]. So we must have j+1 = r+1, i.e., j = r.\n\n            Therefore, we must:\n\n                To close the left part, we must be exactly at l.\n                To close the right part, we must be exactly at r.\n\n            Then the two orders become:\n\n                Order1 (Left then Right):\n                    Step 1: Move from `pos` to `l`: |pos-l|\n                    Step 2: Close left (at l) -> removes [1, l-1]\n                    Step 3: Move from `l` to `r`: |l-r| (which is r-l, since l<=r)\n                    Step 4: Close right (at r) -> removes [r+1, n]\n\n                    Total1 = |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2\n\n                Order2 (Right then Left):\n                    Step 1: Move from `pos` to `r`: |pos-r|\n                    Step 2: Close right (at r) -> removes [r+1, n]\n                    Step 3: Move from `r` to `l`: (r-l) (because we move left from r to l)\n                    Step 4: Close left (at l) -> removes [1, l-1]\n\n                    Total2 = |pos-r| + (r-l) + 2\n\n            But note: what if the cursor is already at l or at r? Then the movement step is 0.\n\n            Example: Input \"6 3 2 4\" from the problem.\n\n                n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n                Then, we must close both sides.\n\n                Order1: \n                    Move from 3 to 2: |3-2|=1\n                    Close left (at 2) -> removes [1,1] (tab1)\n                    Move from 2 to 4: 2 moves (because 4-2=2)\n                    Close right (at 4) -> removes [5,6]\n\n                    Total1 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n                Order2:\n                    Move from 3 to 4: |3-4|=1\n                    Close right (at 4) -> removes [5,6]\n                    Move from 4 to 2: 2 moves (4->3->2)\n                    Close left (at 2) -> removes [1,1]\n\n                    Total2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n            This matches the example.\n\n            Now, consider the example \"6 3 1 3\": only right part needed.\n\n                We are at 3, and we must close the right part. We must be at r=3 to close the right part. Since we are already at 3, we can do:\n\n                    Step: Close right (1 second)\n\n                According to our formula for one side:\n\n                    Only right needed: \n                        if pos <= r (3<=3) -> then 1 second.\n\n            And for the example \"5 2 1 5\": nothing to do -> 0.\n\n            But wait: what if we have to close the left part and the right part, but the cursor is already at l and r? \n\n            Example: n=10,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The cursor starts at a given position, and each operation (moving the cursor or closing tabs) takes one second. The solution involves analyzing the initial conditions and determining the optimal sequence of operations to minimize the time required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (within current boundaries) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The key observation is that to close the left part (tabs < `l`), the cursor must be exactly at `l`. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs > `r`), the cursor must be exactly at `r`.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., `l = 1` and `r = n`), the answer is 0.\n   - If only the left part needs closing (`l > 1` and `r == n`), move the cursor to `l` and then close the left part.\n   - If only the right part needs closing (`r < n` and `l == 1`), move the cursor to `r` and then close the right part.\n   - If both parts need closing, consider two sequences: \n     - **Left then Right**: Move to `l`, close left, move to `r`, close right.\n     - **Right then Left**: Move to `r`, close right, move to `l`, close left.\n   - The optimal solution is the minimum time between these two sequences.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the initial conditions and applying the appropriate sequence of operations based on whether the left, right, or both parts need closing. The time calculation is straightforward once the sequence is determined.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n\n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    left_needed = (l_val > 1)\n    right_needed = (r_val < n)\n\n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        if pos >= l_val:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            print(l_val - pos + 1)\n        return\n\n    if right_needed and not left_needed:\n        if pos <= r_val:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            print(pos - r_val + 1)\n        return\n\n    total_left_then_right = abs(pos - l_val) + (r_val - l_val) + 2\n    total_right_then_left = abs(pos - r_val) + (r_val - l_val) + 2\n\n    print(min(total_left_then_right, total_right_then_left))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r], no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Single Side Closure**: \n   - For closing only the left part, if the cursor is already at or beyond `l`, it takes 1 second to close the left part. Otherwise, move the cursor to `l` and then close it.\n   - Similarly for the right part, if the cursor is at or before `r`, close the right part in 1 second; otherwise, move to `r` first.\n3. **Both Sides Closure**: Calculate the time for both sequences (left then right, and right then left). The optimal solution is the minimum time between these two sequences, which includes moving to the respective boundaries and performing the closures.\n4. **Output**: The solution efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the above checks and arithmetic calculations.",
