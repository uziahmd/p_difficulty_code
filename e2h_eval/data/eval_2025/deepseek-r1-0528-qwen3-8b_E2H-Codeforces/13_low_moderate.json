For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. We need to determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number in a 12-note circle. The notes are: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] (note: H is the same as B? Actually, wait: the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And the circle: ... C, then after H comes C again.\n\n But note: the example input includes \"A B H\", and the example output is 'strange'. Also, the example says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (if going from E up to C, which is actually wrapping around). However, the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\" — but then they say the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. This implies that we consider the circle and the distance is the smallest way? Actually, no: because the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap? Actually, wait: the example says \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". So the distance from E to C (if we go upwards) would be from E to F (1), F to F# (2), F# to G (3), G to G# (4), G# to A (5), A to A# (but wait, there's no A#? Actually, the list goes up to H. Let me check: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the next note after E is F, then F#, then G, then G#, then A, then B, then H, then C. So from E to C: \n   E -> F (1), F->F#(2), F#->G(3), G->G#(4), G#->A(5), A->B(6), B->H(7), H->C(8). So indeed 8 semitones.\n\n But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. So we have to consider all permutations of the three notes and see if we can arrange them in an order such that either:\n   Major: [a, b, c] with (b - a) % 12 = 4 and (c - b) % 12 = 3, then the entire span (c - a) % 12 = 7, but wait: actually the circle might wrap? However, note that the distances are measured from the lowest to the highest without wrapping? Or the condition is just about the semitones in the circle?\n\n Let me clarify: In a major triad, the intervals are 4 and 3 semitones (so the root to third is 4, third to fifth is 3). Then the entire chord spans 7 semitones. Similarly, minor: 3 and 4.\n\n However, the problem states: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" — and note that the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So we must arrange the three notes in ascending order (without wrapping) and then check the intervals?\n\n But wait: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's map the notes to numbers:\n\n Let's assign:\n   C: 0\n   C#: 1\n   D: 2\n   D#: 3\n   E: 4\n   F: 5\n   F#: 6\n   G: 7\n   G#: 8\n   A: 9\n   B: 10\n   H: 11   (because after H comes C, so H is the 11th note)\n\n Now, for \"C# B F\":\n   C#: 1, B: 10, F:5\n\n How to order? The problem says: we can order arbitrarily. But the condition requires consecutive intervals. However, the example orders them as \"B C# F\": which is 10, 1, 5. But wait, in the circle, we can wrap. Actually, the ordering should be by the circular order. But note",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither (classified as \"strange\"). The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if they can be ordered in a way that satisfies the conditions for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Handling Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. These notes are split and processed into their respective numerical values.\n3. **Checking Permutations**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the intervals between consecutive notes (when ordered circularly) match the criteria for a major or minor chord. Specifically:\n   - **Major Chord**: The interval between the first and second note is 4 semitones, and between the second and third note is 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor Chord**: The interval between the first and second note is 3 semitones, and between the second and third note is 4 semitones.\n4. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Since the musical scale is cyclic, we calculate distances modulo 12 to handle wrap-around cases (e.g., from E to C is 8 semitones because E(4) to C(0) is (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    note_to_number = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    numbers = []\n    for note in data:\n        num_list = note.split()\n        for n in num_list:\n            numbers.append(note_to_number[n])\n            \n    if len(numbers) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    a, b, c = numbers\n    \n    def get_distance(x, y):\n        d = (y - x) % 12\n        if d == 0:\n            d = 12\n        return d\n        \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    perms = [(a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a)]\n    \n    for x, y, z in perms:\n        d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        d3 = get_distance(z, x)\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and d3 == 9:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4 and d3 == 9:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_number` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale.\n2. **Input Processing**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their numerical equivalents.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function calculates the smallest distance between two notes in the cyclic scale, ensuring correct handling of wrap-around scenarios.\n4. **Permutation Check**: All six permutations of the three notes are checked to see if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor chord. The conditions involve specific interval sizes (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 for minor).\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met. The solution efficiently handles edge cases by considering all possible orderings of the notes.",
