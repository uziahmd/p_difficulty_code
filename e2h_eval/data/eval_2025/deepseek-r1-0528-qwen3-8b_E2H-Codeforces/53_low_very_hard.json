    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string of up to 100 characters (lower-case Latin letters). We need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Approach:\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can use a more straightforward method.\n\n Idea: \n We can iterate over all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, note that checking all substrings by storing them in a set and then checking lengths might be inefficient if done naively (but n=100 is small).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We'll consider all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n    - The maximum length of a substring that can appear at least twice is floor(n/2) because if we have two non-overlapping occurrences, the total length would be at least 2*L, but note: they can overlap. Actually, the maximum length L must satisfy that there are at least two starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that the substring of length L starting at i and the substring of length L starting at j are the same. However, note that even with overlapping, the entire substring of length L must appear at two different positions (possibly overlapping). The condition for overlapping is that the two occurrences can start as close as one apart (so the substring can be of length L and we can have two consecutive occurrences). But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", so we can have more than two.\n\n However, we can also think: what is the maximum L? It cannot exceed the length of the string. But actually, if we have two occurrences, they must be two distinct starting indices, and the substring of length L starting at i must equal the substring of length L starting at j (with i < j). The condition for the existence is that the substring of length L must appear at least twice.\n\n Alternate approach:\n  We can iterate from the maximum possible substring length (which is n-1, but then we want two non-overlapping? Actually, they can overlap so maximum L is such that there exists two starting indices i and j (with i <= j - L) so that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]. \n\n But note: the problem does not require non-overlapping. So we can have two overlapping occurrences.\n\n Example: \"aaa\" -> the substring \"aa\" appears twice (starting at index0 and index1). So the answer for \"aaa\" is 2.\n\n However, note that the entire string \"aaa\" is 3, but we cannot use the whole string because then we only have one occurrence (if we take the whole string, then we have only one substring of length 3). But wait: the problem says \"at least twice\". So we need two occurrences. In \"aaa\", the substring \"a\" appears three times, \"aa\" appears two times, and \"aaa\" appears once.\n\n So the answer for \"aaa\" is 2.\n\n How about \"ababa\": \n   Substrings of length 3: \n      \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2 -> so length 3 is valid.\n      \"bab\" appears at index1 and index3? Actually, index1: \"bab\", index3: \"ba\" (if we try length 3 from index3: out of bounds? no, because the string is \"ababa\", so from index3: substring of length 3 would be \"aba\" (if we take three from index3: 'aba'? Actually, from index3: 'aba' is the substring from index2 to index4? Let me break it down:\n\n      Actually, the substring starting at index0: \"aba\"\n      substring starting at index2: \"aba\"\n\n      Also, the substring \"aba\" is found at two positions (overlapping).\n\n      Similarly, \"bab\" is found only once? \n        index1: \"bab\"\n        Then we look for another \"bab\": \n          index1: \"bab\"\n          index3: \"ba\" (not enough) and index0: \"aba\", index2: \"aba\", index4: nothing.\n\n      So \"bab\" only appears once.\n\n      Therefore, the answer for \"ababa\" is 3.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can do:\n\n  Let n = len(s)\n  We want to check from L = min(n, ...) down to 1.\n\n  But note: the maximum L we can have is floor((n)/?) Actually, we can have two overlapping occurrences: the second occurrence must start at an index at least 1 (so the first occurrence ends at index i+L-1, and the next occurrence starts at i+1). Then the second occurrence must end at i+1+L-1 = i+L. The condition is that the entire substring of length L must be contained in the string from i+1. So we require",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means they can share some characters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that occurs at least two times. The key observation here is that overlapping occurrences are allowed, which simplifies the problem compared to non-overlapping cases.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the input string from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each possible substring length, we check if there exists at least one substring of that length that appears more than once in the string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a nested loop approach where the outer loop determines the substring length, and the inner loops check for duplicates. If a duplicate substring is found for a particular length, we immediately return that length as the result since we are checking from the longest possible substring down.\n4. **Optimization**: By checking from the longest possible substring length downwards, we can optimize the solution to return the first valid length found, ensuring efficiency without needing to check all possible lengths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    # Check from the maximum possible substring length (n-1) down to 1\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Checks**: The length of the string is determined, and we start checking for substrings from the longest possible length (which is `n-1` because a substring of length `n` cannot appear twice unless the string has duplicates, but even then, it's only one occurrence).\n3. **Substring Search**: For each possible substring length `L`, we iterate through the string, extracting all substrings of length `L`. Each substring is checked against a dictionary (`seen`) to see if it has been encountered before. If a duplicate is found, the length `L` is printed, and the program exits.\n4. **Result Output**: If no duplicate substrings are found for any length, the program outputs `0`, indicating that no such substring exists in the input string.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid length, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
