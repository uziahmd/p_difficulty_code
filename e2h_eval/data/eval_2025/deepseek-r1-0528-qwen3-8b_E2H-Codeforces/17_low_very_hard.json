He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and then `2*n-2` strings. There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1 (so for each length L in [1, n-1], there are two strings). One of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n We are guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n The problem: assign each given string to either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that:\n   - There are exactly n-1 'P's and n-1 'S's (so the string of length 2n-2 has n-1 'P's and n-1 'S's).\n   - There exists at least one string s of length n that has the assigned prefixes and suffixes.\n\n However, note: multiple assignments may be acceptable as long as there is at least one string s of length n that matches.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation: The entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with some string of length n.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that the full string s has length n. Then, for example, the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1 must be the first and last character of s, respectively.\n\n 2. We also have for example, the prefix of length 2 and the suffix of length 2. The prefix of length 2 must equal the first two characters, and the suffix of length 2 must equal the last two.\n\n 3. But note: the input gives two strings for each length. We don't know which is which.\n\n However, we are guaranteed that the set is from a string of length n. Also, we can use the following idea:\n\n Since the entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent, we can try to determine the ordering of the string by matching the given strings.\n\n Alternate idea: \n\n Let the string be s[0..n-1]. Then, for length L, the prefix is s[0:L] and the suffix is s[n-L:n].\n\n Now, consider two strings of the same length: one candidate prefix and one candidate suffix. They might overlap? Actually, they are independent except for the entire string.\n\n But note: the entire string must be consistent. For example, if we have a prefix of length 2 and a suffix of length 2, then the entire string must be of the form ab...ba (if the prefix is \"ab\" and the suffix is \"ba\"). Then the middle part must connect.\n\n However, we are not required to reconstruct the entire string, only to assign labels (P or S) to the given 2n-2 strings.\n\n Important: There are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n How to break the problem?\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Let A be the list of all given strings (with their length). We know that the set of prefixes must be the ones that start at index0, and the set of suffixes must end at index n-1.\n\n But note: we cannot arbitrarily assign because the overlapping parts must match.\n\n Example: n=5, the example input: \n     5\n     ba\n     a\n     abab\n     a\n     aba\n     baba\n     ab\n     aba\n\n Actually, the input has two strings for each length from 1 to 4. The example says the only string is \"ababa\".\n\n So, let's list the given strings by length:\n\n Length 1: ['ba', 'a', 'a'] -> wait, wait, actually the input has two strings of length 1, two of length 2, etc. But the example input is provided as:\n\n     5\n     ba\n     a\n     abab\n     a\n     aba\n     baba\n     ab\n     aba\n\n This doesn't look like two of each length? Let me count:\n\n     Line 1: 'ba' -> length 2\n     Line 2: 'a' -> length 1\n     Line 3: 'abab' -> length 4\n     Line 4: 'a' -> length 1 (so two strings of length 1 so far)\n     Line 5: 'aba' -> length 3\n     Line 6: 'baba' -> length 4 (so two of length 4: 'abab' and 'baba')\n     Line 7: 'ab' -> length 2 (so two of length 2: 'ba' and 'ab')\n     Line 8: 'aba' -> length 3 (so two of length 3: 'aba' and ??? Actually, wait: the two of length 3 are 'aba' and 'aba'? That would be two same ones? But the problem says: \"each of them is the string of length from 1 to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string in the input is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their lengths to assign labels ('P' for prefix or 'S' for suffix) such that the entire set of labeled strings can be derived from some string of length `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we first group all input strings by their lengths.\n2. **Identify Prefixes and Suffixes**: For each length `L` (from 1 to `n-1`), we have two strings. One of these must be a prefix, and the other a suffix. To decide which is which, we compare the strings with potential overlaps:\n   - For prefixes of length `L` and suffixes of length `L`, check if the prefix string matches the first `L` characters of the suffix string or vice versa. This helps in determining the correct assignment based on consistency across different lengths.\n3. **Assign Labels**: Once we determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for each length, we assign 'P' to prefixes and 'S' to suffixes in the order they appear in the input.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    strings = data[1:1+2*n-2]\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        L = len(s)\n        if L not in groups:\n            groups[L] = []\n        groups[L].append(s)\n    \n    result_chars = []\n    for L in range(1, n):\n        arr = groups[L]\n        if len(arr) != 2:\n            continue\n        \n        s1, s2 = arr\n        found_prefix = None\n        found_suffix = None\n        \n        # Check if one of them is prefix and the other suffix\n        if L < n-1:\n            # We can check against longer strings? Actually, we can use the next available length if necessary.\n            # But note: the problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string of length n.\n            # Let's try to see if s1 can be part of a longer prefix/suffix?\n            pass\n        \n        # Alternative approach: Check if s1 is a prefix candidate and s2 is a suffix candidate by comparing with the full string constraints.\n        # However, since we don't know the full string, we can look for consistency between different lengths.\n        \n        # Instead, we can use the following idea: \n        # For two strings of the same length, if one is a prefix and the other a suffix, then the entire string must be consistent.\n        # But we can also consider: for a prefix of length L, the next character (if any) must match the corresponding character in the suffix of length L+1.\n        # However, we don't have the full string, so we need another way.\n        \n        # Actually, we can use the fact that the entire string must be consistent. Consider: \n        # Let the full string be s[0:n]. Then, the prefix of length L is s[0:L], and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n        # Now, if we have two strings of length L, say A and B, and we assume A is the prefix, then for the next length (L+1), the prefix of length L+1 must start with A + some character. Similarly, the suffix of length L+1 must end with that same character.\n        # But we don't have the next length's strings yet. Instead, we can use the following observation:\n        # The prefix of length L must match the beginning of the suffix of length L+1 (if it exists) at the overlapping part. Similarly, the suffix of length L must match the end of the prefix of length L+1.\n        #\n        # However, since the problem does not require reconstructing the full string but only labeling, we can use a greedy approach:\n        # For each length L, we choose one string as prefix and the other as suffix. Then, we check if this choice is consistent with the choices for adjacent lengths.\n        #\n        # But note: the problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\" So we can choose arbitrarily as long as there's at least one valid string.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n        # Compare the two strings of length L. If one string is a prefix of the other (or vice versa), then the shorter one must be the prefix (or suffix). But note: the strings are of the same length, so they cannot be prefixes of each other unless they are identical. However, the problem states that there are exactly two strings per length, so they might be identical? Actually, the example input has duplicates (like two 'a's of length 1). So we need to handle duplicates.\n        #\n        # Let's re-read the problem: \"each of them is the string of length from 1 to n-1 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters\". And \"It is guaranteed that there are exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\". So duplicates are allowed.\n        #\n        # We can try to use the following: For a given length L, if the two strings are different, then one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. If they are the same, then both could be either, but then we must ensure consistency with other lengths.\n        #\n        # However, the problem guarantees that the strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n. So even if two strings of the same length are identical, they could be both prefixes, but then the string would have two identical prefixes of different lengths? That doesn't make sense. Actually, the problem states that there are exactly two strings per length, but they can be duplicates.\n        #\n        # Another idea: For each length L, consider the two strings. The correct assignment is the one where the prefix string matches the beginning of the suffix string of length L+1 (if L < n-1) and the suffix string matches the end of the prefix string of length L+1. But we don't know the assignments for L+1 yet.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can process from the smallest length to the largest. For the smallest length (L=1), we can arbitrarily choose one as prefix and the other as suffix, but we must ensure consistency. However, the problem allows any valid assignment.\n        #\n        # Since the problem is guaranteed to have a solution, we can use the following simpler method:\n        # For each length L, we check the two strings against the next length's strings (if L < n-1). Specifically, for each string of length L, we check if it appears as the starting part of any string of length L+1 (for prefix) or ending part (for suffix). But note: the next length strings are also two, and they might be assigned as prefix or suffix.\n        #\n        # Actually, let's think differently: The entire string of length n is fixed. Therefore, the prefix of length L must equal the first L characters of the full string, and the suffix of length L must equal the last L characters. The full string must be consistent with all these conditions.\n        #\n        # We can try to determine the full string by combining the information from different lengths. For example, the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1 must be the first and last characters of the full string. Then, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character, and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character. By matching these, we can build the full string.\n        #\n        # However, we are not required to find the full string, only to label the input strings. Therefore, we can use the following greedy approach:\n        #   For each length L from 1 to n-1:\n        #       Let the two strings be A and B.\n        #       Check if one of them is a prefix of the other (in the context of the full string) by using the next length's strings if available.\n        #   But note: the next length strings might not directly help because they are of different length.\n        #\n        # After careful thought, here's a simpler method that works due to the problem constraints:\n        #   For each length L, if the two strings are different, then one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. We can choose the one that appears more frequently in the context of the next length as a prefix/suffix? Not sure.\n        #\n        # Another observation: The problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string of length n. Therefore, the prefix of length L must match the first L characters of the suffix of length L+1 (if L < n-1) in the appropriate positions. Specifically, the first L characters of the suffix of length L+1 should equal the prefix of length L. Similarly, the last L characters of the prefix of length L+1 should equal the suffix of length L.\n        #\n        # Since we don't know the assignments for the next length, we can use the following: \n        #   For length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n        #   For each string (say A) of length L, check if there exists a string of length L+1 (which is already labeled) such that the first L characters of that string (if it's a prefix) equals A, or the last L characters (if it's a suffix) equals A. But we haven't labeled them yet.\n        #\n        # We need to label all lengths simultaneously. Here's a better idea:\n        #   Start from the smallest length (L=1) and go up to L=n-1.\n        #   For each length L, we have two strings. We need to decide which is prefix and which is suffix.\n        #   Consider: The prefix of length L must be the first L characters of the full string. The suffix of length L must be the last L characters. The full string must be consistent with the next length's prefix and suffix.\n        #   Specifically, the next length (L+1) will have a prefix and a suffix. The prefix of length L+1 must start with the prefix of length L followed by one character, and the suffix of length L+1 must end with one character followed by the suffix of length L.\n        #   Therefore, if we know the assignment for length L, we can check the next length's strings against it.\n        #\n        # But we don't know the next length's assignment. However, we can use the following: \n        #   For length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n        #   Suppose we tentatively assign A as prefix and B as suffix.\n        #   Then, for the next length (L+1), the prefix of length L+1 must start with A + some char, and the suffix of length L+1 must end with some char + B.\n        #   Now, look at the strings of length L+1: they are two strings, say C and D.\n        #   If one of them starts with A and the other ends with B, then our assignment for length L is consistent.\n        #   If not, then swap the assignment for length L.\n        #\n        # However, we don't know the next length's assignment either. So we need to do this for all lengths together.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can use a recursive or iterative method, but given the constraints (n <= 100), we can try a simpler approach:\n        #   We know that the full string s[0:n] must satisfy:\n        #       prefix_L = s[0:L]\n        #       suffix_L = s[n-L:n]\n        #   Also, for any L, the prefix of length L must match the first L characters of the full string, and the suffix of length L must match the last L characters.\n        #   Moreover, the full string can be built by combining the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k, ensuring that the overlapping parts match.\n        #\n        # But note: the problem does not require us to find the full string, only to label the input strings. Therefore, we can use the following heuristic:\n        #   For each length L, if one of the two strings is a prefix of the other (when considering the full string) then the shorter one must be the prefix/suffix. But again, they are of the same length.\n        #\n        # After reading the problem statement again, I notice that the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings, and they are the proper prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n. The key insight is that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with some string s of length n. \n        #\n        # Here's a practical approach:\n        #   Since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose the assignment that maximizes consistency. However, the problem is small (n<=100, but the number of strings is 2n-2 <= 198), so we can try to determine the full string first.\n        #\n        # Steps to determine the full string:\n        #   Let s be the unknown string of length n.\n        #   The prefixes are s[0:k] for k in [1, n-1].\n        #   The suffixes are s[n-k:n] for k in [1, n-1].\n        #   The input provides two strings for each k in [1, n-1]. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n        #\n        #   We can try to build s by aligning the given strings. For example:\n        #       The first character must be the first character of the length-1 prefix.\n        #       The second character must be the second character of the length-1 prefix and also the second character of the length-2 prefix (if it exists) and so on.\n        #\n        #   However, without knowing which is prefix and which is suffix, we need to guess.\n        #\n        # Another idea from known similar problems (e.g., CodeForces problems) is to use the following:\n        #   For each length L, we have two strings. We can check if one string is a prefix of the other (but they are same length, so no). Instead, we can check if one string appears as a substring in the other (again, same length, so no).\n        #\n        # Given the complexity, let's look for a pattern in the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n     Input: n=5, strings = ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n     Output: 'SPPSPSPS'\n\n     The full string is \"ababa\".\n\n     Let's break down the input strings by length:\n        Length 1: ['a', 'a'] -> both 'a'\n        Length 2: ['ba', 'ab']\n        Length 3: ['aba', 'aba'] -> both 'aba'\n        Length 4: ['abab', 'baba']\n\n     How was the output determined?\n        The output is a string of 8 characters (since 2*5-2=8): 'SPPSPSPS'\n        The first string 'ba' is labeled 'S' (suffix), the next 'a' is labeled 'P' (prefix), then 'abab' is 'P', 'a' is 'S', 'aba' is 'P', 'baba' is 'S', 'ab' is 'P', and the last 'aba' is 'S'.\n\n     So the assignments are:\n        'ba' -> suffix (correct: the suffix of length 2 of \"ababa\" is \"aba\", not \"ba\"? Wait, \"ababa\" has suffixes of length 2: \"ba\" and \"ab\" (last two). Actually, the suffixes of \"ababa\" are:\n            length 1: \"a\"\n            length 2: \"ba\"\n            length 3: \"aba\"\n            length 4: \"baba\"\n\n        So indeed, 'ba' is the suffix of length 2.\n\n        Now, the two strings of length 1: both 'a'. In the full string \"ababa\", the prefix of length 1 is 'a' and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So both are valid. But in the input, we have two 'a's. We assigned one as 'P' and one as 'S'. \n\n        The output labels the two 'a's (length 1) as follows:\n            First 'a': labeled 'P'\n            Fourth 'a': labeled 'S'\n\n        Similarly, for length 3, both strings are 'aba'. The full string \"ababa\" has the prefix of length 3 as \"aba\" and the suffix of length 3 as \"aba\". So both are valid. The output assigns:\n            Fifth string 'aba': labeled 'P'\n            Eighth string 'aba': labeled 'S'\n\n        For length 4, we have 'abab' and 'baba'. The full string \"ababa\" has prefix of length 4: \"abab\" and suffix of length 4: \"baba\". So the output assigns:\n            Third string 'abab': labeled 'P'\n            Sixth string 'baba': labeled 'S'\n\n        And for length 2, we have 'ba' and 'ab'. The full string \"ababa\" has prefix of length 2: \"ab\" and suffix of length 2: \"ba\". So the output assigns:\n            First string 'ba': labeled 'S' (suffix)\n            Seventh string 'ab': labeled 'P' (prefix)\n\n     Observation: The assignment is done in the order of increasing length, and for each length, the two strings are labeled alternately starting with 'P' for the first occurrence? Not exactly, because for length 1, the first 'a' is labeled 'P' and the second 'a' (which is the fourth overall) is labeled 'S'. But note the order of input:\n\n        Input order:\n            5\n            ba\n            a\n            abab\n            a\n            aba\n            baba\n            ab\n            aba\n\n        The labels are: \n            ba -> S\n            a -> P\n            abab -> P\n            a -> S\n            aba -> P\n            baba -> S\n            ab -> P\n            aba -> S\n\n     Pattern: \n        For each length L, the two strings are labeled such that the first time we encounter a string of length L, we label it as 'P' if it is the prefix, otherwise 'S'. But wait, the two strings of length 1 are both 'a'. The first 'a' is labeled 'P', the second 'a' is labeled 'S'. Similarly, for length 3, the first 'aba' is labeled 'P', the second 'aba' is labeled 'S'. \n\n     But how do we know which is prefix and which is suffix for a given length? \n\n     Insight: The full string s must have the property that for each length L, the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix is s[n-L:n]. Now, consider two strings of length L: A and B. \n        - If A is the prefix, then the full string starts with A.\n        - If B is the suffix, then the full string ends with B.\n\n     The full string must also be consistent with the next length's prefix and suffix. Specifically, the next length L+1:\n        - The prefix of length L+1 is A + c (where c is the next character).\n        - The suffix of length L+1 is c + B (where c is the character before the suffix).\n\n     But note: the next length's strings are two strings, and one of them must start with A + c and the other must end with c + B.\n\n     Therefore, if we know A and B, we can check the next length's strings (if L < n-1) to see if there is a string that starts with A (for the prefix) and a string that ends with B (for the suffix). \n\n     Algorithm for length L (from 1 to n-1):\n        Let A and B be the two strings of length L.\n        If L == n-1 (the largest length we have), then we can arbitrarily assign one as prefix and the other as suffix (but we must ensure that the assignment is consistent with the full string, but the problem allows any valid assignment). However, we can use the following:\n\n        For L < n-1:\n            Look at the strings of length L+1. There are two strings, say X and Y.\n            One of these must be the prefix of length L+1, which should start with A if A is the prefix of length L, or with B if B is the prefix of length L.\n            Similarly, one of these must be the suffix of length L+1, which should end with A if A is the suffix of length L, or with B if B is the suffix of length L.\n\n        Therefore, we can try both possibilities for L and see which one leads to a consistent assignment for L+1. However, we are processing in increasing order, so we can assign for L and then for L+1.\n\n     But note: the problem does not require the full string to be reconstructed, only the labels. And the input order is arbitrary. \n\n     Revised plan:\n        We'll process lengths from 1 to n-1.\n        For each length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n        We'll try to assign A as prefix and B as suffix, and then check if this assignment is consistent with the next length (if L < n-1) by looking at the next length's strings. \n        Specifically, for the next length L+1, there are two strings: X and Y.\n        - If A is the prefix for length L, then one of the next length's strings must start with A (i.e., the prefix for L+1 must be A + some char).\n        - Similarly, if B is the suffix for length L, then one of the next length's strings must end with B (i.e., the suffix for L+1 must be some char + B).\n\n        But we don't know which string in the next length is the prefix and which is the suffix. However, we can count:\n            Let countA = number of next length strings that start with A\n            Let countB = number of next length strings that end with B\n\n        If countA >= 1 and countB >= 1, then the assignment (A as prefix, B as suffix) is potentially consistent for the next length.\n\n        Similarly, if we swap (A as suffix and B as prefix), then we require:\n            countA' = number of next length strings that start with B (for B as prefix)\n            countB' = number of next length strings that end with A (for A as suffix)\n        and if countA' >= 1 and countB' >= 1, then this assignment is also potentially consistent.\n\n        But note: the next length's strings might be used in multiple ways? Actually, each string of length L+1 is either a prefix or a suffix. So the total usage is two: one for prefix and one for suffix.\n\n        However, we are only interested in the current length's assignment consistency for the next length. \n\n        But note: the next length's assignment might affect the current one. Since we are processing in increasing order, we can make a decision for length L and then for length L+1.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the order of the input strings. We must output the labels in the order of the input strings.\n\n        Therefore, we need to remember the input order. \n\n        Steps:\n          1. Read all input strings and record their order.\n          2. Group them by length.\n          3. Process lengths from 1 to n-1, and for each length, decide the assignment for its two strings.\n\n        But how to check consistency for the next length? We need the next length's strings to have one that starts with the current prefix and one that ends with the current suffix.\n\n        However, we haven't decided the next length's assignment yet. But we can precompute for each length L+1:\n            Let next_group = groups[L+1] (two strings)\n            For each string in next_group, we can note:\n                It can be a prefix if it starts with some prefix from length L.\n                It can be a suffix if it ends with some suffix from length L.\n\n        But we are processing in increasing order, so for length L, we know the next length L+1 hasn't been processed yet. But we can look ahead.\n\n        Alternatively, we can process all lengths at once by checking the next length's strings for each current length.\n\n        Let's define for each length L (except the last) a condition:\n            Condition for (A as prefix, B as suffix) at length L is satisfied if:\n                There exists a string X in groups[L+1] such that X.startswith(A) and \n                There exists a string Y in groups[L+1] such that Y.endswith(B)\n\n            But note: X and Y must be distinct? They are two distinct strings (even if they are the same string, but there are exactly two strings, so they are the same only if duplicate, but then we have two identical strings, so we can use one for startswith and one for endswith if available).\n\n        However, if the two strings in groups[L+1] are the same, then we require that the string starts with A and ends with B.\n\n        But note: the full string must be consistent. The prefix of length L+1 must be A + c, and the suffix of length L+1 must be c + B. Therefore, the string of length L+1 that is the prefix must start with A, and the string that is the suffix must end with B.\n\n        Since there are two strings in groups[L+1], one must be the prefix and one must be the suffix. Therefore, we require that one of them starts with A and the other ends with B.\n\n        So the condition for (A as prefix, B as suffix) is:\n            There exists one string in groups[L+1] that starts with A, and the other string in groups[L+1] that ends with B.\n\n        Similarly, for (A as suffix, B as prefix):\n            There exists one string in groups[L+1] that starts with B, and the other string in groups[L+1] that ends with A.\n\n        Therefore, we can decide the assignment for length L by checking both possibilities against the next length's strings.\n\n        Steps for length L (from 1 to n-1):\n            Let A, B = groups[L]\n            Let next_group = groups.get(L+1, [])\n            But note: we are processing in increasing order, so next_group is defined for L+1 < n.\n\n            Option1: Assign A as prefix, B as suffix.\n                Check if:\n                    There exists a string X in next_group such that X.startswith(A)\n                    There exists a string Y in next_group such that Y.endswith(B)\n                Note: X and Y can be the same string? Only if A+B == X and X.endswith(B) is true. But if X is the same string, then we require X = A + c and X[-len(B):] = B. But len(A)=len(B)=L, and len(X)=L+1, so A + c must end with B. That means c must be chosen such that (A + c)[1:] == B? Actually, no: (A + c) is of length L+1, and B is of length L, so the last L characters of (A+c) must be B. But A is of length L, so (A+c) has first L characters A and last L characters: the last L characters of (A+c) is the substring of length L from index 1 to L+1. So we require that A[1:] + c == B? But B is of length L, and A is of length L, so A[1:] is of length L-1, and then adding c gives length L. So B must be A[1:] + c. This is automatically satisfied if c is chosen appropriately, but we don't know c.\n\n            Actually, the condition is independent: the next length's prefix must start with A (so the first L characters must be A) and the next length's suffix must end with B (so the last L characters must be B). These are two separate conditions and the next length's strings are two distinct strings (unless there are duplicates, but even then, they are two instances).\n\n            However, note: the next length's two strings are not necessarily distinct. But the condition requires that one string starts with A and the other ends with B. If there are two identical strings in next_group, then we need that string to start with A and end with B.\n\n            So the algorithm for length L (not the last) is:\n                Option1: (A as prefix, B as suffix)\n                    Let count1 = 0\n                    For each string in next_group:\n                        if string.startswith(A):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    Let count2 = 0\n                    For each string in next_group:\n                        if string.endswith(B):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    If count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1, then Option1 is potentially valid.\n\n                Option2: (A as suffix, B as prefix)\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for string in next_group:\n                        if string.startswith(B):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for string in next_group:\n                        if string.endswith(A):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    If count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1, then Option2 is potentially valid.\n\n                Then, if both are valid, we can choose either.\n                If only one is valid, choose that one.\n                If none is valid, then there is an error (but the problem guarantees a solution).\n\n            For the last length (L = n-1), there is no next length, so we can arbitrarily choose one as prefix and the other as suffix. But note: the problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string, so we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n        However, we must output the labels in the input order. So we need to remember the original order of the strings.\n\n        Implementation details:\n            - We'll read the input and keep a list of tuples (length, string, original_index)\n            - Then, group by length, but also remember the original index.\n            - Then, when assigning labels, we will output the label in the order of the original indices.\n\n        Steps:\n            1. Read n.\n            2. Read the next 2n-2 lines, keeping track of the original index (0-indexed in the input order).\n            3. Group by length, and for each length, sort the group by the original index? Or just store the original indices.\n\n        Alternatively, we can process the input without grouping by length, but then we'd have to find the two strings of the same length. \n\n        Let's do:\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            strings = data[1:1+2*n-2]\n\n            # Create a list for the original input order\n            indexed_strings = [(idx, s) for idx, s in enumerate(strings)]\n\n            # Group by length, but also store the index\n            groups = {}\n            for idx, s in indexed_strings:\n                L = len(s)\n                if L not in groups:\n                    groups[L] = []\n                groups[L].append((idx, s))\n\n            # Now, we want to output a string of length 2n-2: for each input string (in the original order), we output 'P' if it's a prefix, 'S' if it's a suffix.\n\n            # We'll create an array 'result' of size 2n-2, initially None for each position.\n\n            # Then, for each length L from 1 to n-1:\n            #   Let the two tuples (idx1, s1) and (idx2, s2) = groups[L]\n            #   Then, if L == n-1, we arbitrarily choose one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n            #   Else, we use the lookahead condition to choose.\n\n            # But note: the lookahead condition uses the next length's strings. We need to process lengths in increasing order.\n\n            # However, the next length might have duplicate strings. We need to be cautious.\n\n            # Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Edge: When n=2, then lengths are 1 only (since n-1=1). Then, we have two strings of length 1. We assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Example from the input: n=2, input strings = ['a','c'] (example input: ['2\\na\\nc']). The output should be 'PS' or 'SP'? The example output is 'PS'.\n\n        But the example input provided in the problem is:\n            Input: \n                2\n                a\n                c\n            Output:\n                PS\n\n        Why 'PS'? The full string could be \"ac\" or \"ca\". If we assign the first string 'a' as prefix and the second 'c' as suffix, then the full string must be \"ac\" (because the prefix is 'a' and suffix is 'c'). If we assign 'a' as suffix and 'c' as prefix, then the full string is \"ca\". Both are valid. The problem allows any. The example output is 'PS', meaning the first string is prefix and the second is suffix.\n\n        So for n=2, we can arbitrarily choose.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll iterate over lengths from 1 to n-1 in increasing order.\n\n            For each length L, we have two strings: s1 and s2.\n\n            If L < n-1:\n                Check Option1: (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix)\n                    next_group = groups.get(L+1, [])\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.startswith(s1):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.endswith(s2):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    valid_option1 = (count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1)\n\n                Check Option2: (s1 as suffix, s2 as prefix)\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.startswith(s2):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.endswith(s1):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    valid_option2 = (count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1)\n\n                Then, if both are valid, we can choose either. But to be consistent with the example, let's choose Option1 if the first string (by original order) comes first? Actually, we must output in the original order, so we need to remember which string is which.\n\n                However, the two strings in groups[L] are stored with their original indices. We should choose the option that is valid. If both are valid, it doesn't matter which one we choose because the problem allows any.\n\n                But note: the assignment for length L will affect the next length's condition. However, since we are only checking the next length's strings (and not the assignment for the next length), it might not be entirely accurate. But the problem guarantees a solution.\n\n            If L == n-1:\n                Choose arbitrarily: say assign the first string in groups[L] (by original index) as prefix and the second as suffix, or vice versa? But we must ensure that the assignment is valid for the full string. However, the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\n            However, there's a catch: the assignment for length L affects the next length's condition. But we are processing in increasing order, so for length L+1, we will use the assignment from length L to check its own condition. But what if the assignment for length L is made arbitrarily and then length L+1's condition fails? \n\n            Example: \n                n=3, so lengths 1 and 2.\n                Suppose at length 1, we arbitrarily choose Option1: s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix.\n                Then for length 2, we check: \n                    next_group is empty (since L+1=3 is beyond n-1), so we arbitrarily choose for length2.\n                But the assignment for length1 might be inconsistent with the full string.\n\n            However, the problem guarantees that there exists at least one string. Therefore, if we make a wrong choice at length1, the condition for length2 might fail, but there is still a valid assignment. \n\n            But note: the condition we check for length1 uses length2's strings. So if we choose the wrong assignment for length1, the condition for length1 might pass (if both options are valid) or fail. \n\n            Actually, the condition for length1 is: \n                Option1: there exists a string in length2 that starts with s1 and one that ends with s2.\n                Option2: there exists a string in length2 that starts with s2 and one that ends with s1.\n\n            If both are valid, then both assignments are potentially valid for the full string. But if only one is valid, then that one is the only valid one.\n\n            However, the full string must be consistent with all lengths. Our condition only checks the next length. But the problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string, so if the next length's strings exist, then the assignment for length L must be such that the next length's assignment is also valid.\n\n            Therefore, we can use this condition for lengths less than n-1.\n\n            For the last length (n-1), we don't have a next length, so we arbitrarily choose.\n\n            But note: the last length's assignment must be consistent with the full string. However, the full string is not known, so we rely on the previous lengths.\n\n            Steps for the algorithm:\n\n                Let result = [None] * (2*n-2)\n                indexed_strings = list of (index, string)\n                groups = {L: [(index, string)] for each L}\n\n                For L in range(1, n):\n                    list_at_L = groups[L]   # list of (index, string)\n                    if L == n-1:\n                        # Arbitrary assignment: choose the first string as prefix and the second as suffix, but note: the two strings might be in any order in the input.\n                        # We'll take the two strings and assign the one with the smaller index as prefix?

We grouped by length, so:\n\n            L=1: [ (1, 'a'), (3, 'a') ]  -> indices 1 and 3 (0-indexed in the input list, but the input list is the 8 strings)\n            L=2: [ (0, 'ba'), (6, 'ab') ]\n            L=3: [ (4, 'aba'), (7, 'aba') ]\n            L=4: [ (2, 'abab'), (5, 'baba') ]\n\n        Processing L=1:\n            s1_str = 'a', s2_str = 'a' (both from indices 1 and 3)\n            next_group = groups[2] = [('0','ba'), ('6','ab')]\n\n            Option1: 'a' as prefix, 'a' as suffix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('a'): \n                    'ba' -> no\n                    'ab' -> no\n                Count1_1 = 0 -> invalid.\n\n            Option2: 'a' as suffix, 'a' as prefix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('a'):\n                    'ba' -> no\n                    'ab' -> no -> count1_2=0 -> invalid.\n\n            So fallback: assign arbitrarily. We sort by index: [ (1, 'a'), (3, 'a') ]\n            Assign index1 as 'P', index3 as 'S'. So result[1]='P', result[3]='S'\n\n        Processing L=2:\n            s1_str='ba', s2_str='ab'\n            next_group = groups[3] = [('4','aba'), ('7','aba')]\n\n            Option1: 'ba' as prefix, 'ab' as suffix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('ba'):\n                    'aba' -> starts with 'a'? no, 'ab'? no -> actually, 'aba' starts with 'a', not 'ba'. \n                    'aba' -> no.\n                Count1_1=0 -> invalid.\n\n            Option2: 'ba' as suffix, 'ab' as prefix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('ab'):\n                    'aba' -> yes, starts with 'ab'\n                    'aba' -> yes, starts with 'ab' -> count1_2=2\n                Check next_group for endswith('ba'):\n                    'aba' -> ends with 'a'? no, ends with 'ba'? no -> count2_2=0 -> invalid.\n\n            So fallback: assign arbitrarily. Sort by index: [('0','ba'), ('6','ab')] -> assign index0 as 'P', index6 as 'S'. But wait, the example output has 'ba' as 'S' and 'ab' as 'P'. \n\n            However, in the example output, the first string 'ba' is labeled 'S' and the seventh string 'ab' is labeled 'P'. \n\n            But our fallback assigned 'ba' as 'P' and 'ab' as 'S'. This is not matching the example output.\n\n            What's the issue? In the example, the full string is \"ababa\". The prefix of length 2 is \"ab\", and the suffix of length 2 is \"ba\". Therefore, 'ab' is prefix and 'ba' is suffix. \n\n            In our Option2 for L=2: \n                We checked: \n                    Option2: 'ba' as suffix, 'ab' as prefix.\n                The condition for prefix (startswith('ab')) passed, but the condition for suffix (endswith('ba')) failed. \n\n            Why did the condition for suffix fail? The next length (L=3) has two strings: 'aba' and 'aba'. Neither ends with 'ba'. \n\n            But wait, the suffix of length 3 is 'aba', which is not 'ba'. The condition for suffix of length 2 is that the next length's suffix must end with 'ba'. But the next length's suffix is of length 3, and it must end with 'ba'. Indeed, 'aba' ends with 'a' (last char) and 'ba' is two chars. \n\n            The condition we are checking is: for the next length (L+1=3), the suffix of length 3 must end with the current suffix (which is 'ba' in Option2). But the suffix of length 3 is 'aba', and 'aba' does not end with 'ba'. \n\n            However, the full string \"ababa\" has a suffix of length 3: \"aba\", which does not end with \"ba\". So why is Option2 valid? \n\n            Let me reexamine the condition:\n\n            Our condition for Option2 (at length L=2) is:\n                The next length (L+1=3) must have:\n                    One string that starts with the current prefix (which is 'ab') -> yes, 'aba' does start with 'ab'.\n                    One string that ends with the current suffix (which is 'ba') -> no.\n\n            But the full string \"ababa\" has a suffix of length 3: \"aba\", which does not end with \"ba\". \n\n            However, the suffix of length 2 is \"ba\", and the suffix of length 3 is \"aba\". These are consistent because the suffix of length 3 includes the suffix of length 2. \n\n            The condition we are using is not exactly matching. We are requiring that the next length's suffix ends with the current length's suffix. But the next length's suffix is of length L+1, and the current length's suffix is of length L. The condition should be that the next length's suffix (which is of length L+1) has the current length's suffix (of length L) as its last L characters. \n\n            In our example, the current length's suffix is 'ba' (L=2), and the next length's suffix is 'aba' (L+1=3). The last 2 characters of 'aba' are 'ba', which matches. \n\n            But our condition is checking if the next length's string ends with 'ba'. And 'aba' does end with 'ba' (the last two characters). \n\n            Let me verify: \n                'aba' ends with 'ba'? Yes, because 'aba'[-2:] is 'ba'.\n\n            So the condition should be: \n                For Option1: \n                    next_group must contain a string that starts with the current prefix (of length L) and a string that ends with the current suffix (of length L).\n\n            In the example for L=2, Option2:\n                'ab' is the prefix -> next_group must have a string that starts with 'ab' -> 'aba' does.\n                'ba' is the suffix -> next_group must have a string that ends with 'ba' -> 'aba' does (because 'aba'[-2:]=='ba').\n\n            But in our code, we are checking with `endswith` which for a string of length L+1 and a suffix of length L, we should check the last L characters. \n\n            The `str.endswith` method in Python checks if the string ends with the specified suffix. For example, 'aba'.endswith('ba') returns True.\n\n            So why did our code say count2_2=0? \n\n            In the code for Option2, we did:\n                count2_2 = 0\n                for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                    if s_next.endswith(s1_str):   # Here s1_str is 'ba' in Option2\n                        count2_2 += 1\n\n            For 'aba': 'aba'.endswith('ba') is True.\n\n            So count2_2 should be 2.\n\n            Let me re-run the condition for L=2, Option2 manually:\n\n                s1_str = 'ba' (suffix in Option2)\n                s2_str = 'ab' (prefix in Option2)\n\n                Option2: \n                    count1_2: number of strings in next_group that start with 'ab' -> both 'aba' and 'aba' start with 'ab' -> 2.\n                    count2_2: number of strings in next_group that end with 'ba' -> both 'aba' end with 'ba' -> 2.\n\n                So valid2 = (2>=1 and 2>=1) -> True.\n\n            Then, we would choose Option2, which assigns 'ab' as prefix and 'ba' as suffix. \n\n            In our code, we then do:\n                list_at_L_sorted = sorted([('0','ba'), ('6','ab')], key=lambda x: x[0]) \n                -> sorted by index: [ (0, 'ba'), (6, 'ab') ]\n\n                Then, assign index0 as 'S' and index6 as 'P'.\n\n            The example output has the first string 'ba' (index0) as 'S' and the seventh string 'ab' (index6) as 'P'. \n\n            This matches.\n\n        Example 2: n=3, input strings = ['a','aa','aa','a'] (example input: ['3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na'])\n\n        Group by length:\n            L=1: [ (0,'a'), (3,'a') ]\n            L=2: [ (1,'aa'), (2,'aa') ]\n\n        Processing L=1:\n            s1_str='a', s2_str='a'\n            next_group = groups[2] = [('1','aa'), ('2','aa')]\n\n            Option1: 'a' as prefix, 'a' as suffix.\n                next_group startswith('a'): both 'aa' start with 'a' -> count1_1=2\n                next_group endswith('a'): both 'aa' end with 'a' -> count2_1=2 -> valid1=True.\n\n            Option2: 'a' as suffix, 'a' as prefix -> same as Option1, valid2=True.\n\n            Then, we choose arbitrarily by sorting by index: [ (0,'a'), (3,'a') ]\n            Assign index0 as 'P', index3 as 'S'\n\n        Processing L=2:\n            s1_str='aa', s2_str='aa'\n            next_group = groups.get(3, []) -> None (since n=3, so L goes from 1 to 2)\n            Since L==n-1 (2==3-1), we arbitrarily assign the first string (index1) as 'P' and the second (index2) as 'S'\n\n            So the result for indices: \n                index0: 'P'\n                index1: 'P'\n                index2: 'S'\n                index3: 'S'\n\n            Output string: for indices 0,1,2,3: 'P','P','S','S' -> \"PPSS\"\n\n        But the example output is \"PPSS\" or any valid assignment. The example says: \"Answers 'SPSP', 'SSPP' and 'PSPS' are also acceptable\". \n\n        However, our output is \"PPSS\", which is acceptable.\n\n        Example 3: n=2, input strings = ['a','c'] (example input: ['2\\na\\nc'])\n        Group by length:\n            L=1: [ (0,'a'), (1,'c') ]\n\n        Processing L=1 (n-1=1, so last length):\n            Arbitrarily assign the first string (index0) as 'P' and the second (index1) as 'S'\n            Output: \"PS\"\n\n        All examples passed.\n\n        Note: The condition for the last length is handled separately, and for non-last lengths, we use the lookahead condition.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        One more thing: the input order. We are storing the original indices, and we are updating the result array at those indices. Then, we output the result array in the order of the input strings.\n\n        But note: the input strings are given in a specific order, and our result array is built for each index (0 to 2n-3). Then, we simply join the result array from index0 to index(2n-3) to get the output string.\n\n        However, the example input order for n=5 has 8 strings, and our result array is of length 8, and we output the characters in the order of the indices 0 to 7.\n\n        This matches the input order.\n\n        Code implementation:\n\n            We'll read the input.\n            We'll create an array `result` of length (2*n-2) with None.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n                n = int(data[0])\n                total_strings = 2*n - 2\n                strings = data[1:1+total_strings]\n\n                indexed_strings = [(i, s) for i, s in enumerate(strings)]\n                groups = {}\n                for idx, s in indexed_strings:\n                    L = len(s)\n                    if L not in groups:\n                        groups[L] = []\n                    groups[L].append((idx, s))\n\n                result = [None] * (2*n-2)\n\n                for L in range(1, n):\n                    if L not in groups or len(groups[L]) != 2:\n                        # According to the problem, there are exactly two strings per length, so this should not happen.\n                        continue\n\n                    list_at_L = groups[L]\n                    if L == n-1:\n                        # Last length\n                        list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        idx1, s1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                        idx2, s2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                        result[idx1] = 'P'\n                        result[idx2] = 'S'\n                    else:\n                        next_group = groups.get(L+1, [])\n                        s1_str, s2_str = [s for (idx, s) in list_at_L]  # extract the two strings without regard to order\n\n                        # Option1: s1_str is prefix, s2_str is suffix\n                        count1_1 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.startswith(s1_str):\n                                count1_1 += 1\n                        count2_1 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.endswith(s2_str):\n                                count2_1 += 1\n                        valid1 = (count1_1 >= 1 and count2_1 >= 1)\n\n                        # Option2: s1_str is suffix, s2_str is prefix\n                        count1_2 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.startswith(s2_str):\n                                count1_2 += 1\n                        count2_2 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.endswith(s1_str):\n                                count2_2 += 1\n                        valid2 = (count1_2 >= 1 and count2_2 >= 1)\n\n                        if valid1 and valid2:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'P'\n                            result[idx2] = 'S'\n                        elif valid1:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'P'\n                            result[idx2] = 'S'\n                        elif valid2:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'S'\n                            result[idx2] = 'P'\n                        else:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'P'\n                            result[idx2] = 'S'\n\n                # Now, we have result as a list of None and 'P'/'S' for each index in the input order.\n                # But note: some indices might still be None if we skipped due to missing groups.

Therefore, the output_string is the concatenation of the result for the first string, second string, etc.\n\n        This matches the required format.\n\n        Let's hope it works.\n\n        Note: The condition for the next length might be too strict if there are duplicate strings in the next length. But the condition counts occurrences, so if a string appears twice, it will be counted twice.\n\n        We'll submit and hope for the best.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the next length uses `startswith` and `endswith` which are string methods. These work correctly.\n\n        Final code:\n",

Consider: \n        # Let the full string be s[0:n]. Then, the prefix of length L is s[0:L], and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n        # Now, if we have two strings of length L, say A and B, and we assume A is the prefix, then for the next length (L+1), the prefix of length L+1 must start with A + some character. Similarly, the suffix of length L+1 must end with that same character.\n        # But we don't have the next length's strings yet. Instead, we can use the following observation:\n        # The prefix of length L must match the beginning of the suffix of length L+1 (if it exists) at the overlapping part. Similarly, the suffix of length L must match the end of the prefix of length L+1.\n        #\n        # However, since the problem does not require reconstructing the full string but only labeling, we can use a greedy approach:\n        # For each length L, we choose one string as prefix and the other as suffix. Then, we check if this choice is consistent with the choices for adjacent lengths.\n        #\n        # But note: the problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\" So we can choose arbitrarily as long as there's at least one valid string.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n        # Compare the two strings of length L. If one string is a prefix of the other (or vice versa), then the shorter one must be the prefix (or suffix). But note: the strings are of the same length, so they cannot be prefixes of each other unless they are identical. However, the problem states that there are exactly two strings per length, so they might be identical? Actually, the example input has duplicates (like two 'a's of length 1). So we need to handle duplicates.\n        #\n        # Let's re-read the problem: \"each of them is the string of length from 1 to n-1 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters\". And \"It is guaranteed that there are exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\". So duplicates are allowed.\n        #\n        # We can try to use the following: For a given length L, if the two strings are different, then one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. If they are the same, then both could be either, but then we must ensure consistency with other lengths.\n        #\n        # However, the problem guarantees that the strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n. So even if two strings of the same length are identical, they could be both prefixes, but then the string would have two identical prefixes of different lengths? That doesn't make sense. Actually, the problem states that there are exactly two strings per length, but they can be duplicates.\n        #\n        # Another idea: For each length L, consider the two strings. The correct assignment is the one where the prefix string matches the beginning of the suffix string of length L+1 (if L < n-1) and the suffix string matches the end of the prefix string of length L+1. But we don't know the assignments for L+1 yet.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can process from the smallest length to the largest. For the smallest length (L=1), we can arbitrarily choose one as prefix and the other as suffix, but we must ensure consistency. However, the problem allows any valid assignment.\n        #\n        # Since the problem is guaranteed to have a solution, we can use the following simpler method:\n        # For each length L, we check the two strings against the next length's strings (if L < n-1). Specifically, for each string of length L, we check if it appears as the starting part of any string of length L+1 (for prefix) or ending part (for suffix). But note: the next length strings are also two, and they might be assigned as prefix or suffix.\n        #\n        # Actually, let's think differently: The entire string of length n is fixed. Therefore, the prefix of length L must equal the first L characters of the full string, and the suffix of length L must equal the last L characters. The full string must be consistent with all these conditions.\n        #\n        # We can try to determine the full string by combining the information from different lengths. For example, the prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1 must be the first and last characters of the full string. Then, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character, and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character. By matching these, we can build the full string.\n        #\n        # However, we are not required to find the full string, only to label the input strings. Therefore, we can use the following greedy approach:\n        #   For each length L from 1 to n-1:\n        #       Let the two strings be A and B.\n        #       Check if one of them is a prefix of the other (in the context of the full string) by using the next length's strings if available.\n        #   But note: the next length strings might not directly help because they are of different length.\n        #\n        # After careful thought, here's a simpler method that works due to the problem constraints:\n        #   For each length L, if the two strings are different, then one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. We can choose the one that appears more frequently in the context of the next length as a prefix/suffix? Not sure.\n        #\n        # Another observation: The problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string of length n. Therefore, the prefix of length L must match the first L characters of the suffix of length L+1 (if L < n-1) in the appropriate positions. Specifically, the first L characters of the suffix of length L+1 should equal the prefix of length L. Similarly, the last L characters of the prefix of length L+1 should equal the suffix of length L.\n        #\n        # Since we don't know the assignments for the next length, we can use the following: \n        #   For length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n        #   For each string (say A) of length L, check if there exists a string of length L+1 (which is already labeled) such that the first L characters of that string (if it's a prefix) equals A, or the last L characters (if it's a suffix) equals A. But we haven't labeled them yet.\n        #\n        # We need to label all lengths simultaneously. Here's a better idea:\n        #   Start from the smallest length (L=1) and go up to L=n-1.\n        #   For each length L, we have two strings. We need to decide which is prefix and which is suffix.\n        #   Consider: The prefix of length L must be the first L characters of the full string. The suffix of length L must be the last L characters. The full string must be consistent with the next length's prefix and suffix.\n        #   Specifically, the next length (L+1) will have a prefix and a suffix. The prefix of length L+1 must start with the prefix of length L followed by one character, and the suffix of length L+1 must end with one character followed by the suffix of length L.\n        #   Therefore, if we know the assignment for length L, we can check the next length's strings against it.\n        #\n        # But we don't know the next length's assignment. However, we can use the following: \n        #   For length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n        #   Suppose we tentatively assign A as prefix and B as suffix.\n        #   Then, for the next length (L+1), the prefix of length L+1 must start with A + some char, and the suffix of length L+1 must end with some char + B.\n        #   Now, look at the strings of length L+1: they are two strings, say C and D.\n        #   If one of them starts with A and the other ends with B, then our assignment for length L is consistent.\n        #   If not, then swap the assignment for length L.\n        #\n        # However, we don't know the next length's assignment either. So we need to do this for all lengths together.\n        #\n        # Alternatively, we can use a recursive or iterative method, but given the constraints (n <= 100), we can try a simpler approach:\n        #   We know that the full string s[0:n] must satisfy:\n        #       prefix_L = s[0:L]\n        #       suffix_L = s[n-L:n]\n        #   Also, for any L, the prefix of length L must match the first L characters of the full string, and the suffix of length L must match the last L characters.\n        #   Moreover, the full string can be built by combining the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k, ensuring that the overlapping parts match.\n        #\n        # But note: the problem does not require us to find the full string, only to label the input strings. Therefore, we can use the following heuristic:\n        #   For each length L, if one of the two strings is a prefix of the other (when considering the full string) then the shorter one must be the prefix/suffix. But again, they are of the same length.\n        #\n        # After reading the problem statement again, I notice that the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings, and they are the proper prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n. The key insight is that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent with some string s of length n. \n        #\n        # Here's a practical approach:\n        #   Since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose the assignment that maximizes consistency. However, the problem is small (n<=100, but the number of strings is 2n-2 <= 198), so we can try to determine the full string first.\n        #\n        # Steps to determine the full string:\n        #   Let s be the unknown string of length n.\n        #   The prefixes are s[0:k] for k in [1, n-1].\n        #   The suffixes are s[n-k:n] for k in [1, n-1].\n        #   The input provides two strings for each k in [1, n-1]. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n        #\n        #   We can try to build s by aligning the given strings. For example:\n        #       The first character must be the first character of the length-1 prefix.\n        #       The second character must be the second character of the length-1 prefix and also the second character of the length-2 prefix (if it exists) and so on.\n        #\n        #   However, without knowing which is prefix and which is suffix, we need to guess.\n        #\n        # Another idea from known similar problems (e.g., CodeForces problems) is to use the following:\n        #   For each length L, we have two strings. We can check if one string is a prefix of the other (but they are same length, so no). Instead, we can check if one string appears as a substring in the other (again, same length, so no).\n        #\n        # Given the complexity, let's look for a pattern in the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n     Input: n=5, strings = ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n     Output: 'SPPSPSPS'\n\n     The full string is \"ababa\".\n\n     Let's break down the input strings by length:\n        Length 1: ['a', 'a'] -> both 'a'\n        Length 2: ['ba', 'ab']\n        Length 3: ['aba', 'aba'] -> both 'aba'\n        Length 4: ['abab', 'baba']\n\n     How was the output determined?\n        The output is a string of 8 characters (since 2*5-2=8): 'SPPSPSPS'\n        The first string 'ba' is labeled 'S' (suffix), the next 'a' is labeled 'P' (prefix), then 'abab' is 'P', 'a' is 'S', 'aba' is 'P', 'baba' is 'S', 'ab' is 'P', and the last 'aba' is 'S'.\n\n     So the assignments are:\n        'ba' -> suffix (correct: the suffix of length 2 of \"ababa\" is \"aba\", not \"ba\"? Wait, \"ababa\" has suffixes of length 2: \"ba\" and \"ab\" (last two). Actually, the suffixes of \"ababa\" are:\n            length 1: \"a\"\n            length 2: \"ba\"\n            length 3: \"aba\"\n            length 4: \"baba\"\n\n        So indeed, 'ba' is the suffix of length 2.\n\n        Now, the two strings of length 1: both 'a'. In the full string \"ababa\", the prefix of length 1 is 'a' and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So both are valid. But in the input, we have two 'a's. We assigned one as 'P' and one as 'S'. \n\n        The output labels the two 'a's (length 1) as follows:\n            First 'a': labeled 'P'\n            Fourth 'a': labeled 'S'\n\n        Similarly, for length 3, both strings are 'aba'. The full string \"ababa\" has the prefix of length 3 as \"aba\" and the suffix of length 3 as \"aba\". So both are valid. The output assigns:\n            Fifth string 'aba': labeled 'P'\n            Eighth string 'aba': labeled 'S'\n\n        For length 4, we have 'abab' and 'baba'. The full string \"ababa\" has prefix of length 4: \"abab\" and suffix of length 4: \"baba\". So the output assigns:\n            Third string 'abab': labeled 'P'\n            Sixth string 'baba': labeled 'S'\n\n        And for length 2, we have 'ba' and 'ab'. The full string \"ababa\" has prefix of length 2: \"ab\" and suffix of length 2: \"ba\". So the output assigns:\n            First string 'ba': labeled 'S' (suffix)\n            Seventh string 'ab': labeled 'P' (prefix)\n\n     Observation: The assignment is done in the order of increasing length, and for each length, the two strings are labeled alternately starting with 'P' for the first occurrence? Not exactly, because for length 1, the first 'a' is labeled 'P' and the second 'a' (which is the fourth overall) is labeled 'S'. But note the order of input:\n\n        Input order:\n            5\n            ba\n            a\n            abab\n            a\n            aba\n            baba\n            ab\n            aba\n\n        The labels are: \n            ba -> S\n            a -> P\n            abab -> P\n            a -> S\n            aba -> P\n            baba -> S\n            ab -> P\n            aba -> S\n\n     Pattern: \n        For each length L, the two strings are labeled such that the first time we encounter a string of length L, we label it as 'P' if it is the prefix, otherwise 'S'. But wait, the two strings of length 1 are both 'a'. The first 'a' is labeled 'P', the second 'a' is labeled 'S'. Similarly, for length 3, the first 'aba' is labeled 'P', the second 'aba' is labeled 'S'. \n\n     But how do we know which is prefix and which is suffix for a given length? \n\n     Insight: The full string s must have the property that for each length L, the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix is s[n-L:n]. Now, consider two strings of length L: A and B. \n        - If A is the prefix, then the full string starts with A.\n        - If B is the suffix, then the full string ends with B.\n\n     The full string must also be consistent with the next length's prefix and suffix. Specifically, the next length L+1:\n        - The prefix of length L+1 is A + c (where c is the next character).\n        - The suffix of length L+1 is c + B (where c is the character before the suffix).\n\n     But note: the next length's strings are two strings, and one of them must start with A + c and the other must end with c + B.\n\n     Therefore, if we know A and B, we can check the next length's strings (if L < n-1) to see if there is a string that starts with A (for the prefix) and a string that ends with B (for the suffix). \n\n     Algorithm for length L (from 1 to n-1):\n        Let A and B be the two strings of length L.\n        If L == n-1 (the largest length we have), then we can arbitrarily assign one as prefix and the other as suffix (but we must ensure that the assignment is consistent with the full string, but the problem allows any valid assignment). However, we can use the following:\n\n        For L < n-1:\n            Look at the strings of length L+1. There are two strings, say X and Y.\n            One of these must be the prefix of length L+1, which should start with A if A is the prefix of length L, or with B if B is the prefix of length L.\n            Similarly, one of these must be the suffix of length L+1, which should end with A if A is the suffix of length L, or with B if B is the suffix of length L.\n\n        Therefore, we can try both possibilities for L and see which one leads to a consistent assignment for L+1. However, we are processing in increasing order, so we can assign for L and then for L+1.\n\n     But note: the problem does not require the full string to be reconstructed, only the labels. And the input order is arbitrary. \n\n     Revised plan:\n        We'll process lengths from 1 to n-1.\n        For each length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n        We'll try to assign A as prefix and B as suffix, and then check if this assignment is consistent with the next length (if L < n-1) by looking at the next length's strings. \n        Specifically, for the next length L+1, there are two strings: X and Y.\n        - If A is the prefix for length L, then one of the next length's strings must start with A (i.e., the prefix for L+1 must be A + some char).\n        - Similarly, if B is the suffix for length L, then one of the next length's strings must end with B (i.e., the suffix for L+1 must be some char + B).\n\n        But we don't know which string in the next length is the prefix and which is the suffix. However, we can count:\n            Let countA = number of next length strings that start with A\n            Let countB = number of next length strings that end with B\n\n        If countA >= 1 and countB >= 1, then the assignment (A as prefix, B as suffix) is potentially consistent for the next length.\n\n        Similarly, if we swap (A as suffix and B as prefix), then we require:\n            countA' = number of next length strings that start with B (for B as prefix)\n            countB' = number of next length strings that end with A (for A as suffix)\n        and if countA' >= 1 and countB' >= 1, then this assignment is also potentially consistent.\n\n        But note: the next length's strings might be used in multiple ways? Actually, each string of length L+1 is either a prefix or a suffix. So the total usage is two: one for prefix and one for suffix.\n\n        However, we are only interested in the current length's assignment consistency for the next length. \n\n        But note: the next length's assignment might affect the current one. Since we are processing in increasing order, we can make a decision for length L and then for length L+1.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the order of the input strings. We must output the labels in the order of the input strings.\n\n        Therefore, we need to remember the input order. \n\n        Steps:\n          1. Read all input strings and record their order.\n          2. Group them by length.\n          3. Process lengths from 1 to n-1, and for each length, decide the assignment for its two strings.\n\n        But how to check consistency for the next length? We need the next length's strings to have one that starts with the current prefix and one that ends with the current suffix.\n\n        However, we haven't decided the next length's assignment yet. But we can precompute for each length L+1:\n            Let next_group = groups[L+1] (two strings)\n            For each string in next_group, we can note:\n                It can be a prefix if it starts with some prefix from length L.\n                It can be a suffix if it ends with some suffix from length L.\n\n        But we are processing in increasing order, so for length L, we know the next length L+1 hasn't been processed yet. But we can look ahead.\n\n        Alternatively, we can process all lengths at once by checking the next length's strings for each current length.\n\n        Let's define for each length L (except the last) a condition:\n            Condition for (A as prefix, B as suffix) at length L is satisfied if:\n                There exists a string X in groups[L+1] such that X.startswith(A) and \n                There exists a string Y in groups[L+1] such that Y.endswith(B)\n\n            But note: X and Y must be distinct? They are two distinct strings (even if they are the same string, but there are exactly two strings, so they are the same only if duplicate, but then we have two identical strings, so we can use one for startswith and one for endswith if available).\n\n        However, if the two strings in groups[L+1] are the same, then we require that the string starts with A and ends with B.\n\n        But note: the full string must be consistent. The prefix of length L+1 must be A + c, and the suffix of length L+1 must be c + B. Therefore, the string of length L+1 that is the prefix must start with A, and the string that is the suffix must end with B.\n\n        Since there are two strings in groups[L+1], one must be the prefix and one must be the suffix. Therefore, we require that one of them starts with A and the other ends with B.\n\n        So the condition for (A as prefix, B as suffix) is:\n            There exists one string in groups[L+1] that starts with A, and the other string in groups[L+1] that ends with B.\n\n        Similarly, for (A as suffix, B as prefix):\n            There exists one string in groups[L+1] that starts with B, and the other string in groups[L+1] that ends with A.\n\n        Therefore, we can decide the assignment for length L by checking both possibilities against the next length's strings.\n\n        Steps for length L (from 1 to n-1):\n            Let A, B = groups[L]\n            Let next_group = groups.get(L+1, [])\n            But note: we are processing in increasing order, so next_group is defined for L+1 < n.\n\n            Option1: Assign A as prefix, B as suffix.\n                Check if:\n                    There exists a string X in next_group such that X.startswith(A)\n                    There exists a string Y in next_group such that Y.endswith(B)\n                Note: X and Y can be the same string? Only if A+B == X and X.endswith(B) is true. But if X is the same string, then we require X = A + c and X[-len(B):] = B. But len(A)=len(B)=L, and len(X)=L+1, so A + c must end with B. That means c must be chosen such that (A + c)[1:] == B? Actually, no: (A + c) is of length L+1, and B is of length L, so the last L characters of (A+c) must be B. But A is of length L, so (A+c) has first L characters A and last L characters: the last L characters of (A+c) is the substring of length L from index 1 to L+1. So we require that A[1:] + c == B? But B is of length L, and A is of length L, so A[1:] is of length L-1, and then adding c gives length L. So B must be A[1:] + c. This is automatically satisfied if c is chosen appropriately, but we don't know c.\n\n            Actually, the condition is independent: the next length's prefix must start with A (so the first L characters must be A) and the next length's suffix must end with B (so the last L characters must be B). These are two separate conditions and the next length's strings are two distinct strings (unless there are duplicates, but even then, they are two instances).\n\n            However, note: the next length's two strings are not necessarily distinct. But the condition requires that one string starts with A and the other ends with B. If there are two identical strings in next_group, then we need that string to start with A and end with B.\n\n            So the algorithm for length L (not the last) is:\n                Option1: (A as prefix, B as suffix)\n                    Let count1 = 0\n                    For each string in next_group:\n                        if string.startswith(A):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    Let count2 = 0\n                    For each string in next_group:\n                        if string.endswith(B):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    If count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1, then Option1 is potentially valid.\n\n                Option2: (A as suffix, B as prefix)\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for string in next_group:\n                        if string.startswith(B):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for string in next_group:\n                        if string.endswith(A):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    If count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1, then Option2 is potentially valid.\n\n                Then, if both are valid, we can choose either.\n                If only one is valid, choose that one.\n                If none is valid, then there is an error (but the problem guarantees a solution).\n\n            For the last length (L = n-1), there is no next length, so we can arbitrarily choose one as prefix and the other as suffix. But note: the problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string, so we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n        However, we must output the labels in the input order. So we need to remember the original order of the strings.\n\n        Implementation details:\n            - We'll read the input and keep a list of tuples (length, string, original_index)\n            - Then, group by length, but also remember the original index.\n            - Then, when assigning labels, we will output the label in the order of the original indices.\n\n        Steps:\n            1. Read n.\n            2. Read the next 2n-2 lines, keeping track of the original index (0-indexed in the input order).\n            3. Group by length, and for each length, sort the group by the original index? Or just store the original indices.\n\n        Alternatively, we can process the input without grouping by length, but then we'd have to find the two strings of the same length. \n\n        Let's do:\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            strings = data[1:1+2*n-2]\n\n            # Create a list for the original input order\n            indexed_strings = [(idx, s) for idx, s in enumerate(strings)]\n\n            # Group by length, but also store the index\n            groups = {}\n            for idx, s in indexed_strings:\n                L = len(s)\n                if L not in groups:\n                    groups[L] = []\n                groups[L].append((idx, s))\n\n            # Now, we want to output a string of length 2n-2: for each input string (in the original order), we output 'P' if it's a prefix, 'S' if it's a suffix.\n\n            # We'll create an array 'result' of size 2n-2, initially None for each position.\n\n            # Then, for each length L from 1 to n-1:\n            #   Let the two tuples (idx1, s1) and (idx2, s2) = groups[L]\n            #   Then, if L == n-1, we arbitrarily choose one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n            #   Else, we use the lookahead condition to choose.\n\n            # But note: the lookahead condition uses the next length's strings. We need to process lengths in increasing order.\n\n            # However, the next length might have duplicate strings. We need to be cautious.\n\n            # Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Edge: When n=2, then lengths are 1 only (since n-1=1). Then, we have two strings of length 1. We assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Example from the input: n=2, input strings = ['a','c'] (example input: ['2\\na\\nc']). The output should be 'PS' or 'SP'? The example output is 'PS'.\n\n        But the example input provided in the problem is:\n            Input: \n                2\n                a\n                c\n            Output:\n                PS\n\n        Why 'PS'? The full string could be \"ac\" or \"ca\". If we assign the first string 'a' as prefix and the second 'c' as suffix, then the full string must be \"ac\" (because the prefix is 'a' and suffix is 'c'). If we assign 'a' as suffix and 'c' as prefix, then the full string is \"ca\". Both are valid. The problem allows any. The example output is 'PS', meaning the first string is prefix and the second is suffix.\n\n        So for n=2, we can arbitrarily choose.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll iterate over lengths from 1 to n-1 in increasing order.\n\n            For each length L, we have two strings: s1 and s2.\n\n            If L < n-1:\n                Check Option1: (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix)\n                    next_group = groups.get(L+1, [])\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.startswith(s1):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.endswith(s2):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    valid_option1 = (count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1)\n\n                Check Option2: (s1 as suffix, s2 as prefix)\n                    count1 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.startswith(s2):\n                            count1 += 1\n                    count2 = 0\n                    for (idx, s) in next_group:\n                        if s.endswith(s1):\n                            count2 += 1\n\n                    valid_option2 = (count1 >= 1 and count2 >= 1)\n\n                Then, if both are valid, we can choose either. But to be consistent with the example, let's choose Option1 if the first string (by original order) comes first? Actually, we must output in the original order, so we need to remember which string is which.\n\n                However, the two strings in groups[L] are stored with their original indices. We should choose the option that is valid. If both are valid, it doesn't matter which one we choose because the problem allows any.\n\n                But note: the assignment for length L will affect the next length's condition. However, since we are only checking the next length's strings (and not the assignment for the next length), it might not be entirely accurate. But the problem guarantees a solution.\n\n            If L == n-1:\n                Choose arbitrarily: say assign the first string in groups[L] (by original index) as prefix and the second as suffix, or vice versa? But we must ensure that the assignment is valid for the full string. However, the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\n            However, there's a catch: the assignment for length L affects the next length's condition. But we are processing in increasing order, so for length L+1, we will use the assignment from length L to check its own condition. But what if the assignment for length L is made arbitrarily and then length L+1's condition fails? \n\n            Example: \n                n=3, so lengths 1 and 2.\n                Suppose at length 1, we arbitrarily choose Option1: s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix.\n                Then for length 2, we check: \n                    next_group is empty (since L+1=3 is beyond n-1), so we arbitrarily choose for length2.\n                But the assignment for length1 might be inconsistent with the full string.\n\n            However, the problem guarantees that there exists at least one string. Therefore, if we make a wrong choice at length1, the condition for length2 might fail, but there is still a valid assignment. \n\n            But note: the condition we check for length1 uses length2's strings. So if we choose the wrong assignment for length1, the condition for length1 might pass (if both options are valid) or fail. \n\n            Actually, the condition for length1 is: \n                Option1: there exists a string in length2 that starts with s1 and one that ends with s2.\n                Option2: there exists a string in length2 that starts with s2 and one that ends with s1.\n\n            If both are valid, then both assignments are potentially valid for the full string. But if only one is valid, then that one is the only valid one.\n\n            However, the full string must be consistent with all lengths. Our condition only checks the next length. But the problem guarantees that the strings are from a valid string, so if the next length's strings exist, then the assignment for length L must be such that the next length's assignment is also valid.\n\n            Therefore, we can use this condition for lengths less than n-1.\n\n            For the last length (n-1), we don't have a next length, so we arbitrarily choose.\n\n            But note: the last length's assignment must be consistent with the full string. However, the full string is not known, so we rely on the previous lengths.\n\n            Steps for the algorithm:\n\n                Let result = [None] * (2*n-2)\n                indexed_strings = list of (index, string)\n                groups = {L: [(index, string)] for each L}\n\n                For L in range(1, n):\n                    list_at_L = groups[L]   # list of (index, string)\n                    if L == n-1:\n                        # Arbitrary assignment: choose the first string as prefix and the second as suffix, but note: the two strings might be in any order in the input.\n                        # We'll take the two strings and assign the one with the smaller index as prefix?

We grouped by length, so:\n\n            L=1: [ (1, 'a'), (3, 'a') ]  -> indices 1 and 3 (0-indexed in the input list, but the input list is the 8 strings)\n            L=2: [ (0, 'ba'), (6, 'ab') ]\n            L=3: [ (4, 'aba'), (7, 'aba') ]\n            L=4: [ (2, 'abab'), (5, 'baba') ]\n\n        Processing L=1:\n            s1_str = 'a', s2_str = 'a' (both from indices 1 and 3)\n            next_group = groups[2] = [('0','ba'), ('6','ab')]\n\n            Option1: 'a' as prefix, 'a' as suffix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('a'): \n                    'ba' -> no\n                    'ab' -> no\n                Count1_1 = 0 -> invalid.\n\n            Option2: 'a' as suffix, 'a' as prefix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('a'):\n                    'ba' -> no\n                    'ab' -> no -> count1_2=0 -> invalid.\n\n            So fallback: assign arbitrarily. We sort by index: [ (1, 'a'), (3, 'a') ]\n            Assign index1 as 'P', index3 as 'S'. So result[1]='P', result[3]='S'\n\n        Processing L=2:\n            s1_str='ba', s2_str='ab'\n            next_group = groups[3] = [('4','aba'), ('7','aba')]\n\n            Option1: 'ba' as prefix, 'ab' as suffix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('ba'):\n                    'aba' -> starts with 'a'? no, 'ab'? no -> actually, 'aba' starts with 'a', not 'ba'. \n                    'aba' -> no.\n                Count1_1=0 -> invalid.\n\n            Option2: 'ba' as suffix, 'ab' as prefix.\n                Check next_group for startswith('ab'):\n                    'aba' -> yes, starts with 'ab'\n                    'aba' -> yes, starts with 'ab' -> count1_2=2\n                Check next_group for endswith('ba'):\n                    'aba' -> ends with 'a'? no, ends with 'ba'? no -> count2_2=0 -> invalid.\n\n            So fallback: assign arbitrarily. Sort by index: [('0','ba'), ('6','ab')] -> assign index0 as 'P', index6 as 'S'. But wait, the example output has 'ba' as 'S' and 'ab' as 'P'. \n\n            However, in the example output, the first string 'ba' is labeled 'S' and the seventh string 'ab' is labeled 'P'. \n\n            But our fallback assigned 'ba' as 'P' and 'ab' as 'S'. This is not matching the example output.\n\n            What's the issue? In the example, the full string is \"ababa\". The prefix of length 2 is \"ab\", and the suffix of length 2 is \"ba\". Therefore, 'ab' is prefix and 'ba' is suffix. \n\n            In our Option2 for L=2: \n                We checked: \n                    Option2: 'ba' as suffix, 'ab' as prefix.\n                The condition for prefix (startswith('ab')) passed, but the condition for suffix (endswith('ba')) failed. \n\n            Why did the condition for suffix fail? The next length (L=3) has two strings: 'aba' and 'aba'. Neither ends with 'ba'. \n\n            But wait, the suffix of length 3 is 'aba', which is not 'ba'. The condition for suffix of length 2 is that the next length's suffix must end with 'ba'. But the next length's suffix is of length 3, and it must end with 'ba'. Indeed, 'aba' ends with 'a' (last char) and 'ba' is two chars. \n\n            The condition we are checking is: for the next length (L+1=3), the suffix of length 3 must end with the current suffix (which is 'ba' in Option2). But the suffix of length 3 is 'aba', and 'aba' does not end with 'ba'. \n\n            However, the full string \"ababa\" has a suffix of length 3: \"aba\", which does not end with \"ba\". So why is Option2 valid? \n\n            Let me reexamine the condition:\n\n            Our condition for Option2 (at length L=2) is:\n                The next length (L+1=3) must have:\n                    One string that starts with the current prefix (which is 'ab') -> yes, 'aba' does start with 'ab'.\n                    One string that ends with the current suffix (which is 'ba') -> no.\n\n            But the full string \"ababa\" has a suffix of length 3: \"aba\", which does not end with \"ba\". \n\n            However, the suffix of length 2 is \"ba\", and the suffix of length 3 is \"aba\". These are consistent because the suffix of length 3 includes the suffix of length 2. \n\n            The condition we are using is not exactly matching. We are requiring that the next length's suffix ends with the current length's suffix. But the next length's suffix is of length L+1, and the current length's suffix is of length L. The condition should be that the next length's suffix (which is of length L+1) has the current length's suffix (of length L) as its last L characters. \n\n            In our example, the current length's suffix is 'ba' (L=2), and the next length's suffix is 'aba' (L+1=3). The last 2 characters of 'aba' are 'ba', which matches. \n\n            But our condition is checking if the next length's string ends with 'ba'. And 'aba' does end with 'ba' (the last two characters). \n\n            Let me verify: \n                'aba' ends with 'ba'? Yes, because 'aba'[-2:] is 'ba'.\n\n            So the condition should be: \n                For Option1: \n                    next_group must contain a string that starts with the current prefix (of length L) and a string that ends with the current suffix (of length L).\n\n            In the example for L=2, Option2:\n                'ab' is the prefix -> next_group must have a string that starts with 'ab' -> 'aba' does.\n                'ba' is the suffix -> next_group must have a string that ends with 'ba' -> 'aba' does (because 'aba'[-2:]=='ba').\n\n            But in our code, we are checking with `endswith` which for a string of length L+1 and a suffix of length L, we should check the last L characters. \n\n            The `str.endswith` method in Python checks if the string ends with the specified suffix. For example, 'aba'.endswith('ba') returns True.\n\n            So why did our code say count2_2=0? \n\n            In the code for Option2, we did:\n                count2_2 = 0\n                for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                    if s_next.endswith(s1_str):   # Here s1_str is 'ba' in Option2\n                        count2_2 += 1\n\n            For 'aba': 'aba'.endswith('ba') is True.\n\n            So count2_2 should be 2.\n\n            Let me re-run the condition for L=2, Option2 manually:\n\n                s1_str = 'ba' (suffix in Option2)\n                s2_str = 'ab' (prefix in Option2)\n\n                Option2: \n                    count1_2: number of strings in next_group that start with 'ab' -> both 'aba' and 'aba' start with 'ab' -> 2.\n                    count2_2: number of strings in next_group that end with 'ba' -> both 'aba' end with 'ba' -> 2.\n\n                So valid2 = (2>=1 and 2>=1) -> True.\n\n            Then, we would choose Option2, which assigns 'ab' as prefix and 'ba' as suffix. \n\n            In our code, we then do:\n                list_at_L_sorted = sorted([('0','ba'), ('6','ab')], key=lambda x: x[0]) \n                -> sorted by index: [ (0, 'ba'), (6, 'ab') ]\n\n                Then, assign index0 as 'S' and index6 as 'P'.\n\n            The example output has the first string 'ba' (index0) as 'S' and the seventh string 'ab' (index6) as 'P'. \n\n            This matches.\n\n        Example 2: n=3, input strings = ['a','aa','aa','a'] (example input: ['3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na'])\n\n        Group by length:\n            L=1: [ (0,'a'), (3,'a') ]\n            L=2: [ (1,'aa'), (2,'aa') ]\n\n        Processing L=1:\n            s1_str='a', s2_str='a'\n            next_group = groups[2] = [('1','aa'), ('2','aa')]\n\n            Option1: 'a' as prefix, 'a' as suffix.\n                next_group startswith('a'): both 'aa' start with 'a' -> count1_1=2\n                next_group endswith('a'): both 'aa' end with 'a' -> count2_1=2 -> valid1=True.\n\n            Option2: 'a' as suffix, 'a' as prefix -> same as Option1, valid2=True.\n\n            Then, we choose arbitrarily by sorting by index: [ (0,'a'), (3,'a') ]\n            Assign index0 as 'P', index3 as 'S'\n\n        Processing L=2:\n            s1_str='aa', s2_str='aa'\n            next_group = groups.get(3, []) -> None (since n=3, so L goes from 1 to 2)\n            Since L==n-1 (2==3-1), we arbitrarily assign the first string (index1) as 'P' and the second (index2) as 'S'\n\n            So the result for indices: \n                index0: 'P'\n                index1: 'P'\n                index2: 'S'\n                index3: 'S'\n\n            Output string: for indices 0,1,2,3: 'P','P','S','S' -> \"PPSS\"\n\n        But the example output is \"PPSS\" or any valid assignment. The example says: \"Answers 'SPSP', 'SSPP' and 'PSPS' are also acceptable\". \n\n        However, our output is \"PPSS\", which is acceptable.\n\n        Example 3: n=2, input strings = ['a','c'] (example input: ['2\\na\\nc'])\n        Group by length:\n            L=1: [ (0,'a'), (1,'c') ]\n\n        Processing L=1 (n-1=1, so last length):\n            Arbitrarily assign the first string (index0) as 'P' and the second (index1) as 'S'\n            Output: \"PS\"\n\n        All examples passed.\n\n        Note: The condition for the last length is handled separately, and for non-last lengths, we use the lookahead condition.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        One more thing: the input order. We are storing the original indices, and we are updating the result array at those indices. Then, we output the result array in the order of the input strings.\n\n        But note: the input strings are given in a specific order, and our result array is built for each index (0 to 2n-3). Then, we simply join the result array from index0 to index(2n-3) to get the output string.\n\n        However, the example input order for n=5 has 8 strings, and our result array is of length 8, and we output the characters in the order of the indices 0 to 7.\n\n        This matches the input order.\n\n        Code implementation:\n\n            We'll read the input.\n            We'll create an array `result` of length (2*n-2) with None.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n                n = int(data[0])\n                total_strings = 2*n - 2\n                strings = data[1:1+total_strings]\n\n                indexed_strings = [(i, s) for i, s in enumerate(strings)]\n                groups = {}\n                for idx, s in indexed_strings:\n                    L = len(s)\n                    if L not in groups:\n                        groups[L] = []\n                    groups[L].append((idx, s))\n\n                result = [None] * (2*n-2)\n\n                for L in range(1, n):\n                    if L not in groups or len(groups[L]) != 2:\n                        # According to the problem, there are exactly two strings per length, so this should not happen.\n                        continue\n\n                    list_at_L = groups[L]\n                    if L == n-1:\n                        # Last length\n                        list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        idx1, s1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                        idx2, s2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                        result[idx1] = 'P'\n                        result[idx2] = 'S'\n                    else:\n                        next_group = groups.get(L+1, [])\n                        s1_str, s2_str = [s for (idx, s) in list_at_L]  # extract the two strings without regard to order\n\n                        # Option1: s1_str is prefix, s2_str is suffix\n                        count1_1 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.startswith(s1_str):\n                                count1_1 += 1\n                        count2_1 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.endswith(s2_str):\n                                count2_1 += 1\n                        valid1 = (count1_1 >= 1 and count2_1 >= 1)\n\n                        # Option2: s1_str is suffix, s2_str is prefix\n                        count1_2 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.startswith(s2_str):\n                                count1_2 += 1\n                        count2_2 = 0\n                        for (idx, s_next) in next_group:\n                            if s_next.endswith(s1_str):\n                                count2_2 += 1\n                        valid2 = (count1_2 >= 1 and count2_2 >= 1)\n\n                        if valid1 and valid2:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'P'\n                            result[idx2] = 'S'\n                        elif valid1:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'P'\n                            result[idx2] = 'S'\n                        elif valid2:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'S'\n                            result[idx2] = 'P'\n                        else:\n                            list_at_L_sorted = sorted(list_at_L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                            idx1, s_val1 = list_at_L_sorted[0]\n                            idx2, s_val2 = list_at_L_sorted[1]\n                            result[idx1] = 'P'\n                            result[idx2] = 'S'\n\n                # Now, we have result as a list of None and 'P'/'S' for each index in the input order.\n                # But note: some indices might still be None if we skipped due to missing groups. But the problem guarantees two strings per length.\n                output_string = ''.join(result)\n\n                Print(output_string)\n\n        However, note: the input order is the order of the strings, and our result array is built for each string's original index. Therefore, the output_string is the concatenation of the result for the first string, second string, etc.\n\n        This matches the required format.\n\n        Let's hope it works.\n\n        Note: The condition for the next length might be too strict if there are duplicate strings in the next length. But the condition counts occurrences, so if a string appears twice, it will be counted twice.\n\n        We'll submit and hope for the best.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the next length uses `startswith` and `endswith` which are string methods. These work correctly.\n\n        Final code:",
