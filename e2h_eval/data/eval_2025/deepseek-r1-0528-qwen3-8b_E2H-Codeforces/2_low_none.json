Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row, the middle element is 's' but the diagonals are 'x'. The non-diagonal elements should be the same and different from the diagonal. In this case, the non-diagonal elements are not all the same (there's an 's' and many 'o').\n\n Steps:\n  Let the main diagonal be the set of positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n  The anti-diagonal: (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n  Condition 1: All characters on the main diagonal must be the same. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\n  Condition 2: All characters not on either diagonal must be the same and also different from the diagonal character.\n\n  However, note: what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then we already fail condition 1.\n\n  But wait, the problem says:\n      - Both diagonals must have the same letter (so the entire diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be composed of the same letter, say 'x').\n      - The rest of the squares must be the same letter (say '.') and different from 'x'.\n\n  So, we can do:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n  Step 2: Check the two diagonals.\n    Let diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n    Let diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n    If there's any variation in diag1, or in diag2, then we have a problem. Also, the two diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, the problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning each diagonal has one letter, but does it require that the two diagonals have the same letter? \n\n  Let me check the example: \n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      This is YES.\n\n      In this example, the main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> wait, that's not the same letter! But wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n  Wait, I think I misread the problem. The problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This means the entire main diagonal is one letter (say 'X') and the entire anti-diagonal is one letter (which might be the same as the main diagonal or not?) — but then condition 2 says that the other squares must be the same and different from the diagonal ones.\n\n  However, note the example: \n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Main diagonal: 'w', 's', 'w' -> not all the same! But wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n  Let me read again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" — meaning that for the main diagonal, all letters must be the same, and for the anti-diagonal, all letters must be the same. It doesn't require that the two diagonals have the same letter.\n\n  But then condition 2: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n  So, the two diagonals can have two different letters? Then we have two different letters on the diagonals. Then condition 2 requires that the rest of the squares are the same and different from ... which one? The problem says \"different from the letters on the diagonals\". But there are two different letters.\n\n  Let me analyze the example: \n      Example 2: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='s', [2][2]='w' -> not the same! So why is the answer YES?\n\n  Wait, I think I made a mistake. The example input is:\n\n      Input:\n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      But the example output is \"YES\".\n\n  However, the problem statement says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms an \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - The main diagonal consists of elements where the row index equals the column index (i.e., `grid[i][i]` for each `i`).\n   - The anti-diagonal consists of elements where the row index plus the column index equals `n-1` (i.e., `grid[i][n-1-i]` for each `i`).\n   - Both diagonals must have identical letters throughout. If either diagonal has varying letters, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**:\n   - All elements not on either diagonal must form a single letter.\n   - This letter must be different from the letters found on both diagonals. If any non-diagonal element violates this condition, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - If all conditions are satisfied, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n    diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n    \n    if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    diag_letter1 = diag1[0]\n    diag_letter2 = diag2[0]\n    \n    non_diag_letters = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_letters.append(grid[i][j])\n            \n    if not non_diag_letters:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if len(set(non_diag_letters)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_letter = non_diag_letters[0]\n    \n    if non_diag_letter == diag_letter1 or non_diag_letter == diag_letter2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The main diagonal (`diag1`) and anti-diagonal (`diag2`) are extracted. If either diagonal contains more than one distinct letter, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code then checks all elements not on either diagonal. These elements must all be the same letter and different from the letters on the diagonals. If they are not, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Output Result**: If all checks pass, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by leveraging set operations to check uniformity and simple loops to collect and validate non-diagonal elements.",
