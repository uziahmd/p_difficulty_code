Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each up to 1000 bytes. The total size is at most 100*1000 = 100000 bytes.\n\n We are to find all integers x in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying process when both progress bars show x.\n\n Conditions:\n   Let the files be a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n   After copying x bytes of file i (which is the current file), the first progress bar shows: floor(100*x / a_i)\n   The second progress bar shows: floor(100 * (total_bytes_copied) / total_size) \n        where total_bytes_copied = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{i-1} + x, and total_size = sum(a_1 to a_n)\n\n Note: The copying is done sequentially. So we can break down the problem by considering each file and each possible byte count in that file.\n\n However, note that the second progress bar depends on the cumulative bytes from all files so far (including the current one partially).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that at the very beginning (before any file is copied) both are 0, so 0 is always included.\n\n 2. We also know that at the end (after all files) both will be 100. So 100 is always included.\n\n 3. But there might be intermediate values.\n\n How to approach?\n\n We cannot iterate over every single byte (because the total size can be up to 100000) but note that n is only up to 100 and each file size is up to 1000.\n\n However, note: we are only interested in the values that appear as the floor percentages. And the percentages change only at specific points.\n\n Observation: The first progress bar for a file of size a_i can take integer values from 0 to 99 (and then 100). Actually, the value jumps occur at multiples of (a_i/100). But since we are taking floor, the value changes at byte counts that are ceil((k+1)*a_i/100) for k from 0 to 99? Actually, the condition for the first progress bar to be k is:\n\n   k <= 100*x/a_i < k+1\n   => x >= ceil(k * a_i / 100) and x < (k+1)*a_i/100 + 1? Actually, because of floor, the condition is:\n\n   x must satisfy: k <= (100*x)/a_i < k+1\n   => k * a_i / 100 <= x < (k+1)*a_i/100\n\n But note: x is integer, so we can define:\n   Lower bound: L_k = ceil(k * a_i / 100)   [if k * a_i / 100 is not integer, then x must be at least the next integer]\n   However, wait: the condition is k <= 100*x/a_i. Since we are flooring, we have:\n        k <= 100*x/a_i   => x >= (k * a_i + 99) // 100 + 1? \n\n Alternatively, we can say: the first progress bar becomes k at x0 = ceil(k * a_i / 100). But note: it's floor division, so actually the condition is:\n\n   floor(100*x/a_i) = k   if and only if\n        k <= 100*x/a_i < k+1\n        => x in [ceil(k * a_i / 100), floor((k+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)]\n\n But note: because of integer x, we can write:\n\n   x_min = ceil(k * a_i / 100)\n   x_max = floor((k+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)   but actually, the condition is strict: x must be less than (k+1)*a_i/100.\n\n However, note that (k+1)*a_i/100 might not be an integer. The maximum x for which floor(100*x/a_i) = k is the largest integer strictly less than (k+1)*a_i/100.\n\n But note: we don't need to iterate over every k for every file? We are asked for the numbers that appear in both progress bars at some moment.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can consider the entire process as having events at each byte transferred. However, the total number of events is up to 100000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be careful.\n\n But note: n is only 100, and each file has at most 1000 bytes. So we can iterate over each file and then for each byte in the file? Then we would do 100 * 1000 = 100000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we don't need to check every single byte: we can check the boundaries for each progress bar value.\n\n But note: the second progress bar depends on the entire history. So we have to account for:\n\n   Let S = total size = sum(a_i)\n   Let T_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{i-1}   (the total bytes from previous files)\n\n   Then while copying the i-th file (size a_i) at byte x (from 0 to a_i) the total bytes copied is T_i + x.\n\n   The second progress bar is: floor(100*(T_i+x)/S)\n\n   The first progress bar is: floor(100*x/a_i)\n\n   We want to know for which k (from 0 to 100) there exists an integer x in [0, a_i] (for some file i) such that:\n\n        floor(100*x/a_i) = k   and   floor(100*(T_i+x)/S) = k\n\n   But note: k must be the same.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to have k=0 and k=100 at the start and end. Also, note that k=0 might occur at the beginning of any file (unless the previous files were already 100%? but no, because we are in the middle of the process).\n\n   But wait: the second progress bar is cumulative. The moment we are at is during the i-th file, so the first progress bar is about the current file, and the second is about the overall.\n\n   We have to check for each file i and for each k from 0 to 100 whether:\n\n        There exists an integer x in [0, a_i] such that:\n            k <= 100*x/a_i < k+1   and\n            k <= 100*(T_i+x)/S < k+1\n\n   However, note: the second condition requires that the overall percentage is k. But note: we are in the middle of the i-th file, so the overall percentage must be k. Also, note that the overall percentage might jump during the copying of a file.\n\n   But we are iterating by file, and within a file by x from 0 to a_i. Since a_i is at most 1000, we can do a loop for each file and for each x from 0 to a_i (inclusive). Then check both conditions.\n\n   However, the total number of x's is 100000, which is acceptable in Python? We have 100 files, each with up to 1000 bytes -> 100*1000 = 100000 iterations. This is acceptable.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read n.\n   Read list a of n integers.\n\n   Let total = sum(a)\n   Let prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n   For i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   Now, we are going to simulate the process by going through each file i (from 0 to n-1) and then each x from 0 to a[i] (inclusive). But note: we must include the starting point (x=0) for each file.\n\n   However, note: the first progress bar for the i-th file at x=0 is 0, and the second progress bar is floor(100 * (prefix[i]) / total) [because we have copied all previous files completely]. But wait, at x=0 of the i-th file, we haven't copied any part of the i-th file, so the overall bytes are prefix[i] (which is the sum of the first i files). Then the second progress bar is floor(100 * prefix[i] / total).\n\n   We want to record for each k (from 0 to 100) if at any moment (any x and any file i) both conditions hold.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        seen = set()   # to record the k values that appear at some moment.\n\n        But note: we are to output numbers from 0 to 100 (in increasing order) that appear at least once.\n\n        However, note: the same k might appear multiple times, but we just need to know if it appears at least once.\n\n        But wait: what about the fact that the second progress bar condition depends on the entire history? We must compute:\n\n            condition1: floor(100*x / a_i) == k\n            condition2: floor(100*(prefix[i] + x) / total) == k\n\n        But note: we are iterating by file and by x. We can check for each (file i, x) the two percentages.\n\n        However, note: k is defined by the two conditions. We don't know k in advance. Instead, we can record the two percentages at each (file i, x) and then mark that k (which is the common value) is achieved.\n\n        But wait: we require that the same k is achieved by both. So at a given (file i, x) we have:\n\n            p1 = (100*x) // a_i   [but wait: if x is 0 then 0, but if x is fractional? no, x is integer. However, note: the condition is floor(100*x/a_i). But note: 100*x might be a float? We can use integer division? Actually, we can use:\n\n            p1 = (100 * x * 1000) // (a_i * 1000)   -> no, that's not necessary.\n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n\n            p1 = (100 * x) // a_i   # but wait, this is integer division? Actually, 100*x is integer, a_i is integer, but (100*x)//a_i is the floor division.\n\n            Similarly, p2 = (100 * (prefix[i] + x)) // total   # again, floor division.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"floor\", and in Python, for nonnegative integers, floor division is the same as truncation.\n\n            But note: 100*x might be very big? No, because x <= 1000 and a_i>=1, so 100*x <= 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the first progress bar is floor(100*x/a_i). But if we do (100*x)//a_i, that is the same as floor(100*x/a_i) because both numerator and denominator are positive.\n\n        Similarly, (100*(prefix[i]+x))//total is floor(100*(prefix[i]+x)/total).\n\n        But note: the problem says \"rounded down\", so we are doing exactly that.\n\n        However, note: the second progress bar uses the cumulative sum (prefix[i] + x). The cumulative sum is from the first i files (completely) and then x bytes of the i-th file.\n\n        But wait: our prefix[i] is the sum of the first i files. So the total bytes is prefix[i] + x.\n\n        Now, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                a_i = a[i]\n                T_i = prefix[i]   # total bytes before this file\n                for x in range(0, a_i+1):\n                    # Compute the two percentages\n                    p1 = (100 * x) // a_i   if a_i != 0 else 0   # but a_i>=1, so safe.\n                    # But note: if x==0, then p1=0, which is correct.\n\n                    total_bytes_so_far = T_i + x\n                    # But note: if we are at the last file, then total_bytes_so_far should be T_i+x, and total is the same as prefix[n]? Actually, prefix[n] = total.\n\n                    p2 = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total   # total is the total of all files, which is prefix[n]\n\n                    # Now, we have two percentages: p1 and p2. We require that they are equal?\n                    # But wait: the problem asks for the same number on both progress bars. However, note that the problem does not require that the two progress bars show the same value at the same time? Actually, no: the problem says \"both progress bars show this number\". So we require p1 == p2.\n\n                    # However, note: we are iterating and we want to record the value k (which is the common value) that appears at least once.\n\n                    if p1 == p2:\n                        # Then we have found a moment when both show k = p1 (or p2, they are equal)\n                        # But note: k must be an integer between 0 and 100. Since p1 and p2 are computed by floor division, they are integers.\n\n                        # We can add k to a set.\n\n            Then, after processing all files, we output the sorted list of unique k's from 0 to 100 that appeared at least once.\n\n        However, note: the problem says to output numbers from 0 to 100 (only those that appear). We are only checking when p1==p2.\n\n        But wait: is that sufficient? Consider: we are only checking the moments when the two progress bars are equal. And that is what we want.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that the two progress bars are equal at the same time, but we are iterating over every moment (every x and every file) and checking if the two values are equal.\n\n        However, note: the example input ['1\\n6'] should output [0,16,33,50,66,83,100]. \n\n        Let's test with n=1, a=[6], total=6.\n\n        We iterate i=0, a_i=6, T_i=0, x from 0 to 6.\n\n        x=0: p1 = (100*0)//6 = 0, p2 = (100*0)//6 = 0 -> record 0.\n        x=1: p1 = (100*1)//6 = 100//6 = 16, p2 = (100*1)//6 = 16 -> record 16.\n        x=2: p1 = (200)//6 = 33, p2 = (200)//6 = 33 -> record 33.\n        x=3: p1 = (300)//6 = 50, p2 = 50 -> record 50.\n        x=4: p1 = 66, p2=66 -> record 66.\n        x=5: p1 = (500)//6 = 83, p2=83 -> record 83.\n        x=6: p1 = (600)//6 = 100, p2=100 -> record 100.\n\n        So we get {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}. Then we sort and output.\n\n        But wait: the example output for the first test case is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'. So that matches.\n\n        However, the second example: Input: \"2\\n100 500\"\n\n        We are told the output is: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n        Let's simulate:\n\n        n=2, a=[100,500], total=600.\n\n        File0: a0=100, T0=0.\n\n          x from 0 to 100.\n\n          At x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> record 0.\n          We need to check when p1==p2.\n\n          For x from 0 to 100:\n\n            p1 = (100*x)//100 = x   (since 100*x is divisible by 100, so floor(100*x/100)=x)\n\n            p2 = (100*(0+x))//600 = (100*x)//600\n\n            We require x == (100*x)//600.\n\n            Let me check for x=0: 0==0 -> yes.\n\n            x=1: 1 == (100*1)//600 -> 100//600=0 -> 1!=0 -> no.\n            x=2: 2 vs 200//600=0 -> no.\n            ...\n            x=6: 6 vs 600//600=1 -> no.\n            x=60: 60 vs 6000//600=10 -> no.\n\n            So we only get 0 from the first file.\n\n        Now, file1: a1=500, T1=100 (because prefix[1]=100).\n\n          We iterate x from 0 to 500.\n\n          At x=0: \n              p1 = (100*0)//500 = 0\n              p2 = (100*(100+0))//600 = 10000//600 = 16 (since 10000//600 = 16.66... -> 16)\n\n          At x=1:\n              p1 = 100//500 = 0\n              p2 = 10100//600 = 16 (because 10100//600 = 16.833... -> 16)\n\n          ...\n\n          How do we get 95,96,97,98,99,100?\n\n          Note: the second progress bar at the end of the second file will be 100. But during the second file, the second progress bar goes from 16 (at x=0) to 100 (at x=500). The first progress bar goes from 0 to 100.\n\n          We need to find when p1 (which is (100*x)//500) equals p2 (which is (100*(100+x))//600).\n\n          Example: Let k=95.\n\n          Condition for the first progress bar: \n              95 <= (100*x)/500 < 96\n              => 95*500 <= 100*x < 96*500\n              => 47500 <= 100*x < 48000\n              => 475 <= x < 480\n\n          Now check the second progress bar at these x:\n\n          Condition for the second progress bar: \n              95 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 96\n              => 95 <= (10000 + 100*x)/600 < 96\n              => 95*600 <= 10000+100*x < 96*600\n              => 57000 <= 10000+100*x < 57600\n              => 47000 <= 100*x < 46600   -> wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\n          Actually, let me recast:\n\n          95 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 96\n          Multiply by 600: 57000 <= 100*(100+x) < 57600\n          Divide by 100: 570 <= 100+x < 576\n          => 570 - 100 <= x < 576 - 100\n          => 470 <= x < 476\n\n          Now, from the first condition we have x in [475,480) (i.e., 475<=x<=479). From the second condition we have x in [470,476) (i.e., 470<=x<=475). So the intersection is [475,476). Only x=475.\n\n          Then at x=475:\n\n            First progress bar: (100*475)//500 = 47500//500 = 95\n            Second progress bar: (100*(100+475))//600 = (100*575)//600 = 57500//600 = 95 (since 57500/600 = 95.833... -> floor is 95)\n\n          So k=95 is achieved at x=475.\n\n          Similarly, we can check for 96:\n\n          First condition: \n              96 <= (100*x)/500 < 97\n              => 96*500 <= 100*x < 97*500\n              => 48000 <= 100*x < 48500\n              => 480 <= x < 485\n\n          Second condition:\n              96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n              => 96*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 97*600\n              => 57600 <= 10000+100*x < 58200\n              => 47600 <= 100*x < 47200 -> wait, that's impossible.\n\n          Let me do it again:\n\n          Second condition: 96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n          => 96*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 97*600\n          => 57600 <= 10000+100*x < 58200\n          => 47600 <= 100*x < 47200 -> wait, that is 476 <= x < 472, which is impossible.\n\n          But wait: I see, the inequality direction is reversed? Actually, we did:\n\n          Condition for floor: k <= (100*(T_i+x))/total < k+1\n\n          So for k=96:\n\n          96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n\n          => 96 * 600 <= 100*(100+x) < 97 * 600\n          => 57600 <= 100*(100+x) < 58200\n          => 57600 <= 10000+100*x < 58200\n          => 47600 <= 100*x < 47200   -> wait, 47600 <= 100*x and 100*x < 47200 -> which is impossible because 47600 > 47200.\n\n          So k=96 is not achieved? But the example output includes 96.\n\n          Let me recompute the example output: the example output for the second test case is \"0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100\"\n\n          So we must have missed something.\n\n          Wait: the second progress bar condition for k=96:\n\n          We require: floor(100*(100+x)/600) = 96.\n\n          Solve: 96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n          => 96*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 97*600\n          => 57600 <= 10000+100*x < 58200\n          => 47600 <= 100*x < 47200 -> wait, that is an empty set.\n\n          But note: the cumulative total is 600, and the second progress bar is (100*(100+x))/600.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute the required x for the second progress bar to be 96:\n\n          96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n          => 96*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 97*600\n          => 57600 <= 10000+100*x < 58200\n          => 47600 <= 100*x < 47200   -> no solution.\n\n          But wait, how did the example output include 96? \n\n          Let me check the example: \"2\\n100 500\" -> Output: \"0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100\"\n\n          Maybe we are missing that the first progress bar condition is for the current file (which is the second file) and the second progress bar is the overall.\n\n          Alternatively, maybe the example output is generated by the official solution and we are misunderstanding the problem.\n\n          Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n          \"second — floor( (100 * (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{i-1} + x) / total )\"\n\n          In the second file, the total is 600, and the current file is the second one (so the first file is already fully copied, so we have 100 bytes from the first file and then x bytes from the second).\n\n          Now, the second progress bar is: floor(100*(100+x)/600). \n\n          For k=96, we need:\n\n             96 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 97\n\n          => 57600 <= 10000+100*x < 58200\n          => 47600 <= 100*x < 47200 -> no solution.\n\n          But wait, maybe the condition is satisfied at a different x? Or perhaps we are not iterating correctly.\n\n          Alternatively, note: the problem says the second progress bar updates after each byte. So we must check every x from 0 to 500.\n\n          Let me try to compute the second progress bar at x=475 and x=476, etc.\n\n          For the second file, the second progress bar:\n\n          At x=0: (100*100)/600 = 10000/600 = 16.666 -> floor=16\n          At x=1: (100*101)/600 = 10100/600 = 16.833 -> 16\n          ...\n          When does it become 95? \n\n          We solved above: at x=475: (100*(100+475))/600 = 57500/600 = 95.833 -> floor=95.\n\n          Then at x=476: 57600/600 = 96 -> floor=96.\n\n          So at x=476, the second progress bar becomes 96.\n\n          Now, what is the first progress bar at x=476 in the second file?\n\n          First progress bar: (100*476)//500 = 47600//500 = 95 (since 47600/500 = 95.2 -> floor=95)\n\n          So at x=476: p1=95, p2=96 -> not equal.\n\n          Then when does p1 become 96? \n\n          Condition for p1=96: (100*x)//500 = 96 -> 96*500 <= 100*x < 97*500 -> 48000 <= 100*x < 48500 -> 480<=x<485.\n\n          Now, check the second progress bar at x=480:\n\n          (100*(100+480))/600 = (58000)/600 = 96.666 -> floor=96.\n\n          Then at x=480, p1= (100*480)//500 = 48000//500 = 96, and p2= (100*580)//600 = 58000//600 = 96 (since 58000/600 = 96.666 -> floor=96).\n\n          So k=96 is achieved at x=480.\n\n          Similarly, k=97:\n\n          Condition for p1=97: 48500 <= 100*x < 49000 -> 485<=x<490.\n\n          Condition for p2=97: 97<= (100*(100+x))/600 <98 -> 97*600<=100*(100+x)<98*600 -> 58200<=10000+100*x<58800 -> 48200<=100*x<48800 -> 482<=x<488.\n\n          Intersection: x from 485 to 488 (exclusive) -> so x=485,486,487.\n\n          At x=485: p1 = (100*485)//500 = 48500//500 = 97, p2 = (100*585)//600 = 58500//600 = 97 (since 58500/600=97.5 -> floor=97).\n\n          So k=97 is achieved.\n\n          Similarly, k=98,99,100.\n\n          So our simulation by iterating over x from 0 to 500 for the second file would catch:\n\n            k=0: at x=0 (from the first file and the beginning of the second file)\n            k=95: at x=475\n            k=96: at x=480\n            k=97: at x=485\n            k=98: ? \n            k=99: ?\n            k=100: at x=500\n\n          But wait, k=98 and k=99?\n\n          For k=98:\n\n          Condition for p1: (100*x)//500=98 -> 49000<=100*x<50000 -> 490<=x<500.\n\n          Condition for p2: 98<= (100*(100+x))/600<99 -> 98*600<=100*(100+x)<99*600 -> 58800<=10000+100*x<59400 -> 48800<=100*x<48400 -> wait, 48800<=100*x and 100*x<48400 -> no solution.\n\n          But wait: 98*600 = 58800, so:\n\n          58800 <= 10000+100*x < 59400\n          => 48800 <= 100*x < 48400 -> no.\n\n          However, let's compute the second progress bar for x=490:\n\n          (100*(100+490))//600 = (59000)//600 = 98.333 -> floor=98.\n\n          So condition for p2=98: 98<= (100*(100+x))/600 <99 -> 58800<=100*(100+x)<59400 -> 58800<=59000 (which is true) and 59000<59400 (true). So x=490 satisfies the second condition.\n\n          Then p1 at x=490: (100*490)//500 = 49000//500 = 98.\n\n          So k=98 is achieved at x=490.\n\n          Similarly, k=99:\n\n          Condition for p1: 99<= (100*x)/500 <100 -> 49500<=100*x<50000 -> 495<=x<500.\n\n          Condition for p2: 99<= (100*(100+x))/600 <100 -> 59400<=100*(100+x)<60000 -> 59400<=10000+100*x<60000 -> 49400<=100*x<50000 -> 494<=x<500.\n\n          Intersection: x from 495 to 499.\n\n          At x=495: p1= (100*495)//500 = 49500//500=99, p2=(100*595)//600=59500//600=99 (since 59500/600=99.166 -> floor=99).\n\n          So k=99 is achieved.\n\n          And k=100 at x=500: p1=50000//500=100, p2=(100*600)//600=100.\n\n          So the set of k's we get from the second file: {0,95,96,97,98,99,100}.\n\n          Now, why did the first file not contribute any k from 95 to 100? Because in the first file, the overall progress bar goes from 0 to 100 (since total=600, and we are copying 100 bytes). \n\n          For the first file, the second progress bar is (100*x)//600.\n\n          We require p1=x (from the first file) to equal (100*x)//600.\n\n          So x must satisfy: x = (100*x)//600.\n\n          => 600",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusive that can be displayed simultaneously on both progress bars during the copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process of each file byte by byte. For each byte copied in a file, we calculate the current progress percentages for both progress bars. If these percentages match at any point during the copying process, that percentage is recorded.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each possible byte within the file, we can compute the current progress percentages for both progress bars. The key insight is that the first progress bar depends only on the current file's progress, while the second progress bar depends on the cumulative progress of all files processed so far.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total size of all files.\n   - Using a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative bytes copied before each file.\n   - For each file, iterate through each byte (from 0 to the file's size) and compute both progress percentages.\n   - Check if these percentages are equal and record the value if they are.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each file and each byte within the file. With up to 100 files and each file up to 1000 bytes, the total operations are 100 * 1000 = 100,000, which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_size = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    results = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        file_size = a[i]\n        T_i = prefix[i]\n        for x in range(0, file_size + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_bytes_so_far = T_i + x\n            p2 = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_size\n            if p1 == p2:\n                results.add(p1)\n    \n    sorted_results = sorted(results)\n    for num in sorted_results:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed to store the cumulative bytes of files processed before each file, facilitating quick calculation of the second progress bar's value during processing.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, the code iterates through each possible byte (from 0 to the file's size). For each byte, it calculates:\n   - **First Progress Bar (p1)**: The percentage of the current file copied, computed as `(100 * x) // file_size`.\n   - **Second Progress Bar (p2)**: The overall percentage of all files copied so far, computed as `(100 * (T_i + x)) // total_size`.\n4. **Recording Matching Percentages**: If `p1` equals `p2`, the value is added to a set to avoid duplicates.\n5. **Output**: The unique values are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible moments during the file copying process where both progress bars display the same percentage, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
