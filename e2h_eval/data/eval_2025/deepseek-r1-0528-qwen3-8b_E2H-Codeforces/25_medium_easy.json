При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it can be formed by two copies of some string `s` (with the same length) that were transmitted with an error.\n\n Conditions for the error:\n  - The message is the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s`.\n  - The two messages may merge: the end of the first and the beginning of the second can overlap if they have a common substring at the junction.\n  - The overlapping part must be positive and less than the length of `s`.\n  - However, note: if the entire second message is exactly the same as the first (i.e., total length is 2 * len(s)), then there is no error? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\"\n    But note: the example input includes 'abcabc' and the output is 'NO'. So even though 'abcabc' is two copies of 'abc', the problem does not consider that as an error.\n\n Therefore, the error only occurs when there is a non-trivial (at least one character and less than the whole length) overlap. \n\n How can we think?\n Let n = len(t). Suppose the original message was s, then t is formed by two copies of s, but with a suffix of the first copy merging with a prefix of the second.\n\n Let |s| = L. Then the total length of t would be 2*L, unless there is an overlap of k (1 <= k < L) then the total length is L + (L - k) = 2*L - k.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that t is the concatenation of two strings: a prefix of s and a suffix of s, such that the entire t is of the form:\n   t = s[0 : L - k] + s[L - k : ] + s   ??? \n\n Actually, let's break down:\n   The first message is s, and the second message is s again. The error causes that the last k characters of the first s are merged (overwritten) by the first k characters of the second s, provided that the last k of the first s equals the first k of the second s.\n\n Then the resulting string is: \n   t = s + s[k:]   (because the first k characters of the second s overwrite the last k of the first s)\n\n So the total length is: len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*L - k.\n\n We know the total length of t is n. So we must have: 2*L - k = n, and k must satisfy 1<=k<L.\n\n Also, the condition on the overlapping part: the last k of s must equal the first k of s.\n\n But note: we don't know L. However, note that the entire string t must be composed from two copies of s with an overlap. \n\n Another way: Consider that t must be such that there exists an integer L (the length of s) and an integer k (overlap, 1<=k<L) such that:\n   t = s + s[k:]\n\n And also, note that the entire t must be the same as: \n   s[0:L-k] + s[L-k:] + s\n\n But note: the first copy of s is from index0 to L-1, and then the second copy starts and the first k characters of the second copy merge with the last k of the first copy.\n\n Alternatively, we can express t as:\n   t = s[0:L] + s[k:L]   [but wait, the second copy is s, so the entire second copy is s, but the overlapping part is omitted in storage?]\n\n Actually, the process is: \n   We write the first s, then we write the second s, but at the point where the two s meet, if the next k characters of the first s (which are the last k) match the first k of the second s, then we only store the non-overlapping part of the second s.\n\n So the stored string is: s + s[k:L]   -> which is of length L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n Now, how do we relate t to s? \n   t = s + s[k:L]   (where k is the overlap)\n\n But note: the entire t should be built from two copies of s. Also, we can see that the first L characters of t must be s, and then the next part (if any) must be s without the first k characters.\n\n However, wait: the problem says that the error might occur, so the entire t is the result. But note: we don't know s. \n\n Approach:\n\n 1. The total length of t is n. Then, the length of s must be L such that 2L - k = n, with 1<=k<L. Therefore, L must be greater than ceil(n/2) and less than or equal to n? Actually, from 2L - k = n, and k>=1, we have 2L - n >= k_min=1, so L >= ceil((n+1)/2). Also, since k < L, then 2L - n < L, so L > n? Wait, let me rearrange:\n\n   n = 2L - k  =>  L = (n + k) / 2. Since k is at least 1 and at most L-1, then L must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most ... actually, note that the entire t must start with s (so the first L characters are s) and then continue with the rest. But we don't know L.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can consider that the string t must be periodic with a period of L, and the two copies are merged. \n\n Observation: \n   Since t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap of k, then the first L characters of t must be s, and the last L characters of t must be s (because the second copy is s, but we lost the first k characters due to overlap). \n\n However, note: the second copy is written without the first k characters. So the entire t is:\n\n   t = s[0:L] + s[k:L]\n\n Then, the last L characters of t are: \n   from index (n - L) to the end. But n = 2L - k, so the last L characters are from index (2L - k - L) = L - k to the end. \n\n But wait, let me write indices:\n\n   t[0:L] = s[0:L]   (first copy)\n   t[L: ] = s[k:L]   (the rest of the second copy)\n\n Then the last L characters of t are t[L-k: L] (from the second copy's tail) and then the first k characters of the second copy are missing because they overlapped. Actually, the last L characters of t are just the last L characters of the entire t.\n\n But note: the entire t is of length 2L - k. The last L characters are from index (2L - k - L) = L - k to the end (which is index 2L - k - 1). \n\n Now, these last L characters must be equal to s? Not necessarily. They are the last L characters of t, but the second copy was s, so the last part of t is s without the first k. So the last L characters are:\n\n   t[L-k: ] = s[k:L] + s[0:k]   ???? \n\n Actually, wait, no: the entire second copy is s, but we only wrote s[k:L] (because the first k characters were merged). So the last part is s[k:L] (which has length L-k). Then the entire t is s (length L) and then s[k:L] (length L-k). So the entire t is of length 2L-k.\n\n How can we recover s?\n\n We know that the first L characters of t must be s. Also, the condition for the error is that the last k characters of s (which is s[L-k:L]) must equal the first k characters of s (s[0:k]). \n\n So, we can try to find an integer L (length of s) such that:\n   (a) 2L - k = n, for some k with 1<=k<L.\n   (b) The first L characters of t are s.\n   (c) The last k characters of s (i.e., t[L-k:L]) must equal the first k characters of s (t[0:k]).\n\n But note: we don't know k. However, from (a) we have k = 2L - n.\n\n Conditions on k: \n   k must be an integer, and 1<=k<L.\n\n So, we can iterate over possible L.\n\n What are the possible values for L?\n   From (a): k = 2L - n, and k>=1 => 2L - n >= 1 => L >= ceil((n+1)/2)\n   and k < L => 2L - n < L => L < n.\n\n Also, note that the entire t must be built from two copies of s, so the first L characters must be s, and then the remaining part (if any) is the last L-k characters of s (which is s[k:L]). \n\n But note: the remaining part is t[L: n] and its length is (2L - n) - L? Actually, the total length is n = 2L - k, so the remaining part is from index L to n-1, and its length is n - L = (2L - k) - L = L - k.\n\n And this remaining part must be s[k:L] (which is of length L-k). \n\n Therefore, we can check for each candidate L (from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1) such that:\n   k = 2L - n is between 1 and L-1 (inclusive).\n\n Then, we set:\n   s_candidate = t[0:L]   (the first L characters)\n\n Then, we require that the last k characters of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate[L-k:L]) are equal to the first k characters of s_candidate (s_candidate[0:k]).\n\n Additionally, the rest of the string t must be the substring s_candidate[k:L] (which is of length L-k). So we can check that the substring t[L:L+(L-k)] (which is t[L:]) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\n Actually, note: the entire t is built as:\n   t = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n And the length of t is L + (L - k) = 2L - k = n.\n\n So we can check two conditions for candidate L:\n   Condition 1: t[0:L] == s_candidate (obviously, by definition)\n   Condition 2: t[L:L+(L-k)] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n But note: the length of the second part is L-k, and we know that from the candidate L, the second part is exactly t[L:], which is of length n - L = (2L - k) - L = L - k.\n\n So we can check: t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n However, we have two conditions to check for a candidate L (with k=2L-n):\n\n   Condition A: s_candidate[k:] == t[L:]   (this is the part after the first L characters)\n   Condition B: s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]   (the overlapping condition)\n\n But wait, condition A is actually implied by condition B and the way we built s_candidate? Not exactly. \n\n However, note: \n   Condition B ensures that the overlapping part is consistent, but condition A is about the rest of the second copy.\n\n But observe: the entire second copy is s_candidate, and we have written only the part starting at k. So the rest of the second copy is s_candidate[k:]. And the entire t is built by appending that. So condition A is necessary.\n\n Alternatively, we can note: \n   t = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n   Therefore, the entire string t must be: \n        t[0:L] = s_candidate\n        t[L:] = s_candidate[k:]\n\n So we can check that.\n\n Steps:\n\n   n = len(t)\n\n   For L in range(ceil((n+1)/2), n):   (since L must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and less than n)\n        k = 2*L - n\n        If k < 1 or k >= L: skip (but our range ensures k>=1 and k < L? Actually, from k=2L-n, and L>=ceil((n+1)/2) => 2L>=n+1 => k>=1. And k < L is equivalent to 2L-n < L => L < n, which is our upper bound. So we are safe.)\n\n        s_candidate = t[0:L]\n        # Condition 1: the rest of the string (after first L) must be s_candidate[k:]\n        if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            # Condition 2: the overlapping condition: the last k of s_candidate must equal the first k of s_candidate.\n            if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n                Then we found a valid s_candidate.\n\n   If we found one, then output \"YES\" and then s_candidate.\n\n But note: what if there are multiple? The problem says: \"If possibilities exist, output any\".\n\n However, what if the string t is empty? The input says non-empty string.\n\n Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n=22.\n\n   We are looking for L in the range [ceil(23/2)=12, 21]. Then k=2L-22.\n\n   Let L=11: then k=2*11-22=0 -> skip (k must be at least 1).\n   Let L=12: k=24-22=2. Then s_candidate = t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" (but wait, the example output is \"abrakadabra\", which is 11 letters. Actually, \"abrakadabra\" has 11 letters. So we must adjust.\n\n   Correction: the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters? Let me count: \n        abrakadabra is 11, then again abrakadabra is 11, but with an overlap. Actually, the example says that the output is \"YES\\nabrakadabra\", meaning s is \"abrakadabra\".\n\n   How did they get that? \n        s = \"abrakadabra\", then two copies would normally be \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\", but with an error: the last k characters of the first copy must match the first k of the second. In the example, the first copy is \"abrakadabra\", and the second copy is \"abrakadabra\". The error happened with k=1? Actually, the example output has two possibilities: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap 1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap 4).\n\n   But note: the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters. \n        s = \"abrakadabra\" (11 characters) -> then k = 2*11 - 21 = 1. So that fits.\n\n   How about the example t = \"acacacaca\", n=10. \n        The example output is \"YES\\nacaca\", so s=\"acaca\", length L=5, then k=2*5-10=0 -> invalid. \n        But wait, the example says YES and outputs \"acaca\". \n\n   Let me check: \n        s = \"acaca\", then two copies without error would be \"acacacaca\", but with an error? \n        Actually, the example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n   How can we form \"acacacaca\" from two copies of \"acaca\" with an overlap? \n        Without error: two copies of \"acaca\" would be \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters. But the problem says: \n          \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\"\n\n        So if the entire second copy is merged completely, then that is not considered an error. But wait, the problem says: \n          \"Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения.\"\n\n        So the overlap must be positive and less than the length of s. In this case, the entire second copy is merged, so the overlap is 5 (the whole s) which is not allowed (must be <5). \n\n        Then why is the answer \"YES\"?\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n        Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n   So the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n   How can that be? \n\n   Let me break down \"acacacaca\" (10 characters) with s=\"acaca\" (5 characters). \n        The total length is 10 = 2*5 - 0? That doesn't fit. \n\n   Alternatively, maybe we are allowed to have the two copies with a non-zero overlap that is not necessarily the entire second copy? \n\n   But note: the error is defined as the two messages being identical and then merging. The total length is 2*L - k, and k must be between 1 and L-1.\n\n   For \"acacacaca\": \n        We cannot use L=5 because then k=0 (not allowed). \n\n   What if we use a different L? \n        The entire string t is 10. We must have L such that 2L - k = 10, and 1<=k<L.\n\n        Possibilities: \n          L=6: k=2 -> then s_candidate = t[0:6] = \"acacac\"\n          Check condition: \n            Condition A: t[6:] must be s_candidate[2:] -> t[6:] = \"aca\", and s_candidate[2:] = \"cac\" -> \"aca\" != \"cac\"\n\n          L=7: k=4 -> s_candidate = t[0:7]=\"acacaca\"\n          Condition A: t[7:] = \"ca\", and s_candidate[4:] = \"ca\" -> matches.\n          Condition B: last 4 of s_candidate = \"caca\", first 4 of s_candidate = \"acac\" -> not equal.\n\n          L=8: k=6 -> s_candidate = t[0:8]=\"acacacac\"\n          Condition A: t[8:] = \"a\", s_candidate[6:] = \"ac\" -> no.\n\n          L=9: k=8 -> s_candidate = t[0:9]=\"acacacaca\"\n          Condition A: t[9:] = \"c\", s_candidate[8:] = \"a\" -> no.\n\n        So no candidate L from 6 to 9.\n\n   But wait, the example output says \"YES\\nacaca\", meaning that s=\"acaca\" is the answer.\n\n   What if we consider that the error could have occurred with a different amount of overlap? \n\n   Note: the problem says \"if possible, determine a possible value s\". \n\n   However, the above reasoning for s=\"acaca\" (L=5) leads to a total length of 10 (without error) and the problem says that the situation of full overlap is not considered an error. But note: the problem says that the error is defined by having a positive overlap (at least one) and less than the length of the message. \n\n   But wait, the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"YES\", so we must accept s=\"acaca\".\n\n   Let me reexamine the definition: \n        \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s.\"\n\n   The error is described as: two identical messages are transmitted and then they merge (by overlapping) by some positive number of characters (less than the length). \n\n   However, the example input \"acacacaca\" is exactly two copies of \"acaca\" without any overlap? \n\n        Without error: two copies of \"acaca\" is \"acacacaca\", which is the same as the input.\n\n   But the problem says: \n        \"Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки.\"\n\n   So if there is no error (no overlap) then the string is just the concatenation. \n\n   Then why is \"acacacaca\" considered an error? \n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: 'acacacaca'\n\n   And the output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n   This implies that the problem considers that \"acacacaca\" is produced by an error. \n\n   How? \n\n   Consider: \n        The first copy is \"acaca\", then the second copy is \"acaca\". But note: the last part of the first copy is \"a\" (if we take an overlap of 1) then the second copy starts with \"a\", so they merge. Then the resulting string would be:\n\n        First copy: \"acaca\"\n        Second copy: \"acaca\" -> but we merge the last 1 character of the first copy with the first 1 of the second: \n            So we remove the last 'a' of the first copy and then write the second copy without the first 'a'? \n\n        Then the resulting string would be: \"acac\" (first copy without last 'a') + \"caca\" (the rest of the second copy) = \"accaca\"? That doesn't match.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the error can occur at any point? \n\n   Let me consider: \n        The error condition is that the two messages are the same and the last k characters of the first copy match the first k of the second. \n\n        Then the entire string becomes: \n            s[0:L-k] + s[L-k:L] + s   ??? \n\n        Actually, no: the entire second copy is s, but the first k characters of the second copy are merged with the last k of the first copy. So the first copy is written completely, and then the second copy is written without the first k. \n\n        Therefore, the entire string is: \n            t = s + s[k:]\n\n        For s=\"acaca\", k=1: \n            t = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\" -> which matches.\n\n        But wait, that gives the entire string. \n\n        However, note: the problem says that the two messages are transmitted, and the error causes the two messages to merge. But the entire second copy is still present except the overlapping part. \n\n        So for s=\"acaca\", k=1: \n            First copy: \"acaca\"\n            Second copy: \"acaca\", but we merge the last 1 character of the first copy (which is 'a') with the first 1 of the second copy (also 'a'). Then the resulting string is the first copy (which is \"acaca\") and then the rest of the second copy (without the first character) is \"caca\", so total \"acacacaca\".\n\n        So the total length is 5 + 4 = 9? But wait, the example string is 10 characters.\n\n        Let me count: \"acacacaca\" has 10 characters.\n\n        Actually, the formula is: \n            t = s + s[k:]   -> for s=\"acaca\", k=1: \n                s[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n                s[1:5] = \"cac\"\n                Then we add \"cac\", so total length = 5 + 4 = 9, but we have 10.\n\n        Wait, what is s[k:]? \n            s = \"acaca\", k=1 -> s[1:] is \"cac\" (length 3). Then total length = 5+3=8, but that doesn't give 10.\n\n        Let me check: \n            s = \"acaca\", k=0: then s[k:] = \"acaca\", so total length = 5+5=10. But k must be at least 1.\n\n        Alternatively, the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", which is of length 5. Then the total length is 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k. We want 10, so k=0, which is not allowed.\n\n   I think I made a mistake in the formula.\n\n   Let me rederive:\n\n        The two messages are s and s. The first message is written entirely. The second message is written, but the first k characters are merged with the last k of the first message. \n\n        The resulting string is: \n            t = s[0:L] + s[k:L]   (because the first k characters of the second message are not written separately, they are merged and the last k of the first message are overwritten? Actually, the entire second message is s, but the overlapping part is skipped in storage. \n\n        But note: the first message is written, then the second message is written, but the overlapping part is taken from the first message? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго\". So the end of the first (last k characters) and the beginning of the second (first k characters) must be the same. Then the storage is: the entire first message, and then the second message without the overlapping k characters.\n\n        So the total length is L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n        For s=\"acaca\", L=5, k=0: 2*5-0=10 -> that is the entire two copies without overlap. But k=0 is not allowed (must be positive).\n\n        How can we get 10 with k>=1? Then we must have 2L - k = 10, and k>=1, so L must be at least ceil(11/2)=6. \n\n        But wait, the example output says s=\"acaca\" (L=5) is valid. \n\n   After reading the example again: \n        Input: 'acacacaca' -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n   So the problem must consider that the error can happen even if the total length is the same as two copies without error? \n\n   But the problem states: \n        \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\"\n\n   This means that if the entire second message is merged (k = L) then that is not considered an error. But note: k must be less than L. \n\n   However, the example input 'acacacaca' is 10 characters. With s=\"acaca\", the two copies without error would be 10. But that is not an error. \n\n   Then why is the answer YES? \n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \n        \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети\"\n\n   It says \"possibly\". \n\n   There are two ways to get the string t=\"acacacaca\":\n        1. Without error: two copies of \"acaca\" concatenated -> \"acacacaca\".\n        2. With error: two copies of some other string s' (different from \"acaca\") that results in \"acacacaca\".\n\n   But the example output is \"acaca\", so we are saying that the error occurred and the original message was \"acaca\".\n\n   How can the error occur with s=\"acaca\" and produce \"acacacaca\"? \n\n   According to the definition: \n        The error produces: t = s + s[k:], where 1<=k<L.\n\n        For s=\"acaca\", L=5, we need k such that 2*5 - k = 10 -> k=0, which is not allowed.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the error can occur at the boundary arbitrarily? \n\n   Another possibility: the error condition is that the entire second copy is present, but the first copy is truncated? \n\n   The problem says: \"два одинаковых сообщения подряд\", meaning two copies. \n\n   After reading the examples: \n        Example: \"abrakadabra\" (s) and then the error produces either \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap 1) or \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap 4). \n\n        For the first example, the input t is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters. \n            Without error: two copies of \"abrakadabra\" (11 characters) would be 22 characters.\n            With error (overlap k=1): 11 + (11-1)=21.\n\n        Similarly, for s=\"acaca\", we need a string t of length 10. Without error, two copies would be 10. But with error, we need to have two copies with an overlap k (1<=k<5) and total length 10. \n\n        For s=\"acaca\", the total length with error is 2*5 - k = 10 - k. We need 10, so k=0, which is not allowed.\n\n   But wait, the example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters. \n\n   Now, consider: \n        What if the original message was not \"acaca\" but \"acacacaca\" itself? Then two copies would be 20 characters, but we have 10, so that doesn't work.\n\n   Alternatively, consider that the error condition might be that the entire t is formed by two copies of s, but the two copies might be broken arbitrarily? \n\n   Let me look for a candidate L (length of s) for t=\"acacacaca\", n=10.\n\n        We require: 2L - k = 10, with 1<=k<L.\n\n        Then L must be at least 6 (because 2L-10>=1 -> L>=5.5 -> ceil(5.5)=6) and less than 10.\n\n        L=6: k=2 -> then s_candidate = t[0:6] = \"acacac\"\n            Condition B: last 2 of s_candidate = \"ac\", first 2 of s_candidate = \"ac\" -> matches.\n            Condition A: t[6:] = \"aca\", and s_candidate[2:] = \"cac\" -> \"aca\" != \"cac\" -> fails.\n\n        L=7: k=4 -> s_candidate = t[0:7]=\"acacaca\"\n            Condition B: last 4 = \"caca\", first 4=\"acac\" -> not equal.\n\n        L=8: k=6 -> s_candidate = t[0:8]=\"acacacac\"\n            Condition B: last 6=\"cacaca\", first 6=\"acacac\" -> not equal.\n\n        L=9: k=8 -> s_candidate = t[0:9]=\"acacacaca\"\n            Condition B: last 8=\"cacacaca\", first 8=\"acacacac\" -> not equal.\n\n   So no candidate for L from 6 to 9.\n\n   What if we consider that the error might have occurred but the entire t is not the entire two copies? \n\n   The problem says: the two messages are identical and the error merges the end of the first and the beginning of the second. \n\n   But note: the resulting string is exactly t. \n\n   Another possibility: the error might have occurred more than once? \n\n   The problem states: \"при передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка\", so only two messages.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \n        \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети\"\n\n   The error is defined as: two identical messages are transmitted and then they merge. \n\n   So t must be the result of two identical messages with an overlap (positive and less than the message length).\n\n   But then, how did \"acacacaca\" come up? \n\n   Let me try to break \"acacacaca\" into two copies of some s with an overlap:\n\n        We have t = \"acacacaca\"\n\n        Possibility: \n            Let s = \"acac\", then L=4, then k=2*4-10 = -2 -> invalid.\n\n        Or s = \"aca\", L=3, then k=6-10=-4 -> invalid.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might allow that the two messages are s, but the entire t might be the result of merging at the boundary, and then the entire t is s repeated twice with an overlap, but the entire t is not necessarily starting with s? \n\n   But the problem says: the two messages are transmitted. The first message is s, so the first L characters of t must be s? \n\n   However, consider: \n        What if the first message is s, and then the second message is s, but the transmission error happens and the last k of s is dropped and the first k of s is appended? \n\n        Then the entire string would be: s[0:L-k] + s[k:L] + s[k:L] ??? \n\n   But that doesn't match.\n\n   I think there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\n   Let me look at the example: \n        \"abrakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        Here, the first message is \"abrakadabra\", then the second message is \"abrakadabra\". The error: the last 1 character of the first ('a') matches the first 1 of the second ('a'), so we drop the last 'a' of the first and then append the rest of the second: \"abrakadabra\" (without the last 'a') -> \"abrakadabr\", then append \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        So the entire string is: \n            s[0:L] + s[k:L]   -> but wait, that is not correct: \n                s[0:L] is \"abrakadabra\", then we drop the last k characters and then append the entire second copy? \n\n        Actually, the process is: \n            You send s and then s. But at the junction, the last k of the first and the first k of the second are the same, so you effectively replace the last k characters of the first copy with nothing and then the second copy is appended from the k-th character onward.\n\n        So the resulting string is: \n            t = s[0:L-k] + s[k:L] + s[k:L]   ??? \n\n        No, that would be s[0:L-k] + s[k:] + s[k:], which is not matching.\n\n   Let me simulate for \"abrakadabra\", k=1:\n\n        First copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Second copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n\n        The junction: the last 1 of first is 'a', the first 1 of second is 'a'. So we keep the first copy's first L-k = 10 characters, and then append the second copy's part starting at index1: \"brakadabra\".\n\n        So t = \"abrakadabr\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters.\n\n        But wait, the first copy was originally 11 characters, we removed the last one, so we have 10 from the first copy, and then 10 from the second copy? Actually, the second copy is appended from index1 to the end (10 characters). So total length = 10 + 10 = 20, but we have 21.\n\n        Actually, the first copy's kept part is from 0 to L-k-1, which is 0 to 10-1-1 = 8 -> \"abrakadab\", then the second copy's part from index1 to the end is \"brakadabra\", so \"abrakadab\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabbrakadabra\", which is 18 characters.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n   Let me count manually for \"abrakadabra\" (11 characters) with k=1:\n\n        The first copy is written as: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Then the second copy is written, but the first character of the second copy is 'a', which is the same as the last character of the first copy. So the last character of the first copy is overwritten by the first character of the second copy. \n\n        Then the resulting string is: \n            The first copy without the last character: \"abrakadabr\", and then the second copy without the first character: \"brakadabra\", but wait, the second copy's first character is merged, so we don't write it again? \n\n        So the entire string is \"abrakadabr\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters.\n\n        How many characters",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by two identical strings `s` merged with an overlap (as per the problem's error condition). The overlap must be a positive number of characters less than the length of `s`. If such an `s` exists, we should output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by concatenating two copies of `s` but with a suffix of the first copy merging into a prefix of the second copy. The merged part (overlap) must be non-zero and less than the length of `s`.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `L` of `s`, we check if there exists an overlap `k` (1 ≤ k < L) such that:\n   - The first `L` characters of `t` form `s`.\n   - The remaining part of `t` (from position `L` onwards) matches the substring of `s` starting from index `k` to the end.\n   - The last `k` characters of `s` must match the first `k` characters of `s` (the overlapping condition).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over possible lengths `L` from `ceil((n + 1)/2)` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `t`). For each `L`, compute the overlap `k = 2*L - n`. If `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k < L), then verify the conditions mentioned above.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible `L` in O(n) time for each candidate (due to string slicing and comparisons), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    found = False\n    for L in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n            \n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n                found = True\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                break\n                \n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: The loop runs from `ceil((n + 1)/2)` to `n-1` to consider all potential lengths `L` of the original message `s`.\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: For each `L`, the overlap `k` is calculated as `2*L - n`. If `k` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ k < L), the loop continues.\n4. **Candidate Validation**: The candidate `s` is derived as the first `L` characters of `t`. The remaining part of `t` must match the substring of `s` starting from `k`. Additionally, the last `k` characters of `s` must match the first `k` characters of `s`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, \"YES\" and `s` are printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed after the loop completes without finding any valid `s`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical strings `s` with a valid overlap, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
