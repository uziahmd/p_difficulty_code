Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters) and we need to form as many pairs as possible.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that a '?' in either string can match any color.\n 2. We want to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n However, note: each boot can be used at most once.\n\n Approach:\n We can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n Part 1: Matching specific colors and wildcards.\n\n But note: the problem has two types of boots: left and right, and we have two strings.\n\n Since we have up to 150000 boots, we cannot try all possibilities.\n\n Observation:\n There are two kinds of boots: those with letters and those with '?'. The '?' can match anything.\n\n We can consider:\n\n  - First, we can try to match as many '?' with letters? But note: sometimes matching a '?' might block a better match.\n\n However, note: the problem requires maximum pairs. We can use greedy or two-phase matching.\n\n Another idea:\n\n Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter in both left and right boots, but also account for '?'.\n\n But note: we must output the actual pairs, not just the count.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can consider:\n\n  a) Match as many fixed letters as possible (ignoring the '?' for now). Then, use the remaining '?' to match.\n\n However, we have to assign without conflict.\n\n But note: the problem has two arrays, one for left and one for right. We cannot simply match by frequency because the indices matter.\n\n We can do:\n\n  1. We are allowed to use each boot only once.\n\n  2. We want to form pairs. Each pair is (left boot i, right boot j) such that:\n        (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n  Actually, note: \n      - If l[i] is a letter and r[j] is a letter, then they must be equal.\n      - If l[i] is '?' and r[j] is a letter, then it's okay (because '?' matches any letter).\n      - Similarly, if l[i] is a letter and r[j] is '?', then it's okay.\n\n  So the condition is: \n      compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n  But note: the condition can be simplified. In fact, if we define:\n      For left boot i: \n          if l[i] != '?' then it is a specific color c_i = l[i]\n          else, it can be any color.\n\n      Similarly for right boot j.\n\n  The compatibility condition is: \n      (l[i] == '?' OR r[j] == '?' OR l[i] == r[j])\n\n  However, wait: if we have two letters, then they must be equal. And if one is '?' then it matches regardless. So the condition is:\n\n      (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') -> no, wait: if l[i]=='?' then it matches any, including when r[j] is '?'. Similarly, if r[j]=='?' then it matches any.\n\n  Actually, we can write:\n\n      if l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?':\n          compatible\n      else:\n          compatible if l[i] == r[j]\n\n  But note: the above condition is equivalent to the condition above, because if both are '?' then we have the first branch. Also, if one is '?' then we don't care about the other. And if none is '?', then we require equality.\n\n  However, note: the above condition is exactly:\n\n      (l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?') or (l[i] != '?' and r[j] != '?' and l[i]==r[j])\n\n  We can combine:\n\n      (l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?') or (l[i] == r[j] and l[i]!='?' and r[j]!='?')\n\n  But note: the condition \"l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?'\" already covers the cases where at least one is wildcard, and then we don't care about the other. Then, the second part is for when neither is wildcard and they must be equal.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      if l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?':\n          True\n      else:\n          l[i] == r[j]\n\n  This is simpler.\n\n Now, how to form the maximum number of pairs?\n\n We have two arrays: left boots and right boots.\n\n We can think of this as a bipartite graph matching, but n can be up to 150000, so we cannot use general matching algorithms (like Hopcroft–Karp or DFS-based for bipartite matching) which are O(n^2) or worse.\n\n However, note: the problem also requires to output the actual pairs.\n\n Let's break the problem:\n\n  There are two types of boots: fixed and wildcards.\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  1. We will try to match as many fixed boots as possible, then use wildcards to cover the rest.\n\n  But note: a '?' in left can match a fixed color in the right, and vice versa.\n\n  However, we have to maximize the total pairs.\n\n  Idea:\n\n  Step 1: Create two lists for left and right, but we have to remember the index.\n\n  Step 2: We can split the boots:\n\n      Left boots: \n          fixed_left: list of (index, color) for each left boot with color not '?'\n          wild_left: list of indices for left boots with '?' \n\n      Similarly for right:\n          fixed_right: list of (index, color) for each right boot with color not '?'\n          wild_right: list of indices for right boots with '?' \n\n  But note: the condition for matching is:\n\n      - A fixed_left boot (color c) can match a fixed_right boot of color c, or a wild_right boot (any).\n      - Similarly, a fixed_right boot (color c) can match a fixed_left boot of color c, or a wild_left boot (any).\n\n      - A wild_left boot can match any right boot (fixed or wildcard) and similarly wild_right can match any left boot.\n\n  However, we want the maximum matching.\n\n  How to maximize?\n\n  We can use:\n\n      Step 1: First, match as many fixed boots as possible.\n\n      Step 2: Then, use the wildcards to cover the rest.\n\n  But wait: what if we have a fixed boot that cannot be matched by another fixed boot, but can be matched by a wildcard? Then we might leave out the fixed boot and use the wildcard for something else? \n\n  However, note: we are allowed to use wildcards for fixed boots. The goal is to maximize the total pairs.\n\n  Actually, we can use a two-step greedy:\n\n  1. We want to match the fixed boots only with boots that are fixed and of the same color, and also with wildcards, but we have to decide which ones to use.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n      Total pairs = minimum between (n, ...) but we can form at most n pairs.\n\n  However, we have two sides. The problem is symmetric.\n\n  Another idea: \n\n      We can use a greedy algorithm that considers:\n\n        - We'll try to match fixed boots with fixed boots of the same color, but we have to be cautious: we might have more than n pairs if we use wildcards for everything, but n is the total.\n\n      Actually, the maximum pairs is at most n.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. We can match a fixed boot (on left) with a fixed boot (on right) of the same color, but we have to do it without conflict.\n\n  2. Then, the remaining unmatched fixed boots can be matched with wildcards.\n\n  3. Then, the remaining wildcards can be matched with each other.\n\n  However, we have to maximize the total. So we should use wildcards for unmatched fixed boots first, and then for the leftover wildcards.\n\n  But note: a wildcard in left can match a wildcard in right, but also a wildcard in left can match a fixed boot (if we haven't used that fixed boot) and vice versa.\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      We are going to form:\n\n        Let M = set of indices for left boots and right boots.\n\n        We want to assign as many pairs as possible.\n\n  We can use:\n\n      Step 1: Count the frequency of each fixed color in left and right, and then match the fixed boots as much as possible.\n\n      But wait: the fixed boots might be of different colors, and we can only match same colors.\n\n      However, we can use wildcards to match the fixed boots that don't have a same color fixed counterpart.\n\n      But note: if we have a fixed left boot 'a' and there is no fixed right boot 'a', then we can use a wildcard in the right to match it. Similarly, if there is a fixed right boot 'a' and no fixed left boot 'a', then we can use a wildcard in the left to match it.\n\n      However, we have to consider that a wildcard can only be used once.\n\n  We can break the problem into:\n\n      Let F be the set of fixed boots (both left and right). We can form a bipartite graph for fixed boots: an edge from left fixed boot (c) to right fixed boot (d) if c==d.\n\n      Then, we can compute the maximum matching on the fixed boots. But note, we are not limited to fixed boots only: we can use wildcards to match fixed boots.\n\n      Actually, the problem is similar to: we have two sets of items (left and right) and we can match:\n\n          - Any fixed left boot with a fixed right boot of the same color (if available)\n          - Any fixed left boot with a wildcard right boot (if available)\n          - Any fixed right boot with a wildcard left boot (if available)\n          - Any wildcard left boot with a wildcard right boot (if available)\n\n      But note: we cannot match a fixed boot with a wildcard boot if we have a better use (i.e., matching two fixed boots of the same color is always better because then we don't use a wildcard).\n\n      However, we are trying to maximize the total pairs.\n\n      We can use:\n\n          Let X = number of fixed boots that we can match with fixed boots (same color). Then, the remaining fixed boots can be matched with wildcards.\n\n          Then, the total pairs would be: X + (number of fixed boots matched with wildcards) + (pairs formed by wildcards alone)\n\n      But note: a wildcard left boot can match a fixed right boot (if the fixed one isn't matched by a fixed one) OR a wildcard right boot.\n\n      Similarly, a wildcard right boot can match a fixed left boot OR a wildcard left boot.\n\n      However, we have to avoid double counting.\n\n  Another idea: use a greedy matching that goes in two phases:\n\n      Phase 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots of the same color.\n\n        We can use a dictionary to count the fixed boots on the left and right for each color.\n\n        But note: we have to remember the indices.\n\n        Steps for phase 1:\n\n          For each color c:\n\n            Let L[c] = list of indices (in left) that are fixed and have color c.\n            Let R[c] = list of indices (in right) that are fixed and have color c.\n\n          Then, we can match min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|) pairs for color c.\n\n          However, we have to assign specific indices.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            For each color c:\n                Let k = min(len(L[c]), len(R[c]))\n                Then, take the first k from L[c] and match them with the first k from R[c] (but we must preserve order? Actually, we just need to output the pairs, so we can match arbitrarily).\n\n          But note: we are going to record the pairs, so we need to mark these indices as used.\n\n      Phase 2: Match remaining fixed boots with wildcards.\n\n        After phase 1, we have:\n\n          Fixed left boots that are not matched: these are the fixed left boots that were not matched in phase 1.\n\n          Similarly, fixed right boots that are not matched.\n\n        Now, we can use wildcards to match these fixed boots.\n\n        However, we have two types of wildcards: left wildcards and right wildcards.\n\n        We can form:\n\n          For each fixed left boot (that wasn't matched) that has color c, we can match it with any wildcard right boot (since wildcard right boot can accept any color). Similarly, we can match fixed right boots with wildcard left boots.\n\n        But note: we have a limited number of wildcards.\n\n        However, we are going to use the wildcards to cover the remaining fixed boots. We can also use wildcards to cover wildcards.\n\n        But note: we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        The total pairs we can form is:\n\n          base = sum_{c} min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|)   [from phase 1]\n\n          Then, we can use wildcards to match:\n\n            Let A = number of unmatched fixed left boots (which we can match with wildcard right boots)\n            Let B = number of unmatched fixed right boots (which we can match with wildcard left boots)\n\n          However, we have:\n\n            Let W_l = number of wildcard left boots (indices)\n            Let W_r = number of wildcard right boots\n\n          Then, the remaining pairs we can form from fixed boots and wildcards is:\n\n            We can match each unmatched fixed left boot with a wildcard right boot (if available) and vice versa.\n\n          But note: we cannot use the same wildcard twice.\n\n          So, we can form up to min(A, W_r) additional pairs from unmatched fixed left boots and wildcard right boots, and min(B, W_l) additional pairs from unmatched fixed right boots and wildcard left boots.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the same wildcard cannot be used twice.\n\n          Also, we can also form pairs between wildcards and wildcards.\n\n        Actually, the entire problem can be viewed as:\n\n          We have two sets: \n            Left: fixed boots (with colors) and wildcard boots (with no color)\n            Right: fixed boots and wildcard boots.\n\n          We want to form pairs such that:\n\n            Condition: (left boot is fixed and right boot is fixed and same color) OR (left boot is fixed and right boot is wildcard) OR (left boot is wildcard and right boot is fixed) OR (both wildcard)\n\n          We are allowed to use each boot once.\n\n          The maximum pairs is:\n\n            base = matching from fixed boots (same color) as above.\n\n            Then, the remaining fixed boots (both left and right) can be matched with wildcards, but the wildcards are shared.\n\n          However, we can also use the wildcards to match the fixed boots, and then the remaining wildcards can be matched together.\n\n          The total pairs = base + (number of fixed left boots that are matched with wildcards) + (number of fixed right boots that are matched with wildcards) + (pairs from wildcards)\n\n          But note: when we use a wildcard in left for a fixed right boot, that uses one wildcard and one fixed right boot. Similarly for wildcard in right for a fixed left boot.\n\n          Then, after matching as many fixed boots as possible, we are left with:\n\n            Let U_l = unmatched fixed left boots (we can match these with wildcards on the right)\n            Let U_r = unmatched fixed right boots (we can match these with wildcards on the left)\n\n            And let W_l_remaining = W_l - (wildcard left boots used so far) -> but initially we haven't used any wildcards, so W_l_remaining = W_l, and similarly W_r_remaining = W_r.\n\n          Then, we can form:\n\n            Step 2a: Match as many of the unmatched fixed left boots as possible with the wildcard right boots (up to min(U_l, W_r))\n\n            Step 2b: Similarly, match as many of the unmatched fixed right boots as possible with the wildcard left boots (up to min(U_r, W_l))\n\n            Then, the remaining wildcards (after step 2a and 2b) can be matched together: min(W_l_remaining_after_2b, W_r_remaining_after_2a)\n\n          But note: we have to assign the same set of wildcards for both steps.\n\n          Actually, we have to consider:\n\n            Let x = number of wildcard right boots used to match unmatched fixed left boots (from step 2a)\n            Let y = number of wildcard left boots used to match unmatched fixed right boots (from step 2b)\n\n            Then, the remaining wildcards for matching together are:\n\n                W_l_remaining = W_l - y\n                W_r_remaining = W_r - x\n\n            Then, we can form min(W_l_remaining, W_r_remaining) pairs from wildcards.\n\n          However, we can also interleave the matching? Actually, we are free to assign the wildcards arbitrarily.\n\n          But note: we want the maximum total pairs. The total pairs from wildcards (including matching with fixed) is:\n\n            base (from same-color fixed) + \n            (min(U_l, W_r) + min(U_r, W_l))   [but wait, we cannot use the same wildcard twice, so actually we have to use the wildcards without overlapping]\n\n          Actually, the total pairs we can form is:\n\n            base + min(U_l + U_r, W_l + W_r) + ...? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a two-step:\n\n            Step 1: base (matching same-color fixed boots)\n\n            Step 2: We have two sets of boots that are not matched:\n\n                Set A: unmatched fixed left boots (size = U_l)\n                Set B: unmatched fixed right boots (size = U_r)\n                Set C: wildcard left boots (size = W_l)\n                Set D: wildcard right boots (size = W_r)\n\n            Now, we can form pairs between:\n\n                A and D (any element in A with any in D) -> but we can form at most min(U_l, W_r) pairs.\n                B and C (any element in B with any in C) -> min(U_r, W_l) pairs.\n\n            But note: we can also form pairs between C and D (wildcard with wildcard) but we have to reserve some for A and B.\n\n            Actually, the maximum pairs we can form from A, B, C, D is:\n\n                base + min(U_l + U_r, W_l + W_r)   ??? \n\n            But wait, we cannot mix arbitrarily: a wildcard left boot can only be matched to a right boot (either fixed unmatched or wildcard). Similarly, a wildcard right boot can only be matched to a left boot (either fixed unmatched or wildcard).\n\n            However, the fixed unmatched boots (A and B) are independent. \n\n            So, we can form:\n\n                Let x = min(U_l, W_r)   [matching fixed left unmatched with wildcard right]\n                Let y = min(U_r, W_l)   [matching fixed right unmatched with wildcard left]\n\n            Then, the remaining wildcards are:\n\n                W_l_remaining = W_l - y\n                W_r_remaining = W_r - x\n\n            Then, we can form z = min(W_l_remaining, W_r_remaining) pairs from the wildcards.\n\n            Therefore, total pairs = base + x + y + z.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to assign the wildcards arbitrarily. However, we must ensure that we don't use a wildcard twice.\n\n          However, we have to assign the pairs in a way that doesn't conflict.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require to output the pairs in a particular order, but we must output the pairs and the indices.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      We need to:\n\n        1. Read n, then two strings l and r.\n\n        2. Separate the indices for fixed and wildcard in left and right.\n\n        3. For fixed boots, we group by color.\n\n        4. For each color c, we match min(L[c], R[c]) pairs. We have to remember which indices we use.\n\n        5. Then, we have:\n\n            unmatched_fixed_left: all fixed left boots that were not matched (by color, we remove the matched ones from the list for each color)\n\n            unmatched_fixed_right: similarly for right.\n\n            wild_left: list of indices for left boots that are '?'\n            wild_right: list of indices for right boots that are '?'\n\n        6. Then, we can form:\n\n            x = min(len(unmatched_fixed_left), len(wild_right))\n            y = min(len(unmatched_fixed_right), len(wild_left))\n\n            Then, we use x wild_right boots for unmatched_fixed_left, and y wild_left boots for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n            Then, the remaining wild_left = wild_left without the y ones, and remaining wild_right = wild_right without the x ones.\n\n            Then, z = min(len(remaining_wild_left), len(remaining_wild_right))\n\n        7. Total pairs = base + x + y + z.\n\n        8. Then, we output the pairs.\n\n      However, we must output the pairs in the order of the indices? Actually, the problem does not specify the order, but we must output each pair (a_j, b_j) and the indices must be distinct.\n\n      But note: the input indices are from 1 to n (the i-th character is at position i). Our lists are built by index (we stored the index of the boot).\n\n      But wait: in our grouping by color, we removed the matched fixed boots. Then, we need to know the exact indices.\n\n      Steps for storing:\n\n        We can store for each color the list of indices (the position in the string, note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices).\n\n        Then, for phase 1: for each color c, we match the smallest index in L[c] with the smallest index in R[c]? Or we can just take the first min(L[c], R[c]) from each list. But note: the problem does not require a particular matching, so we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n        However, we must output the pairs in increasing order of left boot index? Actually, the example output does not specify. But the problem says: \"The j-th of these lines should contain the index a_j of the left boot in the j-th pair and index b_j of the right boot in the j-th pair.\"\n\n        The example outputs are:\n\n          Input: \"10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree\" -> output: \"5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1\"\n\n          But wait, the example input is provided in the example test, but the example test has multiple inputs. Actually, the example test is:\n\n          Example Input 1:\n            10\n            codeforces\n            dodivthree\n\n          Example Output 1:\n            5\n            7 8\n            4 9\n            2 2\n            9 10\n            3 1\n\n          However, the example input 2,3,4 are also provided.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"The following k lines should contain pairs a_j, b_j (1<=a_j, b_j<=n). The j-th of these lines should contain the index a_j of the left boot in the j-th pair and index b_j of the right boot in the j-th pair.\"\n\n        The example output does not specify the order. We can output in any order.\n\n        However, we must output the pairs without using a boot more than once.\n\n      Steps to output:\n\n        We have four types of pairs:\n\n          Type 1: fixed-fixed (from phase 1): (left_index, right_index)\n          Type 2: unmatched_fixed_left with wildcard_right: (left_index, right_index) [here, the left boot is fixed, the right boot is wildcard]\n          Type 3: unmatched_fixed_right with wildcard_left: (left_index, right_index) [here, the left boot is wildcard, the right boot is fixed]\n          Type 4: wildcard_left with wildcard_right: (left_index, right_index)\n\n        We have to collect all these pairs.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the order, so we can output in any order.\n\n        However, we must use the indices as given (the i-th character is at index i, which we store as i+1? Actually, the problem indexes from 1 to n.\n\n        Our input: the first character is the first boot, so index 0 in the string corresponds to index 1.\n\n        We stored the indices as the position in the string (0-indexed) plus one? Actually, we can store the original index (1-indexed) or use the index from the input.\n\n        Let me read the input:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          l = input().strip()\n          r = input().strip()\n\n        Then, we can iterate:\n\n          For left boot i (0-indexed), the color is l[i] and the index is i+1.\n\n        So, we store the index as i+1.\n\n        We need to build:\n\n          fixed_left: list of (index, color) for each i where l[i] != '?'\n          wild_left: list of indices (index) for each i where l[i]=='?'\n\n          Similarly for right.\n\n        Then, for phase 1, we group fixed_left by color.\n\n        Then, for each color c, we take the list of indices for fixed_left and fixed_right.\n\n        Then, we sort the two lists? Actually, we don't care about the order, but we must not use the same index twice.\n\n        However, we are going to use the smallest indices? Or we can use arbitrary. But note: the problem does not require a particular order.\n\n        But note: the example output uses the left boot index and the right boot index. We must output the left boot index and the right boot index.\n\n        How to match fixed boots of the same color? We can match arbitrarily, but we must not use the same index twice.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          For each color c:\n            Sort the list of fixed_left indices for c and fixed_right indices for c.\n            Then, for j in range(min(len(L[c]), len(R[c]))):\n                left_index = L[c][j]\n                right_index = R[c][j]\n                Then, we mark these indices as used (and we remove them from the unmatched_fixed_left and unmatched_fixed_right, and also from the lists for color c).\n\n        Then, for the unmatched_fixed_left, we have the fixed_left indices that were not matched (for all colors).\n\n        Similarly for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n        Then, we form:\n\n          For the unmatched_fixed_left: we have a list of indices (these are the left boots that are fixed and not matched). We can sort them arbitrarily.\n\n          Similarly, for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n        Then, for step 2a: we take the first min(len(unmatched_fixed_left), len(wild_right)) from unmatched_fixed_left and the same number from wild_right (we can take the smallest indices? or any). But note: the problem does not require a particular order.\n\n        However, we must output the pairs: (left_index, right_index). The left_index comes from the unmatched_fixed_left and the right_index from wild_right.\n\n        Similarly, for step 2b: we take the first min(len(unmatched_fixed_right), len(wild_left)) from unmatched_fixed_right and the same from wild_left.\n\n        Then, for step 4: we take the remaining wild_left and wild_right and match them arbitrarily (minimum number of pairs is min(len(remaining_wild_left), len(remaining_wild_right)), and we can take the smallest indices.\n\n      But wait: we have to remember that the wild_left and wild_right are stored as lists of indices (the original index, 1-indexed). \n\n      However, we have to avoid using the same index twice.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read input.\n\n        Step 2: Build:\n\n          fixed_left = []   # list of (index, color) for each i where l[i] != '?'\n          wild_left = []    # list of index for each i where l[i]=='?' (only index)\n\n          Similarly for right.\n\n        Step 3: Group fixed_left by color: dict: color -> list of indices (the index is the 1-indexed position)\n\n        Step 4: For each color c in fixed_left:\n\n            L_list = fixed_left_group[c]\n            R_list = fixed_right_group.get(c, [])\n            k = min(len(L_list), len(R_list))\n            Then, we take the first k from L_list and R_list (but we must preserve the order? Actually, we can sort the lists by index? Or we can take the smallest indices? The problem does not specify, so we can take arbitrarily.\n\n            But note: the problem does not specify the order of the pairs, so we can output in any order.\n\n            However, we must not use the same index twice.\n\n            We can sort the lists for each color by index and then take the first k.\n\n        Step 5: Now, update:\n\n            unmatched_fixed_left = []\n            for c in fixed_left_group:\n                original_list = fixed_left_group[c]\n                matched_count = min(len(original_list), len(fixed_right_group.get(c, [])))\n                # We remove the first matched_count from original_list, and the rest are unmatched_fixed_left for this color?\n                # But wait, we have stored fixed_left_group[c] as the entire list. We need to remove the matched ones.\n\n            Actually, we should not store the entire list and then remove, but we can build unmatched_fixed_left by:\n\n                unmatched_fixed_left = []\n                for c in fixed_left_group:\n                    lst = fixed_left_group[c]\n                    # We are going to match min(lst, fixed_right_group[c]) pairs, but we need to remove the matched ones from lst and then the rest are unmatched_fixed_left for this color.\n\n            Alternatively, we can:\n\n                matched_pairs = []   # list of tuples (left_index, right_index) for phase 1\n\n                for c in set(list(fixed_left_group.keys()) + list(fixed_right_group.keys())):\n                    L_list = fixed_left_group.get(c, [])\n                    R_list = fixed_right_group.get(c, [])\n                    L_list.sort()\n                    R_list.sort()\n                    k = min(len(L_list), len(R_list))\n                    for i in range(k):\n                        # Use the i-th element of L_list and R_list\n                        left_idx = L_list[i]\n                        right_idx = R_list[i]\n                        # Record this pair\n                        matched_pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n                        # Remove these from the original groups? Actually, we don't need the groups anymore.\n\n                Then, we can build unmatched_fixed_left and unmatched_fixed_right from the original fixed_left and fixed_right, removing the matched pairs.\n\n            But wait: we don't have the entire fixed_left and fixed_right stored as sets. We stored by color.\n\n            Alternatively, we can:\n\n                fixed_left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n                for i, char in enumerate(l):\n                    idx = i+1\n                    if char != '?':\n                        fixed_left_dict[char].append(idx)\n\n                fixed_right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n                for i, char in enumerate(r):\n                    idx = i+1\n                    if char != '?':\n                        fixed_right_dict[char].append(idx)\n\n                Then, we can do:\n\n                base_pairs = []\n\n                for c in set(list(fixed_left_dict.keys()) | list(fixed_right_dict.keys())):\n                    L_list = fixed_left_dict.get(c, [])\n                    R_list = fixed_right_dict.get(c, [])\n                    L_list.sort()\n                    R_list.sort()\n                    k = min(len(L_list), len(R_list))\n                    for i in range(k):\n                        base_pairs.append( (L_list[i], R_list[i]) )\n\n                Then, we need to know the unmatched_fixed_left: we can create a set of all fixed_left indices and subtract the left indices that are in base_pairs.\n\n                Similarly for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n                But note: the base_pairs uses the smallest indices for the same color? Actually, we sort by index and take the smallest ones.\n\n            However, we must output the pairs and we don't care about the order, but we have to make sure that we don't use an index twice.\n\n        Step 6: Then, we have:\n\n            unmatched_fixed_left_indices = set(all_fixed_left_indices) - set(left_side for (left_side, right_side) in base_pairs)\n            unmatched_fixed_right_indices = set(all_fixed_right_indices) - set(right_side for (left_side, right_side) in base_pairs)\n\n            But wait: the base_pairs uses the smallest indices for the same color? Actually, we sorted and took the smallest. Then, the unmatched_fixed_left_indices will be the larger indices for that color.\n\n            Then, we have:\n\n                wild_left_indices = [i+1 for i, char in enumerate(l) if char=='?']   # but wait: we built fixed_left_dict from non '?', so we can also build wild_left_indices by iterating the string.\n\n            Actually, we can build:\n\n                wild_left_indices = []\n                for i, char in enumerate(l):\n                    if char == '?':\n                        wild_left_indices.append(i+1)\n\n                Similarly for wild_right_indices.\n\n            Then, we have:\n\n                unmatched_fixed_left = unmatched_fixed_left_indices   # set of indices\n                unmatched_fixed_right = unmatched_fixed_right_indices   # set of indices\n\n            Then, we can form:\n\n                x = min(len(unmatched_fixed_left), len(wild_right_indices))\n\n                Then, we choose x pairs from unmatched_fixed_left and wild_right_indices.\n\n                Similarly for y.\n\n            But note: we must not use the same wildcard twice. So we have to remove the wildcards that are used.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                # For step 2a: match unmatched_fixed_left with wild_right_indices\n                # We can take the smallest x from unmatched_fixed_left and the smallest x from wild_right_indices? Or we can take arbitrarily.\n\n                # Since the problem does not specify the order, we can take the smallest indices for the left and the smallest for the right? But note: the left index must be from unmatched_fixed_left and the right index from wild_right_indices.\n\n                # However, we are going to output the pairs. It doesn't matter the order.\n\n                # But note: we have to avoid using the same index twice.\n\n                # We can do:\n\n                #   Sort unmatched_fixed_left and wild_right_indices, and then take the first x from each.\n\n                # Then, the remaining unmatched_fixed_left is the rest.\n\n                # Similarly for step 2b.\n\n            Alternatively, we can:\n\n                # Step 2a: \n                unmatched_fixed_left_sorted = sorted(unmatched_fixed_left)\n                wild_right_sorted = sorted(wild_right_indices)\n                x = min(len(unmatched_fixed_left_sorted), len(wild_right_sorted))\n                type2_pairs = []\n                for i in range(x):\n                    type2_pairs.append( (unmatched_fixed_left_sorted[i], wild_right_sorted[i]) )\n\n                Then, update unmatched_fixed_left = unmatched_fixed_left_sorted[x:]\n                wild_right_indices = wild_right_sorted[x:]\n\n                Step 2b:\n                unmatched_fixed_right_sorted = sorted(unmatched_fixed_right)\n                wild_left_sorted = sorted(wild_left_indices)\n                y = min(len(unmatched_fixed_right_sorted), len(wild_left_sorted))\n                type3_pairs = []\n                for i in range(y):\n                    type3_pairs.append( (wild_left_sorted[i], unmatched_fixed_right_sorted[i]) )   # note: here the left boot is wildcard and the right boot is fixed.\n\n                Then, update wild_left_indices = wild_left_sorted[y:]\n                unmatched_fixed_right = unmatched_fixed_right_sorted[y:]\n\n                Then, step 4: \n                type4_pairs = []\n                z = min(len(wild_left_indices), len(wild_right_indices))\n                for i in range(z):\n                    type4_pairs.append( (wild_left_sorted[i], wild_right_sorted[i]) )   # but wait, we have updated wild_left_indices and wild_right_indices above, so we should use the remaining parts.\n\n                Actually, after step 2a and 2b, the remaining wild_left_indices is the part of wild_left_sorted from y to the end, and wild_right_indices is the part from x to the end.\n\n                Then, we can do:\n\n                    z = min(len(wild_left_indices), len(wild_right_indices))\n                    for i in range(z):\n                        type4_pairs.append( (wild_left_indices[i], wild_right_indices[i]) )\n\n            Then, total pairs = base_pairs (from phase1) + type2_pairs (x) + type3_pairs (y) + type4_pairs (z)\n\n            Then, we output the total pairs, and then the pairs.\n\n            But note: the pairs must be output in the order of the left boot index? Actually, the problem does not specify.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that a specific color must match exactly, while an indefinite color ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching left and right boots based on their colors. The key observation is that '?' in either boot can match any color, including other '?' or specific colors. The goal is to form the maximum number of pairs without reusing any boot.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves three main steps:\n   - **Phase 1**: Match fixed colors (non-'?') between left and right boots. For each color, match the smallest indices first to ensure optimal use of resources.\n   - **Phase 2**: Match remaining fixed boots with wildcard boots. Fixed left boots can be matched with wildcard right boots, and vice versa.\n   - **Phase 3**: Match leftover wildcard boots with each other.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Grouping by Color**: Group left and right boots by their colors (excluding '?') and sort their indices to facilitate matching.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: Use a greedy approach to match as many fixed boots as possible first, then handle the wildcards efficiently by matching them with unmatched fixed boots or other wildcards.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot in linear time for grouping and sorting, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is feasible given the constraint n ≤ 150,000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    fixed_left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    wild_left_indices = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        idx = i + 1\n        if char == '?':\n            wild_left_indices.append(idx)\n        else:\n            fixed_left_dict[char].append(idx)\n            \n    fixed_right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    wild_right_indices = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        idx = i + 1\n        if char == '?':\n            wild_right_indices.append(idx)\n        else:\n            fixed_right_dict[char].append(idx)\n            \n    base_pairs = []\n    all_colors = set(fixed_left_dict.keys()) | set(fixed_right_dict.keys())\n    for c in all_colors:\n        L_list = fixed_left_dict.get(c, [])\n        R_list = fixed_right_dict.get(c, [])\n        L_list.sort()\n        R_list.sort()\n        k = min(len(L_list), len(R_list))\n        for i in range(k):\n            base_pairs.append((L_list[i], R_list[i]))\n            \n    used_left_in_base = set()\n    for left_idx, _ in base_pairs:\n        used_left_in_base.add(left_idx)\n        \n    used_right_in_base = set()\n    for _, right_idx in base_pairs:\n        used_right_in_base.add(right_idx)\n        \n    unmatched_fixed_left = set(fixed_left_dict.keys()) & set(fixed_left_dict.keys())\n    for c in fixed_left_dict:\n        lst = fixed_left_dict[c]\n        for idx in lst:\n            if idx in used_left_in_base:\n                unmatched_fixed_left.discard(idx)\n                \n    unmatched_fixed_right = set(fixed_right_dict.keys()) & set(fixed_right_dict.keys())\n    for c in fixed_right_dict:\n        lst = fixed_right_dict[c]\n        for idx in lst:\n            if idx in used_right_in_base:\n                unmatched_fixed_right.discard(idx)\n                \n    unmatched_fixed_left_indices = []\n    for c in fixed_left_dict:\n        for idx in fixed_left_dict[c]:\n            if idx not in used_left_in_base:\n                unmatched_fixed_left_indices.append(idx)\n                \n    unmatched_fixed_right_indices = []\n    for c in fixed_right_dict:\n        for idx in fixed_right_dict[c]:\n            if idx not in used_right_in_base:\n                unmatched_fixed_right_indices.append(idx)\n                \n    unmatched_fixed_left_indices.sort()\n    unmatched_fixed_right_indices.sort()\n    wild_left_indices.sort()\n    wild_right_indices.sort()\n    \n    x = min(len(unmatched_fixed_left_indices), len(wild_right_indices))\n    type2_pairs = []\n    for i in range(x):\n        type2_pairs.append((unmatched_fixed_left_indices[i], wild_right_indices[i]))\n        \n    y = min(len(unmatched_fixed_right_indices), len(wild_left_indices))\n    type3_pairs = []\n    for i in range(y):\n        type3_pairs.append((wild_left_indices[i], unmatched_fixed_right_indices[i]))\n        \n    remaining_wild_left = [idx for i, idx in enumerate(wild_left_indices) if i >= y]\n    remaining_wild_right = [idx for i, idx in enumerate(wild_right_indices) if i >= x]\n    \n    z = min(len(remaining_wild_left), len(remaining_wild_right))\n    type4_pairs = []\n    for i in range(z):\n        type4_pairs.append((remaining_wild_left[i], remaining_wild_right[i]))\n        \n    total_pairs = base_pairs + type2_pairs + type3_pairs + type4_pairs\n    \n    result = []\n    for pair in total_pairs:\n        a, b = pair\n        result.append(f\"{a} {b}\")\n        \n    print(len(total_pairs))\n    for line in result:\n        print(line)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Grouping Boots**: Boots are grouped by their colors (excluding '?') into dictionaries, with lists of indices for each color. Wildcard boots are stored separately.\n3. **Phase 1 Matching**: For each color, match left and right boots by their color, using the smallest indices first to maximize the number of pairs.\n4. **Phase 2 Matching**: Match remaining fixed boots with wildcard boots. Fixed left boots are matched with wildcard right boots, and fixed right boots with wildcard left boots.\n5. **Phase 3 Matching**: Match leftover wildcard boots with each other.\n6. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's left and right boot indices.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging greedy matching and careful handling of wildcard boots.",
