His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n, x\n   list a of n integers (first tour points)\n   list b of n integers (second tour points)\n\n We know that Vasya is one of the participants, so there exists a pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not tell us which participant is Vasya. But we are guaranteed that Vasya was present.\n\n The idea:\n\n We have two lists: a (first tour) and b (second tour). Each participant has one first-tour score and one second-tour score.\n\n Since the jury can assign arbitrary places to those with the same total, we can consider:\n\n   Best place: We want to minimize the number of participants who have a total >= x? Actually, no.\n\n Let's reframe:\n\n   We are to find two numbers: best and worst place for Vasya.\n\n How?\n\n   We know that Vasya has some total T = a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n   The overall ranking is by descending total, and ties can be broken arbitrarily.\n\n   To compute the best place (the highest rank, i.e., smallest number), we would like to maximize the number of participants that have a total strictly less than Vasya's. But note: even if we fix Vasya's total, the other participants can be arranged arbitrarily.\n\n   Actually, let's think:\n\n   Let S be the multiset of all pairs (a_i + b_j) for i, j from 0 to n-1? But note: each participant is fixed: the same participant has a fixed a_i and a fixed b_j. So actually, we have n participants, each with a fixed (a_i, b_i) [but wait: the input gives two separate lists, and the same index in the two lists corresponds to the same participant? Actually, no: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\", and we have two lists of n integers. But then it says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so there are n participants, and each participant has one score from the first list and one from the second list, but the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n   Therefore, we are allowed to assign any a_i to any b_j to form a participant? Actually, no: the problem states that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the order is arbitrary. However, we know that the two lists are given and correspond to the same set of participants, but without knowing which a_i goes with which b_i.\n\n   But note: the input does not specify that the i-th element of the first list is the same participant as the i-th element of the second list. In fact, the problem says: \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\", and the participants are given in arbitrary order.\n\n   Therefore, we can rearrange the second list arbitrarily? Actually, no: the two lists are independent, but we know there are n participants. So we can form any pairing? \n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning that the two lists are of the same n participants, but the assignment between the two lists is arbitrary. So we can assign each a_i to any b_j? Not exactly: each participant must appear once in the first list and once in the second list. Therefore, we have an array A and an array B, and we are allowed to form a participant set by matching each element of A to an element of B (each used exactly once). Then the total for a participant is the sum of the matched elements.\n\n   But note: Vasya is one of these participants. And we know that there is at least one pair (from the entire set) that has a total >= x. However, we don't know which one is Vasya. But wait, the problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x\". This condition is just to guarantee that Vasya was present.\n\n   However, the key is: we don't know Vasya's particular pair (a_i, b_j). But we do know that there exists a pair (which might be assigned to Vasya) that has total >= x.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require us to know which pair is Vasya. We are to compute the best and worst place that Vasya could have got. Since the assignment of the two lists to participants is arbitrary, we can choose any matching? Actually, no: the two lists are fixed, but the pairing is arbitrary. However, the entire set of participants is defined by the two lists. But wait: the problem says \"the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on the given points from two tours. The key insight is that the pairing between the first and second tour points can be arbitrary, which affects the participants' total points and thus their rankings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves two lists of integers representing points from the first and second tours. Each participant's total points are the sum of their points from both tours. The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) possible ranks Vasya could have, given that his total points are at least `x`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Best Place**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we need to maximize the number of participants with total points less than his. This involves pairing the highest possible points from the second list with the lowest possible points from the first list to form other participants' totals, thus minimizing the number of participants who could have higher totals than Vasya.\n   - **Worst Place**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we need to minimize the number of participants with total points less than his. This involves pairing the lowest possible points from the second list with the highest possible points from the first list to form other participants' totals, thus maximizing the number of participants who could have higher totals than Vasya.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Binary Search**: For each participant (Vasya), we use binary search to count how many other participants could have a higher total, based on the sorted lists.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time. The binary search operations for each participant take O(log n) time per operation, leading to an overall complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    def count_greater_or_equal(total):\n        idx1 = 0\n        idx2 = n-1\n        count = 0\n        while idx1 < n and idx2 >= 0:\n            if a_list[idx1] + b_list[idx2] >= total:\n                count += (idx2 + 1)\n                idx2 -= 1\n            else:\n                idx1 += 1\n        return count\n    \n    def count_less(total):\n        idx1 = n-1\n        idx2 = 0\n        count = 0\n        while idx1 >= 0 and idx2 < n:\n            if a_list[idx1] + b_list[idx2] < total:\n                count += (idx1 + 1)\n                idx1 -= 1\n            else:\n                idx2 += 1\n        return count\n\n    total_count = n\n    best_place = total_count + 1\n    worst_place = 0\n\n    low = 0\n    high = 2 * 10**5 + 10**5\n    candidate_total = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if mid >= x:\n            candidate_total = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    if candidate_total == -1:\n        candidate_total = x\n        \n    count_less_than_vasyas_total = count_less(candidate_total)\n    count_greater_or_equal_to_vasyas_total = count_greater_or_equal(candidate_total)\n\n    num_participants_with_less = count_less_than_vasyas_total\n    num_participants_with_more = count_greater_or_equal_to_vasyas_total\n\n    best_place = num_participants_with_less + 1\n    worst_place = n - num_participants_with_less\n\n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n` and the minimum required points `x`, followed by the two lists of points from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing during the binary search operations.\n3. **Binary Search for Minimum Total**: A binary search is used to find the smallest total points `candidate_total` that Vasya could have, ensuring it meets or exceeds `x`.\n4. **Counting Participants**: Two helper functions, `count_less` and `count_greater_or_equal`, are used to count the number of participants who could have totals less than or greater than or equal to Vasya's `candidate_total`. These counts help determine the best and worst possible ranks.\n5. **Determine Ranks**: The best place is calculated as the position Vasya would occupy if all participants with lower totals are ahead of him, while the worst place accounts for all participants with higher or equal totals being ahead.\n6. **Output**: The best and worst possible ranks are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible rankings by leveraging sorting and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
