He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The string is built in three steps:\n    - Step 1: A has a string of one or more 'a's.\n    - Step 2: B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's to the end.\n    - Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's (equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' OR both) to the end.\n\n Important constraints:\n   - The entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, note that step 3 appends 'c's, so if there's no 'c' then it's invalid? But wait, the condition says that C appends some number of 'c' (so at least one). So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", meaning after step 2. Then step 3 adds 'c's. So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n But note: what if the string does not contain all three? Then it's invalid.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, we can immediately output \"NO\".\n\n 2. The order of characters must be:\n    - All the 'a's must come first (from step 1).\n    - Then all the 'b's (from step 2).\n    - Then all the 'c's (from step 3).\n\n    Why? Because each step appends to the end. So the string should be non-decreasing in terms of the letters: first only 'a's, then only 'b's, then only 'c's.\n\n    But wait, what if there's an 'a' after a 'b'? That would break the condition. Similarly, an 'a' or 'b' after a 'c' is not allowed.\n\n    Therefore, the string must be divided into three segments: [a's] [b's] [c's].\n\n 3. Now, let:\n        count_a = number of 'a'\n        count_b = number of 'b'\n        count_c = number of 'c'\n\n 4. Condition on the number of 'c's: \n        count_c must be equal to count_a OR count_c must be equal to count_b.\n\n 5. However, note: the entire string must follow the order. So if we see any 'b' before an 'a', or any 'c' before an 'a' or 'b', then it's invalid.\n\n Steps to solve:\n\n Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n Step 2: Check the order: \n        We can traverse the string and ensure that:\n          - Once we leave the 'a' segment, we don't see an 'a' again.\n          - Once we leave the 'b' segment, we don't see a 'b' again.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check that the string is of the form: \n            [a...a][b...b][c...c]\n\n        We can do:\n            for i in range(len(s)):\n                if s[i] == 'b' and i != 0 and s[i-1] == 'a': then okay, but wait, we can have multiple a's then multiple b's.\n\n        Actually, we can check:\n            - The first occurrence of 'b' must come after the last 'a'.\n            - The first occurrence of 'c' must come after the last 'b'.\n\n        Or we can use:\n\n            valid_order = True\n            seen_b = False\n            seen_c = False\n\n            for char in s:\n                if char == 'a':\n                    if seen_b or seen_c:\n                        valid_order = False\n                        break\n                elif char == 'b':\n                    if seen_c:\n                        valid_order = False\n                        break\n                    seen_b = True\n                else: # char == 'c'\n                    seen_c = True\n\n        But note: the problem says that the string is built by appending, so the order should be non-decreasing. Actually, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense that we never go back to an earlier letter.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check that the string does not contain the sequences: \n            'ba', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb'\n\n        But actually, the only allowed transitions are: from 'a' to 'b', from 'b' to 'c', and within same letter.\n\n        However, note: the problem doesn't require that the letters are contiguous in the alphabet, but the order must be: first all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n        So we can also do:\n\n            if any(char in 'abc' for char in set(s)):  # This is just checking that all chars are in 'abc', which is given.\n\n            Then, we can split the string by non-decreasing order.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            sorted_string = sorted(s)   # which would be ['a'*count_a, 'b'*count_b, 'c'*count_c]\n            and then compare with the original string?\n\n        But wait: the condition requires that the string is built by appending, so the original order must be the same as the sorted_string.\n\n        However, note: the sorted string would be the same as the string if the string is already in non-decreasing order.\n\n        But we don't need to sort the entire string. We can check:\n\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                then invalid.\n\n        However, wait: the string is built by appending, so the original order is the same as the sorted order? \n\n        Example: \n            Original: \"aaabccc\" -> sorted is \"aaabccc\", so same.\n            Example: \"bbacc\": \n                sorted(\"bbacc\") -> ['a','b','b','c','c'] -> \"abbcc\", but the input is \"bbacc\". \n                These are different: \"bbacc\" vs \"abbcc\"\n\n        So if the string is not non-decreasing (i.e., the letters are in increasing order) then it's invalid.\n\n        Therefore, we can check:\n\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But wait: the sorted string is in alphabetical order, which is 'a','b','c'. And the problem says that the string is built by first having a's, then b's, then c's. So the sorted string (which is the lexicographically smallest) must be the same as the original string.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the string is built by appending, so the order must be non-decreasing. Therefore, the string must be sorted.\n\n        But note: what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? Then sorted is \"aabbcc\", same. What if the string is \"aabbc\"? Then sorted is \"aabbc\", same.\n\n        So condition 2: the string must be non-decreasing (i.e., sorted).\n\n Step 3: Then, check the counts:\n\n        Let n_a = count of 'a'\n        n_b = count of 'b'\n        n_c = count of 'c'\n\n        Condition: n_c must be equal to n_a or n_b.\n\n        But note: the problem says that C appends 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (in the entire string at the time of appending). \n\n        However, note: the entire string at the time of appending by C includes the original a's and the b's that were appended. Then C appends n_c 'c's.\n\n        But note: the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string at the time of C's turn is the string after step 2 (which is the initial a's and the appended b's). So the number of 'a' in the string at step 3 is still n_a (because C appends only 'c's), and the number of 'b' is n_b.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n Step 4: Also, we must have at least one of each.\n\n        Since we already checked that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c', we are good.\n\n But wait: what if the string does not have all three? Then we output \"NO\". \n\n However, note the problem says: \n        Step 1: A has a string of at least one 'a'.\n        Step 2: B appends at least one 'b'.\n        Step 3: C appends at least one 'c' (because the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b', and since the number of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, then the appended 'c's are at least 1).\n\n        So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Check if the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, \"NO\".\n        Step 2: Check that the string is non-decreasing (i.e., sorted). If not, \"NO\".\n        Step 3: Let n_a = count('a'), n_b = count('b'), n_c = count('c')\n        Step 4: Check if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b. If yes, \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n However, wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbbcccc\", then n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=4. Then n_c==n_a (4==4) -> YES.\n\n But consider: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\", then n_a=3, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n Example from the problem:\n\n        Input: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> n_c==n_a -> YES.\n\n        Input: \"bbacc\" -> \n            First, check for all three: \n                It has 'a','b','c'. \n            Then check if sorted? \n                Original: \"bbacc\"\n                Sorted: \"abbcc\" -> they are not the same -> NO.\n\n        Input: \"aabc\" ->\n            n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> n_c (1) is equal to n_b (1) -> YES.\n\n        Another example: \"aabbcc\" -> n_c=2, n_a=2, n_b=2 -> YES.\n\n        But wait, what about \"aab\"? \n            It doesn't have 'c', so step 1: missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\" is valid.\n\n        But consider: \"ab\" -> doesn't have 'c', so NO.\n\n        Example: \"abc\" -> \n            n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> n_c==n_a and n_c==n_b -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabbccc\" -> n_c=3, n_a=2, n_b=2 -> 3 !=2 and 3!=2 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> YES (as above).\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbcc\" -> n_c=2, n_a=3, n_b=3 -> 2 !=3 and 2 !=3 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbc\" -> n_c=1, n_a=3, n_b=3 -> 1 !=3 and 1 !=3 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbcccc\" -> n_c=4, n_a=3, n_b=3 -> 4 !=3 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbccccc\" -> n_c=5, n_a=3, n_b=3 -> 5 !=3 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbbccc\" -> n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=3 -> 3 !=4 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbbcccc\" -> n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=4 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbbcc\" -> n_c=2, n_a=4, n_b=4 -> 2 !=4 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbb\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" is valid.\n\n        However, wait: what if the string is \"abacaba\"? \n            This string does not have the non-decreasing property: \n                'a','b','a','c','a','b','a' -> has 'b' then 'a' later -> invalid.\n\n        So we must check the non-decreasing condition.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Check for existence of 'a','b','c'\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        Step 2: Check if the string is sorted (non-decreasing)\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        Step 3: Count the letters\n            n_a = s.count('a')\n            n_b = s.count('b')\n            n_c = s.count('c')\n\n        Step 4: Check if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note: the problem says the string is built by the process. There's one more thing: the condition for the number of 'c' is based on the string at the time of appending (which is the string without the appended 'c's). \n\n        In our analysis, we considered the entire string's counts. But note: the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are the same as the counts at the time of appending because C only appends 'c's.\n\n        So this matches.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\", then the condition is satisfied (n_c=2, and n_a=2, n_b=2) so YES.\n\n        However, consider: the string \"aabbcc\" was built by:\n            Step 1: \"aa\"\n            Step 2: append two 'b's -> \"aabb\"\n            Step 3: append two 'c's (because 2 equals the number of 'a' (2) OR the number of 'b' (2)) -> \"aabbcc\"\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n        But what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\"? \n            Step 1: \"aaaa\"\n            Step 2: append three 'b's -> \"aaaabbb\"\n            Step 3: append three 'c's (since 3 equals the number of 'a' (4)? No, wait: 3 !=4 and 3 !=3 (for 'b')? Actually, the condition is: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. Here, the number of 'b' is 3, so 3==3 -> valid.\n\n        So the example \"aaaabbbccc\" is valid.\n\n        But wait, the example \"aaabccc\" (from the problem) is valid.\n\n        However, note: the problem example input \"aabc\" is valid. Let's check:\n\n            Step 1: A gives \"aa\" (or maybe \"a\" and then B appends one 'b')? Actually, the problem says A has a string of some number of 'a's. Then B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's.\n\n            Then C appends a number of 'c's equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' in the string (at that time). \n\n            In \"aabc\":\n                Step 1: A gives \"aa\" (two 'a's) and then B appends one 'b' -> \"aab\"\n                Then C appends one 'c' (because 1 equals the number of 'b' (which is 1)). \n\n            But wait, the example output says \"YES\" for \"aabc\".\n\n            However, the example input \"aabc\" has:\n                n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1.\n\n            The condition: n_c (1) must equal n_a (2) or n_b (1). It equals n_b, so YES.\n\n        But note: the string \"aabc\" is built by:\n\n            Step 1: \"aa\"\n            Step 2: append one 'b' -> \"aab\"\n            Step 3: append one 'c' -> \"aabc\"\n\n        However, the problem says that the string must be built by appending. The order is: first the 'a's, then the 'b's, then the 'c's. \n\n        In \"aabc\": the order is: \n            a, a, b, c -> that's correct.\n\n        But wait, the example \"aabc\" is given and expected to be YES.\n\n        So our method passes.\n\n        However, note: there's a catch. The problem says that after step 2, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then step 3 appends some 'c's (at least one). \n\n        In our example \"aabc\", the string after step 2 is \"aab\", which has two 'a's and one 'b'. Then C appends one 'c', so the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' (2) or the number of 'b' (1). He chooses 1 (because 1 is the number of 'b').\n\n        Our method: we are counting the entire string. But note: the condition for C is applied to the string at step 2 (without the 'c's). However, the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string are the same as in the string at step 2, because we didn't change them.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' and then the condition is that the count of 'c' must equal the count of 'a' or the count of 'b' (from the entire string, which is the same as the counts at step 2).\n\n        So the code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            has 'a','b','c'\n            sorted: \"aaabccc\" -> same as original? \n                original: \"aaabccc\" -> sorted: ['a','a','a','b','c','c','c'] -> \"aaabccc\" -> same.\n            counts: a=3, b=1, c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            has all three? yes.\n            sorted: \"abbcc\" -> not same as \"bbacc\" -> NO.\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n            has all three? yes.\n            sorted: \"aabc\" -> same? \n                original: \"aabc\", sorted: ['a','a','b','c'] -> \"aabc\" -> same.\n            counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 (with b) -> YES.\n\n        Example 4: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> \n            counts: a=4, b=3, c=3 -> 3==3 (with b) -> YES.\n\n        Example 5: \"aaabbbcc\" -> \n            counts: a=3, b=3, c=2 -> 2 !=3 and 2 !=3 -> NO.\n\n        Example 6: \"aaabbbccccc\" -> \n            counts: a=3, b=3, c=5 -> 5 !=3 -> NO.\n\n        Example 7: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> \n            counts: a=4, b=3, c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 8: \"aaaabbbcccc\" -> \n            counts: a=4, b=3, c=4 -> 4 !=4? wait, 4==4 (a) -> YES.\n\n        But wait, the example \"aaaabbbcccc\" is built by:\n            Step 1: \"aaaa\"\n            Step 2: append \"bbb\" -> \"aaaabbb\"\n            Step 3: append 4 'c's (because 4 equals the number of 'a' (4) OR the number of 'b' (3). It satisfies the condition (by the 'a').\n\n        So YES.\n\n        However, note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (in the entire string at the time of appending). The entire string at the time of appending is \"aaaabbb\", which has 4 'a's and 3 'b's. Then C appends 4 'c's (because 4 is the number of 'a').\n\n        So the condition holds.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\". The entire string at the time of appending is \"aaaabbb\", so the number of 'a' is 4, and the number of 'b' is 3. He appends 4 'c's, which is equal to the number of 'a'. So it's valid.\n\n        However, note: the entire string after step 3 is \"aaaabbbcccc\", and the count of 'c' is 4, which is the same as the original 'a' count (4). But the condition uses the counts from the string at step 2 (which is 4 for 'a' and 3 for 'b').\n\n        Our method uses the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b'. But note: the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are the same as the step 2 counts (since we only appended 'c's). So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if the string has extra 'a's or 'b's from being manipulated? No, because the process is fixed: first only a's, then only b's, then only c's.\n\n        One more edge: what if the string is \"ac\"? \n            It has 'a' and 'c', but no 'b'. So step 1: A gives \"a\", step 2: B must append at least one 'b', so the string after step 2 must have at least one 'b'. Then step 3 appends 'c's. So \"ac\" is missing 'b' -> NO.\n\n        Similarly, \"ab\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"acb\" -> \n            has 'a','b','c'\n            sorted: \"abc\" -> same as original? \n                original: \"acb\" -> sorted: \"abc\", so not the same -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aa\" -> missing 'b' and 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"b\" -> missing 'a' and 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"c\" -> missing 'a' and 'b' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"abc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"abb\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aab\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"a\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"abbbbb\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbbbc\" -> \n            sorted: \"aabbbbc\" -> same as original? \n                original: \"aabbbbc\", sorted: \"aabbbbc\" -> same.\n            counts: a=2, b=4, c=1 -> 1 !=2 and 1 !=4 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbbbc\" is NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbbbc\" is built by:\n            Step 1: \"aa\"\n            Step 2: append \"bbbb\" -> \"aabbbb\"\n            Step 3: C must append either 2 'c's (if matching 'a') or 4 'c's (if matching 'b'). But he appended 1 'c', which is neither 2 nor 4 -> invalid.\n\n        So our method is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. So we check for the presence of each.\n\n        Code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            if len(set(s) - set('abc')) != 0:\n                # But the input is guaranteed to be only 'a','b','c', so we don't need this?\n                pass\n\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait: what if the string is empty? The problem says |S|>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n However, note: the sorted operation and the set operations are O(n). The length is up to 5000, so it's acceptable.\n\n Let me run through the examples again with the code.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\" -> \n            has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n            sorted(\"aabc\") = \"aabc\" -> same as \"aabc\" -> yes.\n            counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"bbacc\" -> \n            has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n            sorted(\"bbacc\") = \"abbcc\" != \"bbacc\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbcc\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbccccc\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"acb\" -> NO (because not sorted).\n\n        Example: \"abc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"ab\" -> NO (missing 'c').\n\n        Example: \"ac\" -> NO (missing 'b').\n\n        Example: \"b\" -> NO (missing 'a','c').\n\n        Example: \"c\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aa\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbbbc\" -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" is \"aaaabbbccc\", which is 4 a's, 3 b's, 3 c's -> YES.\n\n        But wait, in \"aaaabbbccc\", the condition is that the number of 'c' (3) equals the number of 'b' (3) -> YES.\n\n        However, note: the entire string has 3 'b's, so that's correct.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (4 a's, 3 b's, 4 c's) -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbc\" (4 a's, 3 b's, 1 c) -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" (4 a's, 3 b's, 2 c) -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" (4 a's, 3 b's, 3 c) -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbbcccc\" (4 a's, 4 b's, 4 c) -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" is the same as above.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccccc\" (4 a's, 3 b's, 5 c) -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (4 a's, 3 b's, 4 c) -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" is built by:\n            Step 1: 4 a's\n            Step 2: 3 b's\n            Step 3: 4 c's (because 4 equals the number of a's (4))\n\n        So that's valid.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. In \"aaaabbbcccc\", the number of 'c' is 4, which is equal to the number of 'a' (4) but not the number of 'b' (3). So valid.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Check if the string is sorted\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, what if the string has only one type of letter repeated? For example, \"aaa\": \n        It doesn't have 'b' or 'c', so the first condition fails -> NO.\n\n        Similarly, \"bbbb\" -> NO.\n\n        \"cccc\" -> NO.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that after step 2, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then step 3 appends at least one 'c'. So the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. We are checking that.\n\n        I think we have covered all cases.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        But wait: performance? The string length is up to 5000. \n\n        We are doing:\n            - Checking membership of each letter: O(n) for each letter, but we do three checks. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But note: the input is guaranteed to be only 'a','b','c'. So the set(s) will be a subset of {'a','b','c'}. Then we check that it has all three.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if len(set(s)) != 3:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But wait: the string could have duplicate letters and still have 3 distinct letters? Yes. The condition is that the set must be exactly {'a','b','c'}, so size 3.\n\n        However, what if the string has only two distinct letters? Then set(s) has size 2 -> NO.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if len(set(s)) < 3:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But note: the input is guaranteed to be only 'a','b','c', so the set can be at most 3.\n\n        However, the problem does not guarantee that the string only contains 'a','b','c' in the sense of the set? Actually, the input is guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters 'a','b','c'. So we are safe.\n\n        We can change the first check to:\n\n            if len(set(s)) != 3:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But wait: what if the string has more than 3 distinct letters? Then set(s) would have more than 3, but the input is guaranteed to be only 'a','b','c'. So the set(s) can only be a subset of {'a','b','c'}.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\"\n\n        Therefore, the set(s) can only be a subset of {'a','b','c'}. Then we require that the set is exactly {'a','b','c'}.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\", then set(s) is {'a','b','c'} -> valid.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"aabbcc\", set(s) is {'a','b','c'} -> valid.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that the string contains all three? Actually, the process requires that after step 2 we have at least one 'a' and one 'b', and then step 3 appends at least one 'c'. Therefore, the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. So the set must be exactly {'a','b','c'}.\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\", then set(s) is {'a','b','c'} -> valid.\n\n        However, if the string is \"aaabbb\", then set(s) is {'a','b'} -> not 3 -> NO.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n            if set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        But note: the problem says the string is built by the process, so we must have all three.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n\n        Both are O(n). The set method might be faster because set(s) is built once and then compared to a set of three.\n\n        But building the set is O(n) and then the comparison is O(1). The membership test for each letter is three separate scans (each O(n)), so worst-case 3n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if 'a' in s and 'b' in s and 'c' in s:\n\n        This does three membership tests. Each membership test is O(n) but the worst-case overall is 3n.\n\n        The set method: building the set is O(n) and then comparing sets is O(1). So both are O(n). \n\n        Since the string length is 5000, we can choose either.\n\n        But note: if we use set(s), then we are building a set of the entire string. We are already going to traverse the string for sorting and counting. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            counts = {}\n            for char in s:\n                counts[char] = counts.get(char,0)+1\n\n            Then check if counts has keys 'a','b','c'\n\n        But that's similar to the set method.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine:\n\n            if 'a' in s and 'b' in s and 'c' in s:\n\n        This is clear and efficient enough for n=5000.\n\n        However, I'll stick with the set method because it's concise and ensures we have exactly these three.\n\n        But note: the set method does not care about duplicates. We just need to know the distinct letters.\n\n        So:\n\n            if set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        Then the rest.\n\n        However, wait: what if the string is very long? The set(s) is built from the entire string. But 5000 is acceptable.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            if set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\", then set(s) is {'a','b','c'} -> valid.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\" -> valid.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> valid.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" -> valid.\n\n        Example: \"aaaabbbccccc\" -> invalid.\n\n        Example: \"a\" -> set(s) = {'a'} -> invalid.\n\n        Example: \"ab\" -> set(s) = {'a','b'} -> invalid.\n\n        Example: \"ac\" -> set(s",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints. The solution involves checking several conditions to ensure the string adheres to the construction rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This is because the construction process requires each character to be present at least once.\n2. **Check for Non-decreasing Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order (i.e., all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's). This ensures the string was built by appending characters in the specified order.\n3. **Check Character Counts**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This condition is derived from the problem statement where C appends 'c's equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at the time of appending.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nif set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\nif s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check for All Characters**: The code first checks if the string contains all three characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any character is missing, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Order Check**: The code verifies if the string is in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. If they differ, the string does not meet the order requirement, and the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Count Check**: The code counts the occurrences of each character. If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string can be constructed according to the given rules, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
