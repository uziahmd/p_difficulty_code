Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (1 <= n <= 18) and a string A of exactly 2n digits.\n We have two players, Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number.\n\n The goal is to maximize the total prize: S1 (Homer's number) + S2 (Marge's number).\n\n However, note that the sequence of moves matters. At each turn, one of the players is chosen to move.\n\n Since both players must make exactly n moves, the entire sequence of 2n moves will be a string of n 'H' and n 'M' in some order.\n\n How does the game work?\n   Initially, A is the given 2n-digit string, and S1 and S2 are empty.\n   For each move (in the given sequence):\n        Take the leftmost digit of A and append it to the current player's number.\n        Then remove that leftmost digit from A.\n\n But note: the catch is that the same digit might be appended to different players at different times? Actually, the entire process uses all the digits in A, but the assignment of digits to players depends on the order of moves.\n\n Let the entire sequence of moves be represented by a string of length 2n, containing n 'H' and n 'M'. Then, the i-th move (0-indexed) is made by the player specified by the i-th character.\n\n Then, the first player's number S1 is formed by taking the digits from A at the positions where the move is 'H', in the order of the moves (i.e., the order of occurrence of 'H' in the sequence).\n Similarly, S2 is formed by the digits at the positions where the move is 'M'.\n\n However, note: the removal of the leftmost digit means that the digits are taken from A in the original order, but the assignment alternates according to the sequence.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n   One solution: \"HHMM\"\n\n   Steps:\n     Move1: H -> takes '1', so S1 becomes \"1\", A becomes \"234\"\n     Move2: H -> takes '2', so S1 becomes \"12\", A becomes \"34\"\n     Move3: M -> takes '3', so S2 becomes \"3\", A becomes \"4\"\n     Move4: M -> takes '4', so S2 becomes \"34\"\n\n   Then total prize = 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n   Another solution: \"HMHM\"\n\n   Steps:\n     Move1: H -> takes '1', S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n     Move2: M -> takes '2', S2=\"2\", A=\"34\"\n     Move3: H -> takes '3', S1=\"13\", A=\"4\"\n     Move4: M -> takes '4', S2=\"24\", A=\"\"\n\n   Then total prize = 13 + 24 = 37.\n\n   So we need the maximum total prize.\n\n But note: the problem says if there are several solutions, output any.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation:\n   The entire set of digits is fixed. We are just assigning the digits to two numbers, but the assignment is constrained by the order: the k-th digit (from left) can only be assigned to the player whose move comes at the k-th position.\n\n However, note that the sequence of moves is fixed and the digits are removed from left. So the j-th digit of A (0-indexed) is the digit that is available at step j, and the assignment is determined by the j-th character in the move sequence.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is:\n   Let X = [x0, x1, ..., x_{2n-1}] be the digits of A.\n   Let s[0], s[1], ..., s[2n-1] be the move sequence (each either 'H' or 'M').\n\n   Then S1 = x_{i0} * 10^{n-1-i0} + ... (but actually we are building the number by appending the digits in the order they are taken for H)\n\n   Actually, the value of S1 is: \n        Let the indices where the move is 'H' be i0, i1, ..., i_{n-1} (in increasing order of index, because the moves occur in order and the digits are taken from left to right).\n        Then S1 = x_{i0} * 10^{n-1} + x_{i1} * 10^{n-2} + ... \n\n   Similarly, S2 = x_{j0} * 10^{n-1} + ... for the indices j0, j1, ... where move is 'M'.\n\n But note: the indices i0, i1, ... are the actual positions in A (the original string) at which the 'H' moves occur. And these indices are increasing because we take from left to right.\n\n However, note: the same digit cannot be used twice. And the entire A is used.\n\n The challenge: we have to choose a sequence of 2n moves (with n H and n M) such that the total prize (the numerical value of the number formed by H moves plus the numerical value of the number formed by M moves) is maximized.\n\n Since n is up to 18, we cannot iterate over all C(2n, n) sequences (which is about 18!/(9!9!) ~ 48620 which is acceptable for n=18? Actually, 2n=36, so we are choosing 18 out of 36 -> C(36,18) is about 9e9 which is too many).\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We want to assign each digit (from left to right) to either H or M, but with the constraint that exactly n moves are assigned to H and n to M.\n\n   However, note: the assignment must be done in the order of the moves. But wait: the move sequence determines the assignment. The j-th digit is always assigned to the j-th move.\n\n   So the problem reduces to: assign each of the 2n digits to either H or M, but we cannot assign arbitrarily: we have to assign the first digit to the first move, the second to the second, etc.\n\n   But note: the move sequence is a permutation of n H and n M. The total prize is:\n\n        S1 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [ (digit at the k-th H move) * 10^{n-1-k} ]\n        S2 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [ (digit at the k-th M move) * 10^{n-1-k} ]\n\n   However, the H moves occur at specific positions (the positions in the sequence where the move is H), and similarly for M.\n\n   But note: the digits are taken from A in order, so the k-th move (regardless of which player) gets the k-th digit of A (if we consider the entire sequence as fixed). However, the assignment to H and M is by the move sequence.\n\n   Actually, let me reindex:\n\n        Let the move sequence be s[0..2n-1]. Then the digit assigned to the first move is A[0], the second move is A[1], etc.\n\n        Then, the number for H is built by taking the digits at positions i (where s[i]=='H') and then ordering them by the index i (so the earliest H gets the highest power, because the digits are taken from left to right and the number is built by appending, meaning the first digit taken is the most significant).\n\n        Example: n=2, sequence \"HHMM\": \n            A = \"1234\"\n            H moves: at index0 and index1 -> digits '1','2'\n            Then S1 = 1*10 + 2 = 12.\n\n        Sequence \"HMHM\":\n            H moves: index0 and index2 -> digits '1','3'\n            Then S1 = 1*10 + 3 = 13.\n\n        Similarly, for M: \n            In \"HHMM\": M moves at index2 and index3 -> digits '3','4'; S2=3*10+4=34.\n            In \"HMHM\": M moves at index1 and index3 -> digits '2','4'; S2=2*10+4=24.\n\n   Therefore, the total prize for a sequence s is:\n        Let I_H = sorted([i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char=='H'])\n        Let I_M = sorted([i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char=='M'])\n\n        Then S1 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} int(A[I_H[k]]) * (10**(n-1-k))\n        Similarly, S2 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} int(A[I_M[k]]) * (10**(n-1-k))\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the entire sequence as:\n\n        Total prize = sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (digit at position k) * (10^{n-1 - rank[k]})   ?\n\n   But note: the rank of a digit in the H moves: the first time we assign a digit to H, that digit becomes the most significant (hence multiplied by 10^(n-1)), the next H gets 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n   Similarly, the first M gets 10^(n-1) and the next M gets 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n   However, note: the moves are interleaved. The assignment of the power of 10 to a digit depends on when it is assigned (i.e., at which move) and to which player.\n\n   Specifically, the digit at position k (0-indexed) is assigned to the k-th move. Then, if that move is H, then the power for that digit in S1 is 10^(n-1 - r), where r is the rank of this H move (i.e., how many H moves have occurred so far, including this one?).\n\n   Actually, the rank of an H move is the count of H moves from the beginning until that move (including that move). But note: the number is built by appending the digits in the order of the moves. So the first H move (the earliest H) is the most significant.\n\n   Therefore, for an H move that occurs at step i (0-indexed), the power of 10 is 10^( (total number of H moves from the beginning to this one) - 1) but wait, no: the entire H number has n digits. The first H move (if there are n H moves) should be multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n   So for a particular H move at step i, the power of 10 is 10^( (number of H moves that occur after this one) )? Actually, no: the entire H number has n digits, and the digit from the first H move (earliest) is the most significant. So the power for the j-th H move (counting from 0 to n-1) is 10^(n-1-j).\n\n   How to compute j for a given H move? j is the count of H moves that occur from the beginning until (and including) the current move? Actually, no: we can precompute the rank of each H move by counting the H moves that occur before (including) it. Then the power for that H move is 10^(n - (count of H moves from the start to the current) - 1) ? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note:\n\n        Let f(i) = the position of the i-th H move (0-indexed). Then the digit at A[f(i)] is placed at the (i)-th most significant digit of S1.\n\n   Similarly, for M.\n\n   Now, the problem: we have to choose a sequence of moves (a string of n H and n M) to maximize the total prize.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming:\n\n        Let dp[i][j][k] = the maximum total prize we can achieve after processing the first i moves, having j H moves so far, and knowing that the last move was k (maybe not needed) but we also need to know the assignment of the digits to the players and the ranks.\n\n   However, note: the total prize is the sum of two numbers. The value of the numbers depends on the order (the rank of each digit in the respective player's number).\n\n   Alternatively, we can break down the total prize:\n\n        Total prize = (value of S1) + (value of S2)\n\n        S1 = sum_{p=0}^{n-1} (digit at the p-th H move) * (10^(n-1-p))\n        S2 = sum_{p=0}^{n-1} (digit at the p-th M move) * (10^(n-1-p))\n\n        But note: the entire set of digits is fixed. The total prize is the sum over all digits d (from A) of d * (power factor) where the power factor depends on the player and the order of the moves for that player.\n\n        However, the power factor for a digit is not independent of the other digits. \n\n   Another idea: since n is at most 18, we can try to use state space DP that iterates over the positions (2n) and the counts of H and M moves so far, and also keep track of the current \"power\" distribution? That might be too heavy.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use recursion with memoization and branch on each move: at each step, assign the current digit to H or M, and then update the remaining moves and the power factors. But the power factors for the future moves depend on the count of H and M moves that will happen.\n\n   Specifically, if we assign a digit to H at step i (0-indexed), then the power for this digit is 10^(n-1 - (current count of H moves))? Actually, the count of H moves so far (including this one) is the rank for the power? No: the power is determined by the order of the H moves: the first H move (whenever it occurs) is the most significant. \n\n   Actually, the power for a digit assigned to H at a given step is 10^( (number of remaining H moves that will occur after this one) )? Not exactly: the entire H number has n digits. The digit assigned at a step will be the (current_count_H)-th digit in the H number (if we count from 0) and hence the power is 10^(n-1 - (current_count_H))? \n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n        The H number is built by appending the digits as they are taken. The first H move (the earliest) becomes the most significant, i.e., the leftmost digit. Then the next H move becomes the next most significant, and so on.\n\n        So the digit assigned at the first H move (whatever the step index) will be multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second H move by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n        Therefore, regardless of the step index, the power of a digit in S1 is determined by the order in which the H moves occur. Specifically, the k-th H move (k from 0 to n-1) gets 10^(n-1-k).\n\n   This means that the total prize can be computed as:\n\n        Let T = 0\n        Let H_moves = []   # we don't need the actual list, but the order is the order of the moves (by step index)\n        Let M_moves = []\n\n        Then for the H_moves, sort by the step index (because that's the order they were taken) and then assign the digit at that step to the power 10^(n-1 - index_in_H_moves).\n\n        Similarly for M.\n\n   Then the total prize is the sum of all these.\n\n   However, we cannot know the exact power until we know the entire sequence.\n\n   We can use a DP that considers:\n\n        state = (i, j, k) where \n            i = current position (from 0 to 2n)\n            j = number of H moves so far\n            k = number of M moves so far (but j+k = i)\n\n        Additionally, we need to know the current \"remaining\" powers for H and M. But note: the power for a digit depends on the count of H moves that have been done (or will be done) for that player.\n\n        Actually, if we are at step i, and we have already done j H moves, then the next H move (if we choose H) will be the (j)-th H move (0-indexed), so it will get 10^(n-1 - j). Similarly, the next M move will be the (k)-th M move and gets 10^(n-1 - k).\n\n        However, wait: the entire sequence has 2n moves. The j-th H move (0-indexed) is the one that will be the (j)-th most significant in S1. So the power for an H move at step i is 10^(n-1 - j) if we do an H move now (then j becomes j+1, so the next H move will be j+1, but for the current move, if we assign to H, then the power is 10^(n-1 - j) because we have j H moves already and this is the (j)-th (since we are going to have j+1 in the end, but the current one is the j-th in order).\n\n        Actually, the order of H moves is by the step index. So if we have j H moves so far, then the next H move (if we assign H) will be the (j)-th H move (so the power is 10^(n-1-j)).\n\n        Similarly, if we assign M, then the power for that M move is 10^(n-1 - k) (because we have k M moves so far, so this is the k-th M move).\n\n        Then the total prize from the rest of the moves is not known, but we can consider:\n\n            dp[i][j][k] = maximum total prize (from the remaining moves) we can get, given that we have processed i moves (so we've taken the first i digits of A), having j H moves and k M moves (with j+k=i).\n\n        Then, at step i, we have two choices:\n\n            Option 1: assign the i-th digit (0-indexed, so the digit A[i]) to H.\n                Then we add: digit_value * (10^(n-1 - j))   [because j is the count of H moves so far, and this is the j-th H move (0-indexed)]\n                Then we go to state (i+1, j+1, k) and add dp[i+1][j+1][k]\n\n            Option 2: assign the i-th digit to M.\n                Then we add: digit_value * (10^(n-1 - k))\n                Then we go to state (i+1, j, k+1) and add dp[i+1][j][k+1]\n\n        Base case: when i==2n, then we have used all digits, and the prize from the remaining part is 0.\n\n        But wait: the entire assignment must have exactly n H and n M moves. So we require that at the end, j==n and k==n.\n\n        However, we can also stop when we have processed 2n moves. We must ensure that we only consider states where j<=n and k<=n and j+k==i.\n\n        But note: the problem requires exactly n moves for each. So we can only assign the last move if we have j=n and k=n? Actually, we must have j==n and k==n at i=2n.\n\n        But we are iterating from 0 to 2n. The state (i, j, k) must satisfy j+k=i and 0<=j<=n, 0<=k<=n.\n\n        However, the state space is (2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1) = 37 * 19 * 19 ~ 13000 states, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the exponentiation: we need to compute 10^(n-1-j) for j from 0 to n-1. Note: n<=18, so the exponents go up to 10^17, which is a big number, but we are doing exact arithmetic.\n\n        However, the total prize is a number that can be as large as 2 * (10^n - 1) * 10^(n-1) ??? Actually, the maximum S1 is a number with n digits, each digit 9, so 9...9 (n times) and similarly for S2, so the total prize is at most 2 * (10^n - 1) * (10^(n-1)) / 9? Actually, the maximum value for a number with n digits is 10^n - 1, so the total prize is at most 2*(10^n-1). But n=18, so 10^18 is a very big number (about 1e18) and we are doing DP with state (i, j, k) and storing the maximum total prize. The numbers are huge, but Python integers can handle that.\n\n        However, the state space is about 13000 states, and each state we do two transitions. But the numbers are huge, but the operations (multiplying a digit by a power of 10 and adding) are straightforward.\n\n        But note: the exponentiation: we need to precompute the powers of 10 for exponents from 0 to n-1 (max exponent is n-1, which is 17 for n=18). So we can precompute:\n\n            pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]   # but wait, we need exponents from 0 to n-1, but note: the first H move (the earliest) gets 10^(n-1). So we need:\n\n            Let exp_H(j) = 10^(n-1-j) for j from 0 to n-1.\n\n            Similarly for M: exp_M(k) = 10^(n-1-k) for k from 0 to n-1.\n\n        However, note: j and k are the counts of H and M moves so far (so the next H move will be the j-th, so we use j as the index for the exponent). But wait, j is the count of H moves so far, so the next H move (if we choose H) will be the j-th H move (so we use exponent n-1-j). Similarly for M.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute a list `exp_table` for exponents from 0 to n-1 (for both H and M, same table).\n\n            Let dp[i][j][k] = maximum total prize from the remaining moves (from index i to 2n-1) given that we have j H moves and k M moves so far (with j+k=i).\n\n            Then, if i == 2n: dp[i][j][k] = 0.\n\n            Otherwise, if j < n and k < n (we haven't finished either) then:\n\n                option1: assign A[i] to H -> add = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j))   [because j is the current count of H moves, so the next H move is the j-th (0-indexed) and gets 10^(n-1-j)]\n\n                Then, dp[i][j][k] = max( option1 + dp[i+1][j+1][k], \n                                         option2 + dp[i+1][j][k+1] )\n\n            But wait: we are using the current count j (for H) to determine the exponent for an H move. However, note that the entire sequence of H moves is independent of the step index. The j-th H move (so far) is the one that we are about to assign, and its power is 10^(n-1-j). \n\n            However, what if we have already assigned j H moves, and then we assign another H, then the next H move (if we do one) would be the (j+1)-th, but that hasn't happened yet. But in the DP we are at step i, and we are considering the immediate assignment. The exponent for the current H move is fixed by the current count j (because we are going to have j H moves in the past, and this is the next one, the j-th).\n\n            But note: the entire sequence of moves is fixed, and the H moves are ordered by the step index. The j-th H move (0-indexed) is the one that occurs at the j-th H move (counting from 0) in the sequence. However, the step index doesn't matter for the power, only the order of the H moves. And the order of the H moves is the same as the order of the steps (because we are processing from left to right). So the j-th H move (in the entire sequence) is the one that we assign at the step when we have j H moves so far (and we are about to assign the (j+1)-th). But wait, we are at step i, and we are going to assign the next digit. The count j is the number of H moves so far (from the beginning to step i-1). Then the next H move (at step i) will be the j-th H move (because we have j already, so this is the j-th one). \n\n            Actually, no: the j-th H move (0-indexed) is the one that is the j-th in the sequence. The first H move is the 0-th, then the next is the 1st, etc. So if we have j H moves so far, then the next H move (if we choose H) is the j-th H move (because we are going to have j+1, but the current one is the j-th). \n\n            Example: n=2, j=0: then we assign an H, so this is the 0-th H move -> exponent 10^(n-1-0)=10^(1)=10.\n            Then the next H move (if we choose H again) would be the 1st H move (exponent 10^0=1).\n\n            This matches.\n\n            However, note: the entire sequence must have exactly n H moves, so j goes from 0 to n-1 for the next H move.\n\n        But wait: if we are at state (i, j, k) and we choose H, then we are using the j-th H move (0-indexed) and the exponent is 10^(n-1-j). Then, in the next state, j becomes j+1, so the next H move (if we choose H again) will use exponent 10^(n-1-(j+1)).\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the same digit is being assigned to H, and the value we add is the digit value multiplied by the exponent corresponding to the current count j (for H). \n\n        Then, we can write:\n\n            dp[i][j][k] = max(\n                (int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)) + dp[i+1][j+1][k])   if j < n,\n                (int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-k)) + dp[i+1][j][k+1])   if k < n\n            )\n\n        But note: we must check that we don't exceed n for either j or k.\n\n        However, we must consider that the entire sequence must have exactly n H and n M moves, so we require that at the end, j==n and k==n. Therefore, we only consider states where j<=n and k<=n and j+k==i.\n\n        We can use memoization (top-down DP) or bottom-up. Since the state space is small (2n+1 * (n+1) * (n+1)), we can use bottom-up.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let dp[i][j][k] = maximum total prize from the subproblem starting at index i, with j H moves and k M moves already done (so j+k=i). We require that j<=n, k<=n, and j+k==i.\n\n            We'll iterate i from 2n down to 0.\n\n            For each state (i, j, k), we consider:\n\n                if j == n and k == n: then we are at the end, so dp[i][j][k] = 0.\n\n                Otherwise, if j < n and k < n, then we have two options.\n\n                But note: we are at the i-th digit (0-indexed, so we are about to process the i-th digit). Actually, we have processed i digits, so we are at the i-th step (from 0 to 2n). We can define:\n\n                    Let i from 0 to 2n-1, then we are at the i-th digit.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                dp[i][j][k] = maximum prize from the suffix starting at index i (so we have processed the first i digits) and we have j H and k M moves so far.\n\n            Then the recurrence:\n\n                dp[i][j][k] = max(\n                    (if j < n: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)) + dp[i+1][j+1][k]),\n                    (if k < n: int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-k)) + dp[i+1][j][k+1])\n                )\n\n            Base: when i == 2n, then dp[2n][j][k] = 0 (if j==n and k==n, otherwise undefined, but we don't use undefined states).\n\n            However, we must ensure that we don't use states that are invalid (like j>n or k>n). So we can set dp[i][j][k] = -infinity for invalid states, but we can also iterate only on valid states.\n\n        But note: the condition j+k==i must hold, so we can use:\n\n            for i from 2n down to 0:\n                for j from max(0, i-n) to min(n, i):   # because k = i-j, and we require k<=n and j<=n, so j>=i-n (because k=i-j<=n => j>=i-n) and j<=min(n,i)\n                    k = i - j\n                    if j > n or k > n: skip\n\n        Then, if j < n and k < n, then we have two possibilities.\n\n        However, we must also consider that we might have reached the end (i==2n) and then j must be n and k must be n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a top-down memoization.\n\n        But note: the problem also requires to output the sequence of moves (a string of length 2n, containing n H and n M) that achieves the maximum prize.\n\n        So we need to reconstruct the sequence.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp[i][j][k] = (max_value, choice) \n            where choice is either 'H' or 'M' (or None if we are at the base case)\n\n        Then, we start from (0,0,0) and follow the choices.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute a 3D array (or dictionary) for dp and choice.\n\n            Let dp[i][j][k] = maximum total prize from state (i, j, k)\n            Let choice[i][j][k] = the first move (either 'H' or 'M') that leads to the maximum prize.\n\n            Then:\n\n                if i == 2n: \n                    if j==n and k==n: return 0, None\n                    else: invalid state, we don't compute.\n\n                Otherwise, consider two options:\n\n                    option_H = None\n                    option_M = None\n\n                    If j < n:\n                        value_H = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)) + dp[i+1][j+1][k]\n                        option_H = ('H', value_H)\n\n                    If k < n:\n                        value_M = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-k)) + dp[i+1][j][k+1]\n                        option_M = ('M', value_M)\n\n                    Then, dp[i][j][k] = max(option_H, option_M)  [taking the max value, and record the choice]\n\n            Then, we can reconstruct the sequence by starting at (0,0,0) and at each step i, we know the choice (if we chose H, then we append 'H' and go to state (i+1, j+1, k); if M, then (i+1, j, k+1)).\n\n        However, note: the state (i, j, k) must satisfy j+k == i. We are iterating i from 0 to 2n.\n\n        Implementation details:\n\n            We'll use a 3D array for dp and choice, with dimensions [2n+1] x [n+1] x [n+1].\n\n            But note: i ranges from 0 to 2n, and j from 0 to n, and k from 0 to n, but we require j+k==i. So we can iterate i from 0 to 2n, and for each i, j from 0 to min(i, n) and k = i - j, and then check if k<=n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate i from 2n down to 0, and for j from 0 to n, then k = i-j, and if k>n then skip, and also if j>n then skip.\n\n        But note: the state (i, j, k) must have j<=n, k<=n, and j+k==i.\n\n        Since i = j+k, we can iterate i from 0 to 2n, and for j from 0 to min(i, n), then k = i-j, and then if k<=n, then we have a valid state.\n\n        However, we are going backwards (from high i to low i) so we do:\n\n            for i from 2n down to 0:\n                for j from 0 to min(i, n):\n                    k = i - j\n                    if k > n: continue   # because k<=n is required\n                    # then we compute dp[i][j][k] from dp[i+1][j][k] and dp[i+1][j+1][k] etc.\n\n        But wait, we are at state (i, j, k) and we are going to use the next state (i+1, j+1, k) and (i+1, j, k+1). So we need to have computed dp[i+1][j][k] and dp[i+1][j+1][k] (and dp[i+1][j][k+1]).\n\n        Therefore, we iterate i from 2n down to 0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            dp = a 3D array of dimensions (2n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1), initialized to -1 (or a very small number) for uncomputed states, but we know that we only compute valid states (j<=n, k<=n, j+k==i). Alternatively, we can use a dictionary for memoization.\n\n        However, since n is small (18, so 2n=36, and n=18) and the state space is about 2n * (n+1) * (n+1) = 36*19*19 ~ 13000, we can use a 3D list.\n\n        But note: we are only storing states that are valid (j+k==i and j<=n, k<=n). So for each i, we only consider j from max(0, i-n) to min(i, n). \n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp = [[[-1]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(2*n+1)]\n\n        Then, for i from 2*n down to 0:\n\n            for j from 0 to n:\n                k = i - j\n                if k < 0 or k > n: continue   # but j+k=i, so k=i-j, and we require 0<=j<=n and 0<=k<=n, so j>=0, j<=n, and i-j>=0, i-j<=n -> j>=i-n and j<=i, but also j<=n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate j from max(0, i-n) to min(i, n):\n\n                k = i - j\n                if k < 0 or k > n: continue   # but by our bounds, k should be nonnegative and <=n.\n\n            Then, if j==n and k==n and i==2n: then dp[i][j][k] = 0.\n\n            Else, if j < n and k < n:\n                option1 = None\n                option2 = None\n\n                if j < n:\n                    power_H = 10**(n-1-j)\n                    value1 = int(A[i]) * power_H + dp[i+1][j+1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given number A. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves (comprising 'H' and 'M') such that both players make exactly n moves, and the sum of their resulting numbers is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing each digit of the number A in sequence, assigning each digit to either player H or M. The key observation is that the value of each player's number depends on the order in which they pick the digits. The first digit picked by a player becomes the most significant digit in their number, the next becomes the next significant, and so on.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][j][k]` represents the maximum total prize achievable starting from the i-th digit, having already used j moves for H and k moves for M. The recurrence relation considers two choices at each step: assign the current digit to H or M, updating the counts and adding the digit's value multiplied by the appropriate power of 10 based on the move count.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each digit position, if assigning the digit to H is possible (i.e., j < n), the value added is the digit's value multiplied by \\(10^{(n-1-j)}\\). Similarly, if assigning to M is possible, the value added is the digit's value multiplied by \\(10^{(n-1-k)}\\). The DP state transitions explore both possibilities and selects the one yielding the higher total prize.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state (0, 0, 0) to construct the sequence of moves (string of 'H' and 'M') that achieves the maximum prize.
