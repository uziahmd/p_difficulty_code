    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000). We need to:\n 1. Find the minimum number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with n nodes that is p-reachable.\n    - Definition: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable (i.e., they form a strongly connected component).\n\n 2. Among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Observing the problem:\n\n Let's denote by SCCs the strongly connected components. In a directed graph, the mutual reachability (strong connectivity) within an SCC is what we care about.\n\n Note: The problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\". \n However, note that in the definition of strong connectivity, two nodes being mutually reachable implies they are in the same SCC. \n But note: the condition is for u < v. This is a bit different because we are only counting the unordered pairs (u, v) with u<v that are mutually reachable.\n\n However, note that the entire graph might have multiple SCCs. The condition for being p-reachable is that the total number of unordered pairs (u, v) (with u < v) that lie in the same SCC (so that they are mutually reachable) is exactly p.\n\n How to relate the number of unordered pairs in SCCs to the number of nodes?\n\n Consider: Each SCC of size k has C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2 unordered pairs (since every node in the SCC is mutually reachable with every other node). \n\n Then, if we break the graph into several SCCs (say, we have SCCs of sizes s1, s2, ..., sk), then the total number of unordered pairs (u,v) (with u<v) that are mutually reachable is:\n   p_total = sum_{i=1}^{k} [ s_i*(s_i-1)//2 ]\n\n Our goal is to achieve p_total = p, and we want the minimum total number of nodes n = s1 + s2 + ... + sk.\n\n Additionally, we are to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, there's a path from u to v but not from v to u) in the graph (with n nodes) that is p-reachable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Finding the minimum n (total nodes) such that there exists a set of positive integers {s1, s2, ..., sk} with sum n and \n        sum_{i} [ s_i*(s_i-1)//2 ] = p.\n\n    But note: p might not be representable as the sum of triangular numbers? Actually, we can use any partition of n into parts (each part at least 1) and the triangular numbers of these parts must add up to p.\n\n    However, note: the condition is exactly p. We are allowed to have multiple SCCs (each being a complete directed graph? Actually, we can arrange the SCCs arbitrarily, but the key is that the entire graph must have exactly p mutual pairs (which are the pairs within SCCs).\n\n    Also note: we are allowed to have a graph that is not necessarily one big SCC. We can break the graph into SCCs arbitrarily.\n\n    But observe: the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs (the pairs (u,v) with u<v and mutually reachable). This is the sum of the triangular numbers of the SCCs.\n\n    Now, we are to minimize the total number of nodes. So we want the smallest n such that there exists a decomposition of n into positive integers (each integer being the size of an SCC) and the sum of the triangular numbers (i.e., T(s_i)= s_i*(s_i-1)//2) is p.\n\n    However, note: we can also have SCCs that are of size 1. The triangular number for 1 is 0.\n\n    So we are looking for the minimal n and a representation of p as the sum of some triangular numbers (each triangular number T(k) = k*(k-1)//2) and the sizes of the SCCs (each at least 1) must sum to n.\n\n    But note: the same triangular number can be used multiple times (because we can have multiple SCCs of the same size).\n\n    However, we cannot use a triangular number more than once for a given size? Actually, we can have multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n    Example: p=3. \n        We can use one SCC of size 3: T(3)=3 -> n=3.\n        Alternatively, we can use three",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is exactly p-reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) where u ≠ v, there exists a path from u to v but no path from v to u.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-Reachability**: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are mutually reachable. This means the sum of the triangular numbers (s_i * (s_i - 1) // 2 for each strongly connected component (SCC) of size s_i must equal p.\n\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The goal is to find the smallest number of nodes (n) such that the sum of the triangular numbers of the sizes of its SCCs equals p. This involves partitioning n into parts where the sum of their triangular numbers is p. The solution involves checking possible values of n starting from the minimal possible value (which is the smallest integer whose triangular number is ≥ p) and verifying if p can be represented as the sum of triangular numbers of integers summing to n.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: For graphs with the minimum number of nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived by considering the structure of the graph. The key insight is that to maximize unidirectional pairs, the graph should have as many edges as possible without creating mutual reachability between non-SCC nodes. This involves constructing the graph with SCCs and adding edges in a way that maximizes the directionality between different SCCs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        p = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"1 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        t_n = n*(n-1)//2\n        if t_n >= p:\n            break\n        n += 1\n\n    ans_nodes = n\n    total_triangular = 0\n    remaining = p\n    arr = []\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        t_i = i*(i-1)//2\n        if total_triangular + t_i <= p:\n            total_triangular += t_i\n            arr.append(i)\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    while len(arr) > 0 and total_triangular < p:\n        last = arr.pop()\n        remaining_after_remove = p - total_triangular\n        t_last = last*(last-1)//2\n        new_remaining = remaining_after_remove - t_last\n        if new_remaining == 0:\n            pass\n        elif new_remaining > 0:\n            # Find the largest k such that T(k) <= new_remaining\n            k = 1\n            while k*(k-1)//2 <= new_remaining:\n                k += 1\n                k -= 1\n            total_triangular += t_last + k*(k-1)//2\n            arr.append(last)\n            arr.append(k)\n            arr.sort(reverse=True)\n            break\n        else:\n            arr.append(last)\n            total_triangular -= t_last\n            remaining_after_remove = -new_remaining\n            k = 1\n            while k*(k-1)//2 <= remaining_after_remove:\n                k += 1\n                k -= 1\n            total_triangular += k*(k-1)//2\n            arr.append(k)\n\n    total_nodes = sum(arr)\n    while total_nodes < n:\n        arr.append(1)\n        total_nodes += 1\n\n    while total_nodes > n:\n        if arr[-1] > 1:\n            x = arr.pop()\n            arr.append(x-1)\n            arr.append(1)\n            total_nodes = sum(arr)\n        else:\n            break\n\n    while sum([x*(x-1)//2 for x in arr]) != p:\n        while total_nodes < n:\n            arr.append(1)\n            total_nodes += 1\n        while total_nodes > n:\n            if arr[-1] > 1:\n                x = arr.pop()\n                arr.append(x-1)\n                arr.append(1)\n                total_nodes = sum(arr)\n            else:\n                break\n\n    total_pairs = 0\n    for size in arr:\n        total_pairs += size*(size-1)//2\n\n    while total_pairs < p:\n        arr.append(1)\n        total_pairs += 1\n        total_nodes += 1\n\n    while total_nodes < n:\n        arr.append(1)\n        total_nodes += 1\n\n    while total_nodes > n:\n        if arr[-1] > 1:\n            x = arr.pop()\n            arr.append(x-1)\n            arr.append(1)\n            total_nodes = sum(arr)\n        else:\n            break\n\n    arr.sort(reverse=True)\n    s = 0\n    for size in arr:\n        s += size\n        if s > n:\n            break\n\n    m = n*(n-1)//2\n    for size in arr:\n        m -= size*(size-1)//2\n\n    unidirectional = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[i] == arr[j]:\n                continue\n            else:\n                if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                    unidirectional += arr[i]*arr[j]\n                else:\n                    unidirectional += arr[i]*arr[j]\n\n    unidirectional //= 2\n    print(f\"{n} {unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which is a single integer p.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the output is \"1 0\" since a single node graph has no edges and thus no unidirectional pairs.\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The loop calculates the smallest n such that the triangular number T(n) is at least p. This n is the minimal number of nodes needed.\n4. **Triangular Number Summation**: The algorithm checks if p can be represented as the sum of triangular numbers of integers that sum to n. If not, it adjusts the partition by breaking down larger components into smaller ones.\n5. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is computed by considering all pairs of nodes in different SCCs. For any two SCCs of sizes a and b (a > b), the number of directed edges from a to b is a*b, contributing to unidirectional pairs.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the minimal node count and maximizes unidirectional pairs by leveraging triangular numbers and careful partitioning of nodes into SCCs.",
