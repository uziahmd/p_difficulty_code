There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament structure is constrained by the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to allow the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n The key idea is that the tournament can be broken down into rounds, and the winner must go through several rounds. However, the constraint on the difference of games played may force us to structure the tournament in a way that the winner doesn't get too many games.\n\n Alternatively, note that the winner must beat k opponents. But the tournament structure must ensure that the winner does not face an opponent that has played too many games relative to him.\n\n Actually, let's consider:\n\n - The winner must win k consecutive games (so k is the total number of games he plays).\n - In order for the winner to play k games, there must be k wins. But also, the tournament must have been arranged so that the winner can accumulate these wins without violating the rule.\n\n How to model?\n\n We can think of building a tournament tree. However, the problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can have.\n\n Another approach: we know that in a knockout tournament, the maximum number of games the winner can have is limited by the total number of players and the constraints.\n\n Example cases:\n   n = 2 -> 1 game\n   n = 3 -> 2 games? Actually, wait: \n        If n=3, then the tournament must have two games (since 3 players: one bye). But the winner must play 2 games? \n        However, the example output says: for n=3, answer is 2.\n\n   But wait, the example input and output:\n        Input: ['2', '3', '4', '10']\n        Output: ['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n   For n=4: answer is 2.\n\n   Explanation for n=4: \n        One possible arrangement: \n            Round1: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4)\n            Then the winner of Round1 (say 1) vs winner of Round2 (say 3). \n        So the winner (player 1) has played 2 games.\n\n   Why can't the winner play more than 2 games for n=4? Because after two wins, the winner has played 2 games. To play a third game, there would have to be a fourth player that hasn't lost yet, but in a single elimination with 4 players, the tournament ends in 2 rounds (the winner plays 2 games).\n\n   Now for n=10: the answer is 4.\n\n   How does that work?\n        We can think of building the tournament in stages (like a binary tree) but the rule allows that two players can play only if their previous games differ by at most one.\n\n   Actually, the problem is similar to building a bracket that allows the winner to have as many games as possible. \n\n   Another known fact: the maximum number of games the winner can play is floor(log2(n)) + 1? Not exactly, because:\n\n        n=2: log2(2)=1 -> 1+? But 2^1=2, so if we use exponentiation, the number of rounds is the depth. But wait, the winner plays one game for n=2, which is the same as the depth (if we consider the root as the final, then depth=1). \n\n   However, consider:\n\n        n=3: floor(log2(3)) = 1, then 1+? -> 2 (matches)\n\n        n=4: floor(log2(4)) = 2, then 2? but the answer is 2 (matches)\n\n        n=10: floor(log2(10)) = 3, then 3? but the answer is 4.\n\n   Alternatively, we might be looking for the largest integer k such that the total number of players required to have a tournament where the winner plays k games is <= n.\n\n   How many players are needed for the winner to play k games?\n\n   In the first game, the winner must play one game. Then, to have a second game, there must be at least one other branch that has provided a challenger. But note the rule: the next opponent must have played at most one game less or more. \n\n   Actually, we can model the tournament as two halves: one half is the path of the winner (which requires a chain of k wins) and the other half must provide",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the constraint that any two players can only compete if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of consecutive wins for the tournament winner. The tournament is structured such that each player must win all their games to advance. The constraint on game counts between players affects how the tournament can be organized.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves determining the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players required to support \\( k \\) wins for the winner does not exceed \\( n \\). This is derived from the observation that the tournament can be modeled using a binary tree where each level represents a round of the tournament. The winner must progress through each round, and the number of players needed grows exponentially with the number of rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses a mathematical approach to compute \\( k \\) by iteratively doubling the number of players that can be accommodated in each round until the total exceeds \\( n \\). The value of \\( k \\) is then derived from the number of rounds possible under these constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    k = 0\n    total_players = 1\n    while total_players < n:\n        k += 1\n        total_players = (total_players << 1) + 1\n    \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the number of players \\( n \\) from the input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( n \\) is 2, the output is directly 1 since the winner plays only one game.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: The loop calculates the maximum number of games \\( k \\) the winner can play by doubling the number of players in each round (using bit shifting for efficiency) and adding one more player each time to account for the winner's path. This continues until the total players required exceed \\( n \\).\n4. **Output**: The value \\( k \\), which represents the maximum number of games the winner can play, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging binary tree properties and iterative doubling, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of \\( n \\) up to \\( 10^{18} \\).",
