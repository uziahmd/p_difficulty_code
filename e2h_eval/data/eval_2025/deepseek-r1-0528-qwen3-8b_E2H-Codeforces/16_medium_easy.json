Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The block containing your home and the block containing the university are defined by which side of each road they lie on.\n\n However, note that we can only move from one block to another if they share a common border (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). This is analogous to having a graph where each node is a region (block) and edges exist between regions that differ by crossing one road.\n\n But note: The problem states that you can only move in steps that cross a nonzero segment of a road. Importantly, two blocks adjacent at an intersection but not sharing a nonzero boundary segment are not allowed. However, in the arrangement of lines, two blocks are adjacent via a common border if they differ by one road.\n\n Actually, note that the entire plane is divided by n lines. Each line adds a new division. We can think of the regions as being defined by the sign pattern for each line. Each line i gives a sign (say +1 or -1) for the expression a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i. The home and the university have fixed sign patterns for all n lines.\n\n Now, if we consider the graph where each node is a sign pattern (a vector of signs for the n lines) and edges connect nodes that differ in exactly one coordinate (i.e., crossing one road), then the problem reduces to: \n   What is the minimum number of roads (i.e., the Hamming distance) that we need to flip to go from the home's sign pattern to the university's sign pattern?\n\n However, wait: but note that we are not necessarily flipping one road at a time? Actually, the movement condition is that we cross one road at a time, and each step crosses one road (so we change one sign). But note: the problem does not require that we flip the signs arbitrarily; we must stay in the blocks (regions) that are connected by crossing one road.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the minimal number of roads (lines) for which the home and university lie on opposite sides (i.e., the sign is flipped). Because if they are on the same side of a road, then that road doesn't separate them, so we don't need to cross it. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road at least once.\n\n However, note that the problem says we can move from one block to another only if they share a nonzero border. This corresponds to being separated by exactly one road. So the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\n But wait: is that true? Consider that sometimes you might have to cross a road twice? Actually, no: because once you cross a road, you are on the other side, and then if you cross it again, you return to the original side. However, the goal is to get to the university's block. We want the minimal number of crossings. \n\n However, there is a catch: the problem does not require that we cross each separating road only once. But note: the minimal path will cross each separating road exactly once. Why? Because if you cross a road an even number of times, you end up on the same side as the start. If odd, then you end up on the opposite. Since the university is on the opposite side for a separating road, we must cross it an odd number of times. And the minimal way is to cross it once.\n\n But note: we can cross multiple roads in sequence. However, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points (the ones for which the signs differ). However, wait: the example input:\n\n Example 1:\n    Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n    Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), 2 roads: [0*x+1*y+0=0] -> y=0, and [1*x+0*y+0=0] -> x=0.\n\n    For home (1,1): \n        Road1: 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 >0 -> say +1.\n        Road2: 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 >0 -> +1.\n\n    For university (-1,-1):\n        Road1: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> -1.\n        Road2: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> -1.\n\n    So both points are on the same side for both roads? Then according to this, the minimal steps would be 0. But the example output is 2.\n\n Wait, what's going on? Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n In the example, the home is at (1,1) and the university at (-1,-1). The two roads are x=0 and y=0. These two roads divide the plane into 4 quadrants. The home is in the first quadrant (x>0, y>0) and the university is in the third quadrant (x<0, y<0). To get from the first quadrant to the third, we must cross two roads: first the x-axis (from positive y to negative y) and then the y-axis (from positive x to negative x) OR vice versa. But note: the problem says that you can only move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. \n\n However, note that the two roads intersect at (0,0). The home and university are not on the roads. The minimal path must cross two roads.\n\n How do we model this?\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can consider that the entire plane is divided by the roads. The home and the university are in two different blocks. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross to get from home to university.\n\n But note: crossing a road changes the side for that road. The entire journey must flip every road that separates the two points (i.e., for which the sign differs). However, we cannot flip the same road twice in a row? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient.\n\n However, the minimal steps is not simply the number of roads for which the signs differ. Consider: the example above has 2 roads that separate the two points. And the minimal steps is 2.\n\n Another example: \n    Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n    The third road: x+y-3=0. For (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative. For (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5 -> negative. So the third road does not separate them.\n\n    Then according to the example output, the answer is 2.\n\n So how does the sign pattern work? In the example, the first two roads separate the two points, and the third does not. So the minimal steps should be 2.\n\n However, wait: the example input says the answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points (i.e., the roads for which the sign of the expression at home and at university are different).\n\n But wait: why in the first example, with two separating roads, the answer is 2, and in the second example, with two separating roads, the answer is also 2? \n\n But what if we have three roads, and two of them separate the points, but the third doesn't? Then the minimal steps is 2.\n\n However, consider a different scenario: \n   Suppose there are two roads that separate the points, but they are arranged such that there is a direct path that crosses only one road? Actually, no: because if a road separates the two points, then the two points are in different half-planes for that road, so any path connecting them must cross that road an odd number of times. The minimal odd number is 1. But if there are two roads that separate, then the path must cross both, so at least two crossings.\n\n However, wait: what if the two separating roads are crossed in a single step? Actually, no: because each step only crosses one road. So we must cross two roads, hence two steps.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n The key is that when we cross a road, we move from one block to an adjacent block. Each road crossing is one step.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, let me test with three roads, and the two points are separated by two roads. Then the minimal steps is 2.\n\n But wait, there is a catch: the problem says that the blocks are defined by the arrangement of all the roads. It is possible that the two points are separated by two roads, but there exists a path that goes around and crosses only one road? \n\n Actually, no. Because if a road separates the two points, then the two points are in different half-planes for that road, so any continuous path must cross that road. So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, wait: the example input 1 has two separating roads, and the answer is 2. Example input 2 has two separating roads, and the answer is 2.\n\n But wait, what if a road does not separate the two points? Then we don't need to cross it.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   For each road i, compute the value at home: v1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n   For the same road, compute the value at university: v2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n\n   Then, if v1 and v2 have opposite signs (one positive and the other negative, or one negative and the other positive), then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Then the answer is the count of such roads.\n\n However, wait: the problem says that the roads are given by a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. We are guaranteed that the points are not on the road, so v1 and v2 are nonzero.\n\n But note: the sign of v1 and v2: we don't know which side is positive or negative, but we only care about the relative sign.\n\n Example: \n   Road: x+y-3=0. For (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 (negative). For (2,2): 2+2-3=1 (positive). They are separated.\n\n But what if the road equation is given as -x -y +3=0? Then the equation is the same (since multiplying by -1 doesn't change the line). But then for (1,1): -1-1+3=1 (positive). For (2,2): -2-2+3=-1 (negative). Then the signs are opposite.\n\n So the condition is: if (v1 > 0 and v2 < 0) or (v1 < 0 and v2 > 0) then the road separates.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   Read home (x1,y1)\n   Read university (x2,y2)\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n        v1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        v2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (v1 < 0 and v2 > 0) or (v1 > 0 and v2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   Print count\n\n Let's test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: [0,1,0] -> equation: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n        v1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        v2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> separated (count=1)\n\n   Road2: [1,0,0] -> equation: x=0\n        v1 = 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 -> positive\n        v2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> separated (count=2)\n\n   Output 2 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: [1,0,0] -> x=0\n        v1=1, v2=-1 -> separated (count=1)\n   Road2: [0,1,0] -> y=0\n        v1=1, v2=-1 -> separated (count=2)\n   Road3: [1,1,-3] -> x+y-3=0\n        v1=1+1-3=-1, v2=-1-1-3=-5 -> both negative -> not separated.\n\n   Output 2 -> matches.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is given in a different form? For example, the road equation might have negative coefficients. Our condition still holds because we are only checking the product: if v1 * v2 < 0 then they are separated.\n\n However, note: what if the road equation is given as a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i=0, and we compute v1 and v2. The sign of v1 and v2 depends on the representation. But the separation condition is purely based on the side of the line. The line equation is the same regardless of the scalar multiple (except that we are given integer coefficients). But note: the problem does not guarantee that the equations are normalized. However, the condition for separation is independent of the scaling: because if we multiply the equation by k (nonzero), then v1 becomes k*v1 and v2 becomes k*v2, so the sign relationship remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, wait: is that really the minimal steps? \n\n Explanation: Each road that separates the two points must be crossed an odd number of times. The minimal odd number is 1. And since we can only cross one road per step, we need at least one step per separating road. Moreover, we can cross the roads in any order, and each step crosses one road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we cross the roads in a particular order. However, the entire journey must cross every separating road at least once, and we cannot avoid crossing a separating road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, wait: what if two separating roads are crossed in the same step? \n\n Remember: each step moves from one block to an adjacent block by crossing one road. So we cannot cross two roads in one step.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait, there is a known fact: in an arrangement of lines, the minimal number of lines to cross to get from one cell to another is the number of lines that strictly separate the two cells. \n\n However, note that the two points (home and university) are not necessarily in the same cell. The entire plane is divided into cells (blocks). The home and university are in two distinct cells. The minimal number of lines to cross is the number of lines that separate the two cells.\n\n But note: two cells are defined by the arrangement of all the lines. The minimal path must cross a set of lines that are the ones that separate the two cells. And the minimal number of lines is the number of lines for which the two cells lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, there is an alternative way to think: the entire set of lines defines a pseudoline arrangement. The two cells are labeled by a binary vector of length n (each component is the sign for the line). The Hamming distance between the two vectors is the number of differing signs, which is the number of lines that separate the two cells.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and the university.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data\n        # Evaluate the linear equation for home and university\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Check if they are on opposite sides\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with a simple case: one road, home and university on opposite sides -> output 1. On the same side -> output 0.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1 0\\n-1 0\\n1\\n1 0 -1\"   # the road is x-1=0, so home (1,0) is on the road? -> but the problem guarantees neither home nor university is on the road. So adjust.\n\n   Let me take: home (2,0), university (0,0) and road x=1 (i.e., x-1=0). Then:\n        home: 2-1=1>0\n        university: 0-1=-1<0 -> separated, so output 1.\n\n   But wait, the home (2,0) and university (0,0) are separated by the road x=1. The minimal steps is 1.\n\n   Another test: home (2,0) and university (3,0) with the same road x=1: both positive, so no separation -> output 0.\n\n   However, wait: the road x=1 separates the plane into two half-planes: left and right. (2,0) is right, (3,0) is right. So they are in the same block. Therefore, 0 steps.\n\n   But note: the problem says the roads divide the plane. With one road, the plane is divided into two blocks. The home and university are in the same block, so no steps.\n\n   This matches.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   For each road (n lines):\n        Read a, b, c\n        Compute val1 = a*x1+b*y1+c\n        Compute val2 = a*x2+b*y2+c\n        If val1 and val2 have opposite signs (one positive, one negative), then increment count.\n\n   Print count.\n\n However, wait: what if the road equation is given as 0*x + 0*y + c = 0? The problem states that \"ai and bi are not both zero\", so we don't have to worry about that.\n\n But note: the values val1 and val2 might be very large and could be zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are nonzero.\n\n However, what if due to integer overflow? The numbers are up to 10^6, and a, b, c up to 10^6, and x1,y1 up to 10^6.\n\n   Maximum absolute value: |a*x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, similarly for the others. So the total absolute value of val1 and val2 can be up to 3e12 (if we add three terms each up to 10^12). But Python integers can handle that.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n    Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n    Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n    Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n    Output: 2\n\n But wait, the example input string was given as:\n\n   ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n And the expected outputs are ['2', '2'].\n\n However, the problem says:\n\n   Example Input 1: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   Example Input 2:\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n So the code above produces 2 for both.\n\n But wait, there is a known issue: sometimes the road equation might be given in a normalized form or not, but we don't care because the sign is the same.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the roads are infinite lines. The sign of the expression (a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i) is well-defined.\n\n One more test: what if the road equation has negative leading coefficients? \n\n Example: \n   Road: [-1, 0, 1] -> equation: -x+1=0 -> x=1.\n\n   Home (2,0): -2+1 = -1 -> negative\n   University (0,0): -0+1=1 -> positive -> separated.\n\n   Condition: (negative and positive) -> count++.\n\n   Correct.\n\n But wait: the equation -x+1=0 is the same as x-1=0 multiplied by -1. The side definitions are reversed, but the separation condition is the same.\n\n Therefore, we are good.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the input format is as described.\n\n We assume the input is given as:\n\n   First line: x1 y1\n   Second line: x2 y2\n   Third line: n\n   Next n lines: each with three integers a, b, c\n\n We'll read from stdin.\n\n But wait: the example input strings are provided as a list of strings. However, in competitive programming, we read from stdin.\n\n So the code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n   if not data:\n        exit(0)\n\n   # Parse the first two points and n\n   x1 = int(data[0]); y1 = int(data[1])\n   x2 = int(data[2]); y2 = int(data[3])\n   n = int(data[4])\n\n   index = 5\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index]); b = int(data[index+1]); c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check for opposite signs\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait, what if the input is given as two separate lines? The problem says the input is:\n\n   The first line contains two space-separated integers ...\n   The second line contains two integers ...\n   The third line contains an integer n ...\n\n   Then n lines, each with three integers.\n\n However, the above code reads all tokens and then parses. That is acceptable because the input is space separated.\n\n But note: the problem says the input is from stdin. We can use:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n But the example input was given as a string. However, in the competition, the input is provided as standard input.\n\n Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and we are to read from stdin, we can use the second method.\n\n However, the example input string was provided as a list of strings. But in the actual competition, we don't have to worry about that.\n\n Let me change to the line-by-line reading.\n\n Final code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: there's a possibility of integer overflow? The problem says the numbers can be up to 10^6, and we are doing multiplications and additions. The maximum absolute value of a term is 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, and then we have three terms (but actually, each equation has three terms: a*x, b*y, c). But note: the equation is a*x+b*y+c, so we are adding three terms. The maximum absolute value of the entire expression could be up to 3 * (10^12) = 3e12, which is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision). However, the problem constraints are such that 3e12 is about 3 trillion, and that is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says that the input numbers are integers, and we are doing integer arithmetic.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: the signs. What if the expression is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n But wait: what if the expression is very close to zero? Actually, the problem says the points are not on the road, so the expressions are nonzero.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n Let me submit.\n\n However, wait: I just saw the example input was provided as a list of strings. But in the competition, we read from stdin. The above code uses input(), which reads from stdin.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and we are to read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n So the above code should be accepted.\n\n But wait: what if the input has negative numbers? The input() function returns a string, and split() handles spaces and newlines. The map(int, ...) will convert negative numbers correctly.\n\n Example: input() returns \"-1 -1\" -> split() gives ['-1','-1'] -> map(int) converts to -1, -1.\n\n Therefore, the code is robust.\n\n However, wait: what if there are extra spaces? The problem says the input is space separated, so we assume standard formatting.\n\n We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says the input format is as described, so we assume the input is well-formatted.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n\n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2\n\n But wait, wait! There is a known issue: the problem says that the roads divide the plane, and the minimal steps is the number of separating roads. However, note that the problem says that you can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. \n\n But what if two roads are parallel? Then the blocks are separated by multiple roads, but the condition still holds: we need to cross each separating road once.\n\n However, our method counts the separating roads regardless of their orientation. The condition is purely algebraic.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: consider the following scenario:\n\n   Two roads that are the same? The problem says \"no two roads are the same\", so we don't have duplicate lines.\n\n   Also, the roads can be any infinite lines.\n\n   Example: two roads: x=0 and y=0. Then the home (1,1) and university (-1,-1) are separated by both. We count both.\n\n   Example: two roads: x=0 and x=1. Then home (0.5,0) and university (1.5,0) are separated by the road x=0? \n        For x=0: 0.5>0 -> positive, 1.5>0 -> positive -> same side -> not separated.\n        For x=1: 0.5-1=-0.5<0, 1.5-1=0.5>0 -> separated.\n\n        Steps: 1.\n\n   Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n   print(count)\n\n Let me submit.\n\n However, wait: the problem says that the roads are defined by a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i=0. The expression we are evaluating is the same as the left-hand side. The sign of the expression determines the side.\n\n But note: the equation can be written as a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i = 0. The side of the line is determined by the sign of the expression. \n\n This is correct.\n\n We are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university in Crazy Town. The blocks are formed by the infinite line roads that divide the plane into regions. Each step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block by crossing a single road, provided they share a nonzero boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in specific blocks defined by their positions relative to all the roads. The minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate them. A road separates the two points if they lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the road equation.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, we evaluate the given equations at the coordinates of the home and university. If the evaluations have opposite signs, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus this road must be crossed at least once. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. With \\( n \\) roads, the time complexity is \\( O(n) \\), which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 300 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    \n    if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Separation**: If the evaluations at the two points have opposite signs, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and the road contributes to the step count.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm's linear complexity ensures it handles the input constraints effectively.",
