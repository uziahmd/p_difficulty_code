After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns (each row is a string of m characters).\n\n For each subject (column), we want to know the maximum mark and which students achieved that maximum.\n\n However, note: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., has the highest mark in that subject, and note: if multiple students have the same highest mark, then they are all considered best in that subject? Actually, the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if multiple have the same highest, then none has a higher one, so all with the max mark are best in that subject.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the best must be unique. So if two students have the same highest mark, then both are best in that subject.\n\n Then, for each student, we need to check if there is at least one subject where his mark is equal to the maximum mark of that subject.\n\n Approach:\n - First, for each column j, find the maximum value (as integer or character) and the set of rows (students) that have that maximum.\n\n However, note: the input is given as strings of digits, but we can compare by their integer value or by the character? Since '1' to '9', we can compare as characters because the ASCII order is the same as numerical for these.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Let marks = list of n strings, each of length m.\n\n For each j in range(m):\n   col_j = [marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n   max_mark = max(col_j)   # This will be a char, but we can use it as is since the digits are in increasing order.\n\n Then, for each student i, we want to check for any subject j: \n   marks[i][j] == max_mark_per_subject[j]\n\n But note: we don't need to store the entire set of best students per subject? We can precompute for each subject the maximum and then for each student, check if in any subject the student's mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n\n However, wait: what if the same student is best in multiple subjects? That's okay, we only need one.\n\n But note: the problem says \"successful\" if there exists at least one subject.\n\n So we can do:\n\n Step 1: Read n and m and the grid.\n\n Step 2: For each column j, compute the maximum character in that column.\n\n Step 3: For each student i (row i), check if there exists at least one column j such that:\n        grid[i][j] == max_col[j]\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? \n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   Columns: \n      col0: ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n      col1: ['2','3','1'] -> max='3'\n      col2: ['3','2','2'] -> max='3'\n\n   Now, for student0 (first row): \n        col0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n\n   Student1 (second row):\n        col0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n\n   Student2 (third row):\n        col0: '1' != '2'\n        col1: '1' != '3'\n        col2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So output is 2.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline. But the example input format is:\n\n     ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   We are reading from stdin.\n\n   We can read the first line to get n and m, then read next n lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if not data: \n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   first_line = data[0].split()\n   n = int(first_line[0])\n   m = int(first_line[1])\n\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(1, 1+n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n\n   Then, for each column j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_col.append(max(col))\n\n   Then, for each student i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks across m subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n    \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n    \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading all input lines. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the program collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark in that subject.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the program checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result. The solution handles edge cases such as empty input or single-student scenarios gracefully.",
