Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each up to 1000 bytes. Total n <= 100, total size <= 100000 (worst-case 100*1000) but that's acceptable.\n\n We are to find all integers x from 0 to 100 such that there exists a moment when:\n   (1) The current file i has been copied at least x% of its own size (i.e., floor(100*x_current / a_i) = x)\n   and (2) The overall progress (floor(100*(total_bytes_copied_so_far) / total_size) = x)\n\n However, note that the overall progress is computed as: floor(100 * (sum of bytes copied so far) / total_bytes)\n\n But note: the first progress bar is for the current file only. The second is for the entire process.\n\n Observation:\n   Let the current file be i (from 0 to n-1). Then, when copying the j-th byte of file i (so we have j bytes in file i, and all previous files completely),\n   the first progress bar shows: p1 = floor( (100 * j) / a_i )\n   The second progress bar shows: p2 = floor( (100 * (S + j)) / T ), where S = sum_{k=0}^{i-1} a_k, and T = total sum.\n\n We require p1 == p = p2.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"exists a moment\" meaning during the copying of some file i at some byte j (0<=j<=a_i).\n\n We cannot iterate over every file and every byte because the total data might be 100*1000=100000 bytes and n up to 100 -> 10e6 * 100 = 1e9 worst-case, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline.\n\n But note: the problem states that the size of each file is at most 1000, so the maximum j for a file is 1000. And n is at most 100, so total operations would be 100 * 1000 = 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must check for each file i and for each byte j (from 0 to a_i) the two conditions:\n\n   Condition1: floor((100*j)/a_i) = p\n   Condition2: floor((100*(S+j))/T) = p\n\n But note: the same p must appear at the same time.\n\n However, wait: the problem does not require that the same p appears in the same file? Actually, we are looking for a p (from 0 to 100) for which there exists ANY moment (any file i and any byte j) such that both conditions hold.\n\n But note: the overall progress uses the cumulative sum, so the same p can be achieved at different cumulative sums.\n\n Alternate approach: Instead of iterating over every byte (which is acceptable because total bytes is at most 100000), we can also think about the necessary conditions for a fixed p.\n\n However, let me consider the constraints: n<=100, a_i <=1000, so we can do:\n\n   total = sum(a)\n   For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n        Let S_prev = sum(a[0:i])   [if i==0 then S_prev=0]\n        Let a_i = a[i]\n        Then we are going to copy from 0 to a_i bytes.\n\n        For j from 0 to a_i (inclusive) [j is the number of bytes copied in this file so far]:\n\n            current_file_progress = (100 * j) // a_i   [floor division]\n\n            total_so_far = S_prev + j\n            overall_progress = (100 * total_so_far) // total\n\n            If current_file_progress == overall_progress, then we have found an occurrence of p = current_file_progress.\n\n        But note: we must record that the value p (which is current_file_progress) is achievable at this moment.\n\n However, we are asked to output all distinct p (from 0 to 100) that occur at least once.\n\n But note: we must avoid duplicates. We can use a set.\n\n However, there is a catch: the same p might be achieved multiple times, but we only need to record it once.\n\n But wait: what if the same p is achieved in two different files? Then we still output it once.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(a)\n\n   # We'll create a set to record the percentages that occur.\n   seen = set()\n\n   # Precompute prefix sums for the files?\n   # We can compute on the fly: for file i, we know the total of all previous files.\n\n   prefix = [0] * n\n   for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            prefix[i] = 0\n        else:\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   # Alternatively, we can do without storing the entire prefix array, but let's use a running total.\n\n   # Actually, we can do:\n\n   # Option 1: Without precomputation, we can compute the prefix for file i as the sum of all files from 0 to i-1.\n\n   # But we did: for file i, the previous files' total is prefix[i] (as defined above).\n\n   # Now iterate for each file i from 0 to n-1, and for j from 0 to a[i]:\n   for i in range(n):\n        # Compute the total of the previous files\n        S_prev = prefix[i]  # because prefix[i] = a0+a1+...+a{i-1}\n        a_i = a[i]\n        total_so_far_current = S_prev + a_i   # the total after finishing file i\n\n        # We are going to iterate j from 0 to a_i (inclusive)\n        # Note: j=0: then current_file_progress = 0, and overall_progress = floor(100*S_prev/total) [but note: at j=0 we haven't started the file, but the problem says after each byte, including the start? Actually, at the beginning of the file, before copying the first byte, we have j=0, then we update. So we include j=0.\n\n        # However, note: the problem says \"after each byte\", so j=0 is included.\n\n        for j in range(0, a_i+1):\n            # Calculate current file progress\n            cur_prog = (100 * j) // a_i   # integer floor division\n\n            # Calculate overall progress\n            # But note: the total_so_far is S_prev + j\n            total_prog = (100 * (S_prev + j)) // total\n\n            if cur_prog == total_prog:\n                # Then we have found this percentage 'cur_prog' happening at this moment.\n                seen.add(cur_prog)\n\n                # However, note: we don't break because we want to collect all possible p for each file and each j.\n\n   # But wait: what about the last part? After the last file is copied, the overall progress becomes 100, but we are iterating j from 0 to a_i. At the end of the last file, j=a_i, so total_so_far = total, then total_prog = (100 * total) // total = 100. And cur_prog = (100 * a_i) // a_i = 100. So we will record 100.\n\n   # However, note: the problem says that the moment is during the copying. After the last byte of the last file, we have 100.\n\n   # But note: the problem does not require that we stop at the last byte? The copying is complete, but that is included.\n\n   # Now, we must output numbers from 0 to 100 that are in the set, in increasing order.\n\n   # However, note: it's possible that we don't get every integer from 0 to 100? We only get the ones that occur.\n\n   # But note: we must output all integers from 0 to 100 that occur at least once. The set 'seen' contains exactly those.\n\n   # But note: we might get a number greater than 100? No, because both floor divisions are bounded by 100.\n\n   # However, what if the overall progress reaches 100 and the current file progress is 100? Then we add 100.\n\n   # But note: we must output numbers from 0 to 100. Our set may contain numbers from 0 to 100.\n\n   # Finally, we output the sorted list (which is just the set sorted) from 0 to 100, but only the ones present.\n\n   # However, there is a problem: the above iteration does not consider the possibility that the overall progress might be updated in the middle of a file, and the same p might appear again later? But we are iterating every moment (every byte) so we record every occurrence.\n\n   # But note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", so one occurrence is enough.\n\n   # However, we must consider: is it possible that the same p is achieved at two different moments? Then we don't care.\n\n   # But wait: what if the same p is achieved in two different ways (same file or different files) but we only record it once.\n\n   # This is correct.\n\n   # But note: the example input and output.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: n=1, a=[6]\n        Then total=6.\n        For i=0: S_prev=0, a_i=6.\n        j from 0 to 6:\n            j=0: cur_prog=0, total_prog=0 -> record 0.\n            j=1: cur_prog= (100*1)//6 = 16, total_prog= (100*1)//6 = 16 -> record 16.\n            j=2: 32, (200//6)=33 -> no match? Actually 100*2=200, 200//6=33 (floor division). But wait: 200//6 is 33.333... -> floor to 33, but current file progress: (100*2)//6 = 33.333... -> 33. So 33 != 33? Actually, wait: 200//6 is 33 (because 33*6=198, 34*6=204). Similarly, for j=2: current file progress is 33, overall is 33? Then we should record 33.\n\n        Actually, let me recalculate: \n            j=0: 0,0\n            j=1: 100//6 = 16, 100//6 = 16 -> record 16\n            j=2: 200//6 = 33, 200//6 = 33 -> record 33\n            j=3: 300//6=50, 300//6=50 -> record 50\n            j=4: 400//6=66, 400//6=66 -> record 66\n            j=5: 500//6=83, 500//6=83 -> record 83\n            j=6: 600//6=100, 600//6=100 -> record 100\n\n        So we get: {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}. But the example output is \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\", which matches.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: ['2\\n100 500'] -> n=2, a=[100,500], total=600.\n\n        File0: a0=100, S_prev=0.\n          j from 0 to 100:\n            j=0: 0,0 -> record 0.\n            j=1: 1, 1 -> record 1.\n            ... until j=100: 100, 100 -> record 100.\n\n        Then file1: a1=500, S_prev=100.\n          j from 0 to 500:\n            j=0: current_prog=0, overall_prog = (100*100)//600 = 16 (because 10000//600=16.666->16) -> 0 != 16 -> skip.\n            j=1: current_prog=0, overall_prog=(100*101)//600 = 17 (because 10100//600=16.833->16) -> wait, let me calculate: 100*101=10100; 10100//600 = 16 (since 16*600=9600, 17*600=10200) -> 16. But 0 != 16 -> skip.\n\n            We are looking for when current_prog (which is floor(100*j/500)) equals the overall_prog (floor(100*(100+j)/600)).\n\n            How can we get 16 again? Only if the overall_prog is 16 and the current_prog is 16.\n\n            For current_prog to be 16: 16 <= (100*j/500) < 17  => 80 <= j < 85. Since j is integer, j from 80 to 84.\n\n            Then for j=80: \n                current_prog = (100*80)//500 = 8000//500 = 16\n                overall_prog = (100*(100+80))//600 = (100*180)//600 = 18000//600 = 30 -> not 16.\n\n            j=81: current_prog=16, overall_prog=(100*181)//600=18100//600=30.166 -> 30\n            j=82: 30\n            j=83: 30\n            j=84: 30\n\n            Now, how do we get 95,96,97,98,99,100?\n\n            Example output for the second test: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n            So we must get 95,96,... from somewhere.\n\n            Let me check the entire process:\n\n            After file0: we have 100 bytes (16.666...% overall, so floor=16) and then file1 starts.\n\n            Then the overall progress increases as we copy file1. The overall progress at j bytes of file1 is: floor( (100*(100+j)) / 600 )\n\n            We want the current_prog (from file1) to equal the overall_prog.\n\n            Let p be the common value. Then:\n\n            Condition1: (100*j) // 500 == p   =>  5*p <= j*100 < 5*p + 500   [actually: j must satisfy: j >= ceil(5*p) and j < ceil(5*p + 5)? Actually, the condition is: p = floor(100*j/500)  <=>  p <= 100*j/500 < p+1  =>  5*p <= j < (5*p+5)/5? Actually: 500*p <= 100*j < 500*(p+1)  =>  j >= (500*p)/100 = 5*p and j < (500*(p+1))/100 = 5*(p+1)\n\n            Condition2: p = floor(100*(100+j)/600)  <=>  p <= (100*(100+j))/600 < p+1  =>  600*p <= 100*(100+j) < 600*(p+1)  =>  6*p <= 100+j < 6*(p+1)  =>  j >= 6*p - 100 and j < 6*p + 6 - 100 + 1? Actually, we have two inequalities:\n\n                600*p <= 100*(100+j)  =>  j >= (6*p - 100)  [but wait: 600*p <= 10000 + 100*j  => 100*j >= 600*p - 10000  => j >= (600*p - 10000)/100 = 6*p - 100.\n\n                and 100*(100+j) < 600*(p+1)  => j < (600*(p+1) - 10000)/100 = 6*(p+1) - 100.\n\n            So for a given p, j must be in [max(ceil(5*p), 6*p-100), min(floor(5*(p+1)-1), 6*(p+1)-100-1)]? Actually, we need to take integer j that satisfies:\n\n                j_low1 = max(0, ceil(5*p))   [but note: from condition1: j>=5*p and j<5*(p+1); actually from condition1: j in [5*p, 5*(p+1)-1] (integer j)]\n\n                j_high1 = 5*(p+1)-1\n\n                From condition2: j >= 6*p-100 and j < 6*p+6-100 (but wait, from condition2: j < (6*(p+1)-100) and j>=6*p-100.\n\n            Then j must be in the intersection of [5*p, 5*(p+1)-1] and [ceil(6*p-100), 6*(p+1)-100-1] (if we consider integer j). But note: the condition2 requires j>=ceil(6*p-100) but actually 6*p-100 might not be integer, so we take j>=floor(6*p-100)+1? Actually, from condition2: j>=6*p-100, and since j is integer, we take j>=ceil(6*p-100). However, note that condition2 is derived from real number inequalities and then we take floor, so the condition is that j must be an integer satisfying the inequalities.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate over p from 0 to 100 and check if there exists an integer j in [0, 500] (for file1) such that:\n\n                p = (100*j)//500   and   p = (100*(100+j))//600\n\n            But note: our original method iterates j from 0 to 500, so we will catch it.\n\n            Why did we get 95,96,97,98,99,100?\n\n            Let's check for p=95:\n\n                Condition1: j must be in [5*95, 5*96-1] = [475, 479]\n                Condition2: j must be in [6*95-100, 6*96-100-1] = [470, 575]  (wait, 6*95-100 = 570-100=470, and 6*96-100=576-100=476, then j < 476, so j in [470, 475])\n\n                Intersection: [475,479] ∩ [470,475] = {475}\n\n                So j=475.\n\n                Check: \n                  current_prog = (100*475)//500 = 47500//500 = 95\n                  overall_prog = (100*(100+475))//600 = (100*575)//600 = 57500//600 = 95 (since 57500 = 95*600 + 500? 95*600=57000, 57500-57000=500, so floor(57500/600)=95.833 -> 95) -> matches.\n\n            Similarly, for p=96:\n\n                Condition1: j in [480,484]\n                Condition2: j in [6*96-100, 6*97-100-1] = [476, 581] (since 6*96-100=576-100=476, and 6*97-100=582-100=482, so j in [476,481])\n                Intersection: [480,484] ∩ [476,481] = [480,481]\n\n                Check j=480: \n                    current_prog = (100*480)//500 = 48000//500 = 96\n                    overall_prog = (100*(100+480))//600 = (100*580)//600 = 58000//600 = 96 (exactly 96.666... -> floor 96) -> matches.\n\n                j=481: \n                    current_prog = (100*481)//500 = 48100//500 = 96 (since 96*500=48000, 48100-48000=100, so 48100/500=96.2 -> floor 96)\n                    overall_prog = (100*581)//600 = 58100//600 = 96.833 -> floor 96.\n\n            So we have p=96 at j=480 and 481.\n\n            Similarly, we can check for 97,98,99,100.\n\n            Therefore, the set for the second example should be {0, 95,96,97,98,99,100}.\n\n            But wait, why did we not get any p between 1 and 94? \n\n            The reason is that during the copying of the first file, we got p from 0 to 100, but during the second file, the overall progress jumps from 16 (at the beginning) to 100 (at the end). However, the condition for the second file requires that the current file's progress (which is from 0 to 100) and the overall progress (which is from 16 to 100) meet at certain points. The meeting points are only 95,96,...,100.\n\n            So the original method (iterating j from 0 to 500) will indeed capture these.\n\n   Therefore, the code below should work.\n\n   However, note: the example input provided in the problem statement includes four examples. We must ensure our code passes all.\n\n   But wait: the third example: \n        Input: 4\\n1000 2 2 998\n        Expected: 0\\n50\\n99\\n100\n\n   Let's run with our method:\n\n        total = 1000+2+2+998 = 2002\n\n        We'll iterate through the four files.\n\n        File0: a0=1000\n            j from 0 to 1000: \n                We'll record p=0, then p= (100*j)//1000, and overall_prog = (100*(0+j))//2002.\n\n            We are particularly interested in p=50,99,100.\n\n            p=50: \n                Condition1: 50 <= (100*j)/1000 < 51  => 500 <= j < 510 -> j=500 to 509.\n                Condition2: 50 <= (100*j)/2002 < 51  => 5000 <= j*100 < 5100  -> j>=50.0 and j<51.0 -> j=50 or j=51? But wait, condition2: 50 <= (100*j)/2002 <51  => 50*2002 <= 100*j < 51*2002 -> j>= (50*2002)//100 = 1001, and j< (51*2002)//100 = 1021.02 -> j from 1001 to 1021.\n\n                There is no overlap between [500,509] and [1001,1021]. So p=50 is not achieved in file0.\n\n            p=50 must come from a later file? Or maybe from the same file? Actually, no, because the overall progress in file0 is (100*j)//2002, and at j=500: 50000//2002 = 24 (because 2002*24=48048, 2002*25=50050) -> 24. So we never get 50 in file0.\n\n            Then we look at file1: a1=2, S_prev=1000.\n                j from 0 to 2.\n                j=0: overall_prog = (100*1000)//2002 = 49 (because 100000//2002 = 49.95 -> 49) -> not 50.\n                j=1: overall_prog = (100*1001)//2002 = 50 (because 100100//2002 = 50.0 -> 50) and current_prog = (100*1)//2 = 50 -> so 50 is recorded.\n\n            Then we see p=50 is recorded.\n\n            Similarly, p=99 and 100 must be recorded.\n\n            p=99: \n                In which file? \n                In file0: j in [990,999] (from condition1: 99<= (100*j/1000)<100) and condition2: j>= (99*2002)//100 = 1981.98 -> j>=1982, but j<=1000, so not in file0.\n\n                In file1: too small.\n\n                In file2: a2=2, S_prev=1002.\n                    j from 0 to 2.\n                    j=0: overall_prog = (100*1002)//2002 = 50 (since 100200//2002=50.05 ->50) -> not 99.\n                    j=1: (100*1003)//2002 = 50.09 ->50\n                    j=2: (100*1004)//2002 = 50.15 ->50\n\n                In file3: a3=998, S_prev=1004.\n                    Condition1: p=99 -> j in [990,999] (for 99% of 998: 99/100 *998 ~ 988.02, so j>=988 and j<989? Actually: condition1: j>= (99*998)//100 = 988.02 -> j>=989? Let me recast:\n\n                    Condition1: (100*j)//998 == 99  => 99 <= (100*j)/998 < 100\n                    => 99*998 <= 100*j < 100*998+998? Actually: 100*j >= 99*998 and 100*j < 100*998? Actually, the next integer is 100*998, but we use floor, so the condition is 100*j < 100*998+998? Actually, the condition is:\n\n                        99 <= (100*j)/998 < 100\n                        => 99*998 <= 100*j < 100*998   [but wait, the upper bound is strictly less than 100*998? Actually, the definition: floor(100*j/998)=99 means 99 <= (100*j)/998 < 100.\n\n                    So j_min = ceil(99*998/100) and j_max = floor((100*998-1)/100) = floor(997.99) -> 997? \n\n                    Actually, we have:\n                        j_min = ceil( (99*998)/100 ) = ceil(988.02) = 989\n                        j_max = floor( (99*998+997)/100 )? Actually, we have: 100*j < 100*998 -> j < 998. So j from 989 to 997.\n\n                    Now condition2: overall_prog = (100*(1004+j))//2002 = 99.\n\n                    Condition2: 99 <= (100*(1004+j))/2002 < 100\n                    => 99*2002 <= 100*(1004+j) < 100*2002\n                    => 198198 <= 100400 + 100*j < 200200\n                    => 198198-100400 <= 100*j < 200200-100400\n                    => 97798 <= 100*j < 99800\n                    => 977.98 <= j < 998.00\n\n                    So j from 978 to 997.\n\n                    Then the intersection: j from 989 to 997 (from condition1) and j from 978 to 997 (from condition2) is [989,997].\n\n                    Check j=989: \n                        Condition1: (100*989)//998 = 98900//998 = 99 (since 998*99=98802, 98900-98802=98, so 99 full and 98 left -> floor is 99)\n                        Condition2: (100*(1004+989))//2002 = (100*1993)//2002 = 199300//2002 = 99 (since 2002*99=198198, 199300-198198=1102, which is less than 2002, so floor(199300/2002)=99)\n\n                    So we record 99.\n\n            Similarly, p=100: \n                Condition1: j=998 (the entire file3) -> (100*998)//998=100\n                Condition2: (100*(1004+998))//2002 = (100*2002)//2002=100\n\n            So we have 0,50,99,100.\n\n            The example output is: 0\\n50\\n99\\n100.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read n, list a.\n        total = sum(a)\n        prefix = [0]*n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            S_prev = prefix[i] if i>0 else 0   # Actually, our prefix was defined for i>=1, but for i=0 we used 0.

That builds a list of length n, but then we index from 0 to n-1.\n\n            # Actually, the code above for building prefix was incorrect. Let me fix: we want prefix[i] = sum(a[0:i]) (for i from 0 to n).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages from 0 to 100 that can be simultaneously displayed on both progress bars at any point during the copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process of each file byte by byte. For each file, we track the progress within that file (current file progress) and the cumulative progress across all files (overall progress). The key observation is that a percentage `p` is valid if there exists a moment during the copying process where both the current file progress and the overall progress equal `p`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each byte within the file, we can compute both progress values at every step. If these values match, we record the percentage. This brute-force approach is feasible because the maximum number of bytes across all files is 100 * 1000 = 100,000, which is manageable for modern computing.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total size of all files.\n   - Using a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative size of files processed before the current one.\n   - For each file, iterating through each byte (from 0 to the file's size), computing both progress values, and checking if they are equal.\n   - Collecting all unique percentages that meet the condition.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each byte of each file once. With `n` files each of size up to 1000 bytes, the time complexity is O(n * max_file_size), which is O(100 * 1000) = O(100,000) operations. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    total = sum(a)\n    \n    prefix = [0] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        S_prev = prefix[i]\n        a_i = a[i]\n        for j in range(0, a_i + 1):\n            cur_prog = (100 * j) // a_i\n            total_prog = (100 * (S_prev + j)) // total\n            if cur_prog == total_prog:\n                seen.add(cur_prog)\n    \n    result = sorted(seen)\n    for num in result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of files `n` and their respective sizes into a list `a`.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array `prefix` is computed to store the cumulative size of files before each index, facilitating quick access during the main processing loop.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each file, the code iterates over each byte (from 0 to the file's size). For each byte, it calculates the current file's progress (`cur_prog`) and the overall progress (`total_prog`). If these values match, the percentage is added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Output**: The unique percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible points during the file copying process to determine valid percentages, leveraging simple arithmetic and iteration to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
