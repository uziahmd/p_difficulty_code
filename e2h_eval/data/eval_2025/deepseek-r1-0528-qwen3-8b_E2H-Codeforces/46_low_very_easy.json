The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to change at most one number in the subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We are going to consider three cases:\n 1. The entire sequence is already strictly increasing -> then answer n (with 0 changes) or if not, we can have a segment that might require one change.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n We can break the problem into:\n\n Case 1: Without any change, the longest strictly increasing contiguous subsegment.\n Case 2: With one change, we can merge two increasing sequences by fixing the element that breaks the increasing condition.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's define:\n   left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change).\n   right[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without any change).\n\n How to compute left[i]?\n   left[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, for right[i]:\n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n Now, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Entirely without change: the maximum value of left[i] (which gives an increasing subsegment)\n\n Option 2: With one change. There are two possibilities:\n\n   a) The subsegment has only one element: then we don't need to change, but note: if we have one element, we can consider changing it? Actually, a single element is strictly increasing. So we can use this as base.\n\n   b) More than one element.\n\n   We can consider a candidate subsegment that is formed by merging two increasing parts with one change in the middle.\n\n   Specifically, consider an index i (from 1 to n-2) where the increasing condition fails at i (i.e., a[i] >= a[i+1]). Then, we can change a[i+1] (if a[i+1] is too small) or a[i] (if a[i] is too big). But note: we are allowed to change only one number.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Candidate 1: Change the element at position i (so that the entire [L, R] becomes increasing) where L and R are chosen such that:\n\n        We take the increasing part ending at i-1 (if exists) and the increasing part starting at i+1 (if exists) and then set the changed element at i to be between a[i-1] and a[i+1].\n\n        Conditions: \n          - We must have an increasing part ending at i-1 and an increasing part starting at i+1.\n          - The merged segment would be from the start of the left part (at least one element) to the end of the right part (at least one element). The total length would be: left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1 (including the element at i which we change).\n\n        But wait: we are allowed to change one element, so we can change either the element at i or the element at i+1. Alternatively, we can also consider the possibility that the break is at i (a[i] >= a[i+1]) and we change a[i] to something less than a[i+1] but greater than a[i-1] (if exists). Similarly, we can change a[i+1] to something greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if exists).\n\n   However, note: we can also consider breaking the condition at the beginning or the end. But our left and right arrays already account for the increasing runs.\n\n   Actually, let's think about the candidate when we have a break at i (meaning a[i] >= a[i+1]):\n\n        Option A: Change a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. Then the condition for the entire segment [from the beginning of the left part (which ends at i-1) to the end of the right part (starting at i+1)] is satisfied.\n\n        But note: we must check that the left part is non-empty and the right part is non-empty. Then the candidate length is: left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1.\n\n        However, what if the left part doesn't exist? Then we cannot use this candidate because we require at least one element on the left and one on the right to form a contiguous increasing sequence with the changed element.\n\n        Similarly, we can consider changing a[i+1] to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a sequence where, by changing at most one number, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to determine the longest such subsegment efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous subsegment that can be transformed into a strictly increasing sequence by modifying at most one element. The solution requires checking all possible subsegments and determining if they meet the criteria with a single modification.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution leverages dynamic programming to precompute two arrays:\n   - `left[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - `right[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Precompute Arrays**: Calculate `left` and `right` arrays to know the lengths of increasing subsegments around each index.\n   - **Check for Single Change**: For each index, consider scenarios where changing the current element or the next element allows merging adjacent increasing subsegments. The maximum possible length after such a merge is considered as a candidate answer.\n   - **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the entire sequence is already strictly increasing or where single-element subsegments are considered.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes the sequence in linear time, O(n), for both the `left` and `right` array computations and another linear pass to check potential modifications. This ensures efficiency even for large input sizes (up to 10^5 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n <= 1:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    right = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    best = max(max(left), max(right))\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            candidate = right[i] + 1\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n            continue\n                \n        if i == n-1:\n            candidate = left[i] + 1\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n            continue\n                \n        if a[i] == a[i+1]:\n            candidate = left[i] + right[i+1] + 1\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n            continue\n                \n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            candidate = left[i] + right[i+1] + 1\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n            continue\n                \n        if a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n            if left[i-1] > 0 and right[i+1] > 0:\n                candidate = left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1\n                if candidate > best:\n                    best = candidate\n                    \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays store the lengths of the longest increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n4. **Initial Best**: The initial best candidate is the maximum value from the `left` and `right` arrays, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n5. **Single Modification Check**: For each index, the algorithm checks if modifying the current element or the next element allows merging adjacent increasing subsegments. The candidate lengths are updated if they exceed the current best.\n6. **Output**: The maximum length found is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible subsegments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one modification, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.",
