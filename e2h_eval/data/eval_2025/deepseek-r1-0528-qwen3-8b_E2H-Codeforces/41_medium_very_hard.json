There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m (all between 1 and 50) and then m lines of restrictions.\n Since n, m are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities.\n\n However, note that the profit function is a^2, which is convex. Also, the restrictions are that in each contiguous segment [l_i, r_i] the maximum height is <= x_i.\n\n We can think of it as: we want to assign a height a_i (0<=a_i<=h) for each spot i, such that for every restriction j: max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} a_i <= x_j.\n\n The goal is to maximize sum(a_i^2).\n\n Observation: Because the profit function is quadratic and convex, we might consider using DP that goes from left to right, but the constraints (restrictions) are over intervals.\n\n Alternatively, note that the restrictions impose an upper bound on the maximum height in certain intervals. This is similar to a problem with multiple interval constraints.\n\n Since n, m are small (<=50), we can try to use state space reduction. However, note that the state space of heights for each house is from 0 to h (which is up to 50) so 51^50 is too big.\n\n Another idea: The restrictions are independent and must be satisfied. We can combine all restrictions: for each position i, we must have a_i <= min{ x_j | [l_j, r_j] contains i }? Not exactly: because a restriction only constrains the entire interval. But note: if a restriction says that the maximum in [l, r] is <= x, then every house in [l, r] must be <= x. So for each house i, we can compute the minimum x such that i is contained in a restriction? Actually, we can define:\n\n   Let U(i) = min{ x_j | l_j <= i <= r_j }   ... but wait, that is not correct because a restriction might not cover i, then we don't have an explicit x_j for i. However, note that the restriction does not necessarily apply to i if i is outside [l_j, r_j]. But the problem does not require that i is covered by a restriction, only that the houses in the intervals are bounded. \n\n Actually, the restrictions are independent. The requirement is that for each restriction j, the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has houses <= x_j. Therefore, for a given house i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_j among all restrictions j that cover i? Not exactly: because a restriction that doesn't cover i doesn't constrain i. However, note that if a restriction covers i, then i must be <= x_j. But there could be multiple restrictions and the most restrictive one (smallest x_j) that covers i would be the one that matters.\n\n However, wait: what if two restrictions cover i, one with x1 and one with x2 (x1 < x2)? Then the house i must be <= x1 (the smallest). Therefore, for house i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_j such that i is in [l_j, r_j]. But what if no restriction covers i? Then there is no explicit constraint from the restrictions, so the house i can be as high as h.\n\n So we can precompute for each position i (from 1 to n) the minimum x_j that applies to i (if any restriction covers i; if none, then set to h). But note: the problem says the maximum height overall is h, so if no restriction covers i, then we can set a_i up to h.\n\n However, wait: is that really the case? Consider two restrictions: one that covers i with x_j=5, and another that doesn't cover i. Then the house i must be <=5 (from the first restriction). But also, the house i must be <=h (given). So the effective maximum for house i is min( h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j )?\n\n But note: the problem states that the maximum height of a house is h (so we cannot exceed h). And the restrictions say \"must be at most x_i\". So the actual constraint for house i is: \n   a_i <= min( h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j )\n\n However, wait: what if a restriction j does not cover i? Then we don't have to worry about it for i. So the above formula holds.\n\n But let's validate with the example: \n   Example 1: n=3, h=3, m=3, restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n   For house1 (i=1): covered by [1,1,1] -> min_x = 1, so a1 <= min(3,1)=1.\n   For house2 (i=2): covered by [2,2,3] -> min_x = 3, so a2 <= min(3,3)=3.\n   For house3 (i=3): covered by [3,3,2] -> min_x = 2, so a3 <= min(3,2)=2.\n\n Then we choose a1 in {0,1}, a2 in {0,1,...,3}, a3 in {0,1,...,2}. Then we maximize a1^2+a2^2+a3^2.\n\n The example solution uses [1,3,2]: 1^2+3^2+2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n Now, is that the maximum?\n   a1: only 0 or 1 -> 0 gives 0, 1 gives 1 -> better to take 1.\n   a2: can take 3 -> 9\n   a3: can take 2 -> 4\n   total 14.\n\n However, what if we set a2 to 3 and a3 to 2, but what if we break the condition? The condition for the second restriction [2,2,3] is satisfied because 3<=3. The condition for the third restriction [3,3,2] is satisfied because 2<=2. The condition for the first restriction [1,1,1] is satisfied because 1<=1.\n\n But wait: what about the entire set of restrictions? The first restriction only requires the first house to be <=1. The second requires the second house to be <=3. The third requires the third house to be <=2. There are no other restrictions.\n\n However, note: the example input has three restrictions. Each restriction is independent. So we must satisfy all three.\n\n Now, consider a different example: \n   Example 2: Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n   We have n=4, h=10, m=2.\n   Precompute for each house i:\n     House1 (i=1): not covered by any restriction? \n        Restriction1: [2,3] -> doesn't cover 1.\n        Restriction2: [3,4] -> doesn't cover 1.\n        So a1 <= 10 (the global maximum)\n\n     House2 (i=2): covered by restriction1 -> min_x = 8 (since 8 is the only one) -> a2 <= min(10,8)=8\n     House3 (i=3): covered by both restrictions -> min(8,7)=7 -> a3 <=7\n     House4 (i=4): covered by restriction2 -> min_x=7 -> a4<=7\n\n   Then the example solution is [10,8,7,7] -> 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   Why is house1 set to 10? Because there is no restriction forcing it to be lower, and 10 is the maximum allowed (global h=10). Then house2: maximum 8, house3 and house4: maximum 7.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute an array `max_allowed` for each house i (from 0 to n-1, indexing from 0) as:\n        max_allowed[i] = h   (initially)\n        For each restriction (l, r, x):\n            For each index i (0-indexed) such that l-1 <= i <= r-1:\n                max_allowed[i] = min(max_allowed[i], x)\n\n        But note: the problem says the global maximum is h, so if a restriction says x, then the house must be <= x (and x<=h). However, if no restriction covers a house, we leave it as h.\n\n   However, wait: what if a restriction has x greater than h? But the problem says 0<=x_i<=h, so x<=h. Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        max_allowed[i] = min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j   (if at least one restriction covers i) and if none, then we set to h? \n\n        But note: the problem says the maximum height of a house is h, and the restrictions say \"at most x_i\", so if no restriction, we use h.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set initially max_allowed[i] = h, then for each restriction, update the houses in [l_j, r_j] to min(current, x_j). Since x_j<=h, this is safe.\n\n   Step 2: Now, we have for each house i, an upper bound u_i = max_allowed[i]. Then we wish to assign a_i in [0, u_i] (integers) to maximize sum(a_i^2).\n\n   But note: is that all? Actually, no! Because the restrictions are more than just individual bounds. Consider: a restriction says the tallest house in [l_j, r_j] must be <= x_j. This is equivalent to every house in [l_j, r_j] being <= x_j. So the individual bound we computed for each house is necessary and sufficient? Yes, because if we set each house i to be <= min_{j covering i} x_j, then in particular, for a restriction j, every house i in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j (because x_j is one of the x's in the min for those i, and we set the house to be <= that min, which is <= x_j). Conversely, if we set a house i to be greater than min_{j covering i} x_j, then one of the restrictions j that covers i would be violated (because that restriction j requires the house i to be <= x_j, but we set it to a value > x_j). \n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to: assign a_i in [0, u_i] (for each house i) to maximize sum(a_i^2).\n\n   However, wait: is that correct? Consider two houses and one restriction covering both. We set each house independently to its upper bound. But what if we set one house to less than its upper bound so that we can set another house to a higher value? No, because the restrictions are independent per house (each house has its own upper bound). Actually, the assignment is independent because the restrictions are already taken into account by setting the upper bound for each house.\n\n   But note: the profit function is separable and the constraints are separable (each house has an independent upper bound). Therefore, we can assign each house independently to the value that maximizes a_i^2 given the constraint a_i <= u_i.\n\n   However, wait: the function a^2 is increasing for a>=0 (because derivative 2a is positive). So for a given house i, the best is to set a_i to its maximum allowed value: u_i.\n\n   Then the maximum profit would be: for each i, u_i^2, and then sum them up.\n\n   Let me test with example1: \n        House0: u0=1 -> 1^2=1\n        House1: u1=3 -> 3^2=9\n        House2: u2=2 -> 2^2=4\n        Total: 1+9+4=14 -> matches.\n\n   Example2:\n        House0: u0=10 -> 10^2=100\n        House1: u1=8 -> 8^2=64\n        House2: u2=7 -> 7^2=49\n        House3: u3=7 -> 7^2=49\n        Total: 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> matches.\n\n   But wait, what if there is a restriction that forces a house to be low, but then we can set adjacent houses arbitrarily? The above reasoning seems to work.\n\n   However, let's consider a counterexample: \n\n        n=2, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,2,5]\n\n        Then according to our method:\n            House0: u0 = min(10,5)=5 -> profit 25\n            House1: u1 = min(10,5)=5 -> profit 25\n            Total: 50.\n\n        But what if we set one house to 5 and the other to 10? Then the maximum in [1,2] is 10, which violates the restriction (which requires <=5). \n\n        Therefore, we made a mistake: the restriction is on the entire interval. The above method sets each house independently to the minimum of the restrictions that cover it, but note: the restriction [1,2,5] means both houses must be <=5. \n\n        However, we did set both houses to 5. The problem is that we set each house to the minimum of the restrictions that cover it, which is correct because the restriction requires the entire interval to have maximum 5, so each house must be <=5. \n\n        But why did I consider setting one house to 10? Because 10 is the global maximum, but the restriction [1,2,5] overrides the global maximum for these two houses. So the independent assignment is still valid.\n\n        Now, what if we have two overlapping restrictions? \n\n        Example: n=2, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2,5]\n          Restriction2: [1,2,3]\n\n        Then for each house i, the max_allowed[i] = min(10, min(5,3)) = 3.\n        Then profit = 3^2+3^2 = 18.\n\n        Now, if we set one house to 5 and the other to 3, then the entire interval [1,2] has maximum 5, which violates the second restriction (which requires <=3). Therefore, we must set both houses to <=3.\n\n        So the method is: for each house, set the maximum allowed by all restrictions that cover it (taking the minimum) and then set the house to that maximum.\n\n        However, wait: is that always optimal? \n\n        Since the profit function is a^2, which is increasing and strictly convex, the best for a single house is to set it to its maximum allowed value. And because the constraints are independent per house (each house i must be <= u_i, and the restrictions are enforced by setting u_i appropriately), the independent assignment is optimal.\n\n        But note: the restrictions are enforced by the condition that the entire interval must have maximum <= x_j. Our assignment (each house set to u_i) satisfies: for a restriction j, the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has houses set to values <= min_{k covering i} x_k (for each i) and note that for any house i in [l_j, r_j], we have u_i <= x_j (because x_j is one of the x's that defines u_i, so the min including x_j is <= x_j). Therefore, the entire interval has maximum <= x_j.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n          Step1: Precompute an array `u` of length n (for spots 1..n) with initial value h.\n          Step2: For each restriction (l, r, x):\n                  For i from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed indices):\n                      u[i] = min(u[i], x)\n\n          Step3: For each i, set a_i = u[i] (because u[i]^2 is the maximum we can get for that house, since the function is increasing and the constraint is u[i]).\n          Step4: Profit = sum(i=0 to n-1) (u[i]^2)\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n            Initially: u = [3,3,3]\n\n            First restriction [1,1,1]: update index0: u[0]=min(3,1)=1 -> u=[1,3,3]\n            Second restriction [2,2,3]: update index1: u[1]=min(3,3)=3 -> u=[1,3,3]\n            Third restriction [3,3,2]: update index2: u[2]=min(3,2)=2 -> u=[1,3,2]\n\n            Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n        Example2:\n            n=4, h=10, m=2\n            Restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]\n\n            Initially: u = [10,10,10,10]\n\n            First restriction: update indices1 and 2 (0-indexed) -> [10,8,8,10] becomes [10,8,8,10] -> then second restriction: update indices2 and 3: \n                index2: min(8,7)=7 -> becomes 7\n                index3: min(10,7)=7 -> becomes 7\n            So u = [10,8,7,7]\n            Profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n        However, wait: the example input says:\n            Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        But note: the restriction [2,3,8] covers houses 2 and 3 (which are indices1 and 2). The restriction [3,4,7] covers houses 3 and 4 (indices2 and 3).\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait: what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions and one of them is smaller? We are taking the minimum, which is correct.\n\n        However, what if the restrictions are not aligned? \n\n        Example: n=3, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2,5]\n          Restriction2: [2,3,3]\n\n          Then for house0 (index0): only restriction1 -> u0=5\n          house1 (index1): both -> u1=min(5,3)=3\n          house2 (index2): restriction2 -> u2=3\n\n          Then profit = 5^2+3^2+3^2 = 25+9+9=43.\n\n          Check the restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,2] must have max<=5 -> indeed, we have 5 and 3, max=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [2,3] must have max<=3 -> we have 3 and 3 -> ok.\n\n        But is there a better assignment? \n          If we set house0 to 5, house1 to 3, house2 to 3: 43.\n\n          What if we set house0 to 4 (then house1 to 3, house2 to 3): 16+9+9=34 -> worse.\n          Or house0 to 5, house1 to 2, house2 to 3: 25+4+9=38 -> worse.\n\n          So 43 is the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the maximum height is h, and we are using the minimum of the restrictions and h. But note: the initial value is h, and then we take the minimum with the restriction x's (which are <=h). So we are effectively doing:\n\n            u[i] = min( h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j )\n\n        But since x_j<=h, then min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j is the effective constraint (if any restriction covers i) and if not, we use h.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Read n, h, m.\n        Initialize u = [h] * n\n\n        For _ in range(m):\n            Read l, r, x\n            # convert to 0-indexed indices: from l-1 to r-1\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < u[i]:\n                    u[i] = x\n\n        Then, profit = 0\n        for a in u:\n            profit += a*a\n\n        Print profit.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the maximum height of a house is h, and the restrictions are given as x_i (0<=x_i<=h). So if a house is not covered by any restriction, we use h. If covered, we use the minimum x_j (which is <=h). \n\n        However, note: the condition of the problem is that the house must be at most the minimum x_j (if covered) or h (if not). And we are setting the house to that value.\n\n        But is that the maximum? Because the profit function is increasing, yes.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example1: \n            Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n            Output: 14\n\n        Example2:\n            Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n            Output: 262\n\n        However, wait: the example input format is given as two separate strings in a list, but the problem reads from stdin. We need to read from stdin.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as:\n\n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        This is just two examples. In the real competition, we would read one input.\n\n        We assume the input is provided as described.\n\n        However, wait: there is a catch. The above reasoning is correct only if the restrictions are applied independently. But note: the same restriction might be applied multiple times and we are updating the same array. \n\n        But what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions? We are taking the minimum of all x_j that cover it. This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        u = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < u[i]:\n                    u[i] = x\n\n        total = 0\n        for a in u:\n            total += a*a\n\n        print(total)\n\n        However, wait: the example inputs are given as separate strings in a list. But the problem says to read from stdin.\n\n        But note: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n            Input:\n                3 3 3\n                1 1 1\n                2 2 3\n                3 3 2\n\n        So we read one line for n, h, m and then m lines.\n\n        But wait: the example input is provided as two separate strings in a list, meaning the user provided two examples. However, in the actual competition, we only get one input.\n\n        But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples.\n\n        We assume the input comes from stdin.\n\n        However, let me test with the sample inputs.\n\n        Sample1: \n            Input: \n                3 3 3\n                1 1 1\n                2 2 3\n                3 3 2\n\n            Output: 14\n\n        Sample2:\n            Input:\n                4 10 2\n                2 3 8\n                3 4 7\n\n            Output: 262\n\n        But wait, there is a potential issue: what if the same house is updated multiple times? We are iterating through each restriction and updating the entire interval. Since we are taking the minimum, the order does not matter.\n\n        However, consider: \n            n=1, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,1,5]\n            Restriction2: [1,1,3]\n\n            Then for the first restriction: u[0] = min(10,5)=5\n            Then for the second restriction: u[0] = min(5,3)=3.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: what if a restriction has a larger x? Then we don't update (because we take min). So order doesn't matter.\n\n        However, what if a house is covered by two restrictions, one with x=5 and then one with x=3? Then the first restriction sets to 5, the second to 3.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two restrictions that overlap and one is applied first and then the other? It doesn't matter because we update with the minimum.\n\n        Therefore, we can run the code.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the maximum height of a house is h. Our code sets a house to h initially and then reduces if a restriction applies. This is correct.\n\n        Let me test with a house that is not covered by any restriction.\n\n        Example: n=2, h=10, m=1\n            Restriction: [1,1,5]   -> only house0\n            Then u[0]=5, u[1]=10 (since house1 is not covered).\n            Profit = 25+100=125.\n\n        Without the restriction, we would have set house0 to 10 and house1 to 10 -> profit 200. But the restriction forces house0 to be <=5.\n\n        However, wait: the example input only provides one restriction. The code correctly updates house0 to 5.\n\n        But note: the problem says the maximum height is h (10) and the restriction says the house in [1,1] must be <=5. So the house0 must be <=5, and house1 can be up to 10.\n\n        So 5^2+10^2=25+100=125.\n\n        But wait, is 125 the maximum? \n            We cannot set house0 to 6 (because then the restriction is violated). So 125 is the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the maximum height of a house is h, meaning we cannot exceed h. The restriction is independent. The code enforces the restriction by reducing the upper bound to the minimum of h and the restrictions. Since the restrictions are at most h, we are safe.\n\n        But note: the problem says the house can be built with height between 0 and h. So if we set a house to 0, that's allowed. But the profit function is increasing so we don't want to set to 0 unless forced by a restriction? Actually, no: we are forced by the restriction to set the house to at most the minimum of the restrictions (if any) and h. But the profit function is increasing, so we set the house to the maximum allowed value (which is the minimum of the restrictions and h) to maximize the square.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have multiple restrictions that together force a house to be lower than h, but then we can set adjacent houses to h? That is already handled: each house is set independently to its own maximum allowed value.\n\n        But note: the restrictions are independent per house. The only constraint for house i is that it must be <= the minimum x_j for which i is in [l_j, r_j] (if any) and otherwise h.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, wait: the problem statement says the restrictions are given by (l_i, r_i, x_i) and they must be satisfied. Our method ensures that because the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has houses set to values <= x_j (since each house in that interval is set to <= x_j, because x_j is one of the constraints for that house, and we set it to the minimum of all constraints, which includes x_j). \n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        Let's run the code on the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            u = [3,3,3]\n            Process restriction1: [1,1,1] -> update index0: 3->1 -> [1,3,3]\n            Process restriction2: [2,2,3] -> update index1: 3->3 -> [1,3,3] (no change)\n            Process restriction3: [3,3,2] -> update index2: 3->2 -> [1,3,2]\n            Sum: 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n        Example2:\n            n=4, h=10, m=2\n            u = [10,10,10,10]\n            Process restriction1: [2,3,8] -> update indices1 and 2: \n                index1: 10->8, index2:10->8 -> [10,8,8,10]\n            Process restriction2: [3,4,7] -> update indices2 and 3:\n                index2: min(8,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,10] becomes [10,8,7,10] but then update index3: 10->7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n            Sum: 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: the example input format in the problem statement is given as two separate strings. How do we know the input format? The problem says:\n\n            The first line contains three integers n, h, m (1<=n,h,m<=50)\n            Each of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, x_i\n\n        So we read from stdin.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        u = [h] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if x_val < u[i]:\n                    u[i] = x_val\n\n        total = 0\n        for val in u:\n            total += val * val\n\n        print(total)\n\n        Let me submit this.\n\n        But wait: there is a possibility that the same restriction is given multiple times? The problem doesn't say, but our method is idempotent (taking the minimum) so it's okay.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"m\" restrictions, so we process m lines.\n\n        We assume the input is well-formed.\n\n        But wait: the example input has m=3 and then 3 restrictions, and m=2 and then 2 restrictions.\n\n        This code should work.\n\n        However, wait: what if a restriction has x_i greater than h? The problem says 0<=x_i<=h, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But wait: the problem statement says \"In each spot, if a house has height a, you will gain a^2 dollars from it.\" and we are assigning the maximum allowed value. This is optimal because the function is increasing and convex.\n\n        However, wait: what if we can set a house to a value lower than the maximum allowed? Then we might be able to relax some constraints? \n\n        Let me reconsider: the constraints are that in each restriction j, the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. \n\n        The condition is: for every j, max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} a_i <= x_j.\n\n        Our method sets each house i to the minimum of the x_j for which i is in [l_j, r_j] (or h if none). But note: if we set a house i to a value lower than that, then the condition for the restrictions that cover i is still satisfied, but we get less profit.\n\n        However, the problem asks for maximum profit. So we want to set each house to the highest allowed value.\n\n        But is that always safe? \n\n        Example: two houses and one restriction [1,2,5]. We set both houses to 5. Then the maximum in the interval is 5, which is allowed.\n\n        Now, what if we set one house to 4 and the other to 5? Then the maximum is 5, which is allowed. But the profit is 16+25=41, which is less than 5^2+5^2=50.\n\n        Similarly, setting one house to 3 and the other to 5: 9+25=34, even less.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum profit is achieved when each house is set to the maximum allowed value.\n\n        However, wait: what if the maximum allowed value for a house is forced by a restriction that also covers an adjacent house? \n\n        Example: n=2, m=1, restriction [1,2,5]. Then the maximum allowed for house0 is 5, for house1 is 5. Then we set both to 5.\n\n        But what if we set house0 to 4 and house1 to 5? Then the maximum is 5, which is allowed. But profit is 4^2+5^2=16+25=41 < 50.\n\n        Similarly, if we set house0 to 5 and house1 to 4, same thing.\n\n        So the independent assignment is optimal.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have two restrictions that are not conflicting?\n\n        Example: n=2, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,1,5]\n            Restriction2: [2,2,3]\n\n            Then house0: max_allowed=5, house1: max_allowed=3.\n            Then profit = 25+9=34.\n\n            Is there a way to get more? \n                House0: must be <=5, house1: must be <=3.\n                We set house0 to 5 and house1 to 3 -> 25+9=34.\n\n            If we set house0 to 4 and house1 to 3: 16+9=25 -> worse.\n\n        So indeed, the independent assignment is optimal.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the maximum height is h, and we are using h as the initial value. But what if h is 0? Then we set all houses to 0, and the profit is 0.\n\n        Example: n=1, h=0, m=0 -> profit=0.\n\n        Example: n=1, h=0, m=1, restriction [1,1,0] -> then u[0]=min(0,0)=0 -> profit=0.\n\n        Example: n=1, h=0, m=1, restriction [1,1, -1] -> but the problem says x_i>=0, so not possible.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        We'll now write the code.\n\n        Note: We are reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n        Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \n            Input: \n                3 3 3\n                1 1 1\n                2 2 3\n                3 3 2\n\n            Output: 14\n\n        Example2:\n            Input:\n                4 10 2\n                2 3 8\n                3 4 7\n\n            Output: 262\n\n        But wait: the example input in the problem statement is given as two separate strings. We are reading from stdin, so we must provide the input in the standard way.\n\n        The code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < arr[i]:\n                    arr[i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to certain zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints specify that the tallest house in any given interval must not exceed a specified maximum height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal heights for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction limits the maximum height of houses in a specific interval. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes it. This is found by taking the minimum of all the maximum heights specified in the restrictions that cover the house. If no restrictions apply, the house can be built up to the global maximum height \\( h \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Initializing an array with the global maximum height \\( h \\) for each house.\n   - For each zoning restriction, update the corresponding houses in the interval to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n   - After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating each house in its interval. With \\( n \\) houses and \\( m \\) restrictions, the complexity is \\( O(m \\times n) \\). Given the constraints \\( n, m \\leq 50 \\), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    arr = [h] * n\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x_val\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in arr:\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first three values are the number of spots \\( n \\), the global maximum height \\( h \\), and the number of restrictions \\( m \\).\n2. **Initialization**: An array `arr` is initialized with the global maximum height \\( h \\) for each house.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the corresponding houses in the specified interval are updated to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height. This ensures all restrictions are satisfied.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the total profit is computed by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all zoning restrictions are met while maximizing the profit by leveraging the convex nature of the profit function (sum of squares), which dictates that higher heights yield greater profits within the allowed constraints.",
