Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the required letters (without changing the count of each letter).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of letters from the combined string with the sorted list of letters from the third string.\n 4. If they are the same, output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem states that there should be no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   The combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (which has the same letters as \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" when considering the counts? Actually, let's break it down:\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as:\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   Actually, the example input has three lines. So we have:\n\n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then the required letters are from guest + host, which is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". \n\n   Now, let's compare the sorted version of \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\":\n\n   Alternatively, we can note: the example says YES.\n\n   Let me count the letters in the required names:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Combined: S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:2, A:2, N:1, T:2, M:2, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   Wait, there's an extra T and M and O? Actually, let me count again for the pile:\n\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n        S:2, A:2, N:1, T:2, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\n   But wait, the example input says: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\" -> has one T, and host \"DEDMOROZ\" has one T? Actually, host \"DEDMOROZ\": D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> so T is not in host. But the pile has two T's? \n\n   Let me write the combined name: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Count T in \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\": \n        SANTACLAUS: has one T (at position 3: S A N T A ...)\n        DEDMOROZ: has no T. So total T: 1.\n\n   But the pile \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has two T's? \n\n   Actually, let's break down the example:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> actually, wait, let's spell: \n            S A N T A C L A U S -> that's 10 letters. Then host: D E D M O R O Z -> 8 letters. Total 18 letters.\n\n        Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> 18 letters.\n\n        Now, counting T: \n            In the combined string: \n                Guest: SANTACLAUS -> one T.\n                Host",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the counts of each letter in the pile match exactly with the counts of letters in the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters:** Use a frequency counter (like `collections.Counter`) to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts:** Check if the counts of each letter in the combined names exactly match the counts in the pile. If they match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three strings from standard input, representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the required letters.\n3. **Frequency Counting:** The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Comparison:** The counts from the combined names and the pile are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the original names, so the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter counts, ensuring that there are no extra or missing letters in the pile compared to the combined names. The use of `Counter` simplifies the counting process and makes the solution both concise and efficient.",
