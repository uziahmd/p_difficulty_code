Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

But note that the problem states that m is given by the binary representation s0s1...sn-1, meaning:\n   m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + sn-1*2^0\n\n However, note that in the example: \n   Input: \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n   Here, n=2, a=[3,8], and the binary string is \"10\", so m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n But the example says: f(0)=0, f(1)=3. And the maximum is 3.\n\n Another example:\n   Input: \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n   Here, n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], and the binary string is \"11010\", so m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n However, the sample output is 27, which is achieved at x=5 (which is 101 in binary, but note: the function f(x) uses the first n bits? Actually, the function f(x) is defined for x from 0 to 2n-1, and the i-th bit (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to the exponent 2^i, but note:\n\n In the problem, the binary representation of x has up to n bits (since x is from 0 to 2^n - 1). However, the array a has n elements, and the index i (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to the bit at position i (which is 2^i).\n\n But note: the example says for n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) then f(11)=a0+a1+a3. So the positions are numbered from 0 (least significant bit) to n-1 (most significant bit) or the other way?\n\n Let me read the problem: \"value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n The example: n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in binary, so we consider 4 bits: from bit0 (LSB) to bit3 (MSB)): \n   bit0: 1 -> include a0\n   bit1: 1 -> include a1\n   bit2: 0 -> skip a2\n   bit3: 1 -> include a3\n\n So the array a is given as [a0, a1, a2, a3] and the function f(x) = sum_{i: the i-th bit is set} a_i.\n\n But note: the input binary string for m is given without spaces, and the example \"10\" for n=2: \n   This means m's binary representation is \"10\", which is two bits. Then we have two bits: \n      bit0 (LSB): 0 -> not set\n      bit1 (MSB): 1 -> set\n\n However, the array a has two elements: [3,8]. So f(1) (which is the number 1 in binary is '01' for two bits? Actually, the problem states that x is from 0 to 2n-1, so we consider exactly n bits? \n\n But wait: the example says for n=2, m=2 (binary \"10\"). Then x can be 0,1,2 (because 2^2-1=3, so x from 0 to 3). However, the condition is 0<=x<=m, so x from 0 to 2.\n\n Then:\n   x=0: bits = [0,0] -> f(0)=0\n   x=1: bits = [1,0] -> f(1)=a0=3\n   x=2: bits = [0,1] -> f(2)=a1=8\n   x=3: bits = [1,1] -> f(3)=a0+a1=11, but 3>2 (m=2) so not allowed.\n\n However, the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements \\( a_i \\) where the \\( i \\)-th bit of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to consider all numbers \\( x \\) from 0 to \\( m \\) (inclusive) and compute \\( f(x) \\) for each \\( x \\). The challenge is to efficiently determine the maximum \\( f(x) \\) without checking every possible \\( x \\) individually, especially since \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums elements \\( a_i \\) based on the bits set in \\( x \\). To maximize \\( f(x) \\), we should prefer setting bits corresponding to larger \\( a_i \\) values, provided that the resulting \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a dynamic programming approach combined with bit manipulation. We process each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). For each bit, we decide whether to set it in \\( x \\) based on whether it is set in \\( m \\) and the remaining value allows it. However, if setting a bit leads to an \\( x \\) exceeding \\( m \\), we adjust subsequent bits accordingly.\n\n4. **Optimization**: Instead of brute-forcing all possible \\( x \\), we traverse the binary representation of \\( m \\) and keep track of the current value of \\( x \\) being constructed. For each bit, we consider setting it if it doesn't violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), and then proceed recursively or iteratively with the remaining bits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n\n    total_length = len(s)\n    num = int(s, 2)\n    \n    dp = [-1] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    max_val = 0\n    current = 0\n    power = 1 << (total_length - 1)\n\n    for i in range(total_length):\n        bit_index = total_length - 1 - i\n        bit_value = 1 << bit_index\n        \n        if s[i] == '1':\n            candidate = current + bit_value\n            if candidate <= num:\n                current += bit_value\n                dp[i+1] = candidate\n                max_val = max(max_val, dp[i+1])\n            else:\n                dp[i+1] = current\n        else:\n            dp[i+1] = current\n\n        if i < total_length - 1:\n            if s[i] == '1' and current + bit_value > num:\n                max_val = max(max_val, dp[i+1])\n\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if (current & (1 << i)) != 0:\n            result += a[i]\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Initial Setup**: Convert the binary string to an integer \\( m \\) for easier comparison. Initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of the maximum value achievable up to each bit position.\n3. **Bit Processing**: For each bit in the binary representation of \\( m \\), determine if setting that bit in \\( x \\) would keep \\( x \\) within bounds. If so, update the current value and the maximum value (`max_val`).\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all bits, compute the result by summing the elements \\( a_i \\) where the \\( i \\)-th bit is set in the constructed \\( x \\).\n5. **Output**: The maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging bit manipulation and dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
