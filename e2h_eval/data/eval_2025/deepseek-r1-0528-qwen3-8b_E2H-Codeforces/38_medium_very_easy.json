    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000). We need to:\n 1. Find the minimum number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with n nodes that is p-reachable.\n    - Note: The graph must have exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v being mutually reachable.\n\n 2. Among all graphs with the minimum number of nodes that are p-reachable, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, a path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Observation for part 1:\n\n What does it mean for a graph to be p-reachable?\n   We require that the graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) (with u < v) such that u and v are mutually reachable.\n\n Note: In a directed graph, mutual reachability defines strongly connected components (SCCs). In fact, two nodes are in the same SCC if they are mutually reachable.\n\n However, note the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\". \n But note: In an SCC, the entire component is strongly connected. The condition for being p-reachable is that the total number of unordered pairs (u, v) with u < v that are in the same SCC is p.\n\n Let the graph have k strongly connected components (with sizes s1, s2, ..., sk). Then the number of mutual pairs (u < v) is the sum over i of C(s_i, 2) = sum_i [s_i*(s_i-1)//2] = p.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"ordered pairs\" but then specifies (u, v) with u < v. So we are counting unordered pairs? Actually, the problem says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v)\" but then adds the condition u < v. So we are effectively counting unordered pairs, but the graph is directed and the mutual reachability condition is symmetric.\n\n Now, the goal is to use the minimum number of nodes (n) such that we can form a graph with exactly p mutual pairs (and we can arrange the rest arbitrarily, but note the graph must be p-reachable).\n\n We can think of the graph as having several strongly connected components (SCCs) and no edges between some of them (so that the mutual reachability only happens within the SCCs). The entire graph might be disconnected in terms of SCCs, but note: the problem doesn't require the graph to be connected. \n\n How to minimize the total number of nodes? We want to represent p as the sum of triangle numbers (each component of size s_i contributes T(s_i) = s_i*(s_i-1)//2) and we want to minimize the total nodes n = s1 + s2 + ... + sk.\n\n This is similar to the problem of representing p as a sum of triangular numbers (but note: we are allowed to use any positive integers s_i >= 1, and we want to minimize the total sum of the s_i).\n\n However, note: the triangular numbers are T(k) = k*(k-1)//2. We need to write p as a sum of triangular numbers (each component's contribution) and then the total nodes would be the sum of the square roots (in terms of the side lengths) of these triangular numbers? Actually, we have:\n\n   p = T(a1) + T(a2) + ... + T(ak)\n   and n = a1 + a2 + ... + ak.\n\n We want to minimize n, given p.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what is the minimal n such that the maximum sum of T(a_i) for a_i>=1 and sum(a_i)=n is at least p? But note: we can also break into arbitrary components (any partition of n into positive integers). However, the problem requires exactly p.\n\n Actually, we are allowed to choose any set of components (each component is a complete directed graph? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the structure, but note: the mutual reachability condition is equivalent to having a strongly connected component. The minimal way to have a component of size a is to have a complete strongly connected component (like a tournament) but that doesn't matter for counting the mutual pairs (which is fixed by the size).\n\n So the problem reduces to: Represent p as the sum of k triangular numbers (each T(x) = x*(x-1)//2 for x>=1) and minimize the total x's (n) used.\n\n However, note: we cannot use fractional components. We are to assign entire numbers to the components.\n\n Example: p=3 -> which triangular numbers? \n   T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, etc.\n\n So 3 can be represented by one component of size 3 (T(3)=3) and then the total nodes n=3.\n\n Alternatively, we could use three components of size 2: then T(2)=1, so 1+1+1=3, but then the total nodes would be 2+2+2=6, which is more than 3.\n\n Therefore, we want to minimize n (the total nodes) for a given p.\n\n We can use dynamic programming or greedy? But note p can be up to 200000.\n\n Another idea: We know that the triangular number T(k) = k*(k-1)//2. We are to cover p by a sum of triangular numbers and minimize the total k's (the sides) we use.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use the entire n nodes in one connected component? Actually, the graph can have multiple components. So we can break p arbitrarily into triangular numbers.\n\n However, note: the triangular numbers must be nonnegative and we can use as many as we want.\n\n We are to minimize the total nodes (the sum of the sides) given that the sum of the triangular numbers is p.\n\n But note: we can use the same triangular number multiple times.\n\n Let f(n) = maximum p we can get with n nodes (by breaking n into components, the best way to maximize p is to put as many nodes as possible in one component? Actually, no: the function T(k) is convex. To get a fixed total n, we want to minimize the number of components? Actually, no: we want to maximize the sum of T(k_i) for a fixed n. \n\n However, we are not maximizing p for a fixed n, but we are given p and we want the minimal n such that there exists a representation.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the minimal n for each p from 0 up to 200000.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the triangular numbers are T(k) = k*(k-1)//2 for k>=1.\n\n 2. We want to find the smallest n such that we can represent p as the sum of T(a_i) for some positive integers a_i and the sum of a_i is n.\n\n 3. We can use a greedy approach: use the largest triangular numbers first (i.e., use as large components as possible) because the triangular number T(k) grows as k^2, so using a big component gives a lot of p per node.\n\n However, we are minimizing the total nodes. So we want to use as few nodes as possible to achieve p.\n\n But note: one component of size k gives T(k) and uses k nodes. Alternatively, we can use multiple components: for example, if we have two components, one of size k and one of size 1, then the total p is T(k) and the total nodes is k+1. But if we use two components of size k/2 (if k is even) then the total p is 2*T(k/2) and the total nodes is k.\n\n However, we are allowed to break arbitrarily. We want to minimize the total nodes.\n\n Let's define:\n   dp[p] = minimal total nodes needed to represent p as the sum of triangular numbers.\n\n Then we can iterate p from 0 to 200000.\n\n But note: we can use the same triangular number multiple times.\n\n However, the triangular numbers we have are T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, T(5)=10, T(6)=15, ... \n\n But note: we are allowed to use T(1)=0? Actually, a component of size 1 contributes 0 (because there are no edges and no mutual pairs). So we can ignore components of size 1 because they don't contribute to p and they add 1 to the node count. However, we can use components of size 1 arbitrarily without affecting p. But wait, the condition is exactly p mutual pairs. So if we use a component of size 1, we are adding 0 to p and 1 to n. So we can have extra nodes that are isolated.\n\n However, the problem says \"minimum number of nodes\", so we would prefer to avoid unnecessary nodes. But sometimes we might need to break a component to get the exact p.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we are allowed to have multiple components. We want to represent p as the sum of triangular numbers (each T(k) for k>=2, because T(1)=0 and including T(1) doesn't help in increasing p) and then the total nodes is the sum of the k's (for each component, the size k). But note: we can also use components of size 1 (which add 0 to p) to pad the graph without affecting p, but that would increase n. Since we are minimizing n, we don't want to use any unnecessary nodes.\n\n So the minimal n is the minimal sum of the sizes (k_i) such that the sum of T(k_i) (for k_i>=2) is p.\n\n However, we can also use components of size 1 (which are neutral) if we don't have enough p. But since we are minimizing n, we would only use components that are necessary (i.e., those that give positive T(k)) and then if we have to, we can add neutral components (size 1) to meet the requirement of having exactly p? Actually, no: the condition is exactly p, so we must have the sum of T(k_i) equal to p.\n\n So we need to represent p as the sum of T(k_i) for k_i>=2, and we want to minimize the total n = sum(k_i).\n\n How to do that?\n\n We can use dynamic programming:\n\n   dp[0] = 0\n   For p from 1 to 200000:\n        dp[p] = min_{k>=2 and T(k)<=p} { dp[p - T(k)] + k }\n\n But note: k must be at least 2, and T(k) = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n However, the state p goes up to 200000, and k can go up to about floor((sqrt(8*p+1)+1)/2) (since T(k) ~ k^2/2). But the maximum k for p=200000 is about sqrt(400000) which is around 632. So we can iterate k from 2 to 632 (or until T(k) <= p) for each p. \n\n But 200000 * 632 is about 126e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline. However, we can precompute the list of triangular numbers up to 200000 and then use a dictionary or array for dp.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a BFS-like approach for the dp.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let max_p = 200000\n   Let dp = [a big number] * (max_p+1)\n   dp[0] = 0\n\n   Then, we know that we can use a triangular number T(k) = k*(k-1)//2 for k from 2 up to the maximum k such that T(k) <= 200000.\n\n   Then, for each k from 2 to max_k (where max_k is the maximum integer such that T(max_k) <= 200000), we update the dp array.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n        for k in range(2, max_k+1):\n            t = T(k)\n            for p_val in range(t, max_p+1):\n                if dp[p_val - t] != inf:\n                    dp[p_val] = min(dp[p_val], dp[p_val-t] + k)\n\n   But this is O(max_k * max_p) which is 632 * 200000 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if we use a compiled language or optimize (but in Python, 126e6 iterations might take a few seconds, but the problem constraints say p up to 200000, and we are doing 126e6 iterations, which is acceptable in Pyton in competitive programming? Maybe, but we can try to use a different approach.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a better way: for each p, we can consider the largest triangular number <= p, and then use the remainder. But then we have to consider multiple ways.\n\n However, note that the triangular numbers are increasing and we can use multiple same triangular numbers. But we are allowed to use any triangular number arbitrarily.\n\n But the above DP is standard unbounded knapSack? Actually, no: we are allowed to use each triangular number type (each k) as many times as we want. So we are doing an unbounded knapSack. But wait, we are iterating k from 2 to max_k and then for each p from t to max_p, updating dp[p] = min(dp[p], dp[p-t]+k). This is the standard way for unbounded knapSack, but note: we are allowed to use the same k multiple times? Actually, yes: we can have multiple components of the same size.\n\n However, the above nested loops (for each k, then for each p from t to max_p) will work for unbounded knapSack.\n\n But wait: the problem is that we are allowed to use the same component size multiple times, so we are indeed doing unbounded.\n\n However, the above double loop is O(max_k * max_p) and max_k is about 632 and max_p is 200000, so 632 * 200000 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python we must be cautious. We can do:\n\n   max_k = int((math.sqrt(8*max_p+1)+1)//2) + 1   # actually, we can compute the maximum k: the largest k such that k*(k-1)//2 <= max_p\n\n   But note: we are going to use k from 2 to max_k.\n\n   However, we can also use a bounded knapSack and then use the fact that the triangular numbers are sparse? Actually, we can use a different method: for each p, we can use the largest triangular number <= p, subtract it, and then use the minimal representation for the remainder. But then we have to know the minimal representation for each remainder.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a BFS with Dijkstra because the cost is the node count and the weight is the triangular number. But the state space is p (from 0 to 200000) and the transitions are adding a triangular number (with cost = k). But the transitions are defined by k from 2 to max_k.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   dp = [10**9]*(max_p+1)\n   dp[0] = 0\n\n   for k in range(2, max_k+1):\n        t = k*(k-1)//2\n        if t > max_p:\n            continue\n        # Now, we can use this t value and update dp for all values from t to max_p.\n        # But we can update in increasing order of p? Actually, we are allowed to use the same k multiple times, so we need to do a complete knapSack.\n\n        # We do a forward update for all p from t to max_p:\n        for p_val in range(t, max_p+1):\n            if dp[p_val - t] != 10**9:\n                new_val = dp[p_val - t] + k\n                if new_val < dp[p_val]:\n                    dp[p_val] = new_val\n\n   Then, the answer for the first part is dp[p] (the minimal n for given p).\n\n But wait, the above is for unbounded knapSack, but we are iterating k from 2 to max_k and then for each k we update all p from t to max_p. This is the standard way for unbounded knapSack (each item can be used multiple times). However, we are iterating k (each item type) and then updating the entire array for that k. This is acceptable.\n\n However, note that the same p might be updated multiple times (by different k's). This is okay.\n\n But the complexity is O(max_k * max_p) which is about 632 * 200000 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be a bit slow. However, we can try to optimize by breaking the inner loop when t is too large? Actually, we are only considering k from 2 to max_k, and max_k is about 632.\n\n But 126e6 iterations is acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python we have to hope that the operations are simple. Each iteration is just an array lookup and a comparison and an assignment if needed.\n\n However, we can also use a different approach: use the fact that the triangular numbers are increasing and use a smarter way (like coin change problem with coins being the triangular numbers). But the above is standard.\n\n But note: the problem says p from 0 to 200000. We need to compute for all p from 0 to 200000 the minimal n.\n\n However, the problem input is one p (one test case). But the problem says \"The first and only line contains a single integer p\", so we are to read one p and output two numbers.\n\n But the problem also says: \"Also, among all such p-reachable graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let G denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. Find this number.\"\n\n So after finding the minimal n (the total nodes) for the given p, we need to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n How to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs?\n\n First, note: the graph has n nodes (minimal n) and the graph is built by having several strongly connected components (with sizes s1, s2, ..., sk) such that the sum of T(s_i) = p and the total nodes is n (minimized). And the graph must be arranged so that there are no mutual reachabilities between different components (so the graph is a DAG on the components). \n\n Now, what is an unidirectional pair (u, v)? \n   Condition: u != v, there is a path from u to v and no path from v to u.\n\n Note: The graph is built by having a DAG of components. Within a component, there are no unidirectional pairs (because every pair is either both ways or none, but actually, in a strongly connected component, for any two nodes (u, v) there is a path from u to v and from v to u, so they are not unidirectional). \n\n Unidirectional pairs can only occur between two different components.\n\n Consider two components A and B. Suppose there is an edge (or a path) from A to B. Then for every node u in A and every node v in B, we have a path from u to v (because the graph is a DAG and we can assume we have a complete DAG? Actually, we are free to design the graph arbitrarily as long as the mutual reachability condition is satisfied. \n\n To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we can design the edges between components arbitrarily (as long as the mutual reachability is only within the components). \n\n Conditions for unidirectional pairs between two components A and B:\n\n   - If there is a path from A to B and not vice versa, then every pair (u in A, v in B) is a unidirectional pair (unless there is a path from B to A, then they would be in the same component? Actually, no: the definition of component is that if there is a path from A to B and from B to A, then we would merge them. So in our graph, we must not have bidirectional paths between different components.\n\n Therefore, the graph must be such that the condensation (the DAG of SCCs) is acyclic and edges only go from one component to another in one direction.\n\n Now, the unidirectional pairs are:\n\n   For two distinct components A and B, if there is an edge (or a path) from A to B (but not from B to A) then every node in A to every node in B is a unidirectional pair.\n\n Also, note: the entire graph must be built with the minimal n (the minimal node set) that achieves p mutual pairs.\n\n How to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs?\n\n We can design the DAG between the components arbitrarily. The maximum unidirectional pairs is achieved if we make the DAG as complete as possible (i.e., for any two distinct components, we have edges in one direction only, and we choose the direction to maximize the pairs).\n\n Actually, we can arrange the components in a total order (like a linear extension) and then put edges from every component to every component that comes after it. Then, for two components A and B, if A comes before B, then every node in A goes to every node in B (so we get |A|*|B| unidirectional pairs). Similarly, if we had chosen the opposite, we would get |B|*|A|, but then the direction of the edge would be from B to A, and then we would have the same number of pairs (since |A|*|B| = |B|*|A|). \n\n However, note: if we have a DAG and we want to avoid cycles, we must fix a topological order. Then, if we have a linear order of the components (say comp1, comp2, ..., compk) then we can set edges from comp_i to comp_j for all i<j. Then, the number of unidirectional pairs from the inter-component edges is:\n\n   Sum_{i<j} [ |comp_i| * |comp_j| ]\n\n But note: we are also allowed to not put all edges? However, to maximize the unidirectional pairs, we should put as many edges as possible without creating mutual reachability. Since the mutual reachability is already defined by the components, we can put all edges from a component to a later component (in the topological order) and none from a later component to an earlier one.\n\n Then, the total unidirectional pairs is:\n\n   Total_unidirectional = Sum_{i<j} [ |comp_i| * |comp_j| ]\n\n But note: we are also allowed to have edges within a component? However, the mutual reachability condition is already satisfied by the component (we can have a complete graph within the component). And the problem does not restrict the edges within the component. But note: the problem counts unidirectional pairs (u, v) only if there is a path from u to v and not from v to u. In a strongly connected component, for any two nodes (u, v) in the same component, we have both paths, so they are not counted. Therefore, edges within a component don't create unidirectional pairs.\n\n Now, how to maximize the unidirectional pairs? We are given the multiset of component sizes (which are the s_i, and they are the same as the k_i we used in the knapSack). The expression:\n\n   Sum_{i<j} [ |comp_i| * |comp_j| ] = ( (sum_i |comp_i|)^2 - sum_i |comp_i|^2 ) // 2\n\n But note: the total number of nodes n = sum_i |comp_i|. And we know the multiset of component sizes (the k_i) that minimizes n for the given p.\n\n However, the minimal n for p is unique? Actually, no: there might be multiple ways to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers and get the same total n. But note: we are minimizing n, so we are looking for the minimal n such that there exists a representation. Then, for that minimal n, we might have multiple representations (different multisets of component sizes) that yield the same n and same p.\n\n But note: the problem says \"among all such p-reachable graphs with the minimum number of nodes\", so we are allowed to choose any graph with n nodes (the minimal n) that has exactly p mutual pairs. Therefore, we can choose the multiset of component sizes that maximizes the inter-component edges (i.e., maximizes the expression above).\n\n However, note: the set of component sizes must satisfy that the sum of T(s_i) = p and the total nodes n = sum(s_i) is minimal.\n\n But we have already found the minimal n (the minimal total nodes) for p. Now, we must choose the multiset of component sizes (s_i) that minimizes n (which we did) and then, among all such representations (all multisets that have the same n and sum_i T(s_i)=p), we must choose the one that maximizes the inter-component edges (which is the sum_{i<j} |s_i|*|s_j|).\n\n How to compute that?\n\n We have two steps:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the minimal n (total nodes) for p.\n\n   Step 2: Among all representations of p as a sum of triangular numbers (each T(s_i) and s_i>=2) and with total nodes n (minimal), choose the multiset of s_i that maximizes:\n\n        F = (n^2 - sum_i (s_i^2)) // 2\n\n Why? Because:\n\n        (sum_i s_i)^2 = sum_i s_i^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j.\n\n        So, sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j = (n^2 - sum_i s_i^2) / 2.\n\n So we need to maximize (n^2 - sum_i s_i^2) / 2.\n\n Since n is fixed (minimal total nodes), we need to minimize the sum_i (s_i^2) (because n is fixed, so maximizing F is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squares of the s_i).\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: for the minimal n, find a representation of p as a sum of T(s_i) (with s_i>=2) and total nodes n (so the s_i's must sum to n) such that the sum of squares of s_i is minimized.\n\n But note: we already know that the representation must use the minimal n (so we are only considering representations that use n nodes and yield p). However, there might be multiple representations (different multisets) that use the same n and same p.\n\n How to compute the minimal sum of squares for a fixed n and fixed p (with the constraint that the multiset of s_i must satisfy: sum_i T(s_i)=p and sum_i s_i = n)?\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we are given that the graph has n nodes, and we break these n nodes into components (each component of size s_i) such that the total mutual pairs (within components) is p. Then, the condition is:\n\n        p = sum_i [ s_i*(s_i-1)//2 ]\n\n        and the total nodes n = sum_i s_i.\n\n We want to minimize the sum_i (s_i^2) (to maximize the inter-component pairs).\n\n How to do that?\n\n Note: the representation of p as the sum of triangular numbers is fixed (by the minimal n). But we are now allowed to choose any multiset of s_i (each s_i>=2) such that:\n\n        (1) sum_i s_i = n\n        (2) sum_i T(s_i) = p\n\n And we want to minimize the sum_i (s_i^2).\n\n However, note: the minimal n was computed by the knapSack above. But we did not record the actual representation, only the minimal n.\n\n Alternative approach: we can use the fact that the minimal n is known, and then we can use dynamic programming to record the minimal sum of squares for a given (p, n) but that is too heavy.\n\n Another idea: we know that the triangular numbers are fixed. And the minimal n is achieved by using the largest triangular numbers (because the triangular numbers grow quadratically). \n\n Actually, the minimal n is achieved by using as many large components as possible. But note: the same n can be achieved by different decompositions. \n\n However, we are to minimize the sum of squares. The sum of squares is minimized when the numbers (s_i) are as equal as possible (by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). But wait: we have two constraints: the sum of the s_i is n, and the sum of T(s_i) is p.\n\n How to relate? \n\n We can consider: we have n nodes, and we break them into k components. The condition is that the total mutual pairs (within components) is p.\n\n We know: p = sum_i T(s_i) = (sum_i s_i^2 - n) / 2   [because T(s_i) = s_i*(s_i-1)//2 = (s_i^2 - s_i)//2, so sum_i T(s_i) = (sum_i s_i^2 - n) / 2]\n\n Therefore, p = ( (sum_i s_i^2) - n ) / 2   =>   sum_i s_i^2 = 2*p + n.\n\n Wait, that's interesting. So the sum of squares is fixed once p and n are fixed? \n\n Proof:\n\n        p = sum_i T(s_i) = sum_i [ (s_i^2 - s_i) // 2 ] = (sum_i s_i^2 - n) // 2.\n\n Therefore, for a fixed p and n, the sum_i s_i^2 is fixed: it is 2*p + n.\n\n Then, the inter-component pairs F = (n^2 - sum_i s_i^2) // 2 = (n^2 - (2*p+n))//2.\n\n But wait, that expression is independent of the decomposition? Then, as long as we have a representation (with n nodes and p mutual pairs), the value of F is fixed.\n\n Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is fixed for the minimal n and given p.\n\n Then, we don't need to choose the multiset that minimizes the sum of squares because the sum of squares is fixed by the equation: 2*p + n.\n\n So:\n\n        F = (n^2 - (2*p + n)) // 2\n\n But wait: is that correct?\n\n        From p = (sum_i s_i^2 - n) // 2, we have sum_i s_i^2 = 2*p + n.\n\n        Then, the total inter-component pairs is:\n\n            F = (n^2 - sum_i s_i^2) // 2 = (n^2 - (2*p+n)) // 2.\n\n However, note: the expression for F is:\n\n            F = sum_{i<j} |s_i|*|s_j|\n\n            and we know: (sum_i s_i)^2 = sum_i s_i^2 + 2 * F.\n\n            => F = (n^2 - sum_i s_i^2) // 2.\n\n        And from the condition: p = (sum_i s_i^2 - n) // 2.\n\n        So, we can express F in terms of p and n.\n\n Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is:\n\n        F = (n^2 - (2*p + n)) // 2\n\n But wait: we must check the divisibility. Since n^2 and (2*p+n) are integers, and we are doing integer division by 2, we need to ensure that (n^2 - (2*p+n)) is even.\n\n However, note:\n\n        n^2 - (2*p+n) = n^2 - n - 2*p.\n\n        And from p = (sum_i s_i^2 - n) // 2, we have 2*p = sum_i s_i^2 - n.\n\n        Then, n^2 - (2*p+n) = n^2 - (sum_i s_i^2 - n + n) = n^2 - sum_i s_i^2.\n\n        But we know that (sum_i s_i)^2 = n^2 = sum_i s_i^2 + 2 * F, so n^2 - sum_i s_i^2 is even? Not necessarily: n^2 - sum_i s_i^2 = 2*F, so it is even.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            F = (n*n - 2*p - n) // 2\n\n Example: p=3, n=3.\n\n        Then, F = (9 - 6 - 3) // 2 = (0) // 2 = 0.\n\n        Which matches the example.\n\n Example: p=4, n=5.\n\n        Then, we need to represent 4 as the sum of triangular numbers with total nodes 5.\n\n        How? \n          T(3)=3, then we need 4-3=1, which is T(2)=1. Then the components are of size 3 and 2, total nodes 5.\n\n        Then, F = (5*5 - 2*4 - 5) // 2 = (25 - 8 -5) // 2 = 12//2 = 6.\n\n        The example input says: \n            Input: 4 -> Output: '5 6'\n\n        So that matches.\n\n Example: p=0, n=0? \n        Then, F = (0-0-0)//2 = 0.\n\n        But note: the graph with 0 nodes: there are no pairs, so p=0 is achieved, and the unidirectional pairs are 0.\n\n        However, the example input: \n            Input: 0 -> Output: '0 0'\n\n        But wait: the minimal n for p=0 is 0? Or we can have n=0.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"an ordered pair (u, v) in a directed graph\" and u != v. With 0 nodes, there are no pairs, so p=0.\n\n        But the example output for p=0 is \"0 0\".\n\n        However, note the example input: \n            ['3', '4', '0'] -> outputs ['3 0', '5 6', '0 0']\n\n        So for p=0, the minimal n is 0.\n\n        But wait: what if we use n=0? Then the graph has 0 nodes, and the condition holds. But what if we use n=1? Then the graph has one node, and there are no pairs (so p=0) and the node count is 1, which is greater than 0. So minimal n is 0.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"minimum number of nodes required\", so for p=0, 0 nodes.\n\n        But the example output: \n            Input: 0 -> Output: 0 0.\n\n        Now, our formula for F: (n^2 - 2*p - n) // 2 = (0-0-0)//2=0.\n\n        So that works.\n\n But wait: what if p=1? Then minimal n is 2 (because T(2)=1). Then F = (2^2 - 2*1 - 2)//2 = (4-2-2)//2 = 0//2=0.\n\n        Now, what is the graph for p=1? It has one component of size 2 (two nodes) and no other components. Then, the inter-component edges are 0 (only one component). So 0 is correct.\n\n        What if p=2? \n          We cannot use one component: T(2)=1, T(3)=3 -> too big.\n          Then we need two components: T(2)+T(2)=1+1=2. Then n=2+2=4.\n\n          Then F = (4^2 - 2*2 -4)//2 = (16-4-4)//2 = 8//2=4.\n\n          But wait, let me verify:\n\n            Components: two components of size 2. Then the inter-component edges: \n                There are two components, say A and B (each of size 2).\n                We can arrange the DAG: we have two possibilities (linear order). Then, the unidirectional pairs from A to B: 2*2=4, and from B to A: 0 (if we fix the order A->B). So total unidirectional pairs=4.\n\n          So that matches.\n\n        However, wait: is there a representation with fewer nodes for p=2? \n          We cannot use a single component because T(3)=3>2, and T(2)=1 so we need two of them (n=4). \n\n        But wait, can we use a component of size 3? That gives 3, which is more than 2. Then we would have to use negative? No. So minimal n=4.\n\n        Then, our knapSack must have returned dp[2]=4.\n\n        Let me check the knapSack for p=2:\n\n          We have triangular numbers: [0,1,3,6,...]\n\n          We can use two 1's (from k=2). Then dp[",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is exactly p-reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable (i.e., there is a path from u to v and vice versa).\n   - The solution involves finding the minimal number of nodes (n) such that the sum of triangular numbers (each representing the number of mutual pairs in a strongly connected component) equals p.\n   - The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived from the structure of the graph, specifically from the inter-component edges in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) formed by the strongly connected components.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triangular Numbers**: Each strongly connected component of size k contributes \\( T(k) = k*(k-1)/2 \\) mutual pairs. The problem reduces to representing p as the sum of such triangular numbers while minimizing the total number of nodes.\n   - **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to compute the minimal number of nodes for each possible p up to 200,000. The DP state tracks the minimal nodes needed for each p value by considering all possible triangular numbers.\n   - **Unidirectional Pairs Calculation**: Once the minimal nodes (n) are found, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated using the formula \\((n^2 - 2p - n) // 2\\), which leverages the fixed relationship between the sum of squares of component sizes and the given p.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Unbounded Knapsack Problem**: The problem of representing p as a sum of triangular numbers is analogous to an unbounded knapsack problem where each \"item\" is a triangular number and the goal is to minimize the total \"weight\" (number of nodes).\n   - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently precomputes the minimal nodes for all p values up to 200,000 using dynamic programming, ensuring quick lookup during query processing.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Precomputation**: The DP approach runs in \\( O(\\text{max\\_p} \\times \\text{max\\_k}) \\), where max_p is 200,000 and max_k is approximately 632 (the largest integer k such that \\( T(k) \\leq 200,000 \\)). This results in about 126 million operations, which is feasible given modern computing constraints.\n   - **Query Processing**: Each query is answered in constant time using the precomputed results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    p = int(data[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    max_p = 200000\n    max_k = int((math.isqrt(8 * max_p + 1) - 1) / 2) + 1\n    \n    dp = [10**9] * (max_p + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    \n    for k_val in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        t_val = k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2\n        if t_val > max_p:\n            continue\n        for i in range(t_val, max_p + 1):\n            if dp[i - t_val] != 10**9:\n                new_val = dp[i - t_val] + k_val\n                if new_val < dp[i]:\n                    dp[i] = new_val\n                    \n    n_nodes = dp[p]\n    F = (n_nodes * n_nodes - 2 * p - n_nodes) // 2\n    print(f\"{n_nodes} {F}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer p, which is read from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the output is \"0 0\" since no nodes are needed and there are no unidirectional pairs.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The DP array is initialized to store the minimal nodes required for each p value up to 200,000. The size of the array is determined by the largest triangular number within the constraint.\n4. **DP Array Population**: For each possible component size k (from 2 to max_k), the corresponding triangular number is computed. The DP array is updated to reflect the minimal nodes needed by considering the addition of each triangular number.\n5. **Result Calculation**: After computing the minimal nodes (n_nodes) for the given p, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (F) is derived using the formula \\((n_nodes^2 - 2p - n_nodes) // 2\\).\n6. **Output**: The results, consisting of the minimal nodes and the maximum unidirectional pairs, are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently addresses the problem by leveraging dynamic programming to precompute solutions for all possible p values, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
