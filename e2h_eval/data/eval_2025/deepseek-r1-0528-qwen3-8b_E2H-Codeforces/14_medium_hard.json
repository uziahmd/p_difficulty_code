    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n However, note that the problem asks for the number of n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing. However, it does not increase at every step. For example, when n=5, Z(5)=1; then n=6,7,8,9: still Z(n)=1 until n=10, then Z(10)=2.\n\n So, for a given m, we are to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". So we are looking for n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But observe: \n   For m=1, n can be from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n How do we solve it?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. First, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m? Actually, we want n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n 2. We can use binary search to find the range of n for which Z(n)=m.\n\n Let f(n) = Z(n)\n\n Then, we know that:\n   - There is a minimal n0 such that Z(n0) >= m, and actually we want the first n where Z(n) >= m, but then we have to check how many consecutive n's have Z(n)=m.\n\n However, note that the value of Z(n) increases only when n is a multiple of 5 (or more generally, when n is a multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc.). Between two multiples of 5, the value remains constant.\n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Let L be the smallest integer such that Z(L) >= m.\n   Then, let R be the smallest integer such that Z(R) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, for all n in [L, R-1], we have Z(n)=m.\n\n Why? Because at n=L, we get at least m zeros. And until we hit the next point where adding one more factor of 5 (and possibly more) pushes the total zeros to m+1, the zeros remain m.\n\n But note: It's possible that at n=L, we have exactly m zeros, and then at some n between L and R-1, the zeros might jump to m+1? Actually, no: the zeros only jump when n is a multiple of 5 (and the jump is by the number of factors of 5 in n). However, we defined R as the smallest integer such that Z(R) >= m+1. So the condition holds: for n in [L, R-1], Z(n) is exactly m.\n\n But wait: what if there is a gap? Actually, Z(n) is non-decreasing and it increases by steps (the step size being the number of factors of 5 in n). However, the definition of R is the smallest integer with at least m+1 zeros. Then the set of n with exactly m zeros is [L, R-1].\n\n However, note that the problem requires the positive integers n. Also, note that there might be cases where m=0? The input constraint says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n But wait: the example input includes m=1, and output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n Now, how to compute L and R?\n\n We can use binary search for L and R.\n\n However, note that the constraints: m up to 100000.\n\n The value of n we are searching for: since the number of trailing zeros in n! is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/4 (geometric series), so for m=100000, n would be about 4*m? Actually, the exact bound: the maximum power of 5 in n! is less than n. We can set an upper bound for n.\n\n We can set an upper bound: \n   Let n_max = 5 * m   (but this is too low because sometimes we need more, e.g., for m=1, 5*1=5, which is okay, but for m=2, 5*2=10, and indeed Z(10)=2. But for m=3, Z(15)=3, but 5*3=15, which is okay. However, consider m=4: \n        Z(20)= floor(20/5)+floor(20/25)=4+0=4. So n_max might be set to 5*m, but wait, sometimes we need to go beyond? \n\n Alternatively, we can set an upper bound: the zeros in n! is at least n/5 (if we ignore higher powers). So to have at least m zeros, n must be at least 5*m (because n/5 >= m -> n>=5*m). However, sometimes we need more: for example, for m=100000, we can use:\n\n   We know that Z(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/4 (since the geometric series with ratio 1/5 converges to n/4). So n must be at least 4*m. But actually, we can set an upper bound: let n_upper = 5*m * 5? \n\n Actually, we can use binary search on n from 0 to, say, 5*m (but wait, for m=1, 5*m=5, but what about m=2? then 5*2=10, which is correct. However, consider m=0: but m>=1.\n\n But wait: sometimes we might need n larger than 5*m? Consider m=5: \n        n=20: Z(20)=4, n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so for m=5, we don't have any n such that Z(n)=5? \n\n In fact, the trailing zeros jump from 4 (at n=24) to 6 (at n=25). So there is no n with exactly 5 zeros. Therefore, the answer for m=5 should be 0.\n\n So our method:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. (call this L)\n   Step 2: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. (call this R)\n\n   Then, the numbers n are from L to R-1, inclusive.\n\n   But if Z(L) != m? Actually, we defined L as the smallest n with Z(n) >= m, so Z(L) >= m. Similarly, R is the smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1, so Z(R) >= m+1.\n\n   Now, what if there is no n such that Z(n) >= m? Then L would be undefined. But since m>=1, and we know that for n=5*m, Z(5*m) >= m (because Z(5*m) >= 5*m/5 = m). So L is well-defined.\n\n   However, what if m is very large? Our binary search must be efficient.\n\n   How to compute Z(n) quickly?\n\n        def zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n\n   This is O(log_5 n).\n\n   Now, we do two binary searches:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m   (we know that n<=5*m gives at most m zeros? Actually, n=5*m gives at least m zeros. But we also know that zeros(n) is increasing, so we can set the high bound to, say, 5*m (but wait, for m=5, 5*m=25, and zeros(25)=6 which is >=5, so we need to include 25. But we are looking for the smallest n with Z(n)>=m, so we can set the high bound to 5*m? Actually, we might need a bit more because sometimes the zeros jump more than one? \n\n        However, we know that the minimal n for which Z(n)>=m is at most 5*m (because zeros(5*m) = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... >= m). But wait, zeros(5*m) is at least m (exactly: zeros(5*m) = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is greater than m). So we can set high = 5*m, but wait, what if m=1? then high=5, which is correct.\n\n        But consider m=5: we want the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=5. We know zeros(20)=4, zeros(21)=4, ... zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6. So the smallest n is 25. But 5*m=25, so high=25 is enough.\n\n        However, what if m=100000? Then 5*m=500000. We can set high=5*m? But wait, zeros(5*m) is much larger than m. Actually, we can set high to a value that is known to give at least m zeros.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set an upper bound: \n\n            We know that zeros(n) >= n/5 (ignoring higher powers) so if n/5 >= m, then zeros(n)>=m. But we want the minimal n such that zeros(n)>=m, and we know that n_min <= 5*m (since zeros(5*m) >= m). \n\n        However, we must account for the fact that zeros(n) might jump more than one at some points. But note: we are only concerned with the minimal n that reaches at least m.\n\n        We can set:\n\n            low_bound = 0\n            high_bound = 5*m   (this is safe because zeros(5*m) >= m)\n\n        But wait, what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't worry.\n\n        However, for m=100000, 5*m=500000. Then zeros(500000) is:\n\n            zeros(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + ... \n\n        This is a geometric series: 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + ... which is about 124992, which is greater than 100000. So yes, 500000 is an upper bound.\n\n        But what if m=100000, then we are searching in the range [0,500000] for the smallest n with zeros(n)>=100000. That is acceptable because 500000 is about 5e5, and we are doing two binary searches (each O(log(500000)) which is about 20 steps, and each step we do a zeros(n) computation which is O(log_5 n) (about 7 steps for 500000). So total operations is about 2 * 20 * 7 = 280, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the zeros(n) function is called for each candidate in the binary search. But the binary search for the smallest n with zeros(n)>=m will be about 20 iterations (log2(500000) is about 19). Similarly for m+1.\n\n        But wait: what if m=100000 and we are searching for zeros(n)>=100001? Then the smallest n might be around 500000 or a little above? Actually, the zeros function increases as n increases. The zeros(500000)=124992, which is greater than 100001. So we can set the high_bound for the second search to the same 5*m? Or we can set the high_bound for both searches to 5*m.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the high_bound for the second search to the result of the first search? Because the first search found the minimal n for m, then the minimal n for m+1 must be at least that. But we don't know. However, we can set the high_bound for both to 5*m, which is safe.\n\n        But note: the zeros(n) for n=5*m is already about 124992 for m=100000, so we are including values above 100000. However, the minimal n for m+1 (100001) might be the same as the minimal n for m (100000) if zeros(n) jumps from 100000 to 124992? Actually, no: zeros(n) is computed by the formula, and the jumps occur only at multiples of 5. The zeros(n) at n=500000 is 124992, so for m=100000, we are looking for the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=100000. Then the next one (m+1) is the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=100001.\n\n        Since zeros(500000)=124992, we can set the high_bound for the second search to 500000 as well.\n\n        However, we can also set the high_bound dynamically. But for simplicity, we set:\n\n            high = 5 * m   for the first search (for m)\n            and for the second search (for m+1), we set high = 5 * (m+1) ?\n\n        But wait, zeros(n) for n=5*(m+1) is zeros(5*m+5). This is definitely >= m+1? Not necessarily: because zeros(5*m+5) is zeros(5*m) + (number of factors of 5 in 5*m+5) ??? Actually, no: zeros(n) is cumulative. But we know that zeros(5*m) is already >= m (and often > m). But we want the minimal n for m+1, which might be larger than 5*m. \n\n        Actually, the minimal n for m+1 must be at least the minimal n for m, and we know that zeros(5*m) is already >= m, so we can use the same upper bound 5*m for the first search. For the second search, we can set the upper bound to 5*(m+1) because zeros(5*(m+1)) is certainly >= m+1? \n\n        Let me check: zeros(5*(m+1)) = zeros(5*m+5) = zeros(5*m) + zeros(5*m+5) ??? Actually, no, the zeros function is defined for n. The zeros(5*(m+1)) is the sum_{k} floor((5*m+5)/5^k). \n\n        But note: 5*(m+1) is a multiple of 5, so zeros(5*(m+1)) = (5*(m+1))/5 + (5*(m+1))/25 + ... \n\n        This is at least (5*(m+1))/5 = m+1. So yes, zeros(5*(m+1)) >= m+1. Therefore, we can set:\n\n            For the first binary search (for m): low1=0, high1=5*m\n            For the second binary search (for m+1): low2=0, high2=5*(m+1)\n\n        However, we can also set the high2 to 5*m (because the minimal n for m+1 might be less than 5*(m+1)? Actually, no: the minimal n for m+1 must be at least the minimal n for m. But zeros(5*m) is already >= m, and we are looking for zeros(n) >= m+1. We know zeros(5*m) might be greater than m, but we don't know if it is >= m+1. \n\n        Example: m=1, then zeros(5)=1, so for m+1=2, the minimal n is 10. 5*(m+1)=10, so that's the same. \n\n        Another example: m=2, zeros(10)=2, then for m+1=3, the minimal n is 15, and 5*(m+1)=15.\n\n        Another: m=4, zeros(20)=4, then for m+1=5, the minimal n is 25, and 5*(m+1)=25.\n\n        But wait, what if m=0? Not applicable. \n\n        However, what if m=3? zeros(15)=3, so for m+1=4, minimal n is 20, and 5*(m+1)=20.\n\n        Actually, it seems that the minimal n for m is 5*k (a multiple of 5) and the minimal n for m+1 is 5*(k+1) if the zeros at 5*k is exactly k + k/5 + ...? \n\n        But wait, the zeros(n) is defined for all n, and the minimal n for m is the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=m. It turns out that the minimal n is always a multiple of 5? \n\n        Actually, no: consider m=1: the minimal n is 5, which is a multiple of 5. But then n=5,6,7,8,9 all have zeros=1. Then the minimal n for m=1 is 5.\n\n        However, the minimal n for m+1=2 is 10, which is a multiple of 5.\n\n        Why? Because zeros(n) only increases when n is a multiple of 5. So the minimal n for which zeros(n) becomes at least m must be a multiple of 5.\n\n        Proof sketch: zeros(n) is constant for n in [5*k+1, 5*k+4] and then at 5*k+5 (i.e., 5*(k+1)) it increases by the number of factors of 5 in 5*(k+1). \n\n        Therefore, the minimal n for m is a multiple of 5, and the minimal n for m+1 is the next multiple of 5 (or maybe not, because sometimes the jump is more than one). \n\n        But note: the zeros(n) function increases by the multiplicity of 5 in n. So if n=25, then zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6. So the minimal n for m=5 does not exist (because we jump from 4 to 6). \n\n        Therefore, we cannot assume that the minimal n for m is a multiple of 5 and the next one is the next multiple. However, we can still use the binary search from 0 to 5*m (for the first one) and 0 to 5*(m+1) for the second one.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Define function zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n            Then, define a helper function to find the minimal n such that zeros(n) >= target:\n\n                def find_minimal_n(target):\n                    low = 0\n                    high = 5 * target   # for the first call, target is m, then for the second call, target is m+1, but we set high to 5 * target? Actually, we set high to 5 * target for the first call? But wait, we know zeros(5*target) >= target (because zeros(5*target) = target + target/5 + ... >= target). So we can set high = 5 * target.\n\n            However, for the second call, we set high = 5*(m+1). But wait, the minimal n for m+1 is at most 5*(m+1). \n\n            Then:\n\n                L = find_minimal_n(m)   # smallest n with zeros(n) >= m\n                R = find_minimal_n(m+1)  # smallest n with zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n            Then, the numbers n that satisfy zeros(n)==m are from L to R-1.\n\n            But note: if there is no n with zeros(n)==m, then R would be the first n with zeros(n)>=m+1, but L is the first n with zeros(n)>=m. Then the interval [L, R-1] would have zeros(n)=m only if zeros(L)==m and zeros(R-1)==m. \n\n            However, what if zeros(L) > m? Then the condition fails. But wait, we defined L as the smallest n with zeros(n)>=m. Then zeros(L) is the first time we hit at least m. But it could be that zeros(L) = m, or zeros(L) > m. \n\n            Example: m=5, then zeros(20)=4, zeros(21)=4, zeros(22)=4, zeros(23)=4, zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6. So L = 25, and zeros(L)=6. Then R = find_minimal_n(6) -> smallest n with zeros(n)>=6: which is 25. Then the interval [25, 25-1] is empty.\n\n            So in this case, the set of n is empty.\n\n            But wait, what if m=6? Then L = 25, R = find_minimal_n(7): \n                zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7. So R=30. Then the set is [25,29] (5 numbers) for m=6.\n\n            But the problem: for m=5, we output 0.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                Read m.\n\n                If m==0: then we output the numbers from 5 to 4 (but wait, m>=1, so skip)\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  L = find_minimal_n(m)\n                  R = find_minimal_n(m+1)\n\n                  Then, we must check: if zeros(L) < m, then we did something wrong? Actually, no: our find_minimal_n returns the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=m. So zeros(L)>=m.\n\n                  Now, if zeros(L) == m, then L is the start. Otherwise, if zeros(L) > m, then there is no n with zeros(n)=m.\n\n                  But wait, note: the zeros function is non-decreasing, and it only increases at multiples of 5. So if zeros(L) > m, then the zeros value at L is already greater than m, and since zeros(n) is non-decreasing, there is no n with zeros(n)=m.\n\n                  Therefore, we can check:\n\n                    if zeros(L) != m:\n                        Then the answer is 0, and we output:\n                            print(0)\n\n                    else:\n                        Then the numbers are from L to R-1.\n\n                  However, note: what if zeros(L)==m, then we have at least one n (L) with zeros(n)=m. Then all n from L to R-1 have zeros(n)=m.\n\n                  But wait, what if zeros(L)==m, but then at some n < R, the zeros(n) might drop? No, zeros(n) is non-decreasing.\n\n                  However, we must ensure that zeros(L)=m and zeros(R-1)=m.\n\n                  Actually, R is defined as the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=m+1. Then for all n < R, zeros(n) < m+1. But we know zeros(L)=m, so zeros(n) for n in [L, R-1] is at least m and less than m+1, so it must be exactly m.\n\n                  Therefore, the set is [L, R-1].\n\n            But wait, what if zeros(L) > m? Then the set is empty. So we output 0.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                L = find_minimal_n(m)\n                R = find_minimal_n(m+1)\n\n                if zeros(L) != m:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    count = R - L\n                    print(count)\n                    if count > 0:\n                        # Print the numbers from L to R-1\n                        # But note: the problem says to print the k integers in increasing order.\n                        # However, k can be 0, then nothing to print.\n\n            But wait, what if there is a gap? For example, if we have zeros(L)=m, then we know that zeros(n)=m for n from L to R-1. So the count is R-L.\n\n            However, consider m=1:\n\n                L = 5 (zeros(5)=1)\n                R = find_minimal_n(2): \n                    zeros(10)=2, so R=10.\n                Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Example m=5:\n\n                L = find_minimal_n(5): \n                    We are looking for the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=5.\n                    n=20: zeros(20)=4 -> not enough.\n                    n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so L=25.\n                Then zeros(25)=6, which is not equal to 5, so we output 0.\n\n            Example m=6:\n\n                L = find_minimal_n(6): \n                    We know zeros(25)=6, so L=25.\n                R = find_minimal_n(7): \n                    zeros(30)=7, so R=30.\n                Then the numbers are from 25 to 29: 5 numbers.\n\n            But wait, zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7.\n\n            So the answer for m=6 is 5 numbers.\n\n            However, the problem: we are asked for exactly m zeros. So for m=6, we want n such that zeros(n)=6. Then 25 to 29.\n\n            But note: the example input was ['1','5'].\n\n            Now, what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to handle.\n\n            Edge: m=100000, then we are going to do two binary searches, each about 20 iterations, and each iteration calls zeros(n) which is about 7 steps (log base 5 of 500000). So it's acceptable.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the zeros(n) function must be efficient for n up to 500000.\n\n            Implementation of zeros(n):\n\n                def zeros(n):\n                    count = 0\n                    d = 5\n                    while d <= n:\n                        count += n // d\n                        d *= 5\n                    return count\n\n            Now, write the binary search function:\n\n                def find_minimal_n(target):\n                    # We are searching for the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= target.\n                    low = 0\n                    high = 5 * target   # for the first call, target is m, then for the second call, target is m+1.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is primarily determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( Z(n) = \\lfloor n/5 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/25 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/125 \\rfloor + \\ldots \\). This sum counts the total number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimal \\( n \\)**:\n   - **First Binary Search**: Find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\). This \\( L \\) is the smallest number where the factorial has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n   - **Second Binary Search**: Find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( Z(R) \\geq m + 1 \\). This \\( R \\) is the smallest number where the factorial has at least \\( m + 1 \\) trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **Check Valid Range**: If \\( Z(L) \\neq m \\), it means there is no \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), so the answer is 0. Otherwise, all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    d = 5\n    while d <= n:\n        count += n // d\n        d *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_minimal_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m_val = int(data[0].strip())\n    \n    L = find_minimal_n(m_val)\n    R = find_minimal_n(m_val + 1)\n    \n    if zeros(L) != m_val:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = R - L\n        print(count)\n        if count > 0:\n            numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n            print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **zeros(n) Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_minimal_n(target) Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is from 0 to \\( 5 \\times \\text{target} \\), ensuring the upper bound is sufficient.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - **Input Handling**: Reads the input value \\( m \\).\n   - **Binary Searches**: Computes \\( L \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\)) and \\( R \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( Z(n) \\geq m + 1 \\)).\n   - **Validation Check**: If \\( Z(L) \\neq m \\), prints 0 (no solution). Otherwise, prints the count of valid numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\) and lists them if the count is positive.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the properties of factorial trailing zeroes, and ensures optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
