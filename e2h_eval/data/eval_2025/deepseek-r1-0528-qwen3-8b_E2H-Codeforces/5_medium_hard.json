Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters) and we need to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair uses one left and one right boot) such that:\n - The colors must be compatible: \n        'x' and 'x' -> compatible\n        '?' and any character -> compatible\n        any character and '?' -> compatible\n        '?' and '?' -> compatible\n\n We cannot use a boot more than once.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the problem is about matching two sets (left and right) with constraints on the colors.\n\n 2. The key observation: \n    - We have two types of boots: those with fixed colors and those with '?'.\n    - We can think of the problem as having two bipartite graphs (one for the fixed colors and one for the '?').\n\n 3. However, note that the total number of boots is up to 150000. So we cannot try all possibilities.\n\n 4. Approach:\n\n    a. We can first consider matching the fixed color boots. But note: a '?' in one string can match with a fixed color or another '?'.\n\n    b. We can break down the problem:\n\n        Let:\n            L_fixed: list of fixed left boots (non '?')\n            L_question: list of indices for left boots that are '?'\n\n            Similarly, R_fixed and R_question.\n\n        But note: a '?' in the left can also match with a '?' in the right, or a fixed color in the right.\n\n    c. However, the problem is that the '?' in one side can match with multiple possibilities. But note: each boot can only be used once.\n\n    d. We can use a greedy strategy:\n\n        Step 1: First, match as many fixed boots as possible.\n\n        But wait, sometimes a '?' might help to form a pair that we couldn't form otherwise. However, note that the problem asks for the maximum number of pairs.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        We know that the total pairs we can form is at most n. The idea is to use a two-step matching:\n\n        - First, match the fixed boots: but we must match a fixed boot only with a matching fixed boot or an indefinite (but then we might use a '?' that could be needed elsewhere). However, note: the rule says that an indefinite matches everything.\n\n        Actually, we can also use '?' to fill in for missing colors. But the goal is to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We can consider that every '?' in the left can match any '?' in the right? Not exactly: we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        How about:\n\n        Let's count the total pairs we can form:\n\n        We can form a pair if:\n          - The left is fixed and the right is fixed and they are the same.\n          - The left is fixed and the right is '?' -> valid.\n          - The left is fixed and the right is a specific letter, then only if that letter equals the fixed left.\n          - Similarly, the left is '?' and the right is fixed -> valid.\n          - The left is '?' and the right is '?' -> valid.\n\n        But note: the catch is that we have to assign without repetition.\n\n        This is a bipartite graph matching problem, but the graph is very large (n up to 150000). However, we can use the following:\n\n        We can use two pointers and greedy matching for the fixed boots, but then what about the '?'?\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a two-step:\n\n        Step 1: Count the total pairs we can form by matching fixed boots and then use the '?' to cover the rest.\n\n        However, note: the problem requires to output the actual pairs.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        Let's define:\n\n            We are going to consider two types of boots: fixed and variable (with '?'). We want to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n        Insight:\n\n            The maximum number of pairs is at most n. We can form a pair if:\n\n                Condition 1: The left boot is a fixed color, and the right boot is either the same fixed color or '?'.\n                Condition 2: The left boot is '?', and the right boot is either a fixed color or '?'.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use each boot only once.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n            We can try to match the fixed boots first, but sometimes matching a fixed boot with a '?' might leave a fixed boot unmatched when we could have matched two fixed boots? Actually, no: because a fixed boot must be matched with a boot of the same color or a '?'. But if there is a fixed boot on the right of the same color, then we should use that.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Let X = set of fixed colors in l, and Y = set of fixed colors in r.\n\n            But note: we can also use the '?' as wildcards. The problem is that we don't know which '?' to use for which.\n\n        We can use a greedy matching:\n\n            Step 1: For each fixed color, we try to match as many as possible.\n\n            However, we can also consider:\n\n                We can form a pair between two boots (left i, right j) if:\n\n                    (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n            But note: the condition \"or\" is inclusive. Actually, we can simplify:\n\n                if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?'):\n                    then compatible.\n\n            However, we can rewrite the condition:\n\n                Compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?') or (r[j]=='?')\n\n            Why? Because:\n                If both are '?' -> true (by the last part)\n                If one is fixed and the other is '?' -> true (by the third or second part)\n                If both are fixed and equal -> true (by the first part)\n\n            But wait: what if l[i] is fixed and r[j] is fixed but different? Then it fails. And if l[i] is fixed and r[j] is '?' -> true. Similarly, if l[i] is '?' and r[j] is fixed -> true.\n\n            So the condition is: \n                compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?') OR (r[j]=='?')\n\n            However, note: if both are fixed and not equal, then we require at least one '?' to be compatible. But if one is fixed and the other is fixed and not equal, then it's not compatible. So the above condition is correct.\n\n        Now, how to match?\n\n        We have to form a bipartite graph with edges from left to right for compatible pairs, and then find the maximum matching.\n\n        But n can be 150000, so we cannot use a general bipartite matching algorithm (like Hopcroft–Karp or DFS based) because the graph might have O(n^2) edges (if there are many '?' then almost every left can connect to almost every right).\n\n        We need a more efficient way.\n\n        Observation:\n\n            The condition for compatibility is very simple. Also, note that we have two types of nodes: fixed and variable.\n\n        Let's split the left boots and right boots:\n\n            Left boots: \n                Type A: fixed (non '?')\n                Type B: variable ('?')\n\n            Right boots:\n                Type A: fixed (non '?')\n                Type B: variable ('?')\n\n        Then the edges:\n\n            From a fixed left (say color 'x') to the right:\n                - It connects to all right boots that are 'x' (fixed or variable) and to all variable right boots? Actually, according to our condition:\n\n                    Condition: (l[i]=='x') and (r[j]=='x' OR r[j]=='?') OR (l[i]=='x' and r[j]=='?') -> but wait, our condition above: \n                    compatible if (l[i]==r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?') OR (r[j]=='?')\n\n                But note: if l[i] is fixed 'x' and r[j] is fixed 'y' and x != y, then not compatible. Also, if l[i] is fixed 'x' and r[j] is fixed 'x', then compatible. And if l[i] is fixed 'x' and r[j] is '?', then compatible.\n\n            Similarly, from a variable left (l[i]=='?') to the right:\n                - It connects to all right boots (because the condition: if l[i]=='?' then the condition holds regardless of r[j])\n\n        Therefore, the graph has:\n\n            For fixed left boots: \n                Each fixed left boot (color x) is connected to:\n                    - All right boots with color x (both fixed and variable) and \n                    - All right boots that are variable (because if the left is fixed and the right is variable, then the condition holds) but wait: actually, the condition for fixed left and variable right is already included by the condition (r[j]=='?') OR (l[i]==r[j])? Actually, the condition (l[i]==r[j]) is for when the right is fixed and matches, and (r[j]=='?') is for variable right. But note: if the left is fixed and the right is fixed but different, then condition fails. And if the left is fixed and the right is variable, then condition holds.\n\n            However, note: the condition is ORed. So for a fixed left 'x', the edges are to:\n                - All right boots that are 'x' (whether fixed or variable) -> because (l[i]==r[j]) is true for these.\n                - And also to all right boots that are '?' -> but wait, the condition (r[j]=='?') is true for these.\n\n            But note: the right boot that is fixed and not 'x' and the right boot that is variable (which is represented by '?') are separate. Actually, the right boots that are variable are the ones with '?'.\n\n            Similarly, for a variable left boot, it is connected to all right boots (both fixed and variable).\n\n        Now, note: the variable left boots are connected to every right boot. So they can match any right boot.\n\n        Similarly, the variable right boots can be matched by any left boot (both fixed and variable) that is not blocked.\n\n        We can try to solve in two parts:\n\n        Part 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible.\n\n        How?\n\n            We can consider the fixed boots only. But note: we can use variable boots to match fixed boots, but then we lose the possibility of using that variable boot for a fixed boot? Actually, we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        Alternate plan:\n\n            We can use a greedy matching that first matches fixed boots, then uses the remaining variable boots to match the remaining boots arbitrarily.\n\n        But wait: sometimes we can use a variable boot to match two fixed boots? Actually, no, one boot per pair.\n\n        However, note: the condition for matching two fixed boots is strict (same color). We can use variable boots to match any fixed boot. But if we use a variable boot to match a fixed boot, then we cannot use that variable boot for another fixed boot.\n\n        Since the goal is to maximize the number of pairs, we should use the fixed boots to their full potential: match fixed boots with fixed boots of the same color, and then use the remaining fixed boots (if any) with variable boots? Actually, no: because a fixed boot must be matched with either a fixed boot of the same color or a variable boot.\n\n        But we can also use variable boots to match fixed boots even if there is a fixed boot of the same color available? \n\n        Example: \n            Left: ['a','?'] \n            Right: ['a','b']\n\n            Possibilities: \n                Option1: match left0 with right0, then left1 with right1 -> but (left1='?', right1='b') is valid, so 2 pairs.\n                Option2: match left0 with right1 -> invalid (because 'a' and 'b' are fixed and different), then left1 with right0 -> valid, so 1 pair.\n\n            So we should prefer to match fixed boots with fixed boots of the same color.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n            Step 1: Count the frequency of fixed colors in the left and fixed colors in the right.\n\n            But note: the fixed boots are not necessarily the same set of colors.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let L_fixed: dictionary of fixed colors in left (counting the fixed left boots)\n            Let R_fixed: dictionary of fixed colors in right\n\n            Then, for a fixed color 'x' that appears in both, we can match min(L_fixed[x], R_fixed[x]) pairs.\n\n            However, wait: what if we have more fixed boots of color 'x' in left than in right? Then we can only use the fixed ones in right, and the extra fixed left boots of color 'x' can be matched with variable right boots.\n\n            Similarly, for a fixed color 'x' that appears only in left, then we can match them with variable right boots.\n\n            Similarly, for a fixed color 'x' that appears only in right, then we can match them with variable left boots.\n\n        But note: the variable boots can be used arbitrarily. So we can use:\n\n            Let F = the set of fixed colors in left and right.\n\n            Then, the total pairs from fixed boots (ignoring the variable boots) is:\n\n                For each color x, we can match at most min(L_fixed[x], R_fixed[x]) pairs.\n\n            However, we must also account for the fact that a fixed boot in left without a matching fixed boot in right can be matched with a variable right boot, and similarly for fixed boots in right without a matching fixed boot in left.\n\n        But note: we cannot match two fixed boots of the same color beyond the minimum of the two counts.\n\n        Now, let:\n\n            total_fixed_matches = 0\n            For each color x in the union of keys of L_fixed and R_fixed:\n                total_fixed_matches += min(L_fixed.get(x,0), R_fixed.get(x,0))\n\n        Then, the remaining fixed boots (in left) are:\n\n            remaining_left_fixed = {}\n            for x in L_fixed:\n                remaining_left_fixed[x] = L_fixed[x] - min(L_fixed[x], R_fixed.get(x,0))\n\n            Similarly, remaining_right_fixed = {}\n            for x in R_fixed:\n                remaining_right_fixed[x] = R_fixed[x] - min(L_fixed.get(x,0), R_fixed[x])\n\n        Then, the total pairs from fixed boots is total_fixed_matches, and the remaining fixed boots (both left and right) can be matched with variable boots.\n\n        However, note: the variable boots can be used for both fixed and variable. But we have:\n\n            total_left_variable = len(L_question)   [the indices where l[i]=='?']\n            total_right_variable = len(R_question)   [the indices where r[i]=='?']\n\n        Now, the total pairs we can form is:\n\n            base = total_fixed_matches\n\n            Then, we have two sets of fixed boots that are unmatched: \n                left_unmatched_fixed: all fixed left boots that are not matched (which are the remaining_left_fixed for each color, but note: we cannot break by color for the matching with variable? Actually, we don't care about the color for the variable matching, because variable matches anything.\n\n            Then, we can use the variable boots to match:\n\n                We have two kinds of unmatched fixed boots: \n                    unmatched_left_fixed_count = sum(remaining_left_fixed.values())\n                    unmatched_right_fixed_count = sum(remaining_right_fixed.values())\n\n            And we have variable boots: \n                total_variable_left = total_left_variable\n                total_variable_right = total_right_variable\n\n            But note: the variable boots themselves can be used to match the unmatched fixed boots and also the variable boots can be used to match each other.\n\n            However, the condition for matching a variable boot (left) with a fixed boot (right) is satisfied, and vice versa.\n\n            Moreover, we can also use the variable boots to match the unmatched fixed boots and the unmatched variable boots.\n\n            How many additional pairs can we form?\n\n            The entire set of left boots (fixed and variable) must be matched with the entire set of right boots (fixed and variable). The total pairs is limited by n.\n\n            The maximum pairs we can form is n. But we have:\n\n                base + ... \n\n            Actually, the total pairs is:\n\n                base + (number of unmatched fixed boots that we can cover by variable boots) + (variable boots matching each other)\n\n            But note: we can use a variable boot from left to match a fixed boot from right, and then use a variable boot from left to match a variable boot from right, etc.\n\n            However, we are constrained by:\n\n                The total pairs we can form is the maximum matching in the bipartite graph. The graph has:\n\n                  Left nodes: n (each node is either fixed or variable)\n                  Right nodes: n\n\n                The edges for fixed nodes are as described, and variable nodes connect to all.\n\n            We can compute the total pairs by:\n\n                total_pairs = base + min(total_left_variable, total_right_variable + unmatched_left_fixed_count + unmatched_right_fixed_count) ?\n\n            Actually, let me think differently:\n\n            After matching the fixed boots (base pairs), we have:\n\n                remaining_left = n - base   [because we used base pairs, so we removed base left boots and base right boots]\n                remaining_right = n - base\n\n            But wait, we didn't remove the fixed boots from the variable sets. Actually, the fixed boots that are matched in base are removed from both sides.\n\n            The remaining left boots: \n                remaining_left = (n - base) = (original n) - base\n                This remaining_left consists of:\n                    remaining_fixed_left = unmatched_left_fixed_count   [the fixed left boots that weren't matched by fixed]\n                    remaining_variable_left = total_left_variable   [all the variable left boots are still there? No: we haven't used any variable left boot yet]\n\n            Actually, we haven't used any variable boot in the base matching. So the base matching only used fixed boots (and note: we can use a fixed boot from left with a variable boot from right, so the base matching might have used some variable boots from the right? No: in our base matching, we only considered fixed boots. \n\n            Correction: In our base matching, we matched fixed boots with fixed boots. But we also could have matched a fixed boot with a variable boot? \n\n            We did not: because we were counting the fixed boots by color, and we did not account for matching fixed boots with variable boots. \n\n            Therefore, our base matching is only the fixed-to-fixed matches. Then, the unmatched fixed boots (both left and right) can be matched with the variable boots.\n\n            So:\n\n                Let base = total_fixed_matches (from fixed-to-fixed)\n\n                Then, we have:\n\n                    remaining_left_fixed = {x: count} for unmatched fixed left\n                    remaining_right_fixed = {x: count} for unmatched fixed right\n\n                    total_remaining_fixed_left = sum(remaining_left_fixed.values())\n                    total_remaining_fixed_right = sum(remaining_right_fixed.values())\n\n                    total_remaining_left = n - base   [because base pairs used base left boots, which are fixed, and the rest are either fixed or variable? Actually, the base matching only used fixed boots from left? \n\n            Actually, in our base matching, we only matched fixed boots from left with fixed boots from right. Therefore, the left boots that were used in base are the fixed ones that were matched. So the remaining left boots are:\n\n                The fixed left boots that were not matched (total_remaining_fixed_left) and all the variable left boots (total_left_variable).\n\n            Similarly, the remaining right boots are:\n\n                The fixed right boots that were not matched (total_remaining_fixed_right) and all the variable right boots (total_right_variable).\n\n            Now, we can form additional pairs by:\n\n                - Matching a fixed left boot (that remains) with a variable right boot (which is available) -> condition holds.\n                - Matching a fixed right boot (that remains) with a variable left boot (which is available) -> condition holds.\n                - Matching two variable boots.\n\n            However, note: we can also match a variable left boot with a fixed right boot (if the fixed right boot is unmatched) and vice versa.\n\n            But the condition for matching a fixed left boot (unmatched) with a variable right boot is valid, and similarly for fixed right boot with variable left boot.\n\n            The total remaining boots (both sides) is 2*(n - base). We want to form as many pairs as possible from these.\n\n            In the remaining part, the graph is complete for the variable nodes and for the connections between fixed and variable.\n\n            Actually, we can form up to (n - base) pairs from the remaining boots, but we are limited by the number of variable boots and the connections.\n\n            However, note: the remaining graph is:\n\n                Left remaining: \n                    A: fixed left boots (with colors, say) -> these can only connect to variable right boots and to fixed right boots (if the fixed right boot has the same color) but wait, we already did the fixed matching and the remaining fixed right boots are the ones that were not matched by fixed left boots. However, note: we did not consider matching the remaining fixed left boots with the remaining fixed right boots of the same color? \n\n            Actually, we did: in our base matching, we matched by color. But note: our base matching was:\n\n                base = 0\n                for color in common_colors:\n                    base += min(L_fixed[color], R_fixed[color])\n\n            But then, the remaining fixed left boots are the ones that were not matched by the fixed right boots of the same color. Similarly for the right.\n\n            Now, can we match the remaining fixed left boots with the remaining fixed right boots of the same color? \n\n            No, because we already subtracted the minimum. For example, for color 'a':\n\n                Suppose L_fixed['a'] = 3, R_fixed['a'] = 2.\n                Then base += 2, and remaining_left_fixed['a'] = 1, remaining_right_fixed['a'] = 0.\n\n                Then we cannot match the remaining fixed left 'a' with a fixed right 'a' because there are none.\n\n            Therefore, the remaining fixed boots cannot be matched with each other.\n\n            So the remaining graph is:\n\n                Left: \n                    - Fixed left boots (each has a color, but no matching fixed right boot of the same color exists)\n                    - Variable left boots\n\n                Right:\n                    - Fixed right boots (each has a color, but no matching fixed left boot of the same color exists)\n                    - Variable right boots\n\n            And the edges:\n\n                For a fixed left boot (color x): \n                    - It can connect to any variable right boot (because condition: (l[i]=='x') and (r[j]=='?') -> yes) and to any fixed right boot? \n                    But wait, the condition is: (l[i]==r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?') OR (r[j]=='?')\n                    For a fixed left (x) and a fixed right (y): \n                        if x==y, then we would have matched them in base, so in the remaining, we don't have such pairs. \n                        if x != y, then (l[i]==r[j]) is false, and (l[i]=='?') is false, so we require (r[j]=='?') -> but the right boot is fixed, so not. So fixed left boot in the remaining set cannot connect to fixed right boot (unless the fixed right boot is of the same color, which we've already removed).\n\n                Similarly, a fixed right boot (color y) can only connect to variable left boots (because if the left is fixed, then unless it is y we wouldn't have matched, and if it is y then it would have been matched; and if the left is variable, then condition holds).\n\n                And the variable boots can connect to everything.\n\n            Therefore, the remaining graph is bipartite with:\n\n                Left nodes: \n                    Type1: fixed left (cannot connect to fixed right, only to variable right)\n                    Type2: variable left (connects to everything)\n\n                Right nodes:\n                    Type1: fixed right (cannot connect to fixed left, only to variable left)\n                    Type2: variable right (connects to everything)\n\n            Now, we can model this as:\n\n                We have two sets of nodes on the left: \n                    F1 = remaining_left_fixed (size = A)\n                    V1 = total_left_variable (size = B)\n\n                And on the right:\n                    F2 = remaining_right_fixed (size = C)\n                    V2 = total_right_variable (size = D)\n\n                The edges:\n\n                    F1 -> V2   (because fixed left can only connect to variable right)\n                    V1 -> F2   (because variable left can connect to fixed right)\n                    V1 -> V2   (variable left to variable right)\n                    V1 -> F2   (already included above) and F1 -> V2 (already included)\n\n            Now, we want to form as many pairs as possible from the remaining n - base boots.\n\n            The maximum matching in this bipartite graph is:\n\n                We can use the variable boots to cover the fixed boots.\n\n                Consider:\n\n                    The fixed left boots (A) must be matched with variable right boots (V2). But we can also use variable left boots (V1) to match fixed right boots (C). \n\n                However, note: we can also use variable boots to match variable boots.\n\n                The total pairs we can form is:\n\n                    We can use at most min(A + B, C + D) pairs, but note we are constrained by the edges.\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                    Step 1: Use variable left boots to match fixed right boots: we can match up to min(B, C) pairs here.\n\n                    Step 2: Use fixed left boots to match variable right boots: we can match up to min(A, D) pairs here.\n\n                    Step 3: Then, the remaining variable left boots (B - min(B,C)) and remaining variable right boots (D - min(A, D)) can be matched with each other: up to min(B - min(B,C), D - min(A, D)).\n\n                Then, the total additional pairs = min(B, C) + min(A, D) + min(B - min(B,C), D - min(A, D))\n\n            But wait, is that independent? Actually, we are overcounting the use of variable boots? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a flow-like reasoning:\n\n                The entire remaining graph can be viewed as:\n\n                    There are two kinds of edges: \n                        - Edges from F1 to V2\n                        - Edges from V1 to F2 and from V1 to V2\n\n                We can use the variable left boots (V1) to cover two types: F2 and V2.\n\n                Similarly, the variable right boots (V2) can be used to cover two types: F1 and V1.\n\n                We can use a greedy:\n\n                    Let x = min(B, C)   [pairs from V1 to F2]\n                    Then, we have B' = B - x, and C' = C - x.\n\n                    Then, let y = min(A, D)   [pairs from F1 to V2]\n                    Then, we have D' = D - y.\n\n                    Then, the remaining variable left (B') and variable right (D') can form min(B', D') pairs.\n\n                So total additional pairs = x + y + min(B', D')\n\n            Then, the overall total pairs = base + x + y + min(B', D')\n\n            But note: the entire set of boots is fixed, and we are matching without repetition, so we must have:\n\n                base + (additional pairs) <= n\n\n            However, we started with base pairs, and then we are matching from the remaining n - base boots, so the additional pairs is at most n - base.\n\n            But note: the total remaining boots is (n - base) * 2, and we are forming additional pairs of size (additional pairs) which is the number of pairs we form from the remaining.\n\n            However, we must ensure we don't exceed the available boots.\n\n            Let me check with the example:\n\n                Example: n=2, base=0, \n                    Left: ['a','?'] -> A=1, B=1\n                    Right: ['a','b'] -> C=1 (for 'b') and D=1 (for the '?')? Wait, no: the right string is \"ab\", so no variable? Actually, wait the example above was:\n\n                    Input: \n                        2\n                        ab\n                        ac\n\n                    Actually, let me take the example I thought earlier:\n\n                    Example 1: \n                        Left: ['a','?'] -> fixed left: ['a'] (A=1), variable left: ['?'] (B=1)\n                        Right: ['a','b'] -> fixed right: ['a','b'] (so for color 'a': count=1, color 'b': count=1) -> C=2, D=0.\n\n                    Then base = min(L_fixed['a'], R_fixed['a']) = min(1,1)=1.\n\n                    Then, remaining_left_fixed: A = 1-1=0, remaining_right_fixed: for 'a'=0, for 'b'=1.\n\n                    Then, additional pairs:\n\n                        Step1: x = min(B, C) = min(1, 2) = 1 -> but wait, C is the remaining_right_fixed which is 1 (only 'b'), and B=1 (variable left). Then x=1, so we use the variable left to match the fixed right 'b'.\n\n                        Then, we have B' = 0, C' = 0.\n\n                        Then, y = min(A, D) = min(0,0)=0.\n\n                        Then, min(B', D') = min(0,0)=0.\n\n                    Total additional pairs = 1.\n\n                    Overall pairs = 1 (base) + 1 = 2, which is correct.\n\n                    But wait, in base we matched the fixed left 'a' with the fixed right 'a'. Then we matched the variable left with the fixed right 'b'. And the right boot 'a' was used, so we don't have a right boot for the left variable? Actually, no: the base matching used the fixed right 'a'. Then the remaining right boot is only 'b'. So the variable left can match the fixed right 'b'. \n\n                    Then the pairs are:\n                        base: (left0, right0)\n                        additional: (left1, right1)\n\n                    That's 2 pairs.\n\n            However, note: the base matching already used one right boot (the fixed 'a'), so the remaining right boots are only the fixed 'b'. \n\n            Now, let's recalc the remaining_left_fixed and remaining_right_fixed:\n\n                Initially, L_fixed = {'a':1}, R_fixed = {'a':1, 'b':1}\n\n                base = min(1,1) for 'a' = 1, and for 'b' (if present in left? no) so base=1.\n\n                Then, remaining_left_fixed: for 'a': 1-1=0, for other colors: nothing.\n                remaining_right_fixed: for 'a': 1-1=0, for 'b': 1 (since left had no 'b').\n\n            So the calculation is correct.\n\n            But note: the base matching does not consider the other fixed boots (like 'b') because the left doesn't have any fixed boot of color 'b'. \n\n            Now, let's try the example I thought earlier without base matching:\n\n                Example 2: \n                    Left: ['a','?'] -> fixed: {'a':1}, variable: 1\n                    Right: ['b','?'] -> fixed: {'b':1}, variable: 1\n\n                Base matching: \n                    For color 'a': min(1,0)=0\n                    For color 'b': min(0,1)=0\n                    base=0.\n\n                Then, remaining_left_fixed: {'a':1}, remaining_right_fixed: {'b':1}\n\n                Then, additional pairs:\n                    x = min(B=1, C=1) = 1 -> use the variable left to match the fixed right 'b'\n                    Then, remaining_left_variable: 0, remaining_right_fixed: 0\n                    Then, y = min(A=1, D=1) = 1 -> use the fixed left 'a' to match the variable right (which is still there: we haven't touched the variable right because we only used the variable left so far) -> but wait, the variable right is still available? \n\n                However, note: the variable right is part of the remaining right boots. After using the variable left, the variable right is still there. \n\n                But wait, we have two steps:\n\n                    Step1: use variable left to match fixed right: we use one variable left and one fixed right. Then the remaining left: fixed left (1) and variable left (0). The remaining right: fixed right (0) and variable right (1).\n\n                    Step2: then we use fixed left to match variable right: we use the fixed left and the variable right.\n\n                So total additional pairs = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n                Then overall pairs = 0 + 2 = 2.\n\n                But wait, the entire set has 2 left and 2 right, so 2 pairs is maximum.\n\n            However, note: the above step-by-step:\n\n                Step1: x = min(B, C) = min(1,1)=1 -> we use the variable left to match the fixed right (which is 'b' at index1?).\n\n                Then, Step2: y = min(A, D) = min(1,1)=1 -> we use the fixed left (which is 'a') to match the variable right (which is the other one).\n\n                Then, we have no variable boots left? \n\n            But wait, the variable right is one boot. We used it in step2. \n\n            Now, the issue: are the boots distinct? Yes, we are matching distinct boots.\n\n            The base matching used none, so we have:\n\n                Left: index0: fixed 'a', index1: variable\n                Right: index0: fixed 'b', index1: variable\n\n            Then, we formed two pairs:\n\n                Pair1: (index1, index0) -> (variable left, fixed right) -> valid.\n                Pair2: (index0, index1) -> (fixed left, variable right) -> valid.\n\n            So the matching is:\n\n                (left1, right0) and (left0, right1)\n\n            But wait, the problem requires to output the indices (the original indices). We must keep track of the indices.\n\n            Therefore, we must record which left and right boots are used.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We are going to:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, then two strings l and r.\n\n            Step 2: Separate the indices for left and right into fixed and variable.\n\n            Step 3: Count the fixed colors for left and right.\n\n            Step 4: Compute base matching for fixed boots.\n\n            Step 5: Then, we need to output the base matching (the pairs from fixed boots) and then the additional pairs.\n\n            However, note: the base matching is done by color, but we need to know which indices to use.\n\n            We need to output the pairs, so we must record which left boots and which right boots are used.\n\n            Steps for base matching:\n\n                We want to match as many fixed boots as possible. But note: we must use the same color.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Create two dictionaries for left and right fixed boots, but also store the list of indices for each color.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                For each color c that appears in both fixed left and fixed right, we can match the minimum count.\n\n                But we must choose which ones to use. We can use any of the fixed boots.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                For each color c in the intersection of keys of L_fixed and R_fixed:\n\n                    count = min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c])\n\n                    Then, we take the first 'count' fixed left boots of color c and the first 'count' fixed right boots of color c (but we must be careful: we want to use the smallest indices? Actually, we can use any, but we have to output the pairs in any order, but the problem requires to output the left boot index and the right boot index.\n\n            However, we must remember the indices.\n\n            Let:\n\n                left_fixed_dict: maps color -> list of indices (in increasing order) for left boots that are fixed and of that color.\n                right_fixed_dict: maps color -> list of indices (in increasing order) for right boots that are fixed and of that color.\n\n            Then, for each color c:\n\n                num = min(len(left_fixed_dict[c]), len(right_fixed_dict[c]))\n                Then, we take the first num from left_fixed_dict[c] and the first num from right_fixed_dict[c].\n\n            Then, we mark these indices as used.\n\n            But wait, we cannot simply take the first num because the problem does not specify which indices to use. We just need to output k pairs, and the indices must be distinct.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                For each color c, we take the smallest num left indices and the smallest num right indices? But the problem does not require any particular order.\n\n            However, we must also consider that we have variable boots that we will use later, so we must not use the same index twice.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We are going to:\n\n                - Create arrays for left and right, marking which indices are used.\n\n                - First, for base matching: for each color, match the fixed boots.\n\n                - Then, for the additional matching, we have:\n\n                    remaining_left_fixed: we have the entire left_fixed_dict, but we removed some indices (the ones used in base). But wait, we didn't. Actually, we need to remove the base matched ones.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Precompute for each color the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors are compatible if they are the same, while an indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors, considering both fixed colors and wildcards ('?'). The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs without reusing any boot.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main steps:\n   - **Base Matching**: Match as many fixed-color boots as possible by pairing boots of the same color.\n   - **Additional Matching**: Use wildcard boots to match any remaining unmatched fixed boots and then pair wildcard boots among themselves.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Base Matching**: For each color present in both left and right fixed boots, compute the maximum possible pairs by taking the minimum count of that color from both sides.\n   - **Additional Matching**: Use wildcard boots to cover any remaining unmatched fixed boots. Then, pair the leftover wildcard boots together.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently processes the input in linear time relative to the number of boots, making it suitable for large inputs (up to 150,000 boots).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed_dict = {}\n    left_question_indices = []\n    left_fixed_indices = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            left_question_indices.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_fixed_indices.append(i)\n            if char not in left_fixed_dict:\n                left_fixed_dict[char] = []\n            left_fixed_dict[char].append(i)\n            \n    right_fixed_dict = {}\n    right_question_indices = []\n    right_fixed_indices = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            right_question_indices.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_fixed_indices.append(i)\n            if char not in right_fixed_dict:\n                right_fixed_dict[char] = []\n            right_fixed_dict[char].append(i)\n            \n    base_pairs = 0\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    result_pairs = []\n    \n    for color in set(list(left_fixed_dict.keys()) + list(right_fixed_dict.keys())):\n        if color in left_fixed_dict and color in right_fixed_dict:\n            count_left = len(left_fixed_dict[color])\n            count_right = len(right_fixed_dict[color])\n            num = min(count_left, count_right)\n            base_pairs += num\n            left_list = left_fixed_dict[color]\n            right_list = right_fixed_dict[color]\n            left_list.sort()\n            right_list.sort()\n            for j in range(num):\n                idx_left = left_list[j]\n                idx_right = right_list[j]\n                if idx_left not in used_left and idx_right not in used_right:\n                    used_left.add(idx_left)\n                    used_right.add(idx_right)\n                    result_pairs.append((idx_left, idx_right))\n                    \n    A = sum(left_fixed_dict.get(c, [0]) * [len(left_fixed_dict[c]) -

These indices are marked as used.\n4. **Additional Matching**: The remaining wildcards are used to match any unmatched fixed boots. Any leftover wildcards are paired together.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's left and right boot indices (adjusted for 1-based indexing).\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible boot pairs by leveraging greedy matching and careful handling of wildcard characters.",
