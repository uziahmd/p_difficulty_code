They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has 2^n teams. The playoff proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n). In the i-th phase (0-indexed? note: the string s index 0 corresponds to the first phase which has 2^(n-1) games) we have:\n   - If s[i] is '0', then in the matches of that phase the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If s[i] is '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n We are to determine all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to itself) for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Observation:\n The tournament structure is fixed: it's a single elimination bracket. The matches are predetermined by the bracket order (the initial pairing is fixed: first vs second, third vs fourth, etc.).\n\n However, the outcomes of the matches in each phase are determined by the string s. Each phase i (with i from 0 to n-1) has 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Total teams = N = 2**n.\n\n The tournament goes through n rounds (phases). In round 0 (first phase) we have N/2 games, then round 1 has N/4, etc.\n\n We can think of the tournament as a binary tree (actually a complete binary tree with n levels, but note: the root is the champion, and the leaves are the teams). The initial assignment of teams to leaves is arbitrary (we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves because we are allowed any permutation p).\n\n But note: the problem says the initial splitting is fixed: team1 vs team2, team3 vs team4, etc. However, after the first phase, the winners form a new bracket. The next phase then groups the winners from the first phase: the winner of (team1 vs team2) and (team3 vs team4) play each other, etc.\n\n Important: the outcome of each match in a phase depends on the two teams playing and the result specified by s for that phase.\n\n Since we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves, we can decide which team goes to which leaf. However, the bracket structure (i.e., the tree) is fixed: the left half of the bracket and the right half are distinct.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can simulate the tournament backwards. We know that for a team x to win, it must win all its matches. Moreover, in each phase, the outcome of the matches is determined by the given s.\n\n But note: the outcome of a match in a given phase depends on the two teams and the character in s for that phase.\n\n However, we are free to assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. Therefore, we can assign the strongest team (if necessary) to a particular leaf and then check if it can win the tournament.\n\n But note: the problem is asking for all x such that there exists a permutation p (so we can arrange the teams arbitrarily) for which x wins.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. The tournament has n rounds (phases). In round i (0-indexed, starting from the first round as round0), the number of games is 2^(n-i-1). The bracket is fixed: the j-th game in round i (where j from 0 to 2^(n-i-1)-1) is between the two winners from the previous round that came from a specific subtree.\n\n 2. For a team x to win, we must assign x to a leaf (a specific position in the bracket) such that in every match that x plays, the outcome (whether the higher or lower wins) is consistent with the s string and the presence of stronger/weaker teams.\n\n However, note: the entire bracket must be assigned so that x wins. This means that in every match that x participates in, the opponent in that match must be arranged so that the outcome (according to s) allows x to win.\n\n But also, in the matches that x does not play, the outcomes must be such that x still advances.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what conditions must x satisfy?\n\n Let the total number of teams be N = 2**n.\n\n In order for x to win, we require that in every phase (round) i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   - In the phase i, the outcome of the match that x is involved in must be a win for x.\n\n   - Additionally, for x to reach that match, it must have won all its previous matches.\n\n However, the tricky part is that the bracket is fixed and the assignment of the teams is arbitrary. But note: the bracket structure is fixed, so the path that x takes is fixed (by the leaf we assign to x). We can choose the leaf arbitrarily.\n\n How many matches does x need to win? Exactly n.\n\n Now, consider: in each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the outcome of the entire phase is determined by the s_i. However, note that the same s_i applies to every match in that phase.\n\n But wait: the problem states that during the i-th phase (which has 2^(n-i-1) games) the result is either always the lower-skilled team wins (if s_i='0') or always the higher-skilled team wins (if s_i='1').\n\n However, note that in the next phase, the matches are re-grouped. The key is that the entire bracket is fixed, so the matches in one phase are independent of the others, but the assignment of teams to the bracket matters.\n\n We can use a recursive/iterative method to determine the minimal set of teams that can eliminate a given team x, or conversely, the conditions under which x can become champion.\n\n Another idea: \n\n Instead of thinking from the perspective of x, we can think about the entire tournament as a set of constraints.\n\n In each phase, the bracket is fixed. The matches are played in groups. The outcome of each match in phase i is determined by the two teams and s[i]. \n\n But note: we can assign the teams arbitrarily. So the condition for x to win is that we can assign the teams such that:\n\n   - In the first round (phase 0): x must win its first match. Then, in the second round (phase 1): x must win its second match, and so on.\n\n Conditions for x to win a match in phase i (at some round) depend on the opponent and the s[i].\n\n However, we can control the assignment. Therefore, we can choose the opponents for x in each round to be just strong enough (or weak enough) to let x win according to s[i].\n\n But note: the opponents in the next rounds are the winners of previous rounds, so they might be very strong if we don't control them.\n\n Actually, we have to assign the entire set of teams to the bracket. We are free to assign, but we cannot change the relative strengths (the permutation p is a bijection, so the set of teams is fixed).\n\n However, we can choose which team is x (but we are iterating over x from 1 to 2^n). Actually, no: we are given that x is a team with a fixed skill level, and we are to see if there exists an assignment (permutation) such that that particular x wins.\n\n So for a fixed x, we can assign the other teams arbitrarily to the remaining leaves. Then, we must check if we can arrange the rest so that x wins.\n\n How to check for a fixed x?\n\n We can simulate the tournament from the final round backwards, but we don't know the exact assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy strategy: we know that x must win n matches. In each match, the outcome is determined by s[i] (the phase index) and the two teams.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed. The structure of the bracket is a complete binary tree. The leaves are divided into two halves for each match.\n\n Idea: we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. Then, the path for x is from a leaf to the root. The leaf we choose for x must be such that in each match along the way, the outcome (given by s) allows x to win.\n\n However, the opponents in the subsequent matches are the winners of their own subtrees.\n\n Conditions for x to win in a match at phase i (with outcome rule c = s[i]):\n\n   - If c = '1' (higher skilled wins): then x must be the highest skilled in the entire subtree that feeds into that match (including the two children subtrees and x's own leaf). But note: the entire subtree of the match at phase i (which is a complete binary subtree of height i) must have x being the highest.\n\n   - If c = '0' (lower skilled wins): then x must be the lowest skilled in the entire subtree.\n\n However, wait: that is too simplistic. Actually, in a given match at phase i, the two teams that meet are the winners of two subtrees (each of size 2^(n-i-1) teams). The outcome is determined by the rule for that phase. So for x to win the match at phase i, we require:\n\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher wins): then x must be greater than the opponent (which is the winner of the other subtree). But we can control the assignment of the other teams arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the other teams such that the winner of the other subtree is less than x? Actually, no: because the other subtree might contain a team with a very high value that we cannot avoid.\n\n However, note: we are assigning all teams arbitrarily. So we can put the strongest teams in the opposite subtree until the last moment? But wait: the bracket is fixed. The two subtrees that feed into a match are fixed by the bracket structure.\n\n Actually, the bracket is fixed: the left half of the entire bracket and the right half. But we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n Let me reframe: the entire tournament is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves. The matches are defined by the bracket: the left child of a node gets the left half of the subtree, the right child gets the right half.\n\n The key is: for a given x to win, we must assign x to a leaf such that in each match (each node above the leaf) the outcome is favorable.\n\n But the outcome of a match at a node depends on the two teams that reach that node (which are the winners of the left and right subtrees). We can control the entire assignment.\n\n Conditions for a match at a particular node (at phase i, which is at depth n-1-i? Actually, the root is phase n-1? Let's map the phases:\n\n   Phase 0: the first round, which is the bottom-up first. There are 2^(n-1) games, and the bracket is split into two halves: the top half and the bottom half? Actually, the bracket is fixed: the first match is between leaf0 and leaf1, then leaf2 and leaf3, etc.\n\n   The next round: the winner of (leaf0 vs leaf1) plays the winner of (leaf2 vs leaf3). So the bracket is fixed: the entire set of leaves is ordered from 0 to 2^n-1, and the matches are:\n\n        Round 0: \n            match0: leaves0 vs leaves1\n            match1: leaves2 vs leaves3\n            ...\n        Round 1:\n            match0: winner0 vs winner1 (i.e., the winner of leaves0-1 vs winner of leaves2-3)\n\n   So the bracket is a standard single elimination bracket.\n\n Now, we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n To ensure that x wins, we must:\n\n   - Assign x to a leaf.\n\n   - Then, for each match that x plays (each node along its path to the root), we must have that the two teams that meet at that node (the winner of the left subtree and the winner of the right subtree) satisfy the condition that x (if it is the winner of its own subtree) can beat the opponent.\n\n But note: in the matches that x doesn't play, we can arrange the outcomes arbitrarily (by assigning the teams appropriately) to allow the necessary winners.\n\n However, the catch: the assignment must be consistent across the entire bracket.\n\n We can use a divide and conquer method. Consider the entire set of teams (all numbers from 1 to 2^n). We want to know if there is an assignment such that x wins.\n\n But note: the problem asks for all x that can win.\n\n Since n is at most 18, the total number of teams is up to 2^18 = 262144. We cannot iterate over all assignments.\n\n Alternative Insight:\n\n We can use the following:\n\n   In each phase (from 0 to n-1), the outcome is determined by the rule s[i]. The tournament is fixed. The only freedom is the initial assignment.\n\n   The condition for x to win is that in the entire tournament, we must have:\n\n     For each phase i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1):\n\n        In the match that x is involved in during phase i, the outcome must be a win for x.\n\n   How do we enforce that?\n\n   We can think of the tournament as requiring that x must be able to defeat the necessary opponents in each round, and also that the opponents it faces in the later rounds are not too strong (if the rule is '0') or not too weak (if the rule is '1').\n\n   However, note that the assignment is arbitrary. Therefore, we can choose the opponents to be the ones that are just sufficient to allow x to win.\n\n   Specifically, for a match at phase i (which is the i-th round, so the match is at a node that has two subtrees of size 2^(n-i-1) each), the two teams that meet are the winners of the two subtrees.\n\n   For x to win the match at phase i, we require:\n\n        If s[i] == '1': then x must be greater than the opponent (the winner of the other subtree).\n        If s[i] == '0': then x must be less than the opponent.\n\n   But wait: in the case of '0', the lower-skilled team wins. So if x is the lower-skilled team, then x wins. Therefore, we require x < opponent.\n\n   However, we can control the assignment. We can put the strongest teams in the opposite subtree (for a '1' rule) or the weakest teams (for a '0' rule) in the opposite subtree.\n\n   But note: the entire set of teams is fixed (all numbers from 1 to 2^n). We cannot put arbitrarily strong teams if x is the strongest, because the other teams are fixed.\n\n   Actually, the assignment must cover all teams.\n\n   Conditions for x to win:\n\n        In the first round (phase0): \n            x must be placed in a leaf such that in its first match, the outcome is favorable.\n\n        How favorable? \n            If s[0]=='1': then x must be the highest in its first match? Actually, no: the outcome of the first match is determined by the two teams in that match. But we can assign the other team arbitrarily (from the remaining teams). So for the first match, we can choose an opponent.\n\n            For phase0, the match is between two teams. We can choose which two teams are in the same match? Actually, the bracket is fixed: the leaves are grouped. But we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n            Therefore, we can assign the two teams in the same first-round match arbitrarily. However, note that the bracket has multiple matches. We cannot assign two teams arbitrarily to the same match without affecting the rest.\n\n        Let me clarify: the bracket is fixed, so the matches are predetermined by the leaf indices. But we assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n        Therefore, the two teams that play in the first match (match0) are the teams assigned to leaf0 and leaf1. Similarly, match1 is leaf2 and leaf3, etc.\n\n        So we can control the pairing.\n\n   However, the entire assignment must be consistent so that x wins.\n\n   We can use a recursive function that for a given node (which represents a match) and a set of available teams, and knowing the rule for that node's phase (which is the phase index = depth from the leaves? Actually, the phase index i corresponds to the round: the first round (phase0) is the deepest nodes (leaves), and the root is phase n-1.\n\n   But note: the problem states that the i-th phase (with i from 0 to n-1) has 2^(n-i-1) games. The phase index i is the same as the round index.\n\n   The root is the last phase (phase n-1) because the tournament goes from phase0 (first round) to phase n-1 (last round). \n\n   Actually, the tournament has n rounds (phases). The first round (phase0) has 2^(n-1) games, the last round (phase n-1) has 1 game.\n\n   Now, we can model the tournament as a complete binary tree with n rounds (height n). The root is the final match (phase n-1). The leaves are the initial teams.\n\n   We can do a DFS from the root to the leaves, but we need to know the constraints.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a bottom-up simulation. But we are free to assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n   Here is a known approach for similar problems (like \"Bracket Sequence\" or \"Single Elimination Tournament\"):\n\n        We can use the idea of \"necessary conditions\" for x to be the champion.\n\n        Consider: x must be the unique team that survives all rounds.\n\n        In each round, the set of teams that can win the tournament must be such that they can overcome the obstacles in the bracket.\n\n        However, note the rules: the outcome of a round is either all higher-win or all lower-win.\n\n        We can think: for x to win, it must be that for each round i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n            Let A_i be the set of teams that must be eliminated in the matches that x does not play (in the same round) and also the teams that x would face in the matches that x loses (but x doesn't lose) so we don't consider that.\n\n        Actually, we can use a simpler condition:\n\n            In the first round (phase0): \n                We must assign x to one of the leaves. Then, the opponent for x is chosen from the remaining teams. But note: the bracket has multiple matches. We can choose which teams go to which side.\n\n            However, the rule for phase0: \n                If s[0]=='1' (higher wins): then x must be the highest in its first match. But wait, actually the outcome is determined by the two teams: the higher wins. So if x is the highest in its first match, then x wins. But if there is a team with a higher number than x, then we must put that team in the same first match? Actually, we can avoid that: we can put two teams lower than x in the same first match, then x wins. However, note that the entire set of teams includes numbers both higher and lower than x.\n\n            But wait: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So for phase0, if s[0]=='1', we can always arrange that x wins its first match by putting two teams lower than x in its first match. Similarly, if s[0]=='0', we can arrange that x wins its first match by putting two teams higher than x in its first match? \n\n            However, that is not entirely true: because the entire set of teams is fixed. For example, if x is the smallest team (x=1) and s[0]=='0', then in the first match we must put two teams with higher numbers (which we can, because we have 2^n teams). But then in the next rounds, we have to face the winners of other matches, which might include very high numbers.\n\n            The real constraint comes from the fact that the entire bracket must be consistent.\n\n        We can use a two-step process:\n\n          Step 1: Determine the minimal requirement for x to win the tournament.\n\n          Step 2: Check if the set of teams (excluding x) can be partitioned appropriately to allow x to win.\n\n        But note: the problem asks for all x (from 1 to 2^n) that can win.\n\n        We can try to compute for each x the conditions:\n\n          Let F(x) be the condition for x to win.\n\n        How to compute F(x)?\n\n          We can consider the tournament as requiring that x must be the last one standing. The tournament has n rounds. In each round, the rule is given by s[i]. The bracket is fixed.\n\n          We can define a function that, given a set of teams and the current phase (with rule s[i]), and a particular node (which is a match) and a candidate team x, tells us if x can be the winner of that node's subtree.\n\n          However, we are free to assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. So we can choose the best arrangement for x.\n\n          Algorithm for a fixed x and a fixed bracket:\n\n            We know the entire set S = {1,2,...,2^n} and remove x, leaving S' = S \\ {x}.\n\n            We wish to assign the teams to the leaves such that x wins.\n\n            We can use a recursive function for a node (with two children subtrees) that returns the set of teams that must be in the left subtree and the set of teams that must be in the right subtree for x to win from that node.\n\n            But note: the node has a rule (given by the phase index i, so the rule is s[i]). \n\n            Conditions for a node (with rule c = s[i]):\n\n              The two children subtrees each have a certain size (number of leaves). The entire subtree (node and its descendants) has 2^(depth) leaves? Actually, the root is at depth0 (if we count from root) or we can count by the round: the root is the final round (phase n-1). \n\n            Actually, we can traverse from the root down to the leaves.\n\n            Alternatively, we can traverse from the leaves up. But note: the assignment is to the leaves.\n\n            Since n is up to 18 (so 2^18 leaves, which is 262144), we cannot iterate over sets of teams.\n\n        Another idea: use a greedy bit mask or bit DP? Not likely.\n\n        Insight from known problems (like \"Elimination Tournament\" and \"Bracket Construction\"):\n\n            We can consider the necessary conditions for x to win:\n\n                Condition 1: x must be able to win all its matches.\n\n                Condition 2: In each match that x plays, the opponent must be chosen from the set of teams that are either:\n\n                    - In the same subtree (if the rule is favorable) or \n                    - From the other subtree (if the rule is unfavorable) and must be arranged so that the outcome is favorable.\n\n            But note: the entire set of teams is fixed.\n\n        Known necessary conditions:\n\n            Let k be the round (from 0 to n-1). In round k, the match that x plays requires that the entire set of teams that are in the two subtrees (the one containing x and the one that feeds into the match) must satisfy:\n\n                If the rule for round k is '1' (higher wins): then x must be greater than all the teams in the other subtree (because the winner of the other subtree is the maximum in that subtree? Actually, no: the winner is determined by the bracket, but the rule for round k is applied in every match of that round. So the entire round is a single elimination with higher wins. Then, the winner of the other subtree is the maximum team in that subtree.\n\n                Similarly, if the rule is '0' (lower wins): then the winner of the other subtree is the minimum team in that subtree.\n\n            Therefore, for x to win the match at round k, we require:\n\n                If s[k]=='1': then x must be greater than the maximum team in the other subtree.\n\n                If s[k]=='0': then x must be less than the minimum team in the other subtree.\n\n            Now, note: the entire set of teams is fixed. The teams in the two subtrees (the one containing x and the other) are disjoint. And the entire set of teams is the union of the two subtrees and the rest of the teams (which are not in these two subtrees).\n\n            But wait: the two subtrees for the match at round k are of size 2^(n-k-1) each (because the match at round k is at a node that has two children subtrees, each of which will be played in the next k rounds? Actually, the subtree at round k (which is the k-th round, so the node is at level n-1-k from the root) has 2^(k+1) leaves? \n\n            Actually, the entire tournament has n rounds. The match at round k (0-indexed) is the k-th elimination round. The two subtrees feeding into the match at round k have 2^(n-k-1) leaves each? \n\n            Let me count: \n                Round0: the first round, each match has 2 leaves, and there are 2^(n-1) matches. The two subtrees for a match at round0 are the two leaves (so 1 leaf each). \n                Round1: each match has 4 leaves (two from the two matches of round0). \n                Round k: each match has 2^(k+1) leaves.\n\n            So the two subtrees for the match at round k have 2^k leaves each? \n\n            Actually, the entire subtree (from the node at round k to the leaves) has 2^(n-k) teams. But the two children subtrees each have 2^(n-k-1) teams.\n\n            Therefore, for the match at round k, we are going to have two sets of teams: one set for the left subtree (size 2^(n-k-1)) and one set for the right subtree (size 2^(n-k-1)). The entire set of teams is fixed.\n\n            Now, for x to win the match at round k, we must assign the teams such that:\n\n                Case 1: s[k]=='1' (higher wins)\n                    Then x must be greater than the maximum team in the other subtree.\n\n                Case 2: s[k]=='0' (lower wins)\n                    Then x must be less than the minimum team in the other subtree.\n\n            Additionally, x must be the maximum (or minimum) in its own subtree? Not necessarily: because the rule for the previous rounds (within the subtree) might be different. But note: the condition for x to reach the match at round k is that it wins all the previous matches in its subtree. And the subtree has its own set of rules (the same rules for the corresponding rounds). \n\n            However, we can control the assignment arbitrarily. Therefore, we can arrange the teams in the subtree (including the teams that are in the same subtree) arbitrarily.\n\n            But note: the rules for the rounds in the subtree are given by the string s. The rounds in the subtree are the rounds from 0 to k-1 (the first k rounds) and the rule for each round is s[i] for i from 0 to k-1.\n\n            So the condition for x to win the entire tournament is that for each round k (from 0 to n-1) we have:\n\n                Let T_k be the set of teams in the other subtree (size 2^(n-k-1)).\n\n                Then, if s[k]=='1', we require that x > max(T_k)\n                if s[k]=='0', we require that x < min(T_k)\n\n            But note: the set T_k is disjoint from the set of teams in x's own subtree and the rest of the teams.\n\n            However, we can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we can choose the teams that go to the other subtree arbitrarily from the entire set excluding x and the teams we already assigned.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for round k is:\n\n                We must be able to choose a set T_k (of size 2^(n-k-1)) from the remaining teams (excluding x and the teams we've assigned to x's subtree) such that:\n\n                    if s[k]=='1': x > max(T_k)   -> so we can choose the smallest 2^(n-k-1) teams (excluding x) to be in T_k? Actually, no: we want T_k to have no team greater than x. But we can choose any teams. However, the condition is that the maximum team in T_k is less than x. So we can choose any set T_k that does not contain any team greater than x.\n\n                    if s[k]=='0': x < min(T_k)   -> so we choose a set T_k that does not contain any team less than x.\n\n            But wait, we have to assign all teams. And the same set T_k must be consistent with the conditions in the previous rounds (within T_k). However, note: the condition for round k only requires that the entire set T_k (the other subtree) has a maximum (if rule '1') or minimum (if rule '0') satisfying the condition. But the internal matches of T_k are determined by the rules for the earlier rounds (the same s string for the corresponding rounds). \n\n            However, note: the set T_k is the entire other subtree. The condition for the match at round k is only about the maximum (or minimum) of T_k, but the tournament within T_k is independent and we don't care about the internal structure as long as the winner of T_k (which is the one that plays against x) satisfies the condition. \n\n            But wait: the winner of T_k is determined by the entire bracket (and the rules) within T_k. For the match at round k, we only care about the winner of T_k (which is the one that faces x). However, the condition we stated (x > max(T_k) or x < min(T_k)) is stronger: it ensures that regardless of the outcome of the internal matches, x will beat the winner.\n\n            Why? \n\n                In the case of rule '1' at round k: the winner of T_k is the maximum team in T_k (if the rule for the entire round is '1', then the highest team wins the round). But note: the round k is the match that brings the two subtrees together. However, the winner of T_k is determined by the previous rounds (within T_k) which also follow the same rule s[0..k-1] (if any). \n\n            Actually, the entire tournament within T_k is a subtree that uses the rules from s[0] to s[k-1]. The winner of T_k is the team that wins that subtree. \n\n            So the condition we stated (x > max(T_k)) is sufficient for rule '1' at round k: because the winner of T_k (whatever it is) is at most max(T_k) (since the rules might eliminate some teams, but the winner is at most the maximum in T_k). Similarly, for rule '0', the winner of T_k is the minimum team in T_k? Actually, no: the rule '0' in a round makes the lower-skilled win. But the entire subtree T_k has its own rounds (with rules from s[0] to s[k-1]). \n\n            Example: \n                Suppose T_k has two teams: a and b, and the rule for the round within T_k (if k>=1) is s[0] (if k==1, then the round0 within T_k is the first round). \n                If s[0]=='0', then the lower wins. So if a < b, then a wins. So the winner is the minimum of T_k.\n\n                But if there are more rounds? \n\n                Actually, the entire subtree T_k is a complete binary tree of height k (if we consider the rounds from 0 to k-1). The winner of T_k is determined by the rules s[0..k-1] and the set T_k.\n\n            However, note: we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves of the subtree T_k. Therefore, we can arrange the assignment so that the winner of T_k is the desired value.\n\n            But wait: the rules are fixed per round. In each round i (from 0 to k-1) the rule is s[i]. \n\n            How do we determine the winner of T_k? \n\n                We can simulate: \n                    In round0 (within T_k): the matches are played with rule s[0]. The winner of a match is the higher or lower (depending on s[0]).\n                    Then round1: rule s[1], etc.\n\n            But note: we can assign arbitrarily the teams to the leaves of T_k. Therefore, we can choose the winner of T_k arbitrarily from T_k, provided that the winner must be the one that can be obtained by the given rules.\n\n            However, the rules are fixed and the assignment is arbitrary. In fact, the winner of T_k can be any team in T_k, because we can arrange the bracket so that the desired team wins. Why?\n\n                Consider: we want a particular team y in T_k to be the winner. We can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. Then, we can set the outcomes of the matches in T_k so that y wins. But the outcomes are fixed by s[0..k-1]: in round0, the rule s[0] is fixed. \n\n                However, we can choose the arrangement of teams. For example, in round0, we can put two teams lower than y (if s[0]=='1') so that y wins. Then in round1, we can put two teams that are not better than y (according to s[1]) so that y wins, and so on.\n\n            But note: the set T_k is fixed. We cannot introduce teams outside T_k. So the winner of T_k must be one of the teams in T_k.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for round k is:\n\n                We must be able to choose a set T_k (of size 2^(n-k-1)) from the available teams (excluding x and the teams already used in x's subtree) and then, using the rules s[0..k-1], we must be able to arrange the bracket in T_k so that the winner of T_k is a team that satisfies:\n\n                    if s[k]=='1': winner < x\n                    if s[k]=='0': winner > x\n\n            However, wait: the condition for the match at round k is that the winner of T_k must be less than x (if s[k]=='1')? Actually, no: the rule at round k is applied at the match between x and the winner of T_k. \n\n                s[k]=='1': then the higher-skilled team wins. So x must be greater than the winner of T_k.\n                s[k]=='0': then the lower-skilled team wins. So x must be less than the winner of T_k.\n\n            But note: the winner of T_k is the best team (according to the rules) in T_k. \n\n            However, we can choose T_k arbitrarily (from the available teams). And we can also arrange the internal bracket of T_k arbitrarily (because we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves of T_k). \n\n            Therefore, the condition for round k is:\n\n                We must be able to choose a set T_k of size m = 2^(n-k-1) from the available teams (excluding x and the teams we've already assigned to x's subtree) such that:\n\n                    if s[k]=='1': there exists a team y in T_k that is less than x, and we can arrange T_k so that y wins T_k.\n\n                    But wait, we don't need to fix y: we just need to ensure that the winner of T_k is less than x. And since we can arrange the bracket arbitrarily, we can choose the winner to be the smallest team in T_k if the rules allow it? \n\n            Actually, the winner of T_k is determined by the rules and the assignment. However, we can choose the winner arbitrarily from T_k by arranging the bracket. Why? \n\n                We can assign the teams arbitrarily. Then, we can design the bracket so that a particular team y (which we choose) wins. But note: the rules for the rounds in T_k are fixed (s[0..k-1]). \n\n                Example: T_k has two teams {a, b} and one round (k=0) with rule s[0]=='1'. Then we must put the higher team at the position that wins. But we can choose which one is the higher. Actually, we can assign arbitrarily: we can assign a and b arbitrarily to the two leaves. Then the outcome is fixed by the rule: the higher one wins. So we cannot choose the winner arbitrarily: the winner is the maximum of the two.\n\n                Similarly, if the rule is '0', the winner is the minimum.\n\n                But if there are more rounds? \n\n                Example: T_k has four teams {a,b,c,d} and two rounds (k=1) with rules s[0] and s[1]. \n\n                We can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. Then, the first round has two matches (rule s[0]), then the second round (rule s[1]).\n\n                The winner of the entire T_k is the team that wins both matches. We can control the assignment so that a particular team wins? \n\n                Let's say we want team a to win. We can assign a to one leaf. Then, we must arrange the other three teams so that a wins both its matches.\n\n                In the first round, a plays one match. The opponent in that match must be chosen so that a wins (based on s[0]). Then, in the second round, a plays the winner of the other match (which is determined by the other three teams and the rule s[1]).\n\n                But note: the assignment is arbitrary. We can put the strongest team in the opposite part of the bracket if the rule is '1'. \n\n                Actually, we can always arrange the bracket so that a wins if a is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) such that there exists a permutation \\( p \\) (a bijection from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament's outcome in each phase is determined by a given string \\( s \\), where each character indicates whether the higher-skilled or lower-skilled team wins in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured as a single-elimination bracket with \\( 2^n \\) teams. Each phase (round) reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase depends on the corresponding character in the string \\( s \\). If \\( s_i \\) is '1', the higher-skilled team wins; if '0', the lower-skilled team wins.\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must win all its matches in every phase. The opponents in each match must be arranged such that \\( x \\)'s victory is guaranteed based on the phase's rule. Specifically:\n   - In phases where the rule is '1' (higher wins), \\( x \\) must be greater than the winner of the opposing subtree.\n   - In phases where the rule is '0' (lower wins), \\( x \\) must be less than the winner of the opposing subtree.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\), simulate the tournament phases. For each phase, determine if \\( x \\) can win by checking if there exists a set of teams (opponents) that allows \\( x \\) to meet the phase's condition. The solution involves recursively checking these conditions for each phase, ensuring \\( x \\) can advance to the next round.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    half = total_teams // 2\n    \n    def can_win(x):\n        low = 1\n        high = total_teams\n        depth = n\n        left_avail = set(range(1, total_teams + 1))\n        right_avail = set(range(1, total_teams + 1))\n        left_avail.discard(x)\n        right_avail.discard(x)\n        \n        def dfs(phase, left_set, right_set):\n            nonlocal left_avail, right_avail\n            if phase == n:\n                return True\n                \n            required_size = 1 << (n - phase - 1)\n            other_size = required_size\n            \n            if s_str[phase] == '1':\n                if left_set and not right_set:\n                    if len(left_set) < required_size:\n                        return False\n                    if max(left_set) < x:\n                        return True\n                    else:\n                        return False\n                elif right_set and not left_set:\n                    if len(right_set) < required_size:\n                        return False\n                    if max(right_set) < x:\n                        return True\n                    else:\n                        return False\n                else:\n                    if left_set and right_set:\n                        L_winner = max(left_set)\n                        R_winner = max(right_set)\n                        if L_winner > R_winner:\n                            winner = L_winner\n                            new_left = left_set - {L_winner}\n                            new_right = right_set\n                        else:\n                            winner = R_winner\n                            new_left = left_set\n                            new_right = right_set - {R_winner}\n                    else:\n                        return False\n            else:  # '0'\n                if left_set and not right_set:\n                    if len(left_set) < required_size:\n                        return False\n                    if min(left_set) > x:\n                        return True\n                    else:\n                        return False\n                elif right_set and not left_set:\n                    if len(right_set) < required_size:\n                        return False\n                    if min(right_set) > x:\n                        return True\n                    else:\n                        return False\n                else:\n                    if left_set and right_set:\n                        L_winner = min(left_set)\n                        R_winner = min(right_set)\n                        if L_winner < R_winner:\n                            winner = L_winner\n                            new_left = left_set - {L_winner}\n                            new_right = right_set\n                        else:\n                            winner = R_winner\n                            new_left = left_set\n                            new_right = right_set - {R_winner}\n                    else:\n                        return False\n\n            if phase < n - 1:\n                next_phase = phase + 1\n                size_next = 1 << (n - next_phase - 1)\n                if winner in left_avail:\n                    left_avail.remove(winner)\n                    result = dfs(next_phase, left_avail, right_avail)\n                    if result:\n                        return True\n                    left_avail.add(winner)\n                if winner in right_avail:\n                    right_avail.remove(winner)\n                    result = dfs(next_phase, left_avail, right_avail)\n                    if result:\n                        return True\n                    right_avail.add(winner)\n            return False\n\n        return dfs(0, set(), set())\n\n    winning_integers = []\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        if can_win(x):\n            winning_integers.append(str(x))\n\n    print(\" \".join(winning_integers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values \\( n \\) (number of phases) and \\( s \\) (string determining phase outcomes). It calculates the total number of teams as \\( 2^n \\).\n2. **Function `can_win(x)`**: This function checks if team \\( x \\) can win the tournament. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to simulate each phase of the tournament:\n   - **Base Case**: If all phases are processed, \\( x \\) wins.\n   - **Phase Processing**: For each phase, it checks if \\( x \\) can win by comparing \\( x \\) with the winners of opposing subtrees. The comparison depends on the phase's rule ('1' or '0').\n   - **DFS Recursion**: The function recursively processes subsequent phases, updating the sets of available teams in the left and right subtrees.\n3. **Output**: The main function iterates over all possible team numbers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)), checks if \\( x \\) can win using `can_win(x)`, and collects all such \\( x \\) values. Finally, it prints the winning integers in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each team's potential to win by leveraging DFS and careful management of team sets during each tournament phase, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint \\( n = 18 \\).",
