There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is knockout. The winner must win all his games. We want the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n The rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n Let's denote that the winner plays k games. Then, the structure of the tournament must allow the winner to play k games, and the rule must be satisfied for each match the winner plays.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, the total number of games is n-1, but the winner's path is only k games, and k is at most floor(log2(n)) + something? Actually, the condition on the rule might force a particular structure.\n\n However, note the example:\n   n=2 -> 1 game (winner plays 1 game)\n   n=3 -> 2 games (winner plays 2 games)\n   n=4 -> 2 games (winner plays 2 games)\n   n=10 -> 4 games\n\n How can we think about it?\n\n Another way: we can model the tournament as a binary tree. But note the rule: two players can play only if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\n This rule is similar to how a \"double elimination\" or \"balanced\" bracket works, but let's try to understand:\n\n Consider that in order for the winner to play k games, we need to set up the tournament such that the winner can have k wins, and the rest of the players are eliminated appropriately.\n\n However, note that the rule applies to every match, not just the winner's. But the problem says the audience is bored and we are to assume the rule is used. So we are to find the maximum k (the winner's game count) over all possible arrangements.\n\n What constraints must k satisfy?\n\n In a knockout tournament, the winner must beat k opponents. Moreover, the entire tournament must eliminate n-1 players. Each game eliminates one player.\n\n Now, consider the condition: when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he must have won k-1 games already. And the opponent must have won either k-2, k-1, or k games (but note: the opponent must have a game count within one). However, since the winner has k-1 wins, the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins.\n\n But note: the entire tournament must have a structure that allows the winner to accumulate k wins. Also, the other players must be arranged so that the winner can face them at the right time.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to allow a player to win k games under the given rule.\n\n How do we build f(k)?\n\n - In the first game, the winner must play someone. So we need at least 2 players to have the winner play his first game.\n\n - After the first win, the winner has 1 win. Then, to play the second game, the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 wins. But note: the winner cannot play two games in a row without an opponent having 0 wins? Actually, the rule is about the current state: the number of games the opponent has played.\n\n However, we can think of the tournament as being built in rounds, but the rounds might not be balanced. \n\n Actually, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n Let f(0) = 1 (the winner without having played any game? but we don't have a game then)\n Let f(1) = 2 (the winner and one other player)\n\n For the k-th win, the winner must have played k-1 games and the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1 games.\n\n But note: the opponent for the k-th game must come from the remaining players. The entire tournament must account for all the players.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the tournament as having two subtrees: one that leads to the opponent with k-2 wins and one that leads to the opponent with k-1 wins? Actually, we can break down:\n\n To get a player that has exactly k-2 wins (to play against the winner for the k-th game), we need a subtree that produces a player with k-2 wins. Similarly, for a player with k-1 wins, we need a subtree that produces a player with k-1 wins.\n\n However, note that the same opponent must have lost only one game (the one against the winner) and won all others. So the minimal number of players to produce a player with k wins is:\n\n   f(k) = 1 + f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n\n Why?\n   - We need the winner (1 player)\n   - We need a subtree that produces an opponent with k-1 wins (which requires f(k-1) players, because that opponent must",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if their previous game counts differ by at most one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given rule. The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players \\( n \\) is at least the minimal number of players required for a player to win \\( k \\) games under this rule.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The minimal number of players needed for a player to win \\( k \\) games follows a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, \\( f(k) = 1 + f(k-1) + f(k-2) \\), where \\( f(k) \\) represents the minimal number of players required for a player to win \\( k \\) games.\n3. **Binary Search**: Given the constraints \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\), a direct computation of \\( f(k) \\) for large \\( k \\) is infeasible. Instead, we use binary search to find the maximum \\( k \\) such that \\( f(k) \\leq n \\). The binary search is performed over the range \\( [0, \\log_2(n)] \\), leveraging the logarithmic growth of \\( f(k) \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    low, high = 1, 100000\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    ans = 1\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if mid == 1:\n            f_mid = 2\n        elif mid == 2:\n            f_mid = 3\n        else:\n            for _ in range(2, mid+1):\n                a, b = b, a + b\n            f_mid = b\n            \n        if f_mid <= n:\n            ans = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the number of players \\( n \\) is 2, the winner can only play 1 game, so we immediately return 1.\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 1 and `high` set to a sufficiently large value (100,000). The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 2 and 3, representing the base cases for \\( f(1) = 2 \\) and \\( f(2) = 3 \\).\n3. **Binary Search Execution**: For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, we compute \\( f(mid) \\) using the recurrence relation. If \\( f(mid) \\leq n \\), we update the answer and search for a higher \\( k \\); otherwise, we search lower.\n4. **Output Result**: After the binary search completes, the maximum \\( k \\) (stored in `ans`) is printed, representing the maximum number of games the tournament winner can participate in.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( k \\) using binary search, leveraging the logarithmic growth of the minimal player count function \\( f(k) \\) to handle very large values of \\( n \\) up to \\( 10^{18} \\).",
