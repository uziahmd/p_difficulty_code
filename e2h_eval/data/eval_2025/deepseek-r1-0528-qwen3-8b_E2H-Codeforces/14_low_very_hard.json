He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, note: we are given m and we want to find n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing. However, it doesn't increase by one each time. For example, when n=24, f(24)=4; n=25, f(25)=6. So sometimes we jump from 4 to 6.\n\n Therefore, for a given m, there might be:\n   - No n such that f(n)=m.\n   - One or more consecutive n's? Actually, note that once we have m zeros, the next numbers until the next multiple of 5 (or higher power) will have the same number of zeros? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, the function f(n) is constant for a while and then jumps at multiples of 5, 25, etc.\n\n Example: \n   m=1: \n        n=5 -> 1, n=6,7,8,9 -> still 1, because 10! has two zeros? Wait, let me check:\n\n   Actually, the sample input m=1 gives output: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   Why?\n      5! = 120 -> 1 zero\n      6! = 720 -> 1 zero\n      7! = 5040 -> 1 zero\n      8! = 40320 -> 1 zero\n      9! = 362880 -> 1 zero\n      10! = 3628800 -> 2 zeros\n\n   So for m=1, n from 5 to 9.\n\n How do we solve?\n\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then we can look for the range of n that yield exactly m.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"print the k integers (in increasing order)\".\n\n But note: m can be up to 100000.\n\n We cannot iterate over n from 1 to a very large number because n! trailing zeros increases logarithmically.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the trailing zeros function f(n) is strictly increasing when n crosses a multiple of 5, but not always by one.\n\n We are to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the lower bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. But note: if m is 0, then we are looking for n from 1 to 4? However, the problem states m>=1.\n\n 2. Then, we need to find the upper bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n Then the numbers n satisfying f(n)=m must lie between (lower_bound) and (upper_bound-1).\n\n However, note: we found the lower_bound as the smallest n with at least m zeros. Then the condition f(n)=m holds for n from lower_bound to the point where f(n) becomes m+1 (exclusive).\n\n But wait: what if there is no n such that f(n)=m? Then the lower_bound for m+1 would be the same as the lower_bound for m? Actually, we must check:\n\n   Let L(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Then the numbers n with f(n)=m are from L(m) to the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (which we denote as L(m+1)) minus one.\n\n However, note: it is possible that there is no n with f(n)=m. For example, m=6: \n      n=25: f(25)=6+1=7? Actually, let's compute:\n\n      f(24)= floor(24/5)+floor(24/25)=4+0=4\n      f(25)= floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6 -> so 25! has 6 zeros? Then 25! has 6 zeros, so m=6 is achieved at 25.\n\n      But wait, 25! has 6 zeros? Actually, 25! has 6 zeros? Let me compute:\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the product. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the problem reduces to counting the number of factors of 5 in \\( n! \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor \\). This formula counts the total number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that result in exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, we use binary search. We first find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). Then, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., the lower bound for \\( m+1 \\) is the same as the lower bound for \\( m \\)), then there are no solutions, and we output 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m + 1\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    left_bound = low\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m + 100000\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m + 1:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    right_bound = low\n    \n    start = left_bound\n    end = right_bound - 1\n    \n    if start > end:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = end - start + 1\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(start, end + 1))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). This \\( n \\) is stored in `left_bound`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m+1 \\). This \\( n \\) is stored in `right_bound`.\n\n4. **Determine Valid Range**: The valid \\( n \\) values are those from `left_bound` to `right_bound - 1`. If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., `left_bound` is greater than or equal to `right_bound`), the output is 0. Otherwise, the valid \\( n \\) values are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function to avoid brute-force methods. The solution handles edge cases where no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition and outputs the results in the required format.",
