    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (possibly overlapping).\n 3. We can consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates, but since the string length is small (<=100),\n    we can do the following:\n\n Approach:\n - We can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n - For a given length L, check all contiguous substrings of length L and record their frequency.\n - If any substring of length L appears at least twice, then the answer is L.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"longest substring\", so we want the maximum L for which there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the substring occurrences can overlap. Example: \"ababa\" -> substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2.\n\n Alternative approach:\n  We can use a set (or dictionary) to record all substrings and their starting indices? Actually, we don't need the indices, just the frequency.\n\n Steps for the straightforward method:\n  Let n = len(s)\n  We'll start with the maximum possible substring length (n-1) and go downwards until we find one that has at least two occurrences.\n\n  However, note: if we have a substring of length L that appears twice, then we don't need to check for longer ones because we are going from high to low.\n\n  But wait: what if the same substring of length L appears twice, then we return L. But note: it might be that a longer substring doesn't appear twice, but a shorter one does. However, we are looking for the longest.\n\n  Actually, we want the maximum L such that there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n  We can do:\n\n  for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n      seen = {}\n      for i in range(0, n - length + 1):\n          substr = s[i:i+length]\n          # We can use a set or a dictionary to count frequency, but note: we don't need to count more than 2.\n          # We can break early if we already found two of the same substring.\n          # Alternatively, we can use a set and if we see a substring that is already in the set, then we have found at least two.\n\n      But note: if we use a set, we cannot tell if we've seen the same substring multiple times. So we can use a dictionary or simply a set and then check if we've seen the substring before.\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          found = False\n          substr_occurrences = {}   # or set for distinct substrings, but we need to know frequency? Actually, we can break when we see a duplicate.\n          # Alternatively, we can use a set and if we encounter a substring that is already in the set, then we have found a duplicate.\n\n          seen_set = set()\n          for i in range(0, n-length+1):\n              substr = s[i:i+length]\n              if substr in seen_set:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen_set.add(substr)\n\n          if found:\n              print(length)\n              exit(0)\n\n  But wait: what if we have the same substring appearing more than twice? Then we break as soon as we see the second occurrence.\n\n  However, this method only checks for two occurrences. And we are starting from the longest. So the first length we find (from n-1 down) that has a duplicate is the answer.\n\n  But consider: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the first duplicate we meet. But note: we are iterating from left to right. The set will catch the second occurrence of the same substring.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the same substring might appear non-contiguously. Our set method works because we are storing every substring we've seen.\n\n  But what if the same substring appears twice, but not consecutively? The set will remember the first occurrence and then the second time we see it (anywhere) we break.\n\n  Example: \"ababa\", for length=3: \n      i=0: \"aba\" -> add\n      i=1: \"bab\" -> add\n      i=2: \"aba\" -> already in set -> found.\n\n  This works.\n\n  However, we must consider: what if the same substring appears exactly twice? Then we break at the second occurrence.\n\n  But what if the same substring appears more than twice? Then we break at the second occurrence, which is acceptable because we only require at least two.\n\n  But wait: what if the substring appears twice but we don't see the second occurrence until later? Then we break at the second occurrence.\n\n  However, we are iterating from the beginning. So if the same substring appears at the beginning and then again later, we will break at the second occurrence.\n\n  But note: the set records every substring. So if the same substring appears again, we break.\n\n  But there's an issue: what if the substring appears twice but the first occurrence is not stored because we break earlier? Actually, no: we store the first occurrence and then when we see the same substring again we break.\n\n  However, we must consider: what if the same substring appears in two different ways? Actually, no: the substring is defined by its content.\n\n  But what about the empty substring? The problem states non-empty string, and we are starting from n-1 down to 1, so we skip the full string (unless n==1, then n-1=0, but then we start from 0? Actually, we start from n-1 (which is 0 for n=1) and then go down to 1, so for n=1 we don't enter the inner loop because length=0: n-1+1=1, so we iterate from i=0 to 0 (if length=0, then substring is s[0:0] which is empty). \n\n  But the problem: the string is non-empty and length>=1. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice. For a string of length 1, there is no substring of length>=1 that appears twice (because we have only one character). So the answer for a string of length 1 is 0.\n\n  According to the example: Input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> Output [0,3,2]\n\n  Let's test with \"abcd\": \n      n=4, we check from length=3 down to 1.\n        length=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate -> continue\n        length=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate -> continue\n        length=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate -> so we don't find any. Then we break and output nothing? \n\n  We must output 0 in that case.\n\n  So we can structure the code as:\n\n      n = len(s)\n      # We are going to check from max_length = n-1 down to 1.\n      found = False\n      for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  print(L)\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n          if found:\n              break\n\n      if not found:\n          print(0)\n\n  However, consider the case of \"aaa\": \n      n=3\n      Check L=2: substrings: \"aa\", \"aa\" -> duplicate found, so output 2.\n\n  But wait, the example \"zzz\": \n      n=3, check L=2: substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n  This matches the example.\n\n  Another example: \"ababa\"\n      n=5, check L=4: \n          substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate -> next L=3\n          substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> duplicate found (the last substring is \"aba\", which was seen at i=0) -> output 3.\n\n  Example \"abcd\": no duplicate for any L from 3 down to 1, so output 0.\n\n  But wait, what about the empty substring? Our method does not consider the empty substring because we are starting from n-1 (which is 3 for n=4) down to 1. The empty substring would be of length 0, and we don't check that.\n\n  The problem says: the string is non-empty, and we are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice. The empty substring is not allowed because the problem does not specify, but note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring would appear infinitely many times? However, the problem says \"substring\", and typically we consider non-empty substrings unless specified otherwise. But note: the example outputs 0 for \"abcd\", meaning that even the empty substring isn't counted? Actually, the problem says \"longest substring\", and the empty substring has length 0, but the problem also says that the string is non-empty. \n\n  However, the problem does not explicitly state that the substring must be non-empty. But note: the sample output for \"abcd\" is 0. So we must output 0 when no non-empty substring (and even the empty substring?) appears at least twice? Actually, the empty substring always appears infinitely many times, so then why is the answer 0 for \"abcd\"? \n\n  Let me read the problem statement: \"find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n  The empty substring is a substring, and it is met at least twice (in fact, many times). Then the answer for \"abcd\" should be 0, but note: the problem says \"longest\". The empty substring has length 0, and if there is no non-empty substring that appears twice, then 0 is the answer.\n\n  However, our algorithm does not consider the empty substring because we start from n-1 (which is 3 for \"abcd\") down to 1. We never check length 0.\n\n  Therefore, we must consider the empty substring? But the problem says the string is non-empty, but that doesn't prevent the empty substring from being present.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"substring\", and the empty substring is a valid substring. However, the problem examples: \n      Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n  In the example, \"abcd\" gives 0. This 0 corresponds to the empty substring? Or is the problem implying non-empty substrings?\n\n  Let me re-read: \"longest substring\". The empty substring is a substring. But note: the problem does not specify non-empty. However, the sample outputs: \n      \"abcd\" -> 0, meaning that the longest substring that appears at least twice is the empty substring (length 0).\n\n  But wait, is the empty substring considered to appear at least twice? Yes, because it appears at every index (each empty substring is at the boundary between characters). Actually, the empty substring appears n+1 times in a string of length n.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"These occurrences can overlap\". The empty substring can be overlapped arbitrarily. \n\n  But the problem says \"substring\", and in computer science, sometimes substring is defined to be contiguous and non-empty. However, the problem statement does not specify.\n\n  Looking at the examples: \n      Input: \"abcd\" -> output 0.\n\n  This implies that the empty substring is allowed and is the answer when no non-empty substring repeats.\n\n  So we must consider the empty substring.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty. The empty substring is always present (with length 0) and appears at least twice (actually n+1 times). Therefore, the answer for every non-empty string is at least 0.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring appears n+1 times, which is at least twice (for n>=1, n+1>=2). \n\n  Then the answer for every string would be at least 0. And we are to find the longest. \n\n  However, the example \"abcd\" gives 0, meaning that the empty substring is the longest? Actually, no: we are to find the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice. The empty substring has length 0, and if there is a non-empty substring that appears twice, then that non-empty substring (with positive length) would be longer.\n\n  So the algorithm above does not consider the empty substring. Therefore, we must account for the empty substring separately.\n\n  But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't need to worry about empty string.\n\n  How can we include the empty substring? \n\n  We can consider that the empty substring has length 0 and appears at least twice. So the answer is at least 0.\n\n  However, we are checking from the maximum length (n-1) down to 1. We never check length 0.\n\n  We can change the loop to go from n down to 1? Actually, the maximum length of a substring is n (the whole string). But the whole string as a substring: if we take the whole string, then we are looking for two identical whole strings. \n\n  But note: the substring must appear at least twice. So if the whole string appears twice, then the entire string is repeated. But in a string of length n, the whole string appears only once (unless the string is periodic? Actually, no: we are considering contiguous substrings. The whole string is one contiguous substring. The next one would start at index0 and index1? No, the next occurrence would have to start at index0 and index1? But the substring of length n starting at index0 is the entire string, and the substring of length n starting at index1 is the rest of the string (if any) but that is shorter. Actually, the substring of length n is only one: from index0 to n-1.\n\n  So we can check from L = n down to 0? Actually, the maximum length is n, but the substring of length n appears only once (unless the string is empty, but the string is non-empty). So we don't need to check n.\n\n  Actually, the maximum length we can have for a substring that appears at least twice is n-1 (because two identical substrings of length n would require two copies of the entire string, but we don't have two starting positions for the entire string in a string of length n). \n\n  But wait: the entire string is of length n, and we can have two occurrences only if the string is periodic? Actually, no: the entire string is fixed and we are taking contiguous parts. The entire string can only start at index0. There is no other starting index for a substring of length n (because the next one would require at least n characters, and we have only n characters, so the next one would start at index1 and require n characters, but then we need n characters from index1 to the end, which is only n-1 characters if the string is of length n). \n\n  Therefore, the maximum length we need to check is n-1.\n\n  But then how do we account for the empty substring? We are not checking length 0.\n\n  We can modify the loop to go from n-1 down to 0.\n\n  Then:\n\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):   # This is not right because the maximum substring length is n, but we can't have two substrings of length n (unless n==0, but n>=1). So we start from n-1.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check for the empty substring separately.\n\n  Since the empty substring is always present (appearing n+1 times) and we are looking for the longest, we can do:\n\n      We know that if we find any positive length substring that appears twice, then we return that length (since we are going from high to low). Otherwise, we return 0.\n\n  But note: the empty substring is of length 0, and it is always present. So the answer is 0 if no positive length substring appears twice.\n\n  Our current algorithm does not check for length 0, but if we extend the loop to include 0, then:\n\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):   # from n-1 down to 0\n\n  Then for \"abcd\":\n      We check L=3,2,1,0.\n      For L=0: \n          substring = s[i:i+0] for every i from 0 to n (but actually, the substring of length 0 is the empty string, and we have n+1 of them). \n          We will see the same empty string repeatedly.\n\n          However, the set will initially be empty. Then we add the first empty string. Then the next one: we try to add the empty string again, but it's already there? Actually, we break when we see a duplicate.\n\n          But wait, the first empty string is added. The second empty string (from i=1) is the same as the first? Yes. So we break and output 0.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"longest substring\". The empty substring is length 0, and if we break at 0, then we return 0. But if we found a longer substring (like in \"ababa\", we break at 3) then we return 3.\n\n  However, we are iterating from the highest possible (n-1) down to 0. So if we find a duplicate at a higher length, we return that and don't check lower. Only if we don't find any duplicate for positive lengths, we then check length 0 and return 0.\n\n  But wait, the problem says the empty substring is allowed. And we want the longest. The empty substring is the fallback.\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify non-empty, so we must consider the empty substring.\n\n  However, the example \"abcd\" returns 0, which is the empty substring. \n\n  But let me think: is the empty substring really a substring that can be met at least twice? Yes. \n\n  But the problem says \"substring\", and in many definitions, substring can be empty. \n\n  However, the problem statement does not explicitly say non-empty, so we must consider empty.\n\n  But note: the sample input \"zzz\" returns 2. The empty substring would be of length 0, but we found a substring of length 2 which is longer, so we return 2.\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n      n = len(s)\n      # We consider substring lengths from n-1 down to 0.\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          duplicate_found = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  print(L)\n                  return   # or break out and then exit\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n\n      # If we didn't find any duplicate in the above loop, then we output 0. But wait, the above loop includes L=0 and we break if we find a duplicate at L=0. So if we finish the loop without breaking, then no substring (including empty) was duplicated? Actually, the empty substring is duplicated because we see the same empty substring multiple times.\n\n      However, wait: the empty substring: \n          For L=0, the substring is \"\" (empty string). \n          We start with an empty set. Then we take i from 0 to n (n-L+1 = n+1 times). \n          First i: substr = s[0:0] = \"\", then we check: is \"\" in seen? Initially, no -> add to seen.\n          Second i: substr = s[1:1] = \"\" (if L=0, then from i to i, which is empty). Then we check: is \"\" in seen? Yes -> duplicate found -> print 0 and break.\n\n      Therefore, we don't need the separate handling. The loop for L=0 will always break and return 0? \n\n      But wait: what if the string is empty? The problem says non-empty, so we don't have to worry.\n\n      However, consider: the string of length 1, say \"a\". Then n=1.\n        We check L from 0 to 0 (since n-1=0, so we only check L=0).\n        Then we look at substrings of length 0: \n            i from 0 to 1 (n-L+1 = 1+1 = 2) -> two empty substrings.\n            First: add \"\" -> seen = {\"\"}\n            Second: check if \"\" is in seen -> yes -> print 0 and break.\n\n      This is correct.\n\n      But wait: the problem says the string is non-empty, but we are including the empty substring. \n\n      However, the problem's sample outputs: \n          ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> [0,3,2]\n\n      Our algorithm for \"abcd\" (n=4) will check from L=3 down to 0. \n          L=3: no duplicate -> move on\n          L=2: no duplicate -> move on\n          L=1: no duplicate -> move on\n          L=0: duplicate found -> output 0.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      But wait, what if we have a string of length 0? The problem says non-empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\n  However, note: the above algorithm for L=0: \n        We are generating substrings of length 0. The substring of length 0 is the empty string, and there are n+1 such substrings (from index0 to n-1, and also at the end? Actually, from i=0 to i=n (because n-L+1 = n+1)). \n\n        The empty substring is the same for every i.\n\n  Therefore, we can write the code as:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      # If the string is empty, then n=0, but the problem says non-empty, so we assume n>=1.\n\n      # We'll iterate from L = n-1 down to 0.\n      # But note: the maximum length we can have for a substring that appears twice is n-1, and the minimum is 0.\n\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  print(L)\n                  exit(0)   # or break out and then print?\n              seen.add(substr)\n\n      # We should not get here because L=0 always has duplicates, so we always print something.\n      # But if we don't break, then we print nothing. So we can also do:\n\n      # Actually, we break at the first duplicate we find. And the empty substring (L=0) always has duplicates.\n\n      However, note: the above inner loop for L=0 will break at the second occurrence of the empty substring (i.e., after adding the first, the next one is duplicate). So we are safe.\n\n  But wait: what if the string is of length 0? The problem says non-empty, so we don't care.\n\n  However, let me test with \"a\" (n=1):\n      L from 0 to 0 (inclusive) -> L=0.\n      i from 0 to 1 (n-L+1 = 1+1 = 2)\n        i=0: substr = s[0:0] = \"\" -> not in seen -> add to seen.\n        i=1: substr = s[1:1] = \"\" -> in seen -> print 0.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"aa\" (n=2):\n      We check from L=1 down to 0.\n      L=1: \n          i=0: substr=\"a\" -> add\n          i=1: substr=\"a\" -> found duplicate -> print 1.\n\n      Then we don't check L=0.\n\n  This is correct because the longest substring that appears at least twice is \"a\" (length 1).\n\n  Another example: \"aaa\" (n=3)\n      Check L=2: \n          i=0: \"aa\" -> add\n          i=1: \"aa\" -> duplicate -> print 2.\n\n  Example: \"ababa\" (n=5) -> prints 3.\n\n  Example: \"abcd\" (n=4) -> prints 0.\n\n  Example: \"zzz\" (n=3) -> prints 2.\n\n  But wait, \"zzz\": \n      Check L=2 (n-1=2):\n          i=0: \"zz\" -> add\n          i=1: \"zz\" -> duplicate -> print 2.\n\n  It works.\n\n  However, note: the above algorithm uses a set for each length. Since the string length is at most 100, and the maximum L is 99, the worst-case inner loop runs about (n - L + 1) times, and the set operations are O(1) on average.\n\n  But note: the total work is the sum_{L from 0 to n-1} (n-L+1). That is about O(n^2) which is acceptable for n<=100 (max 100*101/2 ~ 5000 iterations).\n\n  However, we break as soon as we find a duplicate for a given L, so in many cases we don't complete the inner loop.\n\n  But worst-case: when there are no duplicates for any L (except L=0, which we break at the second occurrence) then we do:\n\n      For L from n-1 down to 1: we do (n-L+1) iterations, and for L=0: we do 2 iterations.\n\n      The total number of iterations is the sum_{L=0}^{n-1} (n-L+1) but for L from n-1 down to 1, and then 2 for L=0.\n\n      Actually, we are iterating from L=n-1 down to 0, and for each L we do:\n\n          number of substrings = n - L + 1.\n\n      So the total iterations is: \n          For L from 0 to n-1: (n - L + 1) = (n+1)*n - (0+1+...+(n-1)) = (n+1)*n - (n-1)*n/2\n\n      Which is O(n^2). For n=100, that's 101*100 - (99*100)//2 = 10100 - 4950 = 5150, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: we break early for a given L as soon as we find a duplicate. So worst-case is when there are no duplicates until L=0, then we do the full iteration for each L from n-1 down to 1, and then 2 for L=0.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use a dictionary to count the frequency of substrings for each length, but that would be similar.\n\n  However, the above algorithm is simple and meets the constraints.\n\n  One more edge: if the string is of length 1, then we only check L=0 (because n-1=0) and then we break.\n\n  Code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n\n      # If the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty, so we assume n>=1.\n\n      # We are going to check from L = n-1 down to 0.\n      # But note: if n==0, then we skip the loop and then output 0? But n>=1.\n\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  print(L)\n                  exit(0)\n              seen.add(substr)\n\n  However, we can also use a function and avoid exit(0) by using a flag.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          found_duplicate = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  found_duplicate = True\n                  break\n              seen.add(substr)\n          if found_duplicate:\n              ans = L\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n  But wait, what if we break at the first duplicate? Then we set ans = L and break the outer loop.\n\n  However, we are iterating from the largest L to the smallest, so the first duplicate we find is the largest possible L.\n\n  But note: we break the inner loop as soon as we find one duplicate for that L, then we break the outer loop. So we output the largest L for which a duplicate was found.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But note: the empty substring (L=0) is included. \n\n  However, we can also note: the problem says the string is non-empty, and the empty substring is always present (so we always have at least 0 as an answer). But if we break at a positive L, we don't need to check L=0.\n\n  The above code sets ans = L and breaks, so we output the largest L (from high to low) that has a duplicate.\n\n  But wait, what if we don't break the outer loop and continue to the next L? Actually, we break the outer loop.\n\n  This is efficient.\n\n  Let me test with \"abcd\": \n      n=4, L from 3 down to 0.\n      L=3: no duplicate -> continue (inner loop completes without breaking)\n      L=2: no duplicate -> continue\n      L=1: no duplicate -> continue\n      L=0: \n          i=0: substr=\"\" -> add\n          i=1: substr=\"\" -> duplicate -> set found_duplicate=True, break inner loop, then set ans=0, break outer loop -> output 0.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  But wait: the above code does not break the outer loop in the inner loop for L=0? Actually, we break the inner loop and then set ans=0 and break the outer loop.\n\n  However, we must consider: what if we don't break the outer loop? Then we would continue to the next L (but there is none, because L goes from 0 to -1, so we break the outer loop by the condition).\n\n  Actually, the outer loop runs for L from n-1 down to 0 (inclusive). Then we break the outer loop when we set ans and break.\n\n  But note: the above code uses a flag and breaks the inner loop, then sets ans and breaks the outer loop.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  print(L)\n                  return   # if we put this in a function, but we are not.\n\n  Since we are writing a script, we can do:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n\n      # If the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty, so we assume n>=1.\n\n      # We are going to check from L = n-1 down to 0.\n      # But note: if n==0, then we skip the loop and then output 0? But n>=1.\n\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  ans = L\n                  break\n              seen.add(substr)\n          if ans != 0:   # Actually, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop. But we set ans=L and then break the outer loop.\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n  But wait, the above sets ans and then breaks the outer loop. However, we break the inner loop and then check if ans !=0 to break the outer loop? Actually, we set ans and then break the inner loop, then break the outer loop.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break the outer loop immediately after setting ans.\n\n  Let me write it clearly:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  ans = L\n                  break   # break the inner loop\n              seen.add(substr)\n          else:\n              # This else corresponds to the inner loop finishing normally (without break)\n              continue\n          break   # break the outer loop if we broke the inner loop (i.e., found a duplicate)\n\n      print(ans)\n\n  This uses the for-else construct. The else clause of the inner loop runs only if the inner loop did not break. Then we continue to the next L. If the inner loop breaks (because we found a duplicate), then we break the outer loop.\n\n  But wait, we set ans = L and then break the inner loop, and then break the outer loop. Then we output ans.\n\n  However, note: we set ans = L and then break the outer loop, so we don't check the remaining L's.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But we can also do without the else:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          found = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  ans = L\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              seen.add(substr)\n          if found:\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n  This is clearer.\n\n  Let's choose this version.\n\n  However, note: we don't need to set ans to 0 initially, because if we break the outer loop, we output the L that we found. But if we don't break, then we output 0. Actually, in the case of no duplicate for any positive L, we fall through and output 0. But wait, what about the empty substring? We are checking L=0, and we break the inner loop for L=0 (because the empty substring is duplicated) and then break the outer loop, so we output 0.\n\n  However, the above code does not set ans for the empty substring. \n\n  Let me simulate for \"abcd\":\n\n      n=4, L from 3 down to 0.\n\n      L=3: no duplicate -> found remains False -> next L.\n      L=2: no duplicate -> found remains False -> next L.\n      L=1: no duplicate -> found remains False -> next L.\n      L=0: \n          i=0: substr=\"\" -> add to seen.\n          i=1: substr=\"\" -> found becomes True -> break inner loop, then break outer loop, and set ans=0.\n\n      Then we print 0.\n\n  But wait, we set ans=L (which is 0) and then break. Then we print 0.\n\n  Actually, in the code above, we set `ans = L` inside the inner loop. So for L=0, we set ans=0.\n\n  But what if we don't break the outer loop? Then we set ans to the last L that had a duplicate, which is the smallest L. But we break the outer loop as soon as we find a duplicate.\n\n  Actually, we break the outer loop immediately after the inner loop breaks (with found=True). So we set ans to the current L (which is the largest L that has a duplicate) and then break.\n\n  But wait, we are iterating from high to low. The first duplicate we find is the largest L. So we set ans to that L and break.\n\n  However, note: we set ans = L and then break the outer loop. So the value of ans is the L we just found.\n\n  But in the case of \"abcd\", we set ans=0 (when L=0) and break.\n\n  But wait, is 0 the largest L that has a duplicate? No, because we didn't check any positive L and they didn't have duplicates. Then 0 is the largest? Actually, we are iterating from 3 down to 0, so we check 3,2,1,0. The first duplicate we find is at L=0. But that means there was no duplicate for positive L, so the answer is 0.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But wait, what if we have a string that has a duplicate at L=0 and also at a positive L? Then we break at the positive L and set ans to that positive L, and then break the outer loop, so we don't set ans=0.\n\n  Example: \"aa\" (n=2) has duplicate at L=1 (the substring \"a\") and also at L=0. But we break at L=1 (the first duplicate we find, which is the largest) and set ans=1.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings where no such substring exists (in which case the answer is 0).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters that repeats at least once in the string. The solution must consider all possible substrings, from the longest to the shortest, and check for duplicates.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 0, we can efficiently determine the longest substring that appears at least twice. For each length, we check all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Iterating over substring lengths from the largest (n-1) down to 0.\n   - For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n   - Use a set to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is seen more than once, its length is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the string length. This is because for each possible substring length, we process up to n - L + 1 substrings, and L ranges from n-1 down to 0. Given the constraint that n â‰¤ 100, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nans = 0\nfor L in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    found = False\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            ans = L\n            found = True\n            break\n        seen.add(substr)\n    if found:\n        break\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest repeating substring found.\n3. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: The loop runs from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 0. For each length `L`, it checks all substrings of that length.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: Using a set `seen`, the algorithm checks if the current substring has been encountered before. If a duplicate is found, `ans` is set to `L`, and the loop breaks early to ensure the longest valid substring is found first.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all relevant lengths, the result stored in `ans` is printed, which is either the length of the longest repeating substring or 0 if no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
