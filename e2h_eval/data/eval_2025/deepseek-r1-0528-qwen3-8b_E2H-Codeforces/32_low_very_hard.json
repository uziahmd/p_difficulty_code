    "thought": "\n We are to remove exactly one element from the array and minimize the instability (max-min) of the resulting array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` with `n` elements. After removing one element, we have an array of `n-1` elements.\n\n The instability is defined as (max element in the remaining array) - (min element in the remaining array).\n\n We note that the entire array's min and max might change after removal.\n\n However, note that the min or max of the entire array might be the element we remove. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove the current global minimum -> then the new min might be the next smallest element, but the max remains the same (if the minimum was unique, otherwise there might be another minimum).\n Option 2: Remove the current global maximum -> then the new max might be the next largest element, but the min remains the same.\n\n But also note: sometimes the element we remove might not be the global min or max, but we still might change the min or max? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is not the global min, then the min remains the same (unless there are multiple mins and we remove one of them, then the min becomes the next smallest). Similarly for max.\n\n However, we cannot try all possibilities by brute force because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let the sorted array be `b`. Then the overall instability of the original array is `b[n-1] - b[0]`.\n\n When we remove an element, say at index i (in the sorted array), then the new instability would be:\n   If we remove an element that is the minimum, then the new min is `b[1]` (if we remove the first occurrence of the min) and the max remains `b[n-1]` (unless we remove the last occurrence of the min and the min is also the max, but note: we remove one element only). Similarly, if we remove an element that is the maximum, the new max is `b[n-2]` and the min remains `b[0]`.\n\n But note: the element we remove might be somewhere in the middle. Then the min and max of the entire array remain unchanged (because the smallest and largest values are still present). So the instability would still be `b[n-1]-b[0]`.\n\n Therefore, the only chance to reduce the instability is by removing either the global minimum or the global maximum (or possibly both, if we remove an element that is both min and max, but then we must consider the next available min and max).\n\n However, consider: we can remove any one element. The instability of the remaining array is:\n   = max(remaining) - min(remaining)\n\n How do we compute this without trying every removal?\n\n Note: The maximum of the remaining array is at least `b[n-1]` if we don't remove the maximum, but if we remove the maximum then it becomes `b[n-2]` (if the array has at least two distinct elements). Similarly, the minimum is at least `b[0]` if we don't remove the minimum, but if we remove the minimum then it becomes `b[1]`.\n\n So, we can consider two cases:\n\n Case 1: Removing the smallest element (which is `b[0]`). Then the new array has min = `b[1]` and max = `b[n-1]` (if we don't remove the maximum). But wait, what if the smallest element appears multiple times? Then even if we remove one occurrence, the minimum might still be `b[0]` (if there's another `b[0]`). So we cannot simply assume that removing one occurrence of the min increases the min.\n\n Actually, we need to know: after removing one element, the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n We can think of:\n\n   candidate1: Remove the first occurrence of the minimum. Then the new min is:\n        if there are multiple min, then the min remains `b[0]` (because we removed one, but there's still at least one left) unless we remove all min? No, we remove one. So the min becomes `b[0]` if there is at least one more `b[0]`, otherwise `b[1]`.\n   Similarly for max.\n\n But note: we don't know which element we remove. However, we can consider:\n\n   Let L be the list of numbers.\n\n   The instability when removing an element x is:\n        instability = max(L without x) - min(L without x)\n\n   We want the minimum over x.\n\n But enumerating each x is O(n) and each computation is O(n) so total O(n^2) which is too slow for n=10^5.\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Idea:\n\n   The instability of the entire array is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially reduce the instability if the removed element is either the current minimum or maximum of the array. If the removed element is not the minimum or maximum, the instability remains unchanged because the smallest and largest elements in the array are still present.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the new minimum and maximum after removing any element. The optimal solution involves checking the instability when the first element (smallest) or the last element (largest) is removed from the sorted array. The minimum instability among these scenarios will be our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - **Candidate Instabilities**: Calculate the instability for two cases:\n     - Removing the smallest element: The new instability is `b[n-1] - b[1]` (if the smallest element appears only once).\n     - Removing the largest element: The new instability is `b[n-2] - b[0]` (if the largest element appears only once).\n   - **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the array has all identical elements (instability becomes 0) or when the smallest or largest elements appear multiple times (the next smallest or largest must be considered).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    total_instability = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[0]\n    \n    if total_instability == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    candidate1 = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]\n    candidate2 = a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]\n    \n    result = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the array size is 2, the instability after removing any element will be zero (since the remaining single element's max and min are the same).\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[-1]`) elements.\n4. **Zero Instability Check**: If all elements are the same, the instability is zero regardless of removal.\n5. **Candidate Calculation**: Two candidates for the minimum instability are computed:\n   - **Candidate1**: Instability after removing the smallest element (assuming it's unique).\n   - **Candidate2**: Instability after removing the largest element (assuming it's unique).\n6. **Result**: The smaller of the two candidates is printed as the result, representing the minimal achievable instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to derive the solution in optimal time.",
