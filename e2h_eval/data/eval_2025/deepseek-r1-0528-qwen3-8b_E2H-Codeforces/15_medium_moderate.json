They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has 2^n teams. The playoff proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n). In the i-th phase (0-indexed? note: the string s index 0 corresponds to the first phase which has 2^(n-1) games) we have:\n   - If s[i] is '0', then in the corresponding matches, the team with the lower skill wins.\n   - If s[i] is '1', then the team with the higher skill wins.\n\n We are to find all integers x (which are team numbers from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is just a reordering of the skills 1 to 2^n) for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot iterate over all permutations because 2^n can be up to 2^18 = 262144, which is acceptable for n=18? But note: we have 2^n teams and the tournament structure is fixed. However, we need to check for each x whether there is a permutation that makes x win.\n\n Instead, let's think about the conditions under which a particular team x can win.\n\n The tournament is structured as a complete binary tree (with 2^n leaves). The games are played in rounds (phases) from the bottom up.\n\n In each game, the two teams are from two subtrees. The outcome of the game depends on the current phase's result (given by s).\n\n Let the entire set of teams be [1, 2, ..., 2^n]. We can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves (since the permutation p is arbitrary). However, the tournament bracket is fixed (the pairing in the first round is fixed: the first two teams are paired, next two, etc., and then the winners are paired in the next round according to the fixed pattern).\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the initial seeding beyond the fact that the first phase pairs consecutive teams. So the bracket is fixed: the initial bracket is:\n\n Round 1 (phase n, the last phase? Actually, the problem states: \n   \"in the first phase\" (i-th phase with i=0 meaning the first phase) has 2^(n-1) games, then the next phase 2^(n-2), etc.\n\n However, the problem says:\n   s[0] corresponds to the first phase (which has 2^(n-1) games) and so on until s[n-1] (the last phase) has 1 game.\n\n But wait: the total number of games is 2^n - 1. The phases: \n   Phase 1: 2^(n-1) games\n   Phase 2: 2^(n-2) games\n   ...\n   Phase n: 1 game\n\n So the string s has n characters, and the i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the (n-i)-th round? Actually, the problem says \"during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n So the first phase (index0) is the one with 2^(n-1) games (because n-i = n-0 = n, but wait: the phase has 2^(n-i) games? Actually, the problem says: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But note: i-th phase: when i=0, then 2^(n-0) = 2^n, but that would be the entire set of teams, and then the next phase would have 2^(n-1) games? \n\n Let me reread: \n   \"the tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games\"\n   \"first phase: split into pairs (so 2^(n-1) games)\"\n   Then the second phase: 2^(n-2) games, until the last phase (n-th phase) has 2^(0)=1 game.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n Wait: if i=0 (first phase) then the number of games is 2^(n-0) = 2^n? That doesn't match.\n\n Correction: the problem says \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\", but note that the first phase has 2^(n-1) games. \n\n Let me check: \n   The first phase: n=3, then 2^(3-1)=4 teams? Actually, no: wait, for n=3, the first phase has 2^(n-1) = 4? But wait, there are 8 teams. Then the first phase has 4 games (each game eliminates one, so 8 -> 4). Then the second phase has 2 games, and the third phase has 1.\n\n So the number of games in the i-th phase (0-indexed) should be 2^(n-1-i). \n\n But the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\". \n\n Actually, wait: \n   i=0: 2^(n-0) = 2^n -> that would be too many.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the i-th phase (counting from the first) is the one with 2^(n-i) games? But then for i=0, we get 2^n, which is more than the total number of teams.\n\n Let me read again: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But note: the tournament has n phases (from the first phase that reduces 2^n teams to 2^(n-1) and then n-1 more phases until one champion). So the total number of phases is n.\n\n The total games is 2^n - 1, which is also: \n   2^(n-1) + 2^(n-2) + ... + 1 = 2^n - 1.\n\n So the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games.\n\n Therefore, the problem statement says \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\" is incorrect. It should be 2^(n-1-i) games.\n\n But wait, the example input: \n   Input: \"3\\n101\"\n\n And output: \"4 5 6 7\"\n\n How does that work?\n\n Let me reframe: The problem says the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i) games? Actually, the example says n=3, so the first phase (i=0) has 2^(3-0)=8 games? But we only have 8 teams and 7 games.\n\n This is confusing. Let me look at the example: \n   Input: \"3\\n101\"\n\n According to the problem, the tournament has 8 teams. The string s is \"101\", so three characters.\n\n The first phase (i=0) has 2^(3-0)=8 games? Then the next phase (i=1) has 2^(3-1)=4 games, and then the third phase (i=2) has 2^(3-2)=2 games. But then the total games would be 8+4+2 = 14, which is not 7.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\" \n\n But wait, the bracket: \n   First phase: 2^(n-1) games (because we start with 2^n teams and each game eliminates one, so we need 2^n-1 games to have one winner, and the first phase alone has 2^(n-1) games). \n\n Then the second phase: 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n So the total games is 2^(n-1) + 2^(n-2) + ... + 1 = 2^n - 1.\n\n Therefore, the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games.\n\n The problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\" â€” that must be a typo. It should be 2^(n-1-i) games.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n Let me compare: \n   For the first phase (i=0): 2^(n-0)=2^n, but we know it should be 2^(n-1). \n\n Alternatively, maybe the indexing is off by one? \n\n Let me assume the problem meant: the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games.\n\n Then the example: n=3, i=0: 2^(3-1-0)=4, i=1: 2^(3-1-1)=2, i=2: 2^(3-1-2)=1. Then total games=4+2+1=7, which is correct.\n\n So we'll assume the problem intended to say \"the phase with 2^(n-1-i) games\".\n\n Now, how do we determine if a team x can win?\n\n We can use a recursive/dynamic programming approach or simulation of the tournament.\n\n However, note that the permutation p is arbitrary. We can assign the team x to any leaf we want, and assign the other teams arbitrarily. But the bracket is fixed: the first two teams (by initial ordering) play in the first round, then the next two, etc.\n\n But since we can assign the labels arbitrarily, we can choose which teams are in which part of the bracket.\n\n We need to check: for a fixed x, is there an assignment of the 2^n distinct skill levels (from 1 to 2^n) to the bracket such that x wins, and the outcomes of the games follow the rules given by s.\n\n Conditions for a game in a particular phase (with given rule):\n\n In a game between two teams a and b (with skills a and b, note: the actual numbers are distinct and from 1 to 2^n):\n\n   If the phase (at the node where this game occurs) has rule '1': then the higher skill wins.\n   If the phase has rule '0': then the lower skill wins.\n\n However, we can assign the other teams arbitrarily (but without repetition). The key is that we can choose the entire permutation arbitrarily.\n\n We can think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a game. The root is the final champion. The leaves are the teams.\n\n The condition for x to win is that along the path from the leaf (where x is placed) to the root, in every game that x participates, it must win. But note: we can assign the other teams arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and form the set {1,2,...,2^n} without x).\n\n However, the assignment of other teams must be consistent with the entire bracket. Moreover, the outcome of games that x does not participate in must be such that the winner of the subtree containing x is x.\n\n We can use a divide and conquer strategy:\n\n Let F(x, bracket) be whether x can win the bracket (a subtree). But note: the bracket is fixed in structure (always a complete binary tree of height n). However, the assignment of the other teams is arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n For a given phase (game) that x must win (if we are to continue), we can choose the opponents in the games that x plays and the outcomes of the other games arbitrarily (as long as the numbers are distinct and from 1 to 2^n). However, we must ensure that the entire set of numbers is used exactly once.\n\n Another idea: simulate the tournament from the root downward. But we are given the bracket structure (the order of the games) and the rules for each phase.\n\n However, note: the bracket is fixed (the pairing in the first round is the first two teams, then the next two, etc.). But we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n Observation: We can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. Therefore, we can assign x to any leaf. Then, for the rest of the bracket, we assign the remaining 2^n-1 numbers arbitrarily.\n\n The problem reduces to: for a fixed x, can we assign the other 2^n-1 numbers to the rest of the leaves such that:\n\n   For each phase (from the first round to the final round), the outcome of the games (which must be consistent with the rule) leads to x being the champion.\n\n How to check for a fixed x?\n\n We can use a bottom-up simulation. Consider the entire bracket. The bracket is a complete binary tree of height n (with 2^n leaves). The leaf for x is fixed. Then we have to assign the other numbers to the other leaves.\n\n The catch: the outcome of a game depends on the two numbers and the rule of the phase (if the rule is '1', then the larger number wins; if '0', then the smaller number wins).\n\n We need to ensure that in every game that x participates, x wins, and in every game that x does not participate, we can arrange the outcomes so that the winner of the entire bracket is x.\n\n However, note: even in a game that x does not participate, we must assign numbers appropriately so that the winner of that subtree (which will then meet x in a later round) is the appropriate team.\n\n But note: the rule for a phase is fixed for all the games in that phase. The phase is defined by the level (the depth of the game in the tree). The first phase (the first round) is the deepest (closest to the leaves). The last phase (the final) is the root.\n\n The problem: the rule for a phase (say the j-th phase from the bottom) is given by the j-th character in s (from left to right). Actually, the string s is given for the phases from first (largest depth) to last (smallest depth). \n\n But wait: the problem says the first phase (i=0) is the one with 2^(n-1) games (the first round). Then the next phase (i=1) is the next round, and so on.\n\n In the bracket, the first round (first phase) is the one with the highest depth (the leaves). Then the next round is the parent nodes, etc.\n\n So the rule for the first round is s[0], the rule for the second round is s[1], and so on until the final round (the root) is s[n-1].\n\n However, note: the final round (root) is the last phase (i=n-1) and the rule is s[n-1]. The problem says the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games. So the root is the last game (one game) and is the (n-1)-th phase.\n\n Now, we can consider the following:\n\n We need to assign the numbers 1 to 2^n to the leaves. The goal is to have x win the tournament.\n\n We can use a recursive function that, given a segment (a contiguous block of leaves in the bracket) and the rule for the round that this segment is going to be used (which is determined by the depth of the segment), and the set of available numbers, decides whether it is possible to assign numbers to the leaves in this segment such that the winner of the segment is a particular value (or at least, we don't care which, but we have to ensure that the winner of the entire bracket is x).\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the entire set of numbers is fixed (from 1 to 2^n). \n\n Alternatively, we can use a known method: the tournament bracket can be represented by a full binary tree. The outcome of the tournament is determined by the relative ordering of the teams in the entire set.\n\n But note: the rule changes per phase (round). \n\n Insight: We can consider the following: for a fixed x, we can try to see if we can arrange the bracket so that in every round, x wins. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Assign x to a leaf. But note: the bracket is fixed. The bracket has a fixed structure: the initial pairing is (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), ... (2^(n-1)*2-1, 2^(n-1)*2). \n\n However, we can assign the teams arbitrarily to the leaves. So we can choose which leaf to put x. \n\n But note: the bracket structure is fixed: the winners of the first round are then arranged in the next round: the winner of (1,2) plays the winner of (3,4) in the next round, then the winner of (5,6) plays (7,8), etc.\n\n Since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose any leaf for x. \n\n However, the outcome of the games that x does not play is determined by the rules and the assignment of the other numbers.\n\n How to check for a fixed x?\n\n We can use a simulation that goes from the bottom (the leaves) up to the root. But the assignment is arbitrary, so we can choose the numbers for the other leaves arbitrarily (from the set without x). \n\n We can use a two-step process:\n\n Step 1: Determine the minimal and maximal conditions for the numbers that must be present in the bracket for x to win.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy assignment: \n\n   - In the first round (phase0) that x participates, x must win. The rule for that phase is s[0]. \n        If s[0] is '1', then x must be the largest in its first round game (so the other team in the first round must be less than x).\n        If s[0] is '0', then x must be the smallest in its first round game.\n\n   - Then, in the next round (phase1) that x participates, the opponent will be the winner of the adjacent game (which was between two teams that are not x). The rule for phase1 is s[1]. \n\n   But note: the bracket structure: the first round has 2^(n-1) games. The next round has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n However, the entire bracket must be filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n (excluding x). \n\n We can use a known idea from problems like \"Determine the winner of a tournament bracket with variable strengths\" but with arbitrary assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a BFS or DFS over the tournament tree with state representing the set of numbers used and the current winner of a subtree. But the state space is too big.\n\n Another idea: \n\n   Let A be the set of all teams (numbers) except x. We need to assign A to the other leaves.\n\n   The condition for x to win is that:\n\n     In the first round (phase0) that x is involved: \n        Let the other team in that match be y. Then:\n            if s[0]=='1': then x > y\n            if s[0]=='0': then x < y\n\n     Then, in the next round (phase1) that x is involved, the opponent is the winner of the adjacent game (which is a game between two teams from the two adjacent groups). The rule for phase1 is s[1].\n\n     But note: the entire bracket is fixed. We can break the bracket into two halves: the half that contains x and the half that does not (if we are at the top level). \n\n However, we can use a recursive method that considers the entire bracket and the requirement for x to win.\n\n Let F(segment) be the set of numbers that must be present in the segment (the leaves) so that the winner of the segment (under the rules for the rounds that this segment goes through) can be forced to be a particular value (or set of values). But we are only concerned with x.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known approach for fixed bracket tournaments (like in the \"Bracket Sequence\" problems):\n\n   We know that the winner must be the maximum number if all games are won by the higher number, but here the rules change.\n\n But note: the rules change per phase. \n\n Another known idea: \n\n   The tournament can be seen as a series of comparisons. The outcome of the tournament for a fixed assignment is determined by the relative ordering of the numbers and the rules.\n\n However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we can choose the entire set of numbers arbitrarily (except that x is fixed and the rest are the other numbers). \n\n We can consider the following: \n\n   Let the entire set S = {1, 2, ..., 2^n} \\ {x}. \n\n   We need to assign the numbers in S to the other leaves.\n\n   The condition for x to win is that:\n\n     In the first round (phase0) that x plays, the opponent must be chosen appropriately (either very small or very large, depending on s[0]).\n\n     Then, in the subsequent rounds, the opponents (the winners of the adjacent subtrees) must be chosen appropriately.\n\n   We can use a greedy assignment from the bottom up:\n\n     We know the entire set of numbers. We can assign the smallest numbers to the parts of the bracket that x must beat with a '0' rule, and the largest numbers to the parts of the bracket that x must beat with a '1' rule.\n\n   However, we have to satisfy the entire bracket.\n\n   We can use a recursive function that, given a segment (a contiguous set of leaves in the bracket) and the rule for the rounds that apply to this segment (which is determined by the depth: the deeper the segment, the earlier the round), and the set of available numbers, returns whether it is possible to assign numbers to the leaves in this segment such that the winner of the segment is a specific number (we don't care which, but we have to ensure that the winner of the entire bracket is x).\n\n   But note: we are only interested in x. However, the entire bracket must be consistent.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: \n\n     We know the entire set of numbers. We can compute the necessary conditions for x to win.\n\n     Consider the path of x from the leaf to the root. There are n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), x must win. The rule for round i is s[i].\n\n     Additionally, in the rounds that x does not play (the other games in the same round), we must assign numbers such that the winners of the adjacent games (that lead to x's path) are appropriate.\n\n     Specifically, in round i (0-indexed), the bracket is divided into 2^(n-1-i) games. Each game is between two consecutive groups of 2^i teams (from the previous round). \n\n     However, the bracket is fixed. The first round (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, each between two consecutive teams (leaves). Then the next round (i=1) has 2^(n-2) games, each between two consecutive winners from the first round.\n\n     The structure of the bracket is:\n\n        Round 0: \n            Game0: leaf0 vs leaf1\n            Game1: leaf2 vs leaf3\n            Game2: leaf4 vs leaf5\n            ...\n\n        Round 1:\n            Game0: winner of Game0 and Game1 (from the first round) vs winner of Game2 and Game3 (from the first round)\n            Game1: winner of Game4 and Game5 vs winner of Game6 and Game7\n            ...\n\n        Round i: \n            The j-th game in round i is between the winner of the segment [j*2^i, (j+1)*2^i - 1] and the winner of the segment [j*2^i + 2^i, j*2^i + 2^i*2 - 1]?\n\n     Actually, the bracket is fixed: the initial leaves are numbered from 0 to 2^n-1. The first round: \n            game0: [0,1]\n            game1: [2,3]\n            game2: [4,5]\n            ...\n\n     Then the second round: \n            game0: [0,1,2,3] -> the winner of game0 and game1 (which are [0,1] and [2,3])\n            game1: [4,5,6,7] -> the winner of game2 and game3\n\n     Then the third round (if n>=3): \n            game0: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> the winner of game0 and game1 (from the second round)\n\n     We can see that the bracket is fixed: the winner of the left half and the right half meet.\n\n     Now, the condition for x to win is that:\n\n        In the first round (round0) that x participates, x must be assigned to a leaf and the opponent must be chosen according to s[0].\n\n        Then, in the next round, the opponent is the winner of the adjacent quarter (for n>=2). \n\n     How to assign the numbers to the entire bracket?\n\n     We can use a recursive function that, for a given segment (defined by [l, r] in the leaf indices) and the round index i (which is the phase index, so the rule is s[i]), and the set of available numbers, returns the set of numbers that can be the winner of that segment.\n\n     But note: the entire set of numbers is fixed. We are only allowed to use each once.\n\n     However, the state space is too large (2^(n) numbers) and we have 2^n leaves.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use a known fact: the tournament bracket can be solved by considering the necessary conditions on x and the available numbers.\n\n     We can use a greedy assignment from the bottom up:\n\n        We know that in the final (round n-1) we require that x wins. \n\n        Then, for the round n-2 (the penultimate round), the two teams that reach the final are x and another team (call it y). In round n-2, the rule is s[n-2]. \n\n        If s[n-2] is '1', then x must be greater than y to win that final game. \n        If s[n-2] is '0', then x must be less than y.\n\n        But wait, actually: in the final game (round n-1) the rule is s[n-1] (the last character). \n\n        The rounds are: \n          Round0: s[0]\n          Round1: s[1]\n          ...\n          Round n-1: s[n-1]\n\n        So the final game is the last round (round n-1) and the rule is s[n-1]. Therefore, in the final game, if s[n-1]=='1', then x must be the maximum of the two teams in the final. If s[n-1]=='0', then x must be the minimum.\n\n        Then, to reach the final, x must be the winner of its half of the bracket (the left half and the right half). \n\n        Similarly, in the semi-finals (round n-2) the rule is s[n-2]. \n\n        However, note: the rounds are from the first round (round0) to the final (round n-1). \n\n        The condition for x to win the tournament is:\n\n          For each round i (from 0 to n-1), the opponent that x faces in that round (if any) must be chosen according to the rule s[i].\n\n        But note: in round i, x might not face an opponent directly? Actually, x must face one opponent per round until the final.\n\n        The structure: \n\n          In round0, x is in a game (with one opponent). Then the winner advances to round1, and in round1, the opponent is the winner of the adjacent game (which is the next two games). \n\n        We can define the entire path for x. However, the assignment of the other numbers must be done consistently.\n\n     Another known idea: \n\n        We can consider the necessary range of numbers that must be present in the entire bracket for x to win.\n\n        Let M0 be the set of numbers that must be less than x (to be eliminated by x in the rounds where the rule is '0') and M1 the set of numbers that must be greater than x (to be eliminated by x in the rounds where the rule is '1').\n\n        However, note: in a round with rule '0', x must be the smallest in its immediate game. But what about the entire subtree? \n\n        Actually, we can use a two-array approach: \n\n          Let L[i] be the minimal set of numbers that must be less than x to be able to fill the entire bracket so that x wins.\n\n          Let G[i] be the minimal set of numbers that must be greater than x.\n\n        But note: the tournament has a fixed structure. The number of games in which x must eliminate an opponent is n (because x plays n games: one in each round from round0 to round n-1). \n\n        However, in the rounds where the rule is '0', x must eliminate one number (its direct opponent) that is less than x. In the rounds where the rule is '1', x must eliminate one number that is greater than x.\n\n        But wait: what about the entire subtree? In a round, x faces the winner of a subtree. So the entire subtree must be eliminated by x (directly or indirectly). \n\n        Actually, for a round i (0-indexed), the entire subtree that feeds into the opponent of x in that round must be eliminated by that opponent (if the rule is '0') or by x (if the rule is '1')? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n          In a given round i, x is playing against the winner of a particular subtree. The rule for that round is s[i]. \n\n          The condition for x to win that round is:\n\n            if s[i]=='1': then x must be greater than the opponent (the winner of the subtree).\n            if s[i]=='0': then x must be less than the opponent.\n\n          However, note: the entire subtree that feeds into the opponent has been played with the rule for the previous rounds (from round0 to round i-1). \n\n          But the rule for the rounds in the subtree is fixed: the j-th round in the entire tournament (from the bottom) has rule s[j]. \n\n          The subtree that feeds into the opponent of x in round i is a complete binary tree of height i (if we consider the entire tournament has height n). \n\n          In that subtree, the winner is determined by the rules s[0] to s[i-1]. \n\n          What are the constraints on the numbers in that subtree?\n\n          We can think: \n\n            For the opponent to be the winner of the subtree, the numbers in the subtree must satisfy the rules s[0] to s[i-1]. \n\n            Then, the condition for x to beat the opponent in round i is:\n\n                if s[i]=='1': x > opponent\n                if s[i]=='0': x < opponent\n\n          But note: the opponent is the winner of the subtree, which is determined by the rules. \n\n          How to relate the entire set of numbers? \n\n          We can use a known method from tournament bracket problems: \n\n            The tournament bracket can be solved by knowing the minimal and maximal numbers that can appear in the path of x.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a bit DP or a state machine that considers the entire set of numbers and the bracket.\n\n     After careful thought, there is a known solution for similar problems (like CodeForces problems) that use the following idea:\n\n        The team x can win if and only if:\n\n          Let k be the number of '1's in the string s (from index0 to index n-1). Then, the numbers that are greater than x must be at most k (because x must defeat those greater than x in the rounds that have rule '1'). Similarly, the numbers that are less than x must be at least (n - k) (because x must not be eliminated by a rule '0' and must be the smallest in the required games).\n\n        However, wait: \n\n          In each round i, if the rule is '1', then x must be greater than the opponent. But the opponent is the winner of a subtree. The winner of the subtree (for a round i) must be the maximum number in that subtree (if the rules in the subtree are all '1') or the minimum (if the rules in the subtree are all '0')? \n\n        Actually, the rules in the entire tournament are fixed. The rule for the j-th round (0-indexed) is s[j]. \n\n        The winner of a subtree of depth d (which goes through rounds 0 to d-1) is determined by the rules s[0] to s[d-1]. \n\n        Specifically, the winner of a subtree of depth d is:\n\n          - If the rules s[0..d-1] are all '1', then the winner is the maximum number in that subtree.\n          - If the rules s[0..d-1] are all '0', then the winner is the minimum number in that subtree.\n          - Otherwise, it is some number that satisfies the conditions imposed by the mixed rules.\n\n        But note: we can assign the numbers arbitrarily. So for a given subtree, we can choose any set of numbers (from the available ones) to be assigned to its leaves.\n\n        Now, consider the condition for x to win the entire tournament:\n\n          In round0, the first game: the opponent is a single number (from the adjacent leaf). The rule is s[0]. \n\n          Then, in round1, the opponent is the winner of a subtree of size 2 (two leaves). \n\n          The condition for round0: \n            if s[0]=='1', then x must be greater than the opponent (a number y0).\n            if s[0]=='0', then x must be less than y0.\n\n          Then, for round1: \n            if s[1]=='1', then x must be greater than the winner of the subtree (which is a number w1) that came from two leaves (so the two leaves are assigned two numbers, and the winner is determined by s[0] (which is the rule for the first round) and then the rule for the second round is s[1]? \n\n          Wait, no: the entire subtree for round1 uses the first round (s[0]) for its internal games and then the second round (s[1]) for the final game of the subtree.\n\n          But the rule for the first round (the first game in the subtree) is s[0] (which is the same as the first round of the entire tournament). \n\n          However, the entire tournament has a fixed set of rules for every round. The first round (round0) is used for every subtree that requires one round. \n\n        This suggests that the rules are applied uniformly for the entire tournament.\n\n        Therefore, the winner of a subtree of depth d (which uses rounds0 to rounds d-1) is determined by the rules s[0] to s[d-1] and the numbers assigned to the leaves of that subtree.\n\n        How to determine the winner of a subtree with rules r0, r1, ..., r_{d-1} and a set of numbers A (assigned to the leaves of the subtree)?\n\n        We can simulate the tournament within the subtree with the given rules and the set A.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves. \n\n        So the winner of the subtree is the number that can be forced to win by an appropriate assignment of A to the leaves, given the rules r0 to r_{d-1}. \n\n        However, we are trying to see if x can win the entire tournament, so we are free to assign the numbers arbitrarily (from the entire set excluding x) to the other leaves.\n\n        But then, for a given subtree (of depth d) that feeds into x in round d, we must assign a set of numbers A (of size 2^d) and then the winner of that subtree must be a number that satisfies:\n\n          if the rules for the subtree are all '1', then the winner is the maximum number in A.\n          if the rules for the subtree are all '0', then the winner is the minimum number in A.\n\n        What if the rules are mixed? \n\n        Example: a subtree of depth 2 (two rounds) with rules ['1','0'].\n\n          Round0 (first game): rule '1' -> the higher number wins.\n          Round1 (second game): rule '0' -> the lower number wins.\n\n          Then, the two leaves are assigned two numbers a and b.\n\n          First game: the winner is max(a,b).\n          Then, the second game: the winner plays against... but wait, a subtree of depth2 has two leaves? Actually, a subtree of depth d has 2^d leaves.\n\n          Let's clarify: \n\n            Depth0: 1 leaf -> trivial.\n            Depth1: 2 leaves -> one game.\n            Depth2: 4 leaves -> two rounds.\n\n          So for a subtree of depth2 (which is used in round1 of the entire tournament) has 4 leaves. The two rounds:\n\n            Round0 (within the subtree): two games (each of two leaves) with rule '1'.\n            Round1 (within the subtree): one game (between the two winners) with rule '0'.\n\n          Then, the winner is determined by:\n\n            Game0: max(a,b) and max(c,d) -> winners are w1 and w2.\n            Game1: min(w1, w2)\n\n          Therefore, the winner is the minimum of the two maxima.\n\n        In general, the winner of a subtree with rules r0, r1, ... , r_{d-1} and a set of numbers A (of size 2^d) is the number that can be forced to win by optimally assigning A to the leaves. But note: we can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which number goes where.\n\n        However, we are trying",
