For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of 3 notes separated by spaces. The notes are from the set: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n Since the circle is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute the distances.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (index in the list of 12 notes).\n    Let's define the order starting from C (0) to H (11).\n\n    Notes: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n 2. Given three notes, we need to check if they form a major or minor chord.\n\n    Conditions for major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones\n        distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones\n\n    Conditions for minor: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n        distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n    Note: The entire circle has 12 semitones, so the distance between two notes can be computed by:\n        Let a and b be the indices (0-11). Then the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but we want the smallest positive distance?\n        However, the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", and \"distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\".\n\n    But note: the example says the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Actually, if we have E (which is index 4) and C (index 0), then going from E to C in the upward direction (since the circle is cyclic) we can go E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: that's 8 semitones. Alternatively, we can compute the forward distance (without wrapping) and then take the minimum of the two directions? However, the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap around arbitrarily.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". In our example, when comparing E and C, we must consider the circularity. Actually, the problem states: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n    So, we have to consider the direction. We are allowed to traverse the circle in the forward direction (from lower to higher) without wrapping? Actually, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically, but the distance is defined from the lowest to the highest. However, the example of E to C is 8 because if we start at E and go up until we reach C (which is the same as the next C after H) then we cover 8 semitones.\n\n    How do we compute the distance from note a to note b?\n        Let base_notes = ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n        index_a = base_notes.index(a)\n        index_b = base_notes.index(b)\n\n        The forward distance (without wrapping) from a to b is (index_b - index_a) % 12, but if negative we adjust? Actually, we can compute:\n\n        distance_forward = (index_b - index_a) % 12   # This gives the distance in the positive direction, but note: if index_b < index_a, then (index_b - index_a) is negative, so modulo 12 might give a positive value? Actually, we want the smallest nonnegative distance in the forward direction (without going backward). However, the problem doesn't use the minimal distance but the distance from the lowest to the highest, which in a circle might require going through the end.\n\n        But note: the example says from E to C is 8, not 4 (because 12-4=8). So actually, we have two ways: \n          Option 1: Consider the circle and the distance from a to b is the smallest positive steps to get from a to b in the forward direction (without wrapping). However, in the example, from E to C: \n            Forward: E -> F -> F# -> G -> G# -> A -> B -> H -> C: that's 8 steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the distance from a to b as (index_b - index_a) % 12",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking the distances between the notes in all possible orderings to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale starting from C (0) to H (11).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each pair of notes, compute the distance in semitones. The distance from note A to note B is calculated as `(B - A) % 12` to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Chord Classification**: Check all permutations of the three notes to see if any ordering satisfies the conditions for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nbase_notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    return base_notes.index(note)\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in data]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    major_found = False\n    minor_found = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        total_d = (d1 + d2) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and total_d == 7:\n            major_found = True\n            \n        d1_alt = (a - b) % 12\n        d2_alt = (b - c) % 12\n        if d1_alt == 3 and d2_alt == 4:\n            minor_found = True\n            \n    if major_found:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif minor_found:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note to its corresponding index in the predefined list of notes.\n2. **Input Handling**: The `main` function reads the input, checks if there are exactly three notes, and converts them to their respective indices.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, the code checks if the distances between consecutive notes (in both directions) match the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n4. **Classification**: Based on the checks, the code prints \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if the chord does not meet either criterion.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the notes to classify the chord accurately, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes.",
