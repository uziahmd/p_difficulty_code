Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an initial string s and a number n of queries. Each query is \"di->ti\", meaning replace every occurrence of the digit di with ti.\n\n However, note that the replacements are done sequentially, and the same digit might be replaced multiple times (and also the replacement string may contain digits that are to be replaced again).\n\n But note: the total length of all ti is at most 10^5, and the initial string is up to 10^5, so we cannot do naive string replacements (which would be too slow and memory-consuming).\n\n Moreover, the problem requires to compute the number modulo 1000000007, but the resulting string after replacements can be very long (because one replacement might add more digits, and then those digits might be replaced again). However, the total length of all ti in queries is bounded by 10^5, but the same digit might appear in multiple queries and the replacements are done in order.\n\n Important: The problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5.\n\n But note: if we do the replacements naively, the string might become huge (since we are replacing one digit with a string, and then that string might have digits that are replaced, etc.). However, the constraints say that the total length of all ti is 10^5, but we are doing n (<=10^5) queries, each with a ti of certain length, and the total of these ti's is <=10^5.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to output the string, but the number modulo 10^9+7. And the number is formed by concatenating the digits (ignoring leading zeros, but note: the entire string might have leading zeros, but the problem says to ignore them only when representing as a decimal number? Actually, the problem states: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\n But note: the example input includes:\n   '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7' -> output 777\n\n Here, initially s = \"222\", then first query: replace '2' with '00' -> becomes \"00000\" (but wait, actually: each '2' is replaced by \"00\", so \"222\" becomes \"000000\", but then the next query: replace '0' with '7'. So the entire string becomes \"777777\". Then the number is 777777, which mod 1000000007 is 777777.\n\n However, note: the problem says to ignore leading zeros. But in this case, the entire string is zeros and then they are replaced by sevens. But the problem says: ignore leading zeros. But note: the number formed by the string is the usual decimal number, so leading zeros don't count. However, the example output is 777, which is 777777? Actually, wait: the example input is:\n\n Input: \n   ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n Output:\n   ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n The third sample output is '777', but the result should be 777777 (if we do two replacements) but then 777777 mod 1000000007 is 777777, not 777.\n\n Wait, let me check the sample: \n   Input: \"222\" and two queries: first \"2->00\", second \"0->7\"\n\n Step 1: Replace all '2' in \"222\" with \"00\": becomes \"00000\" (each '2' becomes \"00\", so three '2's become \"00\" repeated three times -> \"00000\")\n Step 2: Replace all '0' in \"00000\" with \"7\": becomes \"77777\"\n\n So the resulting string is \"77777\", which is the number 77777.\n\n But the sample output says 777.\n\n There seems to be a discrepancy. Let me read the sample input again:\n\n   Input: \n      ['222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to efficiently process a series of string replacement queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in handling the replacements without explicitly constructing potentially very large intermediate strings, which could be computationally expensive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in sequence (which could lead to exponentially large strings), we reverse the order of the queries. This allows us to handle each digit in the initial string by considering all transformations it might undergo through the queries.\n2. **Digit Transformation Tracking**: For each digit (0-9), we track its final form after all applicable transformations. This involves maintaining a mapping from each digit to its replacement string, but only if the replacement string itself doesn't contain any digits that have been transformed later in the reversed query order.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: While processing each digit's transformation, we compute the contribution of each segment of the resulting string to the final number modulo 1000000007. This involves calculating the value of each digit in its position, considering the length of the string segments it will produce.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        if \"->\" not in line:\n            continue\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        digit = parts[0].strip()\n        replacement = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((digit, replacement))\n    \n    rev_queries = list(reversed(queries))\n    \n    final_mapping = [None] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        final_mapping[i] = str(i)\n    \n    valid_digits = set(range(10))\n    for digit, rep in rev_queries:\n        d_int = int(digit)\n        if d_int not in valid_digits:\n            continue\n        if rep == '':\n            final_mapping[d_int] = ''\n            valid_digits.remove(d_int)\n            continue\n        \n        new_rep = ''\n        for char in rep:\n            c_int = int(char)\n            if c_int in valid_digits:\n                new_rep += final_mapping[c_int]\n            else:\n                new_rep += char\n        final_mapping[d_int] = new_rep\n        if d_int in valid_digits:\n            valid_digits.remove(d_int)\n    \n    def process_digit(d):\n        d_int = int(d)\n        if d_int not in valid_digits:\n            return d, 1\n        rep_str = final_mapping[d_int]\n        if rep_str == '':\n            return '', 0\n        return rep_str, len(rep_str)\n    \n    total_mod = 0\n    power = 1\n    current_power = 1\n    \n    for char in s:\n        rep_str, seg_len = process_digit(char)\n        if seg_len == 0:\n            continue\n        num_val = int(rep_str) % MOD if rep_str != '' else 0\n        if seg_len == 1:\n            total_mod = (total_mod + num_val * power) % MOD\n        else:\n            total_mod = (total_mod + (pow(10, seg_len - 1, MOD) * num_val + (int(rep_str[-1]) * (seg_len - 1)) % MOD * power) % MOD\n        power = (power * pow(10, seg_len, MOD)) % MOD\n\n    print(total_mod % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input. Each query is parsed into a tuple of the digit to be replaced and its replacement string.\n2. **Reversed Queries Processing**: The queries are processed in reverse order. For each digit, we determine its final replacement string by recursively applying transformations from later queries first. This ensures that all transformations are accounted for without building large intermediate strings.\n3. **Digit Processing**: Each digit in the original string is processed using the final mapping. The contribution of each digit's replacement string to the final number is calculated by considering its positional value (modulo 1000000007).\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution uses modular exponentiation to handle large numbers efficiently. The total value is computed by iterating through each character in the original string, applying the transformations, and accumulating the result modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging reverse processing of queries and modular arithmetic to avoid dealing with excessively large strings directly.",
