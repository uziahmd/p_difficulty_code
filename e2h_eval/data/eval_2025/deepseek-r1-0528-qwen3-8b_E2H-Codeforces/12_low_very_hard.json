The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise), we can think of the houses as arranged in a circle from 1 to n and then back to 1.\n\n The key observation: \n We start at house 1. Then we have to do the tasks in the given order. However, note that the condition says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that we must do the tasks in increasing index order (so the first task is the first, then the second, etc.). But the locations for the tasks are arbitrary.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to do the tasks in the order of the house numbers, but the order given by the input. But the condition is: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". This means we must complete the tasks in the order they are given.\n\n So, we start at 1, then go to a1, then from a1 to a2, then from a2 to a3, etc.\n\n But note: the ringroad is circular and clockwise. We can only move clockwise, so from house x we can go to x+1, or if x is n then next is 1.\n\n However, sometimes we might have to traverse the entire circle? Actually, we can also consider that moving from a higher number to a lower number would require going through the end (n) and then wrapping to 1 and then going up to the lower number? Actually, because it's a ringroad and one-way, the movement is always clockwise. So if we are at house x and want to go to house y:\n\n If x <= y: then we can go directly: distance = y - x.\n If x > y: then we have to go from x to n, then from n to 1, and then from 1 to y: distance = (n - x) + y.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the distance as: \n   If we are at current house `cur` and next task is at `a`, then the distance is:\n      if a >= cur: a - cur\n      else: n - cur + a\n\n But wait: what if we are at house 4 and n=4, and we want to go to house 1? Then according to above: 1 < 4 -> distance = 4-4+1 = 1. Correct.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Steps: \n     Start at 1 -> go to 3: \n          since 3>=1: distance = 3-1 = 2.\n     Then from 3 to 2: \n          since 2<3: distance = 4-3+2 = 1+2 = 3.\n     Then from 2 to 3: \n          since 3>2: distance = 3-2 = 1.\n     Total = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n But wait, the example output is 6.\n\n However, note: the example also says: \n        \"In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\"\n\n This implies that after finishing the first task (at 3), she doesn't stay at 3. She continues to 4 (to get ready for the next task at 2?) and then goes to 1, then 2, then 3 for the last task.\n\n Why is that? Because the condition says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", and then we do the next task. But note: the problem does not say that after completing a task we must be at that house until the next task requires being there. However, the problem says: \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\".\n\n The catch: actually, we don't necessarily have to break the journey at the task location? The problem says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". \n\n Let me re-read: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". This means that before starting the i-th task, she must have completed all tasks j < i, and she must be at house ai.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to wait at the task location until the next task is started. However, the movement is sequential. We start at 1. Then we must be at a1 (for the first task). Then from a1 we must be at a2 (for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete each task in the given order, moving from one house to another in the shortest possible path.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia moves only clockwise on a circular ringroad with `n` houses. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The challenge is to calculate the total time taken to complete all tasks by moving from the starting house (1) to each subsequent task location in the given order.\n2. **Insight**: The movement between two consecutive houses can be broken down into two cases:\n   - If the next task's house number is greater than or equal to the current house number, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the next task's house number is smaller, the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ringroad (`n`), then wrapping around to the beginning (house 1) and proceeding to the target house.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task location, compute the distance from the previous task's location (or the start) using the above conditions. Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks. This is optimal given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + a\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` is initialized to 0, representing the cumulative time taken. `current` is set to 1, the starting house.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a`:\n   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `current`, the time taken is the difference `a - current`.\n   - If `a` is less than `current`, the time taken is `n - current + a`, accounting for the circular nature of the ringroad.\n4. **Updating Position**: After processing each task, `current` is updated to `a` for the next iteration.\n5. **Output**: The total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular movement properties of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
