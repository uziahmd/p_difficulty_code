After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each containing a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. We need to find for each subject the maximum mark. Then, for each student, if in at least one subject they have the maximum mark (and note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum mark, so they are all considered best in that subject) then the student is successful.\n\n However, note: The problem states \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark\". So even if multiple students have the same highest mark, they are all best.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (column), we can find the maximum mark (as a character, but we can convert to int or keep as char since '9' > '8', etc.)\n\n Then, for each student i (row), we check: \n   For any subject j, is the mark of student i in subject j equal to the maximum mark of subject j?\n\n But note: if two students both have the maximum mark in a subject, then both are best in that subject, and each will get credit for that subject.\n\n However, we don't need to know the exact subject, just whether there exists at least one subject where the student has the maximum.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let's read the input.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n We can represent the gradebook as a list of strings, or a 2D list of characters.\n\n Steps in code:\n\n 1. Parse the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines.\n\n 3. Find the maximum mark for each subject (each column). We can do this by iterating over columns and then rows.\n\n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n))\n        max_marks.append(col_max)\n\n 4. Now, for each student (each row i), check if there exists at least one j (subject) such that gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n 5. Count the number of students for which the above condition holds.\n\n However, note: what if a subject has multiple maximums? That's okay because we are only checking existence.\n\n Example with sample: \n   Input: \n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   Gradebook as list of strings:\n      ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   Columns (each column j from 0 to 2):\n\n     j=0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n     j=1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n     j=2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for student0: \"223\"\n      j0: '2' == '2' -> True, so student0 is successful.\n\n   Student1: \"232\"\n      j0: '2' == '2' -> True, so successful.\n\n   Student2: \"112\"\n      j0: '1' != '2' -> skip\n      j1: '1' != '3' -> skip\n      j2: '2' != '3' -> skip -> not successful.\n\n   So count = 2.\n\n But wait! The example output is 2.\n\n However, note the example input provided in the problem is given as a string: \n   Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   And outputs: ['2', '3']\n\n Let's check the second example:\n\n   Input: \n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n   We need to compute the maximum per column (each subject):\n\n   Subject0: [ '9','1','1'] -> max '9'\n   Subject1: [ '1','1','1'] -> max '1'\n   Subject2: [ '7','8','1'] -> max '8'\n   Subject3: [ '2','2','1'] -> max '2'\n   Subject4: [ '8','8','1'] -> max '8'\n\n   Now check each student:\n\n   Student0: \"91728\"\n      subject0: '9' == '9' -> True -> successful.\n\n   Student1: \"11828\"\n      subject0: '1' != '9' -> False\n      subject1: '1'",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks across m subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student in that subject.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        gradebook.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n        \n    count_success = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_success += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_success)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The script reads all input lines at once and splits them into individual lines. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the script collects all marks from each student and determines the maximum mark in that subject.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the script checks if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful, and we move to the next student without rechecking other subjects (using `break` for efficiency).\n4. **Output**: The total number of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects, leveraging column-wise maximum calculations to determine success criteria. The solution handles edge cases such as all students having the same marks or no students being successful.",
