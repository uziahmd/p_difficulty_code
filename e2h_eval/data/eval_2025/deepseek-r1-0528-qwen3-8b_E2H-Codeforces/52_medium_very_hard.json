Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a burned candle.\n   - We can use 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n Steps:\n   We start with 'a' candles. We burn them all (each gives 1 hour) and then we have 'a' burned candles.\n   Then, we can convert some burned candles into new ones: specifically, we can make floor(a / b) new candles from the burned ones, and we are left with a % b burned candles.\n\n However, note that the new candles we made can also be burned and then they too will become burned candles that can be used to make more.\n\n So the total hours = initial candles (a) + the hours from the recycled candles.\n\n But note: when we burn the recycled candles, we get additional burned candles which can be used again.\n\n We can simulate:\n   Let `candles = a`\n   Let `burned = 0`\n   Total_hours = 0\n\n However, we can also think mathematically:\n\n   total_hours = a  [because we use the initial a candles]\n   Then, we have a burned candles, which we can turn into floor(a/b) new candles, so we get floor(a/b) extra burning hours.\n\n   Now, after burning these floor(a/b) candles, we have burned those and now we have the leftover from the first conversion (a % b) plus the burned from the new candles (which is floor(a/b)), so we can make floor((a//b + a % b) / b) new candles? \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   while current_candles >= b:\n        total += current_candles // b   # This is the number of new candles we can make, but wait: actually we can burn all the current_candles and then use the burned ones?\n        Actually, let's break down:\n\n   But note: the problem is that we can use the burned candles to make more candles, and then burn those too.\n\n   Another approach: we know that every time we have at least 'b' burned candles, we can make one more candle.\n\n   We start by having 'a' candles, which we burn and get 'a' burned candles. Then we can make a//b new candles and have a % b leftovers.\n\n   Then we burn the new candles (which gives a//b hours) and we now have (a % b + a//b) burned candles.\n\n   Then we can make (a//b + a % b) // b new candles and have (a//b + a % b) % b leftovers.\n\n   We continue until we don't have enough to make a candle.\n\n   However, note: we are burning candles in groups. The entire process is:\n\n      total_hours = 0\n      current = a\n      while current >= b:\n          # Burn as many as we have (all of them) -> each gives 1 hour, so we add current\n          total_hours += current\n          # Then, we have 'current' burned candles. We can convert floor(current / b) of them to new candles, and we are left with current % b.\n          current = current // b + current % b\n\n      Then, after the loop, if current is less than b, we can only burn current candles (if any) and not make any more.\n\n      But wait: in the loop we already burned the current candles (so the last set of candles we burn is the last iteration). Then we break.\n\n      However, consider: in the loop we are burning the current candles and then recycling. But note: the initial a candles are burned in the first step, and then we get new candles from the burned ones.\n\n      But our total_hours in the first iteration adds 'a', then we set current to a//b + a % b. Then in the next iteration, we add (a//b + a % b) and then update again.\n\n      However, we are missing the fact that the last set of candles we burn is the one that we break out of. And that last set is burned, but we don't use the leftovers to make more because current < b.\n\n      So the above while loop counts the burning of the candles we have at the beginning of each cycle.\n\n      Example: a=4, b=2\n          Start: current = 4\n          Iteration1: \n              total_hours += 4 -> 4\n              current = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2 + 0 = 2\n          Iteration2:\n              total_hours += 2 -> 6\n              current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1 + 0 = 1\n          Then break. total_hours=6, but expected is 7.\n\n      Why 7? Because in the example, the process is:\n          Hours 1-4: burn 4 candles -> 4 hours, then we have 4 burned.\n          Then we make 4//2 = 2 new candles and burn them (hours 5 and 6) -> 2 hours, then we have 2 burned from these 2, which makes 2//2=1 new candle (from the 2 burned) -> burn that one for hour 7.\n\n      So we missed the last candle.\n\n      How does the example work? After the second iteration, we have 1 candle (from the previous leftovers). We can burn that one, but our loop condition requires current>=b (which is 2) to enter the loop. So we break and don't burn the last candle.\n\n      But note: the last candle is burned without needing to make it from burned ones? Actually, the last candle is made from the burned ones of the previous set, but we didn't account for burning it.\n\n      Alternatively, we can think: we burn a candle and then we have a burned candle. We can use burned candles to make new ones, but the burning process is separate.\n\n      Another way: total hours = a + floor((a-1)/b) * (something) ? Not exactly.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      total = a   # because we start by burning a candles\n      remaining = a   # the number of burned candles we have initially\n\n      Then, while remaining >= b:\n          new_candles = remaining // b\n          remaining = remaining % b + new_candles   # because the new_candles will burn and become burned, so we need to account for that.\n\n          total += new_candles\n\n      But wait, in the example: \n          a=4, b=2\n          total = 4\n          remaining = 4\n          First iteration: \n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2\n            remaining = 4%2 + 2 = 0+2 = 2\n            total = 4+2 = 6\n          Second iteration:\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n            remaining = 2%2 + 1 = 0+1 = 1\n            total = 6+1 = 7\n\n      Then we break because remaining=1 < 2.\n\n      This matches the example.\n\n      However, let's check the second example: Input \"6 3\" -> Output \"8\"\n\n          a=6, b=3\n          total = 6\n          remaining = 6\n          Iteration1:\n            new_candles = 6//3 = 2\n            remaining = 6%3 + 2 = 0+2 = 2\n            total = 6+2 = 8\n          Then break because 2 < 3.\n\n      So this gives 8, which is correct.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Read a and b.\n        If a == 0: print(0)\n        Else:\n            total = a\n            remaining = a\n            while remaining >= b:\n                new_candles = remaining // b\n                remaining = remaining % b + new_candles\n                total += new_candles\n\n            Print(total)\n\n      However, note: the condition is remaining>=b. In the example above, we break when remaining < b.\n\n      But wait: what if we have remaining that is less than b? Then we cannot make a new candle, so we stop.\n\n      This algorithm seems correct.\n\n      Let's test with another example: a=1, b=2 -> output 1 (correct, because we only have one candle and cannot make a new one from 1 burned candle).\n\n      Example: a=10, b=5\n          total = 10\n          remaining = 10\n          Iteration1: new_candles = 10//5 = 2, remaining = 0 + 2 = 2 -> total=12\n          Then 2 < 5 -> break. So 12 hours.\n\n          Let's verify: \n            Burn 10 candles -> 10 hours, then we have 10 burned -> make 2 candles (each burns for 1 hour) -> 2 more hours, then from the 2 burned candles (from the 2 candles we just burned) we cannot make a new one (since 2<5). So total 12.\n\n      Example: a=10, b=3\n          total = 10\n          remaining = 10\n          Iteration1: new_candles = 10//3 = 3, remaining = 1 + 3 = 4 -> total=13\n          Iteration2: new_candles = 4//3 = 1, remaining = 1 + 1 = 2 -> total=14\n          Then break.\n\n          Let's verify: \n            Hour 1-10: burn 10 candles -> 10 hours, then we have 10 burned -> make 3 new candles (using 9 burned, leaving 1) -> burn 3 candles: hours 11-13 -> 3 hours, then we have 1 (leftover) + 3 (burned from the new) = 4 burned.\n            Then we make 4//3 = 1 new candle, and we have 1 leftover -> burn that one: hour 14. Then we have 1 burned from that, so total burned becomes 1 (from the last candle) but we don't have enough to make another candle. So total 14.\n\n      Therefore, the code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n\n            # If there are no candles, then 0 hours.\n            if a == 0:\n                print(0)\n                exit(0)\n\n            total = a\n            remaining = a\n\n            while remaining >= b:\n                new_candles = remaining // b\n                remaining = remaining % b + new_candles\n                total += new_candles\n\n            print(total)\n\n      However, note: the problem says the input has two integers. We can assume one line with two integers.\n\n      But wait: what if b==1? Then we can make an infinite number of candles? But the problem states: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\", and b>=2. So we don't have to worry about b=1.\n\n      According to the problem: \"2 ≤ b ≤ 1000\"\n\n      So we are safe.\n\n      Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"4 2\" -> 7\n        Example 2: \"6 3\" -> 8\n\n      The code produces 7 and 8 respectively.\n\n      So we write the code accordingly.\n\n      Note: There's an alternative mathematical formula, but simulation is straightforward and efficient because a and b are at most 1000, so the number of iterations is logarithmic (base b) of a, which is very small.\n\n      Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, considering that he can recycle burned-out candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour and produces one burned-out candle. These burned-out candles can be combined to create new candles, which in turn can be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial number of candles, `a`, which directly contributes `a` hours of light.\n2. **Recycling Process**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` burned-out candles. We can convert these into new candles at a rate of `b` burned-out candles per new candle. The number of new candles created is `a // b`, and the remaining burned-out candles after conversion is `a % b`.\n3. **Iterative Burning**: The new candles can be burned, adding their count to the total hours. The process repeats with the new candles (now treated as the initial set) until the number of burned-out candles is insufficient to create any more new candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the remaining burned-out candles are fewer than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made. The total hours accumulated during each burning phase give the final answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total = a\n    remaining = a\n    \n    while remaining >= b:\n        new_candles = remaining // b\n        remaining = remaining % b + new_candles\n        total += new_candles\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new candle).\n2. **Initial Total Hours**: The initial total hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Recycling Loop**: While there are enough burned-out candles (`remaining >= b`) to make new candles:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles (`new_candles`) as `remaining // b`.\n   - Update the remaining burned-out candles to `remaining % b + new_candles` (the remainder from division plus the new candles just created, which will burn and become burned-out later).\n   - Add the new candles' burning time (`new_candles`) to the total hours.\n4. **Output**: Once the loop exits, print the total hours, which includes all initial and recycled candles' burning times.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources to maximize the total burning time. The loop runs in logarithmic time relative to the initial number of candles, making it both time and space efficient.",
