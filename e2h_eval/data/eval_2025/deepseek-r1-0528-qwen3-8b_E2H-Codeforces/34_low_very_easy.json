And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray of length k (each representing a week) and compute the average for each week.\n Then, we need to compute the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However, note: There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n\n The naive approach would be to compute the sum for each of the (n-k+1) windows and then average them.\n But note: The overall average is the total sum of all sleep times in all weeks divided by the number of weeks.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Let S = sum of all elements in the array from index 0 to n-1.\n\n But wait: Each week is k consecutive days. The first week uses indices 0 to k-1, the next from 1 to k, etc.\n\n How many times is each day used?\n   Day i (0-indexed) is used in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) [but easier: the day i appears in (k) consecutive windows? Actually, the day i appears in (n - k + 1) windows only if the window starts from i - k + 1 to i? Actually, the day i is included in windows that start from 0 to i (if i < k-1 then from 0 to i, but wait) or more precisely:\n\n   The window starting at j includes day i if and only if j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, i.e., j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n   And j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). So the number of windows that include day i is:\n      If i < k: then from j=0 to j=i -> i+1 windows.\n      If i >= k: then from j=i-k+1 to j=n-k? Actually, j must satisfy: j <= i and j>=0 and j<=n-k and j>=i-k+1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can say: the day i is included in (min(i, k-1) + min(n-i, k)) + 1? Actually, we can compute:\n\n   The number of windows containing day i is: \n        left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right_bound = min(n-k, i)   -> actually, the window starting at j must be at least 0 and at most i (so that the window ends at j+k-1 >= i) and also j must be <= n-k (so that the window fits).\n\n   Actually, the starting index j must be in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)]? Wait, no: the condition is that j <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j must be in [0, n-k]. So the count is: \n        count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1   ??? \n\n   But note: we have to ensure that the interval [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)] is valid. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        count_i = min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1) ? \n\n   Actually, let me reframe: The first window that includes day i is the one that starts at j0 = max(0, i-k+1). The last window that includes day i is the one that starts at j1 = i (if i <= n-k) but actually the window starting at j must be <= n-k. So the last window that includes day i is j = min(i, n-k). Therefore, the number of windows is: \n        count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n   However, note: the window starting at j goes from j to j+k-1. We require j <= i <= j+k-1. So j <= i and j >= i - k + 1. And j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). So:\n\n        j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        j_max = min(i, n - k)   [because j cannot exceed n-k]\n\n   Then the count is: max(0, j_max - j_min + 1)\n\n   But note: j_max is the minimum of i and n-k. However, what if i > n-k? Then j_max = n-k, but we require j <= i and j<=n-k, so it's okay. But also we require j>=i-k+1. \n\n   Example: n=5, k=3, i=4 (last element). Then j_min = max(0,4-3+1)=2, j",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a given sequence of sleep times. The challenge is to compute this efficiently without resorting to a brute-force approach that would be too slow for large inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all windows of size `k` in an array of `n` elements. Each window represents a week, and there are `n - k + 1` such windows. The straightforward approach would involve summing each window and then averaging these sums, but this would result in an O(n*k) time complexity, which is inefficient for large `n` and `k`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing each window individually, we can leverage the fact that each element in the array contributes to multiple windows. Specifically, each element at position `i` appears in `min(i + 1, k, n - i, n - k + 1)` windows. By precomputing the prefix sums of the array, we can quickly calculate the sum of any window and then use these counts to determine each element's total contribution across all windows.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`. This allows O(1) range sum queries.\n   - **Window Contribution Calculation**: For each element at position `i`, determine how many windows include it. The sum contributed by this element across all windows is `element_value * count_i`.\n   - **Total Sum Calculation**: Sum the contributions of all elements to get the total sum of all window sums.\n   - **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`) to get the average.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves O(n) time to build the prefix sum array and O(n) time to compute the contributions of each element. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    prefix = [0] * n\n    prefix[0] = a[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i]\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right = min(i, n - k)\n        count_i = 0\n        if left <= right:\n            count_i = right - left + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n            \n        if count_i > 0:\n            window_sum = prefix[right] - (prefix[left-1] if left > 0 else 0)\n            if left == 0:\n                window_sum = prefix[right]\n            else:\n                window_sum = prefix[right] - prefix[left-1]\n            total_sum += window_sum * count_i\n    \n    avg = total_sum / total_weeks if total_weeks != 0 else 0.0\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the window size `k`, and the list of sleep times.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` is zero (though constraints ensure `k >= 1`), it prints \"0.0000000000\".\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array is constructed to allow efficient range sum queries.\n4. **Window Contribution Calculation**: For each element, the code calculates how many windows include it and the sum of the values in those windows. This is done using the prefix sum array to avoid recalculating sums for overlapping windows.\n5. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is computed by aggregating each element's contribution. The average is then derived by dividing this total sum by the number of windows, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging prefix sums and careful counting of element contributions, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
