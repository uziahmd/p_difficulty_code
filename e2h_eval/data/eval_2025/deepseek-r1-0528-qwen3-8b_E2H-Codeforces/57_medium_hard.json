His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n, x\n   list a of n integers (first tour points)\n   list b of n integers (second tour points)\n\n We know that Vasya is one of the participants, but we don't know which one. However, we know that there is at least one participant (Vasya) such that ai + bj >= x.\n\n The problem: find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that each participant has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second.\n    Since the input gives two lists (a for first tour, b for second tour), we must consider that the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n 2. We are to consider all possible pairings? Actually, we can assign the two lists arbitrarily (because the problem says the results are given in arbitrary order). \n    But note: the two lists are given as two separate lists of n numbers, and each participant is represented by one number from the first list and one from the second list.\n\n 3. However, we are not told which participant is which. So we can think of it as: we have two sets of numbers (the first tour and the second tour) and we form pairs (one from each set) for each participant.\n\n    But note: the problem states that \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so we are forming n pairs (each participant has one from the first and one from the second).\n\n 4. We are only concerned with the total score (sum of the two tours) for each participant.\n\n    Let S = [a_i + b_j] for the n pairs. Then the ranking is by descending total score.\n\n    However, the catch: we can assign the two lists arbitrarily (meaning we can permute the two lists arbitrarily to form the pairs). But wait, actually: the problem says the results of the first and second tour are given as two lists (without names). So we are allowed to form any pairing between the two lists.\n\n    But note: each participant is one element from the first list and one from the second list. So we are allowed to assign the second list arbitrarily to the first list.\n\n 5. Therefore, we can compute:\n\n    Let c = [a_i + b_j] for a fixed pairing? Actually, no, because we are free to choose the pairing. \n\n    How to approach?\n\n    We are to find the best and worst rank (place) Vasya could get.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    - We know that Vasya must have at least x points (so his total score s_v >= x). But note: we don't know which participant is Vasya. However, the problem states that Vasya is present and we are given two lists. The key is: we are allowed to assign the second list arbitrarily to the first list, so we can choose which participant gets which second score.\n\n    But wait: the problem does not say that the same participant's two scores are consecutive. They are just two sets of numbers.\n\n    Actually, the problem states: \"The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names.\"\n\n    This means: we are given two multisets of n numbers. Each participant has one number from the first multiset and one from the second.\n\n    However, note: the same participant cannot be split. We have to assign the entire second multiset to the entire first multiset.\n\n    But here is the catch: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we can form any pairing.\n\n    Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n      We have two arrays A (size n) and B (size n). We want to assign to each element in A an element in B (each element used once) to form pairs (a_i, b_j) and then compute the total for each pair.\n\n      We then sort the totals in descending order.\n\n      We are to find:\n\n        Best place: the minimum possible rank Vasya can achieve (if his total is high enough, he might be placed first even if others have high totals because we can arrange the rest arbitrarily to push others down).\n\n        Worst place: the maximum possible rank Vasya can achieve.\n\n    However, note: we are not told which pair is Vasya's. But the condition is that there is at least one pair (i.e., one participant) that has total >= x.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that there are two integers i, j (1<=i,j<=n) such that ai+bj>=x\".\n\n    But note: we are free to choose which pairing is Vasya's? Actually, no: the problem states that Vasya was present and we know the two lists. The idea is: we are trying to determine the best and worst place Vasya could have gotten, meaning we can choose the assignment of the second list to the first list arbitrarily, but we must assign the entire second list to the entire first list.\n\n    However, we are not told which element of A and which element of B belong to Vasya. So we must consider that Vasya could be any of the participants. But note: the condition is that at least one pair (which we can choose arbitrarily) must have total >= x.\n\n    But wait: the problem states that Vasya was present, so we know that there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. However, we are free to assign the second list arbitrarily, so we can choose which pairs are formed.\n\n    However, note: we are forming n pairs, and we have two multisets. We are allowed to form any bijection between the two multisets.\n\n    The goal is to compute the best and worst place Vasya can get, assuming we can choose the pairing arbitrarily (but we must use each element exactly once) and we know that there is at least one pair (Vasya's) that has total >= x.\n\n    But wait: we are not told which element is Vasya's. So we must consider: what if we fix that one particular pair (say, we are going to assign the highest available total to Vasya)? Actually, no: we are free to assign the entire set arbitrarily. However, the condition is that Vasya has at least x points. But note: the problem does not specify which participant is Vasya. So we must consider that Vasya is one of the participants, and we are allowed to choose the assignment arbitrarily, but we must ensure that one of the pairs (the one assigned to Vasya) has total >= x.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require us to fix Vasya's pair. We are just told that there is at least one pair (somewhere) that has total >= x.\n\n    Alternate interpretation: we are to consider that we are going to assign the entire second list arbitrarily to the first list, and then we look at the resulting list of totals. Then, we are to determine the best and worst rank that Vasya could have, if we assume that Vasya's pair is the one that we choose arbitrarily (but must satisfy the condition that at least one pair has total >= x). But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which pair is Vasya's as long as we use the entire set.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the teacher has to know Vasya's chances\". The teacher knows the two multisets and that Vasya has at least x points. So the teacher can assume that the pairing was done in such a way that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\n    How do we compute?\n\n    Idea:\n\n    Step 1: We are going to consider all possible ways to assign the second list to the first list. But n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over all assignments.\n\n    We need to compute:\n\n      Let T be the set of all possible totals (from the two multisets). But note: the pairing is a bijection, so the set of totals we can form is constrained.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require to consider every possible pairing. We can use the following:\n\n    We want to know the best and worst rank Vasya can get.\n\n    Let's define:\n\n      Let S be the sorted list of all possible totals? Actually, no, because the pairing is a bijection and the two multisets are fixed.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think:\n\n      We are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can form any pairing. The total set of pairs is the Cartesian product, but we are constrained to use each element exactly once.\n\n    However, note: the two multisets are independent, so we can independently sort them and then form pairs in any order.\n\n    But here is a known fact: the maximum total we can form is the sum of the largest of A and the largest of B, but wait, no: because we have to assign each element of A to a distinct element of B.\n\n    Actually, we can use the following:\n\n      Sort the first list A in non-decreasing order.\n      Sort the second list B in non-decreasing order.\n\n    Then, we can form pairs arbitrarily. The best way to maximize the number of high totals is to pair the largest elements together, and the worst is to pair the largest with the smallest.\n\n    However, we are not asked for the maximum or minimum total, but the best and worst rank.\n\n    Let me explain:\n\n    We are allowed to assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can control how many participants have a total >= some value.\n\n    To compute the best rank (minimum rank) for Vasya:\n\n      We want to maximize Vasya's total (to get a high rank) and minimize the number of participants with a higher total.\n\n      How? We can assign the highest remaining scores to Vasya and then assign the remaining scores in a way that minimizes the number of participants with a total greater than Vasya's.\n\n      But note: we are not forced to maximize Vasya's total, because we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, but we must assign all. However, we can choose which pair is Vasya's. \n\n      Actually, we are to consider that Vasya must have a total >= x. So we can choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x, and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n      For the best rank, we would want to make Vasya's total as high as possible (so that few participants have higher totals) and also arrange the other pairs so that as few as possible have totals higher than Vasya's.\n\n      However, we are free to assign the entire set arbitrarily. So we can:\n\n        Step 1: Form a pairing that maximizes Vasya's total (if we want him to be first, we can set his total to the maximum possible, and then set the others to be as low as possible). But wait, we can also choose which pair is Vasya's. Actually, we are not forced to assign a particular pair to Vasya. We are just told that at least one pair (Vasya's) is >= x.\n\n      Actually, the problem does not fix Vasya's pair. We are to consider all scenarios where there is one pair (Vasya's) that is >= x, and then we look at the entire table and see what rank that Vasya's pair could be.\n\n      However, note: we can choose the entire pairing arbitrarily, and then we must have one pair (the one we assign to Vasya) that is >= x.\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"Vasya was present\", meaning that we are guaranteed that there is at least one pair (from the two multisets) that is >= x. And we are free to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose that one pair arbitrarily (as long as the two multisets are fixed).\n\n      So, to find the best place:\n\n        We can assign the highest total to Vasya (if that total is >= x) and then assign the rest arbitrarily. Then, how many participants have a total strictly greater than Vasya's? None, so Vasya would be first.\n\n        However, what if the highest total is not >= x? Then we cannot assign that to Vasya? But the problem guarantees that there is at least one pair >= x.\n\n        Actually, we are guaranteed that there is at least one pair (anywhere) that is >= x. But note: we are assigning the entire set, so we must assign all pairs. We are free to choose which pair is Vasya's, as long as we use the entire set. However, we are not forced to assign the highest total to Vasya. \n\n        But for the best rank, we want Vasya to have as high a total as possible, and we want to minimize the number of participants with higher totals.\n\n        However, we can set Vasya's total to the maximum total available (if that total is >= x) and then set the other pairs arbitrarily (we can try to set the other pairs to have totals as low as possible, but note: the pairing must use all elements).\n\n        But wait: we cannot set the other pairs arbitrarily without affecting Vasya's pair. Actually, we have to assign all the numbers.\n\n        How about:\n\n          We can compute the maximum total: M = max_{i,j} (a_i + b_j) is the sum of the two maximums? Actually, no: because we have two multisets and we can form any pairing. The maximum total we can get is the sum of the largest element in A and the largest element in B, but then we use one occurrence from each. Then the next maximum total is the sum of the next largest in A and the next largest in B, but note: we have to use the entire set.\n\n        Actually, the entire set of totals we can form is constrained by the two multisets.\n\n        There is a known method: to form the set of totals, we can use the two multisets and then consider the possible sums. However, we are not directly interested in the set of all totals, but the ranking.\n\n    Another idea:\n\n      We can use the following:\n\n        Let's combine the two multisets and consider the entire set of pairs.\n\n        We want to know: what is the minimum number of participants that must have a total >= t (for various t) when we form the pairs arbitrarily?\n\n        Actually, we can use the concept of matching and counting the number of pairs that can be above a certain threshold.\n\n        We can use greedy and sorting.\n\n    Standard approach for problems like \"Olympiad\" (CodeForces style):\n\n      We are to compute:\n\n        Best rank: the minimum rank Vasya can get (so we try to make as few participants as possible have a higher total than Vasya)\n\n        Worst rank: the maximum rank Vasya can get (so we try to make as many participants as possible have a higher total than Vasya)\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Let's denote:\n\n          Let A and B be the two lists.\n\n        We can sort A in ascending order, and B in ascending order.\n\n        Then, we can form pairs arbitrarily. But note: the best way to minimize the number of participants with total > T is to pair the smallest elements with the largest ones (so that the large totals are avoided). Similarly, to maximize the number of participants with total > T, we pair the largest with the largest.\n\n        However, we are not given T (Vasya's total) but we know that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\n        We are free to choose Vasya's pair (as long as it is >= x) and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, to compute the best rank:\n\n          We want to minimize the number of participants that have total > Vasya's total.\n\n          We can set Vasya's total to be as high as possible (so that we minimize the count of participants with higher total). But note: we are constrained by the multisets.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set Vasya's total to be the maximum total that is >= x, and then assign the rest so that as few as possible pairs have a total greater than Vasya's.\n\n          How to assign the rest? We want to avoid having too many pairs with high totals. So we can pair the smallest elements from A with the largest elements from B, but wait, we already used one element from A and one from B for Vasya.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          Let F(t) = the minimum number of participants that must have total >= t (over all pairings). Then, the best rank Vasya can get is at least F(x) (if we set Vasya to have total x, then the number of participants with total >= x is at least F(x), so Vasya's rank is at most F(x) (since the participants with total >= x are ranked above or equal, and ties are broken arbitrarily in favor of Vasya for best rank? Actually, for best rank we break ties in the worst way for the competition: meaning we can assign Vasya a higher place by having the same total as others but then the jury can break the tie arbitrarily in Vasya's favor? Actually, the problem says: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\" So for the best rank, we can assume that when there are ties, the jury breaks the tie in our favor (so we get the best place). Therefore, we can assign Vasya a place that is as high as the number of distinct totals above him plus one (with ties being broken in his favor).\n\n        Actually, let's define:\n\n          Let r be the number of participants with total > Vasya's total. Then Vasya's rank is at most r+1 (if there are ties, then we can break the tie so that all participants with the same total as Vasya are placed after him, so his rank is r+1).\n\n        Similarly, for the worst rank, we want to maximize the rank: we want to have as many participants as possible with total > Vasya's total (and then the ties are broken against us).\n\n        So:\n\n          Best rank: we want to minimize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total.\n\n          Worst rank: we want to maximize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total.\n\n        How to compute the minimum and maximum number of participants that can have total > T (for a fixed T) in a pairing?\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          Let T be a threshold. We want to know the minimum number of pairs (across the entire pairing) that have total > T.\n\n          How?\n\n          We can use a greedy matching:\n\n            Sort A and B.\n\n            To minimize the number of pairs above T, we want to form as few pairs as possible that are above T.\n\n            We can try to form pairs that are <= T as much as possible.\n\n            But note: we are free to choose the pairing arbitrarily.\n\n            Condition for a pair (a, b) to be <= T: a + b <= T.\n\n            However, we have to use all elements.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n              Count the maximum number of pairs that are <= T, then the minimum number of pairs > T is n - (max number of pairs <= T).\n\n            Similarly, for the maximum number of pairs > T, we can use a different method.\n\n        But note: we are not fixing T. We are going to consider T_min = x (for Vasya's minimum total). However, Vasya's total can be any value >= x, and we are allowed to choose his total arbitrarily (from the set of all possible pairs that are >= x). \n\n        Actually, we are to consider:\n\n          Best rank: the minimal possible rank (so we choose a T (>=x) and then we want to minimize the count of pairs with total > T, and we can choose T arbitrarily from the set {t: t>=x and t is a total from the pairing?}).\n\n        However, we can also choose which pair is Vasya's. So we can choose T to be the maximum total (then the count of pairs > T is 0) as long as that maximum total is >= x.\n\n        But note: we are guaranteed that there is at least one pair >= x, so the maximum total is at least x.\n\n        Therefore, the best rank is 1 (by setting Vasya's total to the maximum total, then no one has a higher total).\n\n        Similarly, for the worst rank: we want to maximize the count of pairs with total > Vasya's total. We can set Vasya's total to x (the minimum) and then we want to maximize the number of pairs that have total > x.\n\n        However, wait: is it always possible to set Vasya's total to x? Not necessarily: we must have a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j=x (or >=x). But we are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's, and the condition is that there is at least one pair >= x.\n\n        So for worst rank, we set Vasya's total to the minimum value (which is x) that is available (we can choose the smallest total that is >= x). Then we want to maximize the number of pairs that have total > x.\n\n        But note: we are constrained by the entire pairing. We must assign the entire set.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute the maximum total (M) and the minimum total (m) that can be achieved? Not exactly.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known method (from CodeForces problems):\n\n          We can use the idea of \"greedy\" to compute the minimum and maximum ranks.\n\n        After reading similar problems, I recall a solution that uses:\n\n          Sort A and B.\n\n          Then, to compute the best rank:\n\n            We want to set Vasya's total as high as possible (at least x). Then, we want to minimize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total.\n\n            Let T = maximum total (which is A_max + B_max). Then, we can form the pairing so that Vasya has T, and then we form the rest of the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n            However, to minimize the number of participants with total > T, we set T as high as possible (so no one is above T) and then we break the ties arbitrarily (so we can have as few as 0 above T).\n\n            But wait, what if the maximum total is not unique? Then we can have multiple pairs with the same total T.\n\n            Actually, the rank is defined by:\n\n              Rank = (number of participants with total > T) + 1\n\n            But if there are participants with total == T, they can be placed arbitrarily. For best rank, we can place Vasya first, so the rank is 1.\n\n          Now, what if we cannot set Vasya to the maximum total? Actually, we can: because we are free to assign arbitrarily, we can assign the highest two numbers (the two largest) to Vasya? No, wait: Vasya is one participant, so we can assign one element from A and one from B. So we assign the largest element from A and the largest element from B to Vasya, then the rest we assign arbitrarily.\n\n          Therefore, the best rank is always 1.\n\n          But wait, what if the maximum total is less than x? Then we cannot assign the maximum total to Vasya because it is less than x? However, the problem guarantees that there is at least one pair >= x.\n\n          So the maximum total might be >= x, but note: the maximum total is the sum of the two largest. But what if the two largest are from two different participants? Actually, we are free to assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the largest element from A and the largest element from B to Vasya, and then the rest arbitrarily.\n\n          However, what if the two largest are from the same participant? Actually, no: the two largest are two different participants? Actually, no: the two largest elements in A and B are from two different participants? Actually, no: the two largest elements in A are two different participants, and similarly for B. But we are forming pairs: we can assign the largest of A to the largest of B, and then the next largest of A to the next largest of B, etc.\n\n          So the maximum total is the sum of the largest of A and the largest of B.\n\n          Therefore, the best rank is always 1.\n\n          But wait, consider the first example:\n\n            Input: \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n            Here, the maximum total is 2, and every participant gets 2. Then, we can break the tie arbitrarily. So Vasya can be first, but also last.\n\n          So the best rank is 1.\n\n          The worst rank is 5.\n\n        However, the example output is \"1 5\".\n\n        Now, why is the worst rank 5?\n\n          In the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total.\n\n          But note: Vasya's total must be at least 2. In this example, every participant gets 2. Therefore, there is no participant with total > 2. So the number of participants with total > 2 is 0, so Vasya's rank is 1 (if we break the tie in his favor) or 5 (if we break the tie against him). \n\n          Actually, the problem states: \"the best and the worst place\".\n\n          The ranking: \n            If we break the tie arbitrarily, then the worst place is 5, because the jury can decide to put Vasya last.\n\n          But wait, the problem says: \"Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"\n\n          So in the case of ties, the jury can assign the places arbitrarily. Therefore, for the worst place, we assume that the jury assigns Vasya the last place among the tied ones.\n\n          How many participants have the same total as Vasya? All of them. So the worst rank is n.\n\n        Therefore, we need to consider:\n\n          Let T be Vasya's total (>=x). Then:\n\n            Let k = number of participants with total > T.\n            Let m = number of participants with total == T.\n\n            Then, the rank of Vasya can vary from k+1 to k+m (if we break the ties in his favor, then he is at position k+1; if we break the ties against him, then he is at position k+m).\n\n          But note: we are free to choose T (any total >=x) and the entire pairing (so we can choose which participants have which totals). However, the entire pairing must use all the numbers.\n\n        Therefore, the problem breaks down into:\n\n          We wish to compute:\n\n            Best_rank = min_{T>=x} (k+1)   [where k is the minimum number of participants with total > T we can achieve by pairing]\n            Worst_rank = max_{T>=x} (k+m)   [where k is the number of participants with total > T, and m is the number of participants with total == T, and we are considering a pairing that achieves T for Vasya and then the rest]\n\n          However, note: we are not forced to choose a particular T. We can choose T arbitrarily from the set of achievable totals (that are >=x). And we can also choose the pairing arbitrarily (so we can choose k and m).\n\n        But wait: the entire pairing must be fixed. We cannot independently choose T and then choose k and m.\n\n        Actually, we can choose the pairing arbitrarily, so we can choose T arbitrarily (as long as there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j = T and T>=x) and then we can arrange the rest to minimize/maximize k and m.\n\n        However, the entire pairing must use all the numbers.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We can do:\n\n          Step 1: Compute the best rank.\n\n            We want to minimize the rank: so we want to minimize k (the number of participants with total > T) and then add 1.\n\n            How to minimize k? We want to choose T as large as possible (so that there are few participants with total > T) and then arrange the rest so that as few as possible have total > T.\n\n            The largest T we can assign to Vasya is the maximum total (which is A_max+B_max). Then, we can arrange the rest so that as few as possible pairs exceed T? Actually, no: since T is the maximum, no pair can exceed T. So k=0, so the best rank is 1.\n\n          Step 2: Compute the worst rank.\n\n            We want to maximize the rank: so we want to maximize (k+m) (the position) by having as many participants as possible with total >= T (so that we are pushed down) and then the worst rank is the maximum possible position.\n\n            We can choose T to be the minimum total (>=x) that we can form for Vasya. Then, we want to maximize the number of participants with total > T (so that k is as large as possible) and also we want to have as few participants as possible with total == T (so that the tied ones are minimized, and then we get pushed down by k and then the tied ones are broken against us, so our position is k+m).\n\n            However, note: we are free to choose the pairing. So we can choose T arbitrarily (from the set of achievable totals >=x) and then arrange the rest to maximize k (the number of participants with total > T) and minimize the number of participants with total == T.\n\n          But wait, we must use the entire set. So we cannot arbitrarily choose T and then arrange the rest independently.\n\n        Alternate known solution (from CodeForces problems like \"Olympiad\" or \"Ranking\"):\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Sort A in ascending order.\n            Sort B in ascending order.\n\n            Let C = [a_i + b_j for the pairing] but we don't know the pairing.\n\n            We can compute:\n\n              Let R = the array of all possible totals? That is too big.\n\n            Instead, we can use two pointers or binary search.\n\n        Insight:\n\n          We can use the following:\n\n            To compute the best rank:\n\n              We can set Vasya's total to the maximum total (M). Then, the rest of the participants can be arranged so that we minimize the number of participants with total > M (which is 0) and then the rest are <= M. Then, the rank is 1.\n\n            To compute the worst rank:\n\n              We want to set Vasya's total to a value T (>=x) such that we can maximize the number of participants with total > T.\n\n              How to compute the maximum number of participants that can have total > T?\n\n                We can use a greedy matching:\n\n                  Sort A and B.\n\n                  Let's form the pairing that maximizes the number of participants with total > T.\n\n                  How? We can pair the smallest elements in A and B to avoid exceeding T, but to maximize the number of participants with total > T, we should pair the largest elements in A and B together.\n\n                Actually, to maximize the number of participants with total > T, we can use a two-pointer technique:\n\n                  Sort A in ascending order, B in ascending order.\n\n                  Let two pointers for A and B, and then traverse from the end to count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j > T.\n\n                But note: we have to use all the elements.\n\n                Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                  Let f(T) = the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total > T.\n\n                  Then, the worst rank for Vasya is:\n\n                    We choose T (>=x) and then the number of participants with total > T is at most f(T). Then, the number of participants with total <= T is n - f(T). But note: we must reserve one pair for Vasya (with total >=x and we set Vasya's total to T, but T can be chosen arbitrarily from the set of achievable totals >=x). \n\n                However, we are free to choose T and the pairing. The worst rank is:\n\n                  We want to maximize (k + m), where k is the number of participants with total > T, and m is the number of participants with total == T (including Vasya). But note: we are forced to have at least one pair (Vasya's) with total T (which is >=x). But we are free to choose T and the pairing.\n\n                Actually, we can set T to be the smallest total that is >=x, and then we want to maximize the number of participants with total > T.\n\n                But note: we are not forced to set T to the smallest total. We can set T arbitrarily (as long as there is a pair with that total). However, to maximize the number of participants with total > T, we might set T to be the smallest total that is >=x, and then arrange the rest to have as many as possible pairs with total > T.\n\n                Steps for worst rank:\n\n                  Let T_min = x. But we can choose T to be any total >=x. However, if we choose T too high, then the number of pairs with total > T might be small. So to maximize the number of pairs with total > T, we should choose T as low as possible (but still >=x). Why? Because if T is low, then the bar for being above T is lower, so more pairs can be above T.\n\n                  However, we must have at least one pair (Vasya's) with total >=x (which is T). So we set T = x (if x is achievable) or the smallest achievable total >=x.\n\n                  Then, we want to compute the maximum number of pairs (in the entire set) that have total > T (call this k). Then, the worst rank for Vasya is k+1 (if there are no ties, then Vasya is at k+1). But wait, what if there are ties? \n\n                  Actually, we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily, so we can choose to set Vasya's total to T (which is x) and then arrange the rest to have as many as possible pairs with total > x (k). Then, the participants with total > x are k, and then the participants with total == x (including Vasya) are n - k.\n\n                  Then, the worst rank is k+1 (if the jury breaks the ties against Vasya, then Vasya is the last among the ones with total==x, so his rank is k+1 + (n-k-1) ???). Actually, no: the ranking is:\n\n                    First: the k participants with total > x.\n                    Then: the participants with total == x.\n\n                  And the problem says: the jury can break the ties arbitrarily. So for the worst rank, we assume that all the participants with total == x are placed after the ones with total > x, and then Vasya is last in the group of total==x.\n\n                  Therefore, Vasya's rank is k + (number of participants with total==x) = k + (n - k) = n? \n\n                  Wait: the total number of participants is n. The k participants are above, then the rest n-k are below or equal. But note: one of the n-k is Vasya. So the rest n-k-1 are also with total==x. Then, the worst rank for Vasya is k + (n-k) = n? \n\n                  Actually, the rank is:\n\n                    Participant 1 to k: total > x.\n                    Participant k+1 to n: total <= x.\n\n                  But note: we set Vasya's total to x, so he is in the second group. The second group has (n-k) participants. The worst rank is the last in the second group, so rank = k + (n-k) = n.\n\n                  However, wait: the problem says the table is sorted by total (descending). So:\n\n                    The top k participants are those with total > x.\n                    Then, the next (n-k) participants are those with total <= x.\n\n                  But note: we set Vasya's total to x, so he is in the second group. The second group has (n-k) participants. The worst rank is the last in the entire list, which is n.\n\n                  However, what if there are multiple participants with total==x? Then the rank of Vasya is the size of the first group (k) plus the number of participants with total==x that are before him. In the worst case, we assume he is last, so his rank is k + (n-k) = n.\n\n                  But wait, the rank is the position: the first participant is rank 1, the last is rank n.\n\n                  Example: n=5, k=3, then Vasya is the 5th participant? Then his rank is 5.\n\n                  But note: the second group has 5-3=2 participants. If Vasya is the last in the second group, then his rank is 5 (because the first three are rank 1,2,3 and then the next two are 4 and 5).\n\n                  Therefore, worst_rank = n.\n\n                  However, wait: what if we cannot set T=x? For example, if x is 3, and the smallest total we can form is 4? Then we must set T>=4, and then the number of participants with total>3 is the same as the number of participants with total>=4 (since 4>3). But note: we are counting pairs with total>3, which is the same as pairs with total>=4.\n\n                  Actually, we must set T to be the smallest achievable total that is >=x. But we are free to choose which pair is Vasya's. So we choose the smallest total >=x.\n\n                  Then, the number of pairs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on the given points from two tours. The key insight is that we can pair the participants' points from the first and second tours in any way, and Vasya's rank depends on how many participants have a higher total score than his.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves two lists of integers representing scores from two different tours. Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from both tours. The goal is to find the best (minimum) and worst (maximum) rank Vasya could achieve, given that his total score is at least `x`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Best Rank**: To achieve the best rank, we should maximize Vasya's total score. The highest possible score is the sum of the largest elements from both lists. If this sum is at least `x`, Vasya can be ranked first by ensuring no other participant has a higher score.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To achieve the worst rank, we should minimize Vasya's total score (but still at least `x`) and maximize the number of participants with a higher score. This involves pairing the largest elements from both lists to create as many high-scoring participants as possible, pushing Vasya to the bottom of the ranking.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted in ascending order to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to count the number of participants who can have a total score greater than a given value, which helps in determining the worst rank.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time. The two-pointer technique for counting pairs runs in O(n) time. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # Best rank: always 1 because we can assign the highest possible score to Vasya.\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst rank: We need to find the minimum rank Vasya can get when his score is the smallest possible >= x.\n    # First, check if there's any participant with score >= x.\n    # We'll use two pointers to count the number of participants that can have score > x.\n    j = n - 1\n    count_higher = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] > x:\n            count_higher += 1\n            j -= 1\n        if j < 0:\n            break\n            \n    worst_rank = n - count_higher\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total score `x`, and the two lists of scores from the two tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted in ascending order to facilitate efficient pairing using the two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: The best rank is always 1 because Vasya can be assigned the highest possible score (sum of the largest elements from both lists), ensuring no other participant has a higher score.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: \n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers starting from the end of both sorted lists to count how many participants can have a total score greater than `x`. This count helps determine the maximum number of participants who could be ranked higher than Vasya.\n   - **Rank Calculation**: The worst rank is computed as `n - count_higher`, where `count_higher` is the number of participants with a total score greater than `x`. This gives the position Vasya would occupy if all other participants are ranked higher than him.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed as space-separated integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and a two-pointer technique to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
