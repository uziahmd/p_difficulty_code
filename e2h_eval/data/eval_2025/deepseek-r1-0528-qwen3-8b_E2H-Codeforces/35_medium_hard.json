    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   a list of n integers a0, a1, ..., an-1\n   a string s of length n (the binary representation of m, from most significant to least significant? Note: the problem says \"s0s1...sn-1\" and then m equals the sum of s_i * 2^(n-1-i) for i=0 to n-1? Actually, note the example: \n        Input: '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010'\n        Here, n=5, m is given by binary string \"11010\", which is 16+8+0+2+0? But wait, the example says m=11 (which is 8+2+1) but the string is \"11010\". \n\n Let's decode the example: \n   The example input: \n        5\n        17 0 10 2 1\n        11010\n\n   The binary string \"11010\" has 5 digits. According to the problem, m = s0*2^(4) + s1*2^(3) + s2*2^(2) + s3*2^(1) + s4*2^(0)\n        s0='1', s1='1', s2='0', s3='1', s4='0'\n        So m = 1*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 0*1 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n   However, the example says: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\", which is confusing.\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n   And then: \"Number m equals <formula>\", but the example input has \"11010\" and then in the note: \"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\"\n\n   Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. Let me read the problem again: \n        \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\"\n\n   The formula is missing. But from the example: \n        Input: \n            ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n        Output: \n            ['3', '27']\n\n   For the first test case: n=2, array [3,8], m is given by \"10\" (binary). Then m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n        We need to consider x from 0 to 2 (inclusive). \n        f(0): no bits set -> 0\n        f(1): bit0 set -> a0 = 3\n        f(2): bit1 set -> a1 = 8\n        So maximum is 8? But output is 3.\n\n   Wait, the example says: \n        \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\n   This note says m=20=1? That doesn't add up. Actually, the note might have a typo. Let me check:\n\n        First test case: \n          Input: \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n          The binary string is \"10\", which is two digits. Then the problem states: \"Number m equals s0*2^(n-1) + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0\".\n\n        So for n=2, m = s0*2^(1) + s1*2^(0) = 1*2 + 0*1 = 2.\n\n        Then the example says: \"m = 20 = 1\", that must be a mistake.\n\n        But wait, the example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\". Actually, they probably meant the binary representation is given as a string of length n, and the example input \"10\" is the binary representation of m.\n\n        However, the note then says: \"f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3\". So they are considering x from 0 to m (inclusive). Since m=2, we consider x=0,1,2.\n\n        Then why is the answer 3? Because f(2)=a1=8, so the maximum should be 8. But the output is 3.\n\n        There's a contradiction.\n\n   Let me re-read the problem statement: \n        \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula: f(x) = sum_{i} a_i * bit(i)\"\n\n        But note: the array a has n elements, and the indices of a go from 0 to n-1.\n\n        The function f(x) uses the bits of x. How many bits does x have? The problem says x is from 0 to 2^n-1? Actually, the problem says \"0 ≤ x ≤ m\", and m is given by the binary string of length n.\n\n        However, note: the example input for the first test case has n=2, and the array a has two elements: a0 and a1.\n\n        But the example says: \n            f(0) = 0\n            f(1) = a0\n            f(2) = a1\n\n        This implies that the bits are being considered in the following way: \n            For x, we look at its binary representation with exactly n bits? Or at least, the i-th bit (from the lowest) corresponds to a_i?\n\n        The problem says: \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n        What is the i-th position? Typically, the i-th bit is the bit representing 2^i. In the example, when x=1 (binary '01'), then the 0-th bit is set, so we take a0. When x=2 (binary '10'), then the 1st bit is set, so we take a1.\n\n        But note: the array a has indices from 0 to n-1. And the problem says the binary representation of m is given as a string s0s1...s_{n-1}. Then m is defined by:\n            m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n        However, the function f(x) uses the bits of x in the same way: the i-th bit (with i starting at 0 for the least significant) would correspond to 2^i, and thus to a_i.\n\n        But wait, the example input for the first test case: \n            n=2, a = [3,8], m is given by \"10\" (so s0='1', s1='0') meaning m=2.\n\n        Then we consider x from 0 to 2 (inclusive). The function f(x) is defined as:\n            f(0) = 0\n            f(1) = a0 = 3\n            f(2) = a1 = 8\n\n        Then the maximum is 8, but the example output is 3.\n\n        The problem says: \"Print a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all x such that 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\"\n\n        So for the first test case, the answer should be 8.\n\n        However, the example output is 3.\n\n        This suggests that the example might have been misinterpreted.\n\n        Looking at the example input format: \n            The first line: 2\n            The second line: 3 8\n            The third line: 10\n\n        And the example output: 3\n\n        Another possibility: the problem does not use the standard little-endian for bits? Or perhaps the array a is indexed by the bit position, but the binary representation of m is given in big-endian (most significant first) and the function f(x) uses the bits of x in big-endian order? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n            The problem says: \n                \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n            Without specifying the endianness, but typically the i-th bit is the 2^i bit (least significant is i=0). \n\n        But wait, the example also says: \n            \"For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\n        In that example, x=11 in binary (for n=4) is 1011. The bits set are at positions 0,1,3. So the array a has indices 0 to 3, and we take a0, a1, a3.\n\n        This matches the standard: the i-th bit (with i increasing with the power of two) is the bit for 2^i.\n\n        Now, in the first test case, x=2 is 10 in binary, which has the bit set at position 1 (since 2^1). So we take a1, which is 8.\n\n        Why then the answer is 3? \n\n        Let me read the example note again: \n            \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\n        This note is confusing because it says m=20=1, which doesn't make sense. Maybe they meant m=1? \n\n        If m=1, then we only consider x=0 and x=1. Then the maximum is 3.\n\n        How do we get m=1 from the input? The third line is \"10\", which is two digits. \n\n        The problem states: \"the binary representation of number m\" and then defines m as the sum over i of s_i * 2^(n-1-i). \n\n        For n=2, and string \"10\": \n            s0='1' -> 2^(2-1-0) = 2^1 = 2\n            s1='0' -> 2^(2-1-1) = 2^0 = 1\n            so m = 1*2 + 0*1 = 2.\n\n        But the note says m=1. \n\n        Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the binary string is given in the usual way (like how we write numbers) but then the formula for m is defined differently.\n\n        Another possibility: the problem gives the binary representation of m in the usual way (with the first character being the most significant) and then the function f(x) uses the bits of x in the same order? \n\n        However, the example function f(x) for x=11 (with n=4) uses the bits from the least significant (rightmost) to the most significant (leftmost) for the indices 0 to 3.\n\n        But wait, the example: \n            n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits set at positions 0,1,3.\n\n        The array a has 4 elements, so the indices 0 to 3.\n\n        Now, what if the array a is provided for the bits from the least significant to the most significant? \n\n        The problem does not specify the order of the array a. But the example input for the second test case: \n            n=5, a = [17, 0, 10, 2, 1], m = \"11010\"\n\n        Then the example says the maximum is 27, achieved by x=5 (binary 101, but wait, 5 in binary is 101, but with n=5 we represent with 5 bits: 00101).\n\n        Then f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\n        Now, note: \n            The array a: [17, 0, 10, 2, 1] corresponds to indices 0 to 4.\n\n        The bits set in 5 (which is 00101) are at positions 0 and 2 (if we count the least significant as 0). So we take a0 and a2.\n\n        But wait, the binary representation of m is \"11010\", which is 16+8+0+2+0 = 26. Then m=26, and we consider x from 0 to 26.\n\n        However, the example says: \"the maximum value of function equals f(5)=27\".\n\n        This indicates that the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x, and the array a is provided for each bit index (starting from 0 for the least significant).\n\n        Now, the confusion in the first example: \n            Input: n=2, a=[3,8], m=\"10\"\n\n            Then m=2 (as computed above). Then we consider x from 0 to 2.\n\n            f(0)=0\n            f(1)=a0=3 (because 1 has the 0-th bit set)\n            f(2)=a1=8 (because 2 has the 1st bit set)\n\n            Then the maximum is 8.\n\n        But the example output is 3.\n\n        Unless the problem does not consider x=2? Why not? \n\n        Wait, the problem says: \"0 ≤ x ≤ m\", and m=2, so x can be 0,1,2.\n\n        There must be a misunderstanding about the binary representation of m.\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        And then: \"Number m equals [formula]\".\n\n        The example input for the first test case: \n            n=2, so the binary representation has two digits: s0 and s1.\n\n        The formula: m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) ? or s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... ?\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"Number m equals .\"\n\n        But the example calculation for the second test case: \n            n=5, m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n        So the formula is: \n            m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n        But wait, that means the first character of the string is the most significant bit (for 2^(n-1)) and the last is the least significant (for 2^0).\n\n        Now, the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x, but note: the array a is provided in the order of the bits from index 0 to n-1, and the i-th element a_i corresponds to the bit at position i (which is 2^i). \n\n        However, the problem does not say that the i-th bit of x (in the usual sense) corresponds to a_i. It just says \"bit(i)\".\n\n        But the example: \n            n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits set at positions 0,1,3. Then f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n        So the function f(x) uses the bits of x in the usual way: the i-th bit (with i=0 being the least significant) corresponds to a_i.\n\n        Now, note: the array a has n elements, and x can have up to n bits? Actually, the problem says x is from 0 to m, and m is represented with n bits. So x can be up to (2^n - 1) but we are bounded by m (which is less than 2^n, because the binary string is of length n).\n\n        However, the issue in the first test case remains.\n\n        After re‐reading the problem statement: \n            \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        And the example input for the first test case: \n            \"10\"\n\n        Then the problem says: \"Number m equals .\" (without the formula) but the example note says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\", which is definitely a typo.\n\n        I suspect the intended meaning is that the binary representation of m is given as a string of length n, and the function f(x) uses the bits of x (in the standard way) but the array a is provided in the order of the bits from least significant to most significant? \n\n        But wait, the second test case: \n            n=5, a = [17,0,10,2,1]\n            m = \"11010\"\n\n            Then the maximum is achieved by x=5 (which is 00101 in 5 bits). \n            The bits set are the 0th and 2nd. Then we take a0=17 and a2=10.\n\n        This matches if we assume that the array a is provided for the bits from 0 to n-1 (0 being the least significant).\n\n        Now, the first test case: \n            n=2, a=[3,8] -> a0=3 (for bit0) and a1=8 (for bit1)\n            m=\"10\" -> m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n        Then x can be 0,1,2.\n\n        But note: the problem says the array a has n integers, and the function f(x) uses the bits of x. However, the array a is provided in the order of the bit indices from 0 to n-1 (lowest to highest).\n\n        Now, the problem says: \"0 ≤ x ≤ m\". \n\n        But wait, the example output for the first test case is 3, which is the maximum among x=0 and x=1 (if we only consider x<=m and m=2, then x=2 is allowed and gives 8). \n\n        Unless the problem intended that the binary representation of m is given in reverse order? \n\n        Let me try: \n            Alternative interpretation: the binary string is given from least significant bit to most significant? \n            Then for n=2, string \"10\" would mean: \n                s0 (the first char) is the least significant? Then m = 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 1.\n\n            Then x from 0 to 1: \n                x=0 -> 0\n                x=1 -> a0=3\n            Then the answer is 3.\n\n        Similarly, the second test case: \n            n=5, string \"11010\" (if we interpret the first char as the least significant) then m = 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8+2+1 = 11.\n\n            Then the example says m=11, and the maximum is 27.\n\n        Now, in the second test case, the array a is [17,0,10,2,1]. \n            If the string \"11010\" is interpreted as having the first character as the least significant, then the bits of m are (from LSB to MSB): 0,1,0,1,1.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the binary representation is given as s0s1...s_{n-1}. \n\n        Without knowing the endianness of the binary string, we cannot proceed.\n\n        However, note the example: \n            In the first test case, if we interpret the string as little-endian (LSB first) then m=1, and the answer is 3.\n            In the second test case, if we interpret the string as little-endian then m=11, and the example says the answer is 27.\n\n        The problem statement does not specify the endianness.\n\n        But look at the example: \n            \"In the first test case\" note: \"m = 20 = 1\"\n\n        This suggests that the binary representation is given in the order from most significant to least significant? Or the other way around?\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        In mathematics, the binary representation of a number is usually written with the most significant bit first. \n\n        However, the example input for the first test case: \n            n=2, m=2 (if we take the string as big-endian) but the example output is 3 (which is for m=1 if we take the string as little-endian).\n\n        And the example input for the second test case: \n            n=5, string \"11010\" -> if big-endian: m=16+8+0+2+0=26, and if little-endian: m=0+4+0+2+1=7? Wait, no:\n\n        Let me clarify the two interpretations:\n\n        Interpretation 1: Big-endian (first char is the most significant)\n            n=5, string \"11010\": \n                positions (from left to right): 4,3,2,1,0 (exponents: 4 down to 0)\n                m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\n        Interpretation 2: Little-endian (first char is the least significant)\n            n=5, string \"11010\":\n                positions (from left to right): 0,1,2,3,4 (exponents: 0 to 4)\n                m = 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^4 = 1+2+8 = 11.\n\n        The example note for the second test case says: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\", so they are saying m=11.\n\n        Therefore, the problem intended the binary string to be in little-endian order? \n\n        But wait, the example note says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\", which is consistent with little-endian (then m=1) but inconsistent with big-endian (then m=2).\n\n        However, the problem statement does not specify endianness. \n\n        But the example outputs are:\n\n            First test case: \n                Input: n=2, a=[3,8], m_string=\"10\" -> output 3.\n\n            Second test case:\n                Input: n=5, a=[17,0,10,2,1], m_string=\"11010\" -> output 27.\n\n        How can we achieve these outputs?\n\n        For the first test case with little-endian: \n            n=2, string \"10\": \n                m = 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 1.\n            Then x in [0,1]: \n                x=0 -> 0\n                x=1 -> a0=3\n            So output 3.\n\n        For the second test case with little-endian:\n            n=5, string \"11010\": \n                m = 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8+2+1 = 11? \n            But wait, the string is \"11010\", so the first character is '1' (at exponent 0) and the last is '0' (at exponent 4). \n            m = 1*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 + 1*8 + 0*16 = 1+2+8 = 11.\n\n            Then we consider x from 0 to 11.\n\n            The maximum is achieved by x=5 (which is 00101 in 5-bit little-endian? Actually, no: the bits are numbered from 0 (LSB) to n-1 (MSB). \n\n            How do we represent 5 in base-2? Normally, we don't specify the endianness for the number itself, but for the array a and the binary representation of m.\n\n            In the function f(x), the bits are still the same: the i-th bit (from the least significant) is the one for 2^i.\n\n            However, the constraint is that x <= m, where m is given by the binary string (little-endian) and the bits of x are the same as usual.\n\n            Now, how do we compute f(x)? We use the same bit representation as usual.\n\n            But note: the array a is provided for bit0, bit1, ... bit4 (the same as the exponents). \n\n            Then for x=5 (which is 101 in base2, but in terms of bits: \n                bit0: 1, bit1: 0, bit2: 1, bit3: 0, bit4: 0 (since 5 < 16, so bit4 is 0)\n\n            Then f(5) = a0 (for bit0) + a2 (for bit2) = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\n        Therefore, the problem uses the binary string in little-endian order (first character is the least significant bit).\n\n        However, the problem statement does not say that. But the examples match.\n\n        Conclusion: \n            The binary string is given in little-endian order (the first character is the least significant bit, i.e., 2^0, the next is 2^1, etc.)\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Read n.\n        2. Read the list a of n integers.\n        3. Read the binary string s (without spaces) of length n.\n\n        4. Convert the binary string (little-endian) to an integer m:\n            m = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if s[i] == '1':\n                    m += (1 << i)   # because the first char (index0) is 2^0, the next 2^1, etc.\n\n        However, note: the problem says x from 0 to m (inclusive). But m can be as large as (2^n - 1) (if all bits are 1) and n up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over all x.\n\n        We need to solve: \n            maximize f(x) = sum_{i: the i-th bit is set in x} a_i, subject to 0 <= x <= m.\n\n        But note: the array a is given for each bit i (from 0 to n-1). \n\n        However, the constraint is that x <= m, and m is given by a binary number (in little-endian) of n bits.\n\n        But wait, note: the problem says the binary representation of m is of length n. This means that m is less than 2^n? Actually, the maximum value of m is (2^n - 1) (if all bits are 1). \n\n        However, the problem says: \"for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m\".\n\n        The function f(x) is linear in the bits. We want to choose x (with x<=m) that maximizes the sum of a_i for which the i-th bit is set.\n\n        This is a classic digit DP problem.\n\n        Let me define:\n            Let b_i be the i-th bit of m (in little-endian: the first bit is the least significant, so b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1})\n\n        We can think of x as having n bits (from bit0 to bit_{n-1}), and beyond that, higher bits are not allowed because m is represented with n bits (so x is at most (1<<n)-1, but actually m is given by the n bits, so x can be any number from 0 to m).\n\n        However, note: the problem says the binary representation of m is given as a string of length n. This means that m is exactly the number represented by these n bits (in little-endian). \n\n        We can use a greedy approach or dynamic programming to consider the bits from 0 to n-1.\n\n        But note: the bits are independent except for the constraint x<=m.\n\n        We can consider the following:\n\n            Let dp[i][tight] be the maximum sum we can achieve from bit0 to bit i, where tight=1 means that the prefix is exactly the prefix of m (so we cannot exceed m in the remaining bits) and tight=0 means we can use any bits.\n\n        However, n can be up to 10^5, and we have two states, so we can do a DP with O(n) states.\n\n        But the state is tight (0/1) and we process each bit (from 0 to n-1). \n\n        Steps for DP:\n\n            Precompute the integer m (from the binary string) and also the bits of m (from least to most).\n\n            Let bits = list(map(int, list(s)))   # this gives [b0, b1, b2, ..., b_{n-1}] where b0 is the least significant.\n\n            But wait, our m was computed by adding (1<<i) for each set bit. Alternatively, we can store the bits of m as:\n                m_bits[i] = the i-th bit (from LSB) of m.\n\n            However, we already have the string s, and we know that the i-th character (0-indexed) is the bit for 2^i.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            Let dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can achieve from bit0 to bit i (we have processed i+1 bits, from 0 to i) under the condition that the prefix is equal to the prefix of m (if tight=1) or strictly less (if tight=0).\n\n            Base: dp[-1][tight] = 0 (after processing all bits)\n\n            Transition for bit i (0-indexed):\n\n                Consider two possibilities for the current bit (if tight, then we cannot set a bit that makes x exceed m; else we can set arbitrarily).\n\n                However, note: the array a is provided for each bit i (the i-th element is a_i, which corresponds to 2^i).\n\n            But wait: the array a is given as [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}], and the i-th bit (when set) adds a_i.\n\n            However, note: the function f(x) adds a_i for every bit i that is set. \n\n            But in the DP, we are processing the bits from 0 to n-1 (the least significant to the most). \n\n            We have two choices for the current bit i: set it or not, but subject to the constraint.\n\n            However, the constraint is that x <= m, and m is given by the n bits (little-endian).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Let's define:\n                    m_bits = list(map(int, s))[::-1]   # Now, if we do this, then m_bits[0] is the most significant bit? \n\n                Alternatively, let's keep the bits as given (little-endian) and process from i=0 to i=n-1.\n\n                Let m_i = the i-th bit of m (the one for 2^i). From the string s, the i-th character (at index i) is the bit for 2^i.\n\n                Then, for bit i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1):\n\n                    Let current_bit_m = int(s[i])\n\n                    We consider two cases for tight:\n\n                    Case 1: tight = 0 (we are already below m)\n                        Then we can set the current bit to 0 or 1.\n\n                        If we set the current bit to 1, then we add a_i.\n                        Then the state for the next bit is still tight=0.\n\n                        If we set the current bit to 0, then we don't add a_i and the next state is tight=0.\n\n                    Case 2: tight = 1 (we have matched the prefix so far)\n                        Then we can set the current bit to 0 or 1, but:\n\n                        - If we set the current bit to 1, then we must check: is 1 <= current_bit_m? \n                            If current_bit_m is 1, then setting to 1 is okay and the next state remains tight=1.\n                            If current_bit_m is 0, then we cannot set to 1 (because then x would exceed m) -> so we must set to 0.\n\n                        - If we set the current bit to 0, then if current_bit_m is 1, then the next state becomes tight=0 (because we set a bit to 0 while m had 1, so the rest can be arbitrary). \n                          But if current_bit_m is 0, then setting to 0 keeps tight=1.\n\n                However, note: we are processing from the least significant bit to the most significant? \n\n                But wait, the constraint is: x <= m. In the usual way, we compare numbers by their binary representation (from the most significant bit to the least). \n\n                However, our m is given in little-endian, and we are processing from the least significant (low bits) to the most significant (high bits). \n\n                This is the opposite of how we compare numbers. \n\n                Example: \n                    m (little-endian) = \"11010\" (meaning m=11) and x=5 (binary 101) -> but wait, 5 in little-endian for 5 bits is the same as the usual representation? \n\n                Actually, the number x is the same regardless of the order we write the bits. The constraint x<=m is independent of the order.\n\n                However, the DP above is designed for the usual big-endian (most significant first) because we are propagating the tight condition from high bits to low bits.\n\n                But here, we are processing from low bits (LSB) to high bits (MSB). \n\n                This is problematic because the constraint is naturally defined from the most significant bit. \n\n                We need to process the bits from the most significant to the least significant? \n\n                But the problem: the array a is given for each bit i (from 0 to n-1) and the i-th bit is the one for 2^i. \n\n                However, the constraint x<=m is defined by the entire n-bit number.\n\n                Alternate approach:\n\n                Let's reverse the bits to big-endian (so that the first bit we process is the most significant).\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Let m_big = the big-endian representation of m (so the first character of the original string is the most significant? No, the original string is little-endian).\n\n                Actually, we have the little-endian string s (length n). To get the big-endian representation, we reverse it.\n\n                Then, we can do a DP that goes from the most significant bit (which is s_big[0]) to the least significant (s_big[n-1]).\n\n                Then, the state would be:\n\n                  dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i (now being the most significant processed) to the least significant.\n\n                But note: the array a is given in the order of the bit index (the i-th element is for the bit with weight 2^i). \n\n                However, when we reverse the bits, the bit that was originally at index i (weight 2^i) will now be at index n-1-i (if we reverse the entire string) and have a weight 2^(n-1-i) in the big-end",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of elements from array \\( a \\) based on the bits set in \\( x \\), where \\( x \\) must be less than or equal to \\( m \\). The key insight is that each bit set in \\( x \\) contributes the corresponding element from \\( a \\) to the sum. The challenge is to efficiently determine the optimal combination of bits to set without checking every possible \\( x \\) up to \\( m \\), which could be computationally expensive for large \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves processing the bits of \\( m \\) from the most significant to the least significant, using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum achievable under the constraint that \\( x \\leq m \\). The DP state will consider whether the current prefix of \\( x \\) is strictly less than the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\) (allowing more flexibility in subsequent bits) or exactly matches \\( m \\)'s prefix (requiring careful selection of subsequent bits).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a dynamic programming approach where the state is defined by the current bit position and a boolean indicating if the prefix of \\( x \\) is tightly bound to \\( m \\)'s prefix. For each bit, we decide to set it or not, updating the DP state accordingly. The decision to set a bit depends on whether we are still tight to \\( m \\) and the corresponding bit in \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits. This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n\n    m = 0\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '1':\n            m += (1 << i)\n\n    dp_tight = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp_loose = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    m_bits = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        m_bits[i] = 1 if (m >> i) & 1 else 0\n\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        bit_val = a_list[i]\n        m_bit = m_bits[i]\n        next_dp_tight = 0\n        next_dp_loose = 0\n        \n        if dp_loose[i + 1] > -10**18:\n            next_dp_loose = dp_loose[i + 1]\n        if dp_tight[i + 1] > -10**18:\n            next_dp_tight = dp_tight[i + 1]\n        \n        option_set = -10**18\n        if m_bit == 1:\n            option_set = bit_val + next_dp_tight\n            if next_dp_loose != -10**18:\n                option_set = max(option_set, bit_val + next_dp_loose)\n        else:\n            option_set = next_dp_tight\n            if next_dp_loose != -10**18:\n                option_set = max(option_set, next_dp_loose)\n        \n        option_not_set = -10**18\n        if m_bit == 1:\n            option_not_set = next_dp_loose\n            if next_dp_tight != -10**18:\n                option_not_set = max(option_not_set, next_dp_tight)\n        else:\n            option_not_set = next_dp_loose\n            if next_dp_tight != -10**18:\n                option_not_set = max(option_not_set, next_dp_tight)\n        \n        dp_tight[i] = option_not_set if m_bit == 0 else option_set\n        dp_loose[i] = max(option_set, option_not_set)\n    \n    print(max(dp_tight[0], dp_loose[0]))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Binary Conversion**: The binary string is converted into an integer \\( m \\) by interpreting each bit's position correctly (little-endian order).\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Two arrays, `dp_tight` and `dp_loose`, are initialized to store the maximum sum achievable when the current prefix of \\( x \\) is exactly matching or strictly less than \\( m \\)'s prefix, respectively.\n4. **Processing Bits**: The algorithm processes each bit from the least significant to the most significant.
