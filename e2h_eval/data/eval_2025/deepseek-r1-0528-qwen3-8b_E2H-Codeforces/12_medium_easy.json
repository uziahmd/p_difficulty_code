The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can think of the ring as:\n   From house i, moving clockwise: \n      next house is (i % n) + 1, but note: if i == n, then next is 1.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise.\n\n Important: The tasks must be done in the given order. After completing a task, she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i (but note: the condition is automatically satisfied by processing in order).\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" — meaning that we must do the tasks in increasing index order. So we are given an array a[0..m-1] and we must visit the locations in the order of the array.\n\n However, note that Xenia starts at house 1. Then for each task, we have to move from the current house to the next task's house (along the ring, clockwise). Also, note that the ring has n houses, so the distance between two houses i and j (if we consider the ring as circular) can be calculated as:\n\n   Let d(i, j) = (j - i) % n   but wait, because we are moving clockwise, if j < i, then we can go from i to j by going through the end and wrap around? Actually, the clockwise distance from i to j is:\n        If j >= i: then distance = j - i.\n        If j < i: then distance = (n - i) + j.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the distance as (j - i) mod n, but note that if j-i is negative, then we add n and then take modulo n? Actually, the clockwise distance from i to j is (j - i) if j>=i, and (j - i + n) % n if j < i. However, note that the modulus approach for positive distances: \n        d = (j - i) % n   doesn't work because when j < i, (j-i) is negative. Instead, we can do:\n        d = (j - i + n) % n   but wait, that gives the shortest distance? No, because we are constrained to move clockwise only.\n\n Actually, since we can only move clockwise, the distance from i to j is:\n        If j >= i: d = j - i.\n        If j < i: d = (n - i) + j.\n\n But note: the ring has n houses, so the total distance from i to j (clockwise) is (j - i) mod n, but if negative, we adjust by adding n until positive? Actually, we can also compute as:\n        d = (j - i) % n\n        However, if j < i, then (j-i) is negative, so (j-i) % n is (j-i+n) which is positive and equals (j+n-i). But note: the clockwise distance from i to j (with j < i) is (n - i + j). So yes, that matches.\n\n But wait, let me check: \n        Example: n=4, i=3, j=2 -> d = (2-3+4) % 4 = (3) %4 = 3. And indeed, from 3: 3->4 (1), 4->1 (2), 1->2 (3) -> total 3.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation for negative might give the correct nonnegative value, but we don't want the modulus to give a value that is the shortest path in both directions. We are only allowed to move clockwise, so we must use the entire ring? Actually, no, we can't go counterclockwise. Therefore, the clockwise distance from i to j is:\n        d = (j - i) % n\n        But if j >= i, then (j-i) % n = j-i (since j-i is between 0 and n-1). If j < i, then (j-i) % n = j-i+n (because j-i is negative, so adding n makes it positive and less than n). \n\n However, note that the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n        (j - i) % n is always nonnegative and less than n.\n\n But wait, is that the same as the clockwise distance? In our example: \n        n=4, i=3, j=2: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> which is correct.\n\n However, we must note that the distance from i to j is exactly (j - i) % n, but if we use modulus, then we are effectively getting the number of steps to move from i to j in the clockwise direction. \n\n BUT: wait, what if we have to traverse the entire ring? For example, from house 1 to house 1: (1-1)%n = 0, which is correct. From house 1 to house 2: (2-1)%4=1, correct. From house 1 to house 4: (4-1)%4=3, correct. From house 4 to house 1: (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1? Wait, that's not correct. Because from 4 to 1: we can only move clockwise: 4->1 is one step? Actually, no: the houses are arranged as 1,2,3,4 and then back to 1. So from 4, the next house is 1. Therefore, the clockwise distance from 4 to 1 is 1.\n\n Let me recast: the ringroad has n houses. The movement from house i to house j (clockwise) is defined as:\n        Let k = (j - i) % n\n        But if k is negative, we add n until positive. However, in modular arithmetic, (j-i) % n already gives a value in [0, n-1]. But note: from house 4 (i=4) to house 1 (j=1): \n                (1-4) % 4 = (-3) % 4 = 1 (because -3 + 4 = 1). \n        So that gives 1, which is correct.\n\n However, wait: from house 4 to house 1: \n        Steps: 4 -> 1. That's one step.\n\n But what if we go from house 4 to house 2?\n        (2-4)%4 = (-2)%4 = 2 (because -2+4=2). \n        Steps: 4->1 (1), 1->2 (2) -> total 2. Correct.\n\n Therefore, the clockwise distance from i to j is (j - i) % n, but note: the modulus operation in Python for negative does the right thing.\n\n However, there's a catch: the modulus operation gives a result in [0, n-1]. But if the result is 0, then i=j, so no move. Otherwise, we get the number of steps.\n\n But wait: what about from house 1 to house 1? (1-1)%4=0, correct.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation in the way we did above is equivalent to: \n        d = (j - i) % n\n        if d == 0 and i != j: then we need to consider? Actually, if i==j then d=0, but if i != j then d is nonzero.\n\n But note: the modulus operation doesn't require i != j. It works for all cases.\n\n However, let me test with n=5, i=3, j=5: (5-3)%5=2 -> correct: 3->4->5 (2 steps)\n\n Now, the problem: we start at house 1, and we have a sequence of tasks: a0, a1, ..., a_{m-1}. We must visit these in order.\n\n We can break the journey into segments: from the current house to the next task house.\n\n The total time is the sum of the clockwise distances from the current house to the next task.\n\n However, note: we start at house 1, then go to a0, then from a0 to a1, etc.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   total_time = 0\n   current = 1\n   for each task_location in the list of tasks (which we are given in order):\n        distance = (task_location - current) % n\n        # But wait, the modulus operation might give 0 even if current != task_location? Only when (task_location - current) is a multiple of n? But n is the modulus and the difference is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n        # However, note: the modulus operation as defined above gives the clockwise distance. But if the modulus gives 0, then task_location == current (mod n) but since they are in [1, n], then task_location == current.\n\n        # However, we can use the modulus, but note: the modulus operation is defined to give a nonnegative remainder. But wait, what if task_location < current? Then (task_location - current) is negative, so we add n to make it positive. This is exactly the clockwise distance.\n\n        # But wait, there is a problem: the modulus operation in Python for (a % n) returns a value in [0, n-1]. However, the clockwise distance from current to task_location is (task_location - current + n) % n? Actually, no, because if task_location >= current, then (task_location - current) is positive and (task_location - current) % n is just task_location - current (if task_location - current < n). But note: task_location and current are in [1, n] and the maximum difference is n-1, so (task_location - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        # We can use: \n        #   d = (task_location - current) % n\n        # However, if (task_location - current) is negative, then d = (task_location - current + n) % n? Actually, the modulus operation does that.\n\n        # But wait, what if (task_location - current) is negative? Then (task_location - current) % n = (task_location - current + n) % n, and since task_location - current + n is positive and less than n? Not necessarily: \n        #   Example: task_location=1, current=2, n=4: (1-2) = -1; (-1 + 4) % 4 = 3 %4 = 3. Correct: from 2 to 1: 2->3->4->1 -> 3 steps.\n\n        # However, we can also compute without modulus: \n        #   if task_location >= current: d = task_location - current\n        #   else: d = n - current + task_location\n\n        # Both methods are equivalent.\n\n        # But note: the modulus method might be faster? Or we can use the modulus method.\n\n        # However, we must be cautious: the modulus method gives the same result as the if-else method?\n\n        # Let me test with n=4, current=2, task_location=1: \n        #   if-else: task_location < current -> d = 4-2+1 = 3.\n        #   modulus: (1-2)%4 = -1 %4 = 3 (in Python, -1 %4 = 3). Correct.\n\n        # Another: current=1, task_location=3: \n        #   if-else: 3>=1 -> d=2\n        #   modulus: (3-1)%4=2%4=2. Correct.\n\n        # Another: current=4, task_location=3: \n        #   if-else: 3<4 -> d=4-4+3=3\n        #   modulus: (3-4)%4=-1%4=3. Correct.\n\n        # So we can use either. The modulus method is simpler.\n\n   However, note: the modulus method requires that we do modulo n, but the numbers are in [1, n] so the difference is in [-n+1, n-1]. The modulus operation will adjust negative differences.\n\n   But wait: what if the modulus operation returns 0 for non-zero difference? \n        Example: current=1, task_location=1: (1-1)%n=0. Correct.\n        Example: current=1, task_location= n+1? But n+1 is not in the range [1,n]. So we are safe.\n\n   However, the input guarantees that the task_location is in [1, n].\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for loc in tasks:\n            # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to loc\n            # Option 1: using modulus\n            #   d = (loc - current) % n\n            #   But wait: if (loc - current) is negative, modulus gives the positive adjustment. However, note that the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n            #   We can use: d = (loc - current) % n   but this is the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n            # However, there's a caveat: the modulus operation returns a value in [0, n-1]. The clockwise distance from current to loc is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = loc? \n            #   But note: the ringroad is one-way and we can only move forward. The modulus operation as defined above gives the exact number of steps (without wrapping more than once) because the ring is fixed.\n\n            # But wait, what if the distance is more than n? Actually, because we are in a ring of n, the maximum distance should be n-1. So modulus gives the minimal representation.\n\n            # However, let me test with a large jump: \n            #   current=1, loc= n-1, n=100000 -> (n-1-1) % n = (99998) % 100000 -> 99998, which is correct.\n\n            #   current=n, loc=1: (1-n) % n = (1-n+n) % n = 1 % n = 1? \n            #   But wait, (1-n) % n: \n            #       1-n is negative, so (1-n) % n = (1-n + n) % n? Actually, the modulus operation in Python: \n            #           a % n = a - floor(a/n)*n   for a negative, floor goes to -infinity? Actually, for negative a, it returns a result in [0, n-1] such that (a % n) + n*k = a for some k.\n\n            #   Actually, for a=-99, n=100: (-99 % 100) = 1 (because -99 + 100 = 1, and 1 is in [0,99]). So for current=n, loc=1: (1-n) % n = (1-n + n) % n? No, actually: \n            #       (1-n) % n = (1 - n) % n = (1) % n (if we subtract n once) but wait: \n            #       1-n = -(n-1). Then (-(n-1)) % n = n - (n-1) = 1. So that's correct.\n\n            #   Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n            d = (loc - current) % n\n            # But wait: if d==0, then we don't need to move. However, if d==0 and current != loc, that cannot happen because if current != loc then (loc-current) is not divisible by n? Actually, in our case, current and loc are in [1, n] and the difference is not divisible by n (unless they are the same modulo n, but they are distinct numbers in [1, n]). So d==0 only when loc==current.\n\n            total_time += d\n            current = loc   # update current to the current task's location\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n But wait, let's test with the provided examples:\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n        Steps:\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n          Start at current=1.\n\n          First task: loc=3\n            d = (3-1)%4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n\n          Second task: loc=2\n            d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> total_time=2+3=5, current=2.\n\n          Third task: loc=3\n            d = (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total_time=6.\n\n          Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n        Steps:\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n          Start at current=1.\n\n          First task: loc=2\n            d = (2-1)%4 = 1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n\n          Second task: loc=3\n            d = (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n\n          Third task: loc=3\n            d = 0 -> total_time=2.\n\n          Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n However, note: the modulus operation is efficient and works for n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says that the ringroad is built along the main ringroad with n houses, and the movement from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit of time.\n\n We are calculating the clockwise distance as (loc - current) % n. However, note that the modulus operation is defined for negative numbers and we are getting the correct positive distance.\n\n However, there is an alternative: we can avoid modulus by doing:\n\n        if loc >= current:\n            d = loc - current\n        else:\n            d = n - current + loc\n\n But the modulus method is concise and clear.\n\n But note: the modulus operation is a bit expensive? Probably negligible for 10^5 operations. However, we can use the if-else which might be faster.\n\n However, let's stick to the modulus method because it's short and clear.\n\n But wait: the modulus operation might be slower than a simple subtraction and addition? \n\n Considering that we are doing 10^5 iterations, and modulus is a single operation (though it involves division under the hood for negative numbers?), but in practice for numbers in the range [-n+1, n-1] (which is about [-100000, 100000]) the modulus operation might be acceptable.\n\n However, I'll write the code with the modulus method.\n\n But note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python is well-defined and efficient for numbers of this size.\n\n Let me run a quick test on the modulus method with n=10**5 and a worst-case scenario (alternating high and low) to ensure it doesn't time out.\n\n However, 10^5 iterations is acceptable in Python.\n\n Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        current = 1\n        time = 0\n        for a in arr:\n            # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to a\n            # Using modulus: (a - current) % n\n            d = (a - current) % n\n            # But wait: what if (a - current) is negative? The modulus will adjust it to the positive equivalent.\n\n            # However, note: if a==current, then d=0, which is correct.\n\n            time += d\n            current = a\n\n        print(time)\n\n However, wait: there's a catch. The modulus operation in the way we defined does not account for the fact that the ringroad has n houses. But we've tested with examples and it matches.\n\n But let me test with a different example: \n        n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1]\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Step1: a=5 -> d=(5-1)%5=4 -> time=4, current=5.\n        Step2: a=4 -> d=(4-5)%5 = (-1)%5=4 -> time=8, current=4.\n        Step3: a=3 -> d=(3-4)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=12, current=3.\n        Step4: a=2 -> d=(2-3)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=16, current=2.\n        Step5: a=1 -> d=(1-2)%5=(-1)%5=4 -> time=20.\n\n        Now, let's calculate manually: \n            Start at 1.\n            1->5: 1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps)\n            5->4: 5->1->2->3->4 (4 steps)\n            4->3: 4->5->1->2->3 (4 steps)\n            3->2: 3->4->5->1->2 (4 steps)\n            2->1: 2->3->4->5->1 (4 steps)\n\n            Total: 4*5 = 20. Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation in the above example for the last step: \n        (1-2)%5 = -1%5 = 4, which is the correct clockwise distance from 2 to 1.\n\n Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            # Compute the clockwise distance from current to t\n            d = (t - current) % n\n            total_time += d\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n But wait: is it possible that (t - current) % n is negative? No, because modulus operation in Python returns nonnegative. \n\n However, note: the modulus operation for positive numbers: \n        (t - current) is positive, then modulus n returns the same value if t-current < n, which is always true because the maximum difference is n-1 (if t=current+n, but t is at most n, so t-current <= n-1). So modulus doesn't change positive values.\n\n Therefore, we can also write:\n\n        if t >= current:\n            d = t - current\n        else:\n            d = n - current + t\n\n But the modulus method is concise.\n\n However, note that the modulus operation might be slightly slower than the if-else for positive numbers (because modulus is a general operation). But the if-else would require a branch for every iteration.\n\n Let me compare with the if-else version:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                d = t - current\n            else:\n                d = n - current + t\n            total_time += d\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n This is equally clear and perhaps slightly faster. \n\n Which one to choose? Both are O(m) and m is up to 10^5. \n\n Since the problem constraints are 10^5, and both are linear, we can choose either.\n\n However, note: the modulus method might be considered more elegant, but the if-else is more explicit and avoids the modulus operation (which might be seen as a slight overhead). \n\n But in practice, the modulus operation is very fast. \n\n Let me test with a worst-case scenario of 10^5 tasks, and see if there's any noticeable difference.\n\n But the problem says that n and m can be up to 10^5, so we must be efficient. The if-else method does two comparisons and one subtraction (or two subtractions and one addition in the else branch). The modulus operation does a modulus which is a bit more complex.\n\n However, the modulus operation for numbers in the range [-n, n] (where n is 10^5) is still very fast.\n\n But to be safe, we can use the if-else method.\n\n However, I'll stick to the modulus method for clarity and brevity.\n\n But wait: the modulus method might not be entirely obvious to readers? \n\n Since the problem is from a competition, and the modulus method is mathematically sound, we can use it.\n\n However, let me read the problem statement again: the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. The modulus method exactly captures the clockwise distance.\n\n Therefore, I decide to use the modulus method.\n\n But wait, there's an alternative: we can use the fact that the clockwise distance is (t - current) if t>=current, and (t - current + n) if t<current. But note: (t - current + n) is the same as (t - current) % n? Actually, the modulus operation does that adjustment.\n\n However, the modulus operation does the adjustment automatically.\n\n Final decision: use the modulus method.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined to return a result in [0, n-1]. This is exactly what we need.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples and edge cases.\n\n Edge case: n=2, m=1, task=[1]\n        d = (1-1)%2=0 -> time=0. Correct.\n\n Edge case: n=2, m=1, task=[2]\n        d = (2-1)%2=1 -> time=1. Correct.\n\n Edge case: n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n        Start at 1.\n        First: d=(2-1)%2=1 -> time=1, current=2.\n        Second: d=(1-2)%2 = (-1)%2=1 -> time=2. \n        Manually: 1->2 (1 step), then 2->1 (1 step). Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for a in tasks:\n            d = (a - current) % n\n            total_time += d\n            current = a\n        print(total_time)\n\n However, wait: what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n But note: the modulus operation for n=1 is undefined in our reasoning because the ring would have one house. But the constraint says n>=2.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n But wait: I just thought of an issue. The modulus operation for (a - current) % n is the same as (a - current) mod n, but note that in mathematics, the modulus operation for negative numbers can be defined differently. However, in Python, the definition is:\n\n        a % n = a - floor(a / n) * n\n\n For negative a: \n        floor(-1/4) = floor(-0.25) = -1, so (-1)%4 = -1 - (-1)*4 = -1 +4 = 3.\n\n This matches our requirement.\n\n But note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses. The clockwise distance from current to a is defined as the number of edges we traverse. In the modulus method, we are effectively computing the displacement modulo n, but in the positive direction.\n\n Since the problem is solved by the examples and the reasoning, we are confident.\n\n However, I just ran into a potential issue: the modulus operation might be giving the same result as the clockwise distance, but note that the clockwise distance in a ring of n houses from current to a is the smallest nonnegative solution to (current + d) ≡ a (mod n) and d in [0, n-1]. This is exactly what we are computing.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: let me test with a big jump that wraps multiple times? Actually, the ring is fixed and we can only move clockwise. The modulus operation gives the minimal positive distance (the direct clockwise distance) and we don't consider multiple wraps because the ring is cyclic and the modulus operation naturally gives the minimal representation.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation gives the minimal positive residue, which is the minimal clockwise distance.\n\n But wait, is it minimal? Consider: \n        n=4, current=1, a=3: (3-1)%4=2 -> minimal clockwise distance is 2 (which is the minimal because the other direction would be 2 steps too, but we are not allowed to go counterclockwise). \n\n        But wait, the problem does not allow counterclockwise, so the clockwise distance is fixed.\n\n        However, the modulus operation does not give the minimal distance in terms of steps if we were allowed to go both ways. But here, we are only allowed to go clockwise, so the distance is fixed by the modulus.\n\n        Actually, the modulus operation gives the clockwise distance as defined.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: the example above (n=4, current=1, a=3) has two paths: clockwise 1->2->3 (2 steps) and counterclockwise 1->4->3 (2 steps). However, the problem restricts to clockwise, so we must take the clockwise path. And the modulus operation gives 2, which is the clockwise steps.\n\n However, in the example with n=4, current=3, a=2: \n        The clockwise path: 3->4->1->2 (3 steps). \n        The modulus: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3. Correct.\n\n So the modulus method is correct.\n\n I'll write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation is defined for any integers, and our numbers are positive and within [1, n]. The difference (a - current) is in the range [1-n, n-1]. The modulus operation will convert negative differences to positive by adding n until the result is in [0, n-1].\n\n This is the desired behavior.\n\n Therefore, the final code is as above.\n\n But wait: the modulus operation in Python for (a - current) % n is the same as (a - current + n) % n? Actually, no. The modulus operation is defined as the remainder after dividing by n. The expression (a - current) % n is computed directly.\n\n However, we can also compute (a - current + n) % n, which would give the same result because:\n\n        (a - current) % n = (a - current + k*n) % n for any integer k.\n\n        We can choose k to be the smallest integer such that (a - current + k*n) is nonnegative. But the modulus operation does that automatically.\n\n        So (a - current) % n is the same as (a - current + n) % n? \n\n        Let me test: \n            a=2, current=3, n=4: \n                (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3.\n                (2-3+4)%4 = (3)%4=3.\n\n        Yes, they are the same.\n\n        But note: if we do (a - current + n) % n, then we are effectively ensuring the result is in [0, n-1] (because adding n once might be enough for negative, but if the result is still negative, we would have to add n again). However, the modulus operation handles that.\n\n        Actually, the modulus operation is defined to return the remainder in the range [0, n-1]. \n\n        But in our calculation, we are only concerned with the clockwise distance, which is the minimal positive steps. The modulus operation gives that.\n\n        Therefore, we can also write: d = (a - current + n) % n\n\n        However, if (a - current) is positive and less than n, then (a - current + n) % n = (a - current + n) which is greater than n, so then modulus n gives (a - current) because (a - current + n) % n = (a - current) % n + (n % n) % n? \n\n        Actually, (a - current + n) % n = (a - current) % n, because n % n = 0, and (a - current + n) = (a - current) + n, and (a - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        Example: a=3, current=1, n=4: \n            (3-1+4) %4 = 6%4=2, which is the same as (3-1)%4=2.\n\n        But wait, that's because 6 %4 = 2. \n\n        However, we don't need to add n because the modulus operation already normalizes the negative. \n\n        But adding n and then modulus is the same as just modulus. \n\n        However, sometimes adding n is used to force a positive value, but modulus does that anyway.\n\n        Therefore, we can use either.\n\n        But note: if (a - current) is positive, then (a - current) % n is the same as (a - current) if (a - current) < n, and (a - current) % n is (a - current) - n * floor((a-current)/n) but since (a - current) < n, floor((a-current)/n)=0.\n\n        So the modulus operation is safe.\n\n Conclusion: the modulus method is correct and efficient.\n\n Let me write the code with modulus.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the ringroad has n houses, and the movement from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit of time. We are counting the number of edges traversed.\n\n The modulus operation gives the number of edges (because moving from house i to i+1 is one edge, and the modulus operation counts the steps modulo n, which is the ring length).\n\n Therefore, we output the total_time.\n\n But wait: what if the modulus operation returns 0 for a non-zero distance? It shouldn't because if a != current, then (a - current) is not divisible by n (since |a - current| < n, except when a - current is negative and then we add n to get a positive number, and then the modulus is in [0, n-1]). \n\n        Example: a=1, current=1 -> 0. Correct.\n        Example: a=2, current=1 -> 1. Correct.\n\n        Example: a=1, current=2 -> (1-2)%n = -1 % n = n-1. Correct.\n\n        Example: a=3, current=5, n=10 -> (3-5)%10 = -2 %10 = 8. \n                Clockwise from 5: 5->6->7->8->9->10->1->2->3 -> 8 steps. Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        cur = 1\n        ans = 0\n        for x in arr:\n            # Calculate the clockwise distance from cur to x\n            ans += (x - cur) % n\n            cur = x\n        print(ans)\n\n However, wait: in the example above (n=10, cur=5, x=3), we get (3-5)%10 = -2 %10 = 8. Correct.\n\n But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined as above.\n\n However, there is a potential performance concern: the modulus operation might be more expensive than a conditional branch. But 10^5 operations is acceptable in Python.\n\n But let me try to run a worst-case scenario in my head: 10^5 modulus operations for numbers in the range [-100000, 100000] (which is the range of the differences). This is acceptable.\n\n However, there is an alternative: we can use the if-else to avoid modulus for positive differences.\n\n        if x >= cur:\n            ans += x - cur\n        else:\n            ans += n - cur + x\n\n This avoids modulus and uses two additions and one comparison per iteration.\n\n Let me test with the same examples:\n\n        Example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n          cur=1, x=3: 3>=1 -> ans+=2, cur=3 -> ans=2.\n          x=2: 2<3 -> ans += 4-3+2 = 1+2=3 -> ans=5.\n          x=3: 3>=3 -> ans += 0 -> ans=5? Wait, no: \n                Actually, 3>=3 is true, so we do: ans += 3-3=0 -> ans=5.\n\n          But wait, the expected answer was 6.\n\n          What's wrong?\n\n          In the first example, the steps were:\n                1->3: 2 steps\n                3->2: 3 steps (because from 3 to 2: 3->4->1->2, which is 3 steps)\n                2->3: 1 step\n\n          Total 2+3+1=6.\n\n          In the if-else method:\n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a ringroad with `n` houses arranged in a clockwise order. The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. The challenge is to calculate the total distance she travels while visiting each task location in the given order, starting from house number 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The ringroad is structured such that moving from house `i` to house `j` clockwise requires `(j - i) % n` steps if `j >= i`, otherwise `(j - i + n) % n` steps. This formula accounts for the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Intuition**: For each task location, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house. Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate through each task location, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic, and accumulate the total time.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task once, performing constant-time operations (modulo and addition) per task. Thus, the time complexity is O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for a in tasks:\n        d = (a - current) % n\n        total_time += d\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house number 1 (`current = 1`) and initialize `total_time` to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the clockwise distance from `current` to `a` using `(a - current) % n`. This handles both cases where `a` is ahead or behind `current` in the ring.\n   - **Update Total Time**: Add the computed distance to `total_time`.\n   - **Update Current Position**: Set `current` to `a` for the next iteration.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated `total_time`.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
