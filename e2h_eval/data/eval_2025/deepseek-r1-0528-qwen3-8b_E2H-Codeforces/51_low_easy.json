Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the target string (since we need to form both names).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the third string.\n    - If they are the same, then we can rearrange the pile to form the two names (so output \"YES\").\n    - Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should not have extra letters and we should be able to form the two names without needing more letters.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   The combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n   But note: the example input string for the third line is given as 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' (without spaces) and the example input has a single string for the third line.\n\n However, in the example provided in the problem, the third sample is given as:\n\n     BABBONATALE\n     FATHERCHRISTMAS\n     BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n And the expected output is 'NO'.\n\n But note: the example input in the problem statement is provided as:\n\n     ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n Actually, the example input format is three lines.\n\n Let's break down the first sample:\n\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n Now, let's count the letters:\n\n   Combined guest and host: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Let's break down:\n      SANTACLAUS: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> wait, actually: \n          S: 2, A: 3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n      DEDMOROZ: D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Total: \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let's break down the pile:\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   This matches the combined total.\n\n So the approach is to combine the first two strings and then compare the sorted list of the combined string with the sorted list of the third string.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   s1 = first line (guest)\n   s2 = second line (host)\n   s3 = third line (pile)\n\n   target = s1 + s2\n   if sorted(target) == sorted(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n However, what if there are extra letters? Then sorted(s3) would have more elements. Similarly, if there are missing letters, then sorted(target) would have more elements.\n\n Example 2:\n\n   Input:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Here, the combined target string is \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Count the letters in target and compare with the pile \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        target_letters = s1 + s2\n        pile_letters = s3\n\n   But note: the example output is \"NO\" because there is an extra letter and a missing one.\n\n   Actually, let's count:\n\n        target: \n            P: 2 (from PAPA) and then no more P in the rest? \n            Let me write the target: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Break down target:\n            P: 3? (PAPA: two P's, then in JOULUPUKKI: one more P) -> actually P appears in PAPA (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset of letters in the pile matches exactly with the multiset of letters from the combined names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string. This combined string represents all the letters needed to form both names.\n3. **Compare Letter Counts**: Sort the letters of the combined string and the pile of letters. If the sorted versions are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the right letters (with the correct counts) to form both names. Otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    target = s1 + s2\n    if sorted(target) == sorted(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three strings from standard input, representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name (`s1`) and the host's name (`s2`) are concatenated into a single string (`target`), which should contain all the letters needed to form both names.\n3. **Sorting and Comparing**: The letters of the combined string (`target`) and the pile of letters (`s3`) are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions match, it means the pile has exactly the required letters (no extra or missing letters), and the output is \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter counts by leveraging sorting, which simplifies the comparison process. The solution handles all edge cases, including extra or missing letters, ensuring correctness for any valid input within the given constraints.",
