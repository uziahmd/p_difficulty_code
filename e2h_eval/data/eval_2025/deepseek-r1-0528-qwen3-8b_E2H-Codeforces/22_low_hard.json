After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. We need to find for each subject the maximum mark. Then, for each student, if in at least one subject they have the maximum mark (and note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum mark for that subject) then they are successful.\n\n However, note: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best. Being the best in a subject means having the highest mark in that subject, and note that multiple students can share the highest mark.\n\n Approach:\n - Read n and m.\n - Read the next n lines (each is a string of m characters).\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Step 1: For each subject (column), find the maximum mark (as a character, but we can compare as characters since '1' to '9' are in order).\n Step 2: For each student (row), check if there exists at least one subject (column) where the student's mark equals the maximum mark for that subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   We have 3 students and 3 subjects.\n\n   The gradebook as a grid:\n     Student0: ['2','2','3']\n     Student1: ['2','3','2']\n     Student2: ['1','1','2']\n\n   For subject0: max is '3' (from student0 and student1? Actually wait: subject0 is the first column: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'? Let me check the example.\n\n   Wait, the example input is given as:\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', ...]\n\n   But note: the example says:\n        In the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.\n\n   Here, the students are numbered from 1 to n (so index 0 is student1, index1 is student2, index2 is student3).\n\n   How the grid is arranged?\n        First row: student1 -> \"223\": so for student1, subject1: '2', subject2: '2', subject3: '3'\n        Second row: student2 -> \"232\": subject1: '2', subject2: '3', subject3: '2'\n        Third row: student3 -> \"112\": subject1: '1', subject2: '1', subject3: '2'\n\n   Now, for subject1 (first column): marks are ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'. So student1 and student2 are best in subject1.\n   For subject2 (second column): marks are ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'. Only student2 is best in subject2.\n   For subject3 (third column): marks are ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'. Only student1 is best in subject3.\n\n   Now, student1: has the best in subject1 and subject3 -> successful.\n        student2: has the best in subject1 and subject2 -> successful.\n        student3: no subject -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, output 2.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject (i.e., for each column) of length m. We can do:\n\n        subjects = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_in_col = max(col)   # since '1' to '9', max will work lexicographically which is same as numerically\n\n   Then, for each student (row i), we look at each subject j: if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j], then this student is best in subject j.\n\n   However, note: we must consider that the same student might be best in multiple subjects, but we only need one.\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break   # no need to check other subjects for this student if already found one\n\n   But wait: what if a student is best in multiple subjects? Then we break after the first one, but that's okay because we only need to count the student once.\n\n   However, let me correct: we don't want to break the inner loop until we have checked all subjects for a student? Actually, we can break the inner loop as soon as we find one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a grid of marks where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. For each subject, we identify the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark in at least one subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If yes, they are counted as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values for the number of students (n) and subjects (m).\n   - Read the marks for each student into a grid (list of strings).\n   - For each subject (column), determine the highest mark.\n   - For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If found, increment the success count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves two main steps: computing maximum marks for each subject (O(n*m)) and checking each student's marks against these maxima (O(n*m)). Thus, the overall complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n        \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        found = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all student marks in that column.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, we check if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If so, the student is counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine success, leveraging simple loops and comparisons for clarity and correctness.",
