Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour.\n   - After burning, each candle becomes a burned candle.\n   - Then, we can take 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   burned_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the burned candles to create more candles, which then become burned after burning.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We start with 'a' candles. They will burn for 'a' hours and then we have 'a' burned candles.\n   Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles from these burned ones, and we are left with a % b burned candles.\n\n But note: the process can be repeated because the newly formed candles will also burn and become burned.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total = 0\n   Let leftover = 0\n   While current_candles > 0:\n        total += current_candles   # because each candle gives one hour\n        leftover += current_candles\n        current_candles = leftover // b   # we form new candles from the leftover burned ones\n        leftover = leftover % b\n\n However, there is a more efficient way without looping too many times.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   hours = a\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= b:\n        new_candles = candles // b\n        hours += new_candles\n        candles = candles % b + new_candles\n\n But wait, let's test with the example: a=4, b=2.\n\n   Step 1: hours = 4, candles = 4\n        Since 4>=2 -> enter loop\n        new_candles = 4//2 = 2\n        hours = 4+2 = 6\n        candles = 4%2 (which is 0) + 2 = 2\n        Now, 2>=2 -> again\n        new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n        hours = 6+1 = 7\n        candles = 0 + 1 = 1 -> less than 2, so break.\n\n   This gives 7, which matches the sample.\n\n   Another sample: a=6, b=3\n        Start: hours=6, candles=6\n        Loop1: new_candles=6//3=2 -> hours=8, candles=0+2=2 -> break.\n        Output 8.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n        Read a and b\n        if b == 1: then we can make infinite? But note: the problem says b>=2, so we don't need to handle b==1.\n\n        hours = a\n        current = a\n        while current >= b:\n            new = current // b\n            remainder = current % b\n            hours += new\n            current = new + remainder\n            # We can continue until current < b\n\n   However, note that the above loop condition is \"while current >= b\", and we update current to (remainder + new). \n\n   But wait, in the first iteration: \n        current = a = 4, then we set current = (4 % 2) + (4//2) = 0+2 = 2, then check 2>=2 -> true.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, consider the case when b is large, say b=1000 and a=1000. Then we get:\n        hours = 1000\n        current = 1000 -> 1000//1000 = 1, so hours becomes 1001, and current becomes 0+1 = 1 -> stops.\n\n   That's correct: 1000 candles give 1000 hours, then we get 1000 burned candles which make 1 new candle (if b=1000), and that new candle burns for 1 hour, then we have 1 burned candle which isn't enough to make a new one (since we need 1000). So total 1001 hours.\n\n   But what if a=0? Then we do nothing. The input constraint says a>=1.\n\n   So we can write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that a>=1 and b>=2.\n\n   We'll read the input from stdin.\n\n   Code:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   if not data: \n        print(0)\n   else:\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n\n        hours = a\n        current = a\n        while current >= b:\n            # How",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be combined to form new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` initial candles, each burning for one hour. This gives us `a` hours of light initially.\n2. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` burned candles. We can form new candles by combining `b` burned candles into one new candle. Each new candle will again burn for one hour and become a burned candle after burning.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue the process of forming new candles from the burned ones until there are fewer than `b` burned candles left. In each iteration:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be formed (`current // b`).\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the current number of burned candles to be the remainder of the division (`current % b`) plus the new candles formed.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of burned candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be formed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the total hours by repeatedly recycling the burned candles until it's no longer possible to form new ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    hours = a\n    current = a\n    \n    while current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        hours += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + remainder\n        \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `hours` and `current` are initialized to the number of initial candles `a`. This accounts for the first round of burning.\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as there are enough burned candles (`current`) to form at least one new candle (i.e., `current >= b`).\n3. **New Candle Formation**: Inside the loop, the number of new candles is calculated as `current // b`. The remainder after this division represents the leftover burned candles that couldn't be used to form a new candle.\n4. **Update Total Hours**: The total hours are incremented by the number of new candles formed.\n5. **Update Burned Candles**: The current count of burned candles is updated to the sum of the new candles (which will now burn and become burned themselves) and any leftovers from the previous division.\n6. **Termination**: Once the loop condition fails (i.e., `current < b`), the loop exits, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis method efficiently accounts for all possible rounds of burning and recycling candles, ensuring the maximum number of hours is achieved. The complexity is logarithmic relative to the initial number of candles, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
