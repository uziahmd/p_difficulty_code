The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can think of the ring as:\n   From house i, moving clockwise: \n      next house is (i % n) + 1, but note: if i == n, then next is 1.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise.\n\n Important: The tasks must be done in the given order. After completing a task, she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i (but note: the condition is automatically satisfied by processing in order).\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" — meaning that we must do the tasks in increasing index order. So we are given a list of m task locations (each ai is the house number for the i-th task).\n\n Approach:\n We are going to traverse the tasks in order. Since the ring is circular, we can break down the movement from one task to the next.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to return to the starting point, but to complete all tasks.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Start at house 1.\n 2. For each task i, we need to go from the current house (let's call it 'cur') to house ai.\n\n But note: because the ring is circular, we have two ways to move? Actually no, because the road is one-way and clockwise. So we can only move clockwise.\n\n Therefore, the distance from a current house 'cur' to a target house 't' in a clockwise one-way ring of size n is:\n   Let d = (t - cur) % n\n   However, if (t - cur) is negative, we adjust by adding n until positive? Actually, we can compute:\n\n   If t >= cur: then distance = t - cur\n   If t < cur: then we go from cur to n, then wrap around from 1 to t: so distance = (n - cur + 1) + (t - 1) = n - cur + t\n\n Alternatively, we can use modulo arithmetic: \n   distance = (t - cur) % n\n   But wait: if t < cur, then (t - cur) is negative. Then (t - cur) % n gives a positive value? Actually, we want the clockwise distance.\n\n Let's define:\n   distance = (t - cur) % n\n   But if (t - cur) is negative, then (t - cur) % n becomes (t - cur + n) % n, which is the same as (t - cur + n). \n\n However, note: \n   Example: n=4, cur=3, t=2 -> (2-3) = -1; (-1 % 4) gives 3 in Python (since -1 % 4 = 3). But that 3 is the distance? \n        Indeed: from 3 to 2: we go 3->4->1->2: that is 3 steps, which matches.\n\n But wait, there's a catch: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers gives a non-negative result, but we want the minimal clockwise steps.\n\n Alternatively, we can calculate the distance without using modulus for negative by:\n   If t >= cur: distance = t - cur\n   Else: distance = (n - cur) + t\n\n However, we can also use: \n   distance = (t - cur) % n   if (t - cur) >= 0 then it's just that, else (t - cur + n) % n? Actually, (t - cur) % n will work because when t < cur, then (t-cur) is negative and (t-cur+n) is positive and less than n (because t>=1, cur<=n, so t-cur+n >= 1-n+n = 1, and t-cur+n <= n-1+n? Actually, wait: maximum t-curve+n is (n-1) - 1 + n = 2*n-2, which is too big. So we don't want to use modulus in that way.\n\n Actually, let's reframe: the total ring has n houses. The clockwise distance from cur to t is:\n   (t - cur) mod n, but we interpret mod to give the smallest non-negative residue. However, note that in modular arithmetic, the clockwise distance is the smallest non-negative solution to (cur + d) ≡ t (mod n). But since we are constrained to move clockwise (and we can't move counterclockwise), the distance is defined as above.\n\n Actually, we can compute:\n   d = (t - cur) % n\n   But if d == 0, then we are at t. But wait",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that since the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, the movement from one house to another must strictly follow the clockwise direction. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current house to the target house (where the task is located) in a clockwise manner.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: \n   - If the target house is greater than or equal to the current house, the distance is simply the difference between the target and current house numbers.\n   - If the target house is less than the current house, the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring (house `n`), then wrapping around from house 1 to the target house. This distance is `(n - current_house) + target_house`.\n4. **Summing Distances**: Accumulate the distances for each task to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            distance = t - current\n        else:\n            distance = (n - current) + t\n        total_time += distance\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by `m` integers representing the house numbers where each task is located.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` keeps track of the cumulative time taken to complete all tasks, starting from house 1 (`current = 1`).\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each task location `t`:\n   - If `t` is ahead of the current house in the clockwise direction (`t >= current`), the distance is `t - current`.\n   - If `t` is behind (`t < current`), the distance is the sum of moving from the current house to the end of the ring (`n - current`) and then from the start of the ring to the target house (`t`).\n4. **Updating Position**: After processing each task, update the current house to the task's location.\n5. **Output**: Print the total accumulated time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the one-way nature of the ringroad and ensures optimal performance with a linear pass through the tasks.",
