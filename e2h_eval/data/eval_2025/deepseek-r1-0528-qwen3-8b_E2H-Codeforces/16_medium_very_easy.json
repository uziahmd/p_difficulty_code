Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. Moreover, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent (and can be moved in one step) if they share a nonzero boundary segment, meaning they are separated by exactly one road.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to traverse the entire graph of blocks. Instead, we can think of the roads as separating the plane. Since we start at home and end at university, we must cross a set of roads. But note: the minimal steps correspond to the number of distinct roads we must cross? Actually, consider:\n\n In one step, we cross one road and move to an adjacent block. But sometimes, if we are between two roads, we might have to cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: the problem states that we can only move to a block that shares a nonzero border, which means we are crossing one entire road at a time.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to count the number of roads we cross. Why? Because sometimes we might have to cross two roads in two separate steps even if they are adjacent. But wait, the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n   Output: 2\n\n This means that we start at (1,1) and go to (-1,-1) with two roads: one horizontal (y=0) and one vertical (x=0). The home and university are in opposite quadrants. To get from (1,1) to (-1,-1), we must cross two roads: first either the horizontal or the vertical, then the other.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n   Output: 2\n\n Here, there are three roads: x=0, y=0, and x+y=3. The home (1,1) and university (-1,-1) are both on the side where x+y < 3 (since 1+1=2<3 and -1-1=-2<3). So the third road doesn't separate them. Therefore, we still only need to cross two roads.\n\n What is the relation?\n\n Insight: Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. For each road, we can determine on which side of the road the home and the university lie. If they are on the same side for a given road, then that road does not need to be crossed. Otherwise, we must cross that road.\n\n However, note that crossing a road moves you from one side to the other. But the problem asks for the minimum number of steps (each step crosses one road and goes to an adjacent block). Therefore, the minimal steps required is the number of roads that separate the home from the university.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are crossed in one step? No, because when you cross one road, you move to an adjacent block. Then to cross another road, you have to move again from that adjacent block. So each road that separates the two points must be crossed exactly once, and the order doesn't matter.\n\n However, note: the problem does not allow crossing two roads at the same time (unless the two roads meet at a point and you cross them at the intersection, but that would still be two separate crossings). \n\n Therefore, the answer is simply the number of roads for which the home and the university lie on opposite sides.\n\n Let's check with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0.\n     Home (1,1): 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1 > 0 (if we define the side by the sign of ax+by+ci)\n     University (-1,-1): 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite sides.\n\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n     Home (1,1): 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1 > 0\n     University (-1,-1): 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 < 0 -> opposite sides.\n\n   So two roads: answer 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n        Home: 1>0, University: -1<0 -> opposite.\n\n   Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        Home: 1>0, University: -1<0 -> opposite.\n\n   Road3: 1*x + 1*y -3 = 0 -> x+y-3=0.\n        Home: 1+1-3 = -1 <0\n        University: -1-1-3 = -5 <0 -> same side.\n\n   So two roads: answer 2.\n\n Therefore, algorithm:\n\n   Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For each road (a, b, c):\n        Evaluate the expression for home: value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        Evaluate the expression for university: value2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        Note: We don't know the sign convention, but we just need to know if they are on the same side or not.\n\n        We can do: \n          if (value1 * value2 < 0) then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Count the number of such roads.\n\n   Print the count.\n\n However, caution: what if the expression is zero? The problem states that neither home nor university lies on the road, so value1 and value2 are nonzero.\n\n But note: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple? Actually, the line equation is given as a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and we are using the same form. The sign of the expression only tells the side.\n\n However, note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the sign of the expression flips. But we are comparing the product: if one is positive and the other negative, then regardless of the scaling (as long as we use the same equation for both) the product will be negative.\n\n But wait: what if the equation is normalized? The problem does not say. However, the condition for being on the same side is that the expressions have the same sign (even if the equation is multiplied by a negative constant, then both signs flip and the product remains positive). So we can use the product.\n\n Alternatively, we can compare the signs without multiplication (to avoid potential overflow, but the numbers are up to 10^6 and n<=300, so multiplying two numbers each up to 10^6 gives up to 10^12, which is acceptable in Python for integers, but let me think: worst-case, a, b, c are 10^6, and x,y are 10^6, so the expression is 10^6*10^6 + 10^6*10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6 ~ 2e12, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n However, we can also avoid multiplication by checking the signs directly:\n\n        if (value1 < 0 and value2 > 0) or (value1 > 0 and value2 < 0):\n            count++\n\n But note: the equation might be defined with a negative leading coefficient, but the sign comparison is consistent.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the equation is a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. The side is defined by the sign of the expression. The problem does not specify which side is \"positive\", but the relative sign between the two points is what matters.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n        expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (expr1 < 0 and expr2 >= 0) or (expr1 >=0 and expr2 <0):\n            count++\n\n But wait, since the points are not on the road, we know expr1 and expr2 are nonzero. So we can use:\n\n        if (expr1 < 0) != (expr2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n This is equivalent.\n\n Let's test with example 1 for the first road (0,1,0): \n        expr1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        expr2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative\n        Condition: (1 < 0) is False, (-1 < 0) is True -> False != True -> True.\n\n So it works.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the two expressions have opposite signs (excluding zero)\n        if (expr1 < 0) != (expr2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait, is that really the answer? \n\n Let me think of a counterexample: \n\n   Consider three roads. Suppose the home and university are separated by two roads. Then we need two steps. But note: what if we have a configuration where two roads are crossed at the same time? Actually, no: the movement is defined by crossing one road at a time. And the minimal steps is the minimal number of road crossings, which is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might have to cross the same road twice? But wait, the problem says that we are moving from block to block, and the roads are fixed. Once you cross a road, you are on the other side, so you don't need to cross it again to get back. And the goal is to get to the university, so we don't want to cross a road that doesn't separate the two points.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by multiple roads, but the minimal path might be able to cross two roads at an intersection and then continue? However, note that the problem does not require to minimize the total distance, but the number of steps (each step is crossing one road). And the graph of blocks is such that two blocks are connected if they share a border (i.e., separated by one road). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads to cross, and that is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: sometimes the two points might be separated by a set of roads, but the minimal path might require crossing the same road twice if we take a different route? But observe: once you cross a road, you are on the opposite side. If the university is on the opposite side of a road, then you must cross that road exactly once (and only once). Therefore, the minimal steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n Therefore, the code above should work.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: two roads separate, output 2 -> matches.\n\n Example 2: two roads separate, output 2 -> matches.\n\n Another test case: \n   Input: \n        0 0\n        0 0\n        ... but wait, the problem says the home and university are not on the road. So we cannot have coordinates that are on the road. \n\n   But wait, the example input: \n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\n   So home is (1,1) and university is (-1,-1). \n\n   Another test: \n        n=1: one road that separates the two points -> answer 1.\n\n   Example: \n        Home (1,1), University (2,2); one road: x+y=0.\n        For home: 1+1=2>0 -> positive.\n        For university: 2+2=4>0 -> same side -> answer 0.\n\n   But wait, what if the two points are on the same side of all roads, then we don't need to cross any road? Then the answer is 0.\n\n   Example: \n        Home (1,1), University (2,2); one road: x+y=0 -> same side -> 0 steps.\n\n   That makes sense: if they are in the same block, then we don't need to move.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the roads divide the plane into connected regions (blocks)\". So if the two points are in the same block, then we don't need to cross any road.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the two points are separated by more than one road, but the minimal steps might be less if we can cross two roads at the same time? \n\n   Let me clarify: the problem says that in one step you can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. The border between two blocks is a segment of one road. Therefore, you cannot cross two roads at the same time because that would require being at an intersection (which is a point) and then you would be crossing two roads simultaneously? But the step definition says: from one block to another, and the common border must have nonzero length. An intersection is a point, and two blocks that share only a point are not allowed to be connected by a step.\n\n   Therefore, you must cross one road at a time.\n\n   Hence, the answer is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n   However, wait: consider the following configuration:\n\n        Two roads: one horizontal and one vertical, forming four quadrants.\n        Home at (1,1) and University at (-1,1). Then we must cross the vertical road (x=0) to get to the university. So one step.\n\n        But now, what if there is a third road: y=2? Then the home and university are still separated by the vertical road, and the horizontal road (y=0) does not separate them (both have y=1). The third road (y=2) does not separate them (both below). So the answer is still 1.\n\n   Now, what if the two points are separated by two roads, but they are not in the same quadrant? Then we must cross two roads.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read home and university coordinates.\n        Read n.\n        For each of the n roads:\n            Calculate the expression for home and for university.\n            If the signs of the expressions are different, then count this road.\n\n        Print count.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Important: The input format. The first two lines are the home and university, then n, then n lines of three integers.\n\n   Example input string: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   We split by newline.\n\n   Code:\n\n        lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        x1, y1 = map(int, lines[0].split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, lines[1].split())\n        n = int(lines[2])\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(3, 3+n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, lines[i].split())\n            expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if (expr1 < 0) != (expr2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        lines[0] = \"1 1\"\n        lines[1] = \"-1 -1\"\n        n = 2\n        lines[3] = \"0 1 0\"\n        lines[4] = \"1 0 0\"\n\n        For the first road (0,1,0): \n            expr1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            expr2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> count becomes 1.\n\n        For the second road (1,0,0):\n            expr1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n            expr2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> count becomes 2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   Example 2:\n        lines[0] = \"1 1\"\n        lines[1] = \"-1 -1\"\n        n = 3\n        roads: [ (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,-3) ]\n\n        First road (1,0,0): same as above -> count=1.\n        Second road (0,1,0): same as above -> count=2.\n        Third road (1,1,-3): \n            expr1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n            expr2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same side -> not counted.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, note: the equation might be given in any form. The expression a*x+b*y+c might be negative for both, but that's okay because we are only comparing the two points.\n\n   One more edge: the expression might be very large, but the numbers are within 10^6 and we are doing integer arithmetic, so it's safe.\n\n   Therefore, we output the count.\n\n   But wait: the problem statement says \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps\". And we are counting the number of roads that separate the two points. Is that the minimal steps?\n\n   Yes, because to get from one side of a road to the other, you must cross that road, and each crossing is a step. And since the steps are independent (you can cross the roads in any order), the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n   Therefore, we output the count.\n\n   However, wait: what if there is a road that separates the two points, but the two points are not directly connected by crossing that road because the road is not the only one? Actually, the graph is planar and the roads are straight lines. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points because you have to cross each separating road exactly once, and you can arrange the crossings arbitrarily (so the minimal steps is the total number of separating roads).\n\n   This is analogous to the problem of determining the minimal number of hyperplanes (or half-planes) that separate two points in an arrangement.\n\n   So we are confident.\n\n   Let's run the code with the provided examples and hope that it passes.\n\n   Note: the problem says the roads are given as aix + biy + ci = 0, and the coefficients are integers.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().strip().splitlines()\n            if not data: \n                print(0)\n                return\n            x1, y1 = map(int, data[0].split())\n            x2, y2 = map(int, data[1].split())\n            n = int(data[2])\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(3, 3+n):\n                parts = data[i].split()\n                if len(parts) < 3:\n                    continue\n                a, b, c = map(int, parts)\n                expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n                expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n                # Check the sign of the expressions for the two points.\n                if (expr1 < 0) != (expr2 < 0):\n                    count += 1\n            print(count)\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n            main()\n\n   We'll submit this.\n\n   But wait: what if the expression is zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so expr1 and expr2 are nonzero. So we don't have to worry about division by zero or anything.\n\n   However, note: the expression might be very close to zero due to floating point, but we are using integers so no problem.\n\n   This should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road that separates the two blocks. The key insight is that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed once. The minimal number of steps is the total number of such roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. This is done by evaluating the line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\) for both points. If the signs of the results differ, the road separates the two points.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves reading the coordinates of the home and university, then processing each road's coefficients. For each road, it calculates the value of the line equation at both points and checks if the signs differ. The count of roads where the signs differ gives the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\(n\\) roads (up to 300), the complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    x1, y1 = map(int, data[0].split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, data[1].split())\n    n = int(data[2])\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(3, 3 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split()\n        a, b, c = map(int, parts)\n        expr1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        expr2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (expr1 < 0) != (expr2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two lines contain the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads \\(n\\).\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are extracted. The line equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Sign Check**: The signs of the evaluated expressions determine if the points lie on the same side of the road. If the signs differ, the road is counted as separating the two points.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university from home by crossing one road per step.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution.
