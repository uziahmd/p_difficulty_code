The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length between 1 and 1000) containing only 'R','S','P'\n\n The game is played for n rounds. In each round i (from 0 to n-1):\n   Nikephoros uses the character at position (i mod m) in string A.\n   Polycarpus uses the character at position (i mod k) in string B.\n\n We need to count the total number of red spots (losses) for both players.\n\n Note: \n   - Each time a player loses, they get one red spot.\n   - Draw: no red spot for either.\n\n Rules of the game:\n   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n Approach:\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate each round.\n\n Instead, we can break down the problem:\n\n Let:\n   Let L1 = total losses for Nikephoros over n rounds.\n   Let L2 = total losses for Polycarpus over n rounds.\n\n We note that in each round, the outcome is determined by comparing A[i mod m] and B[j mod k].\n\n But note: the rounds are independent and the index for A is i % m, and for B is i % k.\n\n We can think of the entire sequence of rounds as being broken into cycles that repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds? However, note that n might not be a multiple of LCM(m,k). \n\n Alternatively, we can consider the entire sequence of rounds as a grid of (m x k) states, but note that the indices for A and B are periodic with periods m and k respectively.\n\n However, note: the round index i corresponds to (a_i, b_i) where:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n The state (i % m, i % k) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. But note: the state (x,y) occurs exactly how many times? Actually, the pair (i % m, i % k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds, and within one period (of LCM(m,k) rounds), each pair (x,y) with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] appears exactly gcd(m,k) times? Actually, the number of distinct pairs is m*k, and the period is LCM(m,k). And the frequency of each pair (x,y) is either floor(n/LCM(m,k)) * (some base count) plus the remainder part.\n\n But wait, there's a better way:\n\n We can compute the outcome for a fixed pair (x, y) (meaning A[x] vs B[y]) and then count how many times the pair (x,y) appears in the n rounds.\n\n How many times does the pair (x, y) appear?\n   The round indices i for which:\n        i % m = x   and   i % k = y.\n\n This is equivalent to solving:\n        i ≡ x (mod m)\n        i ≡ y (mod k)\n\n By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, if m and k are coprime then there is a unique solution modulo m*k. But in general, we require that the system has a solution if and only if x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k))? Actually, the condition is that (x-y) must be divisible by g = gcd(m,k) and then the solution is periodic with period LCM(m,k). \n\n However, note: we don't need to use the full CRT because we are only going to iterate over the residues. But note: n can be very large, and m,k up to 1000, so we can precompute the frequency for each pair (x,y) without iterating over all residues from 0 to n-1.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the LCM and GCD of m and k? Actually, we don't need the LCM directly.\n\n 2. We can break the n rounds into cycles of length T = LCM(m, k). Then the entire n rounds will have:\n        full_cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n 3. In each cycle (each T rounds), the pattern of pairs (A[i % m], B[i % k]) will repeat. However, note that the rounds in one cycle are from i=0 to i=T-1, and T is LCM(m,k). But the same pair (x,y) appears in the cycle at a specific set of positions. Actually, the number of times a particular pair (x,y) appears in one cycle is 1 if there exists an i in [0, T-1] such that i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k), and note that T is the least common multiple, so the solution for i (if it exists) is unique modulo T, and hence in one cycle (of T rounds) there is at most one occurrence of (x,y). Moreover, the condition for existence is that (x - y) must be divisible by g = gcd(m,k). But note: actually, the condition is that x ≡ y (mod g) for the system to have a solution.\n\n However, let me restate: the system:\n        i ≡ x (mod m)\n        i ≡ y (mod k)\n\n has a solution if and only if (x - y) is divisible by g = gcd(m,k). And if there is a solution, then there is exactly one solution modulo T.\n\n Therefore, in one cycle (of T rounds), the pair (x,y) appears exactly once if the system has a solution, and 0 otherwise.\n\n But wait, actually, the set of i satisfying i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) is an arithmetic progression with difference T. So the number of i in [0, n-1] that satisfy the condition is:\n\n        Let t0 be the smallest non-negative solution (if exists) for i in [0, T-1]. Then the solutions are: t0, t0+T, t0+2*T, ... until <= n-1.\n\n        Count = 1 + (n-1-t0) // T   [if t0 exists and t0 < n]\n\n However, we can also write:\n\n        total_occurrences(x,y) = \n            if there is a solution: floor((n - t0) / T) + 1   (if t0 <= n-1, then we have at least one)\n            else: 0\n\n But note: we don't know t0, and we don't want to iterate over all x,y (there are m*k pairs) and then for each do a complex calculation.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the entire sequence of rounds is periodic with period T, and the set of pairs (x,y) that appear in the first T rounds (i.e., the fundamental cycle) is exactly the set of pairs (x,y) for which the system has a solution (i.e., x ≡ y (mod g)). And in fact, the fundamental cycle has exactly T rounds, and each round is uniquely identified by the residue class modulo T.\n\n However, note: the total number of rounds is n, and the total number of distinct pairs (x,y) that appear is at most m*k. But m,k <= 1000, so m*k <= 1e6, which is acceptable? But n is up to 2e9, and we cannot iterate over 1e6 pairs and for each do a calculation that involves 2e9? \n\n But note: we can precompute the frequency of each pair (x,y) in the entire n rounds without iterating over each i from 0 to n-1.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let g = gcd(m, k). Then the condition for the existence of a solution for (x,y) is that (x - y) % g == 0.\n\n Now, how to count the number of i in [0, n-1] such that:\n        i % m = x   and   i % k = y\n\n This is equivalent to:\n\n        i = x + a*m\n        i = y + b*k\n\n and we require that x + a*m = y + b*k, so (a*m - b*k) = y - x.\n\n We can also use the idea: the set of i that satisfy i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) is periodic with period T = LCM(m,k). And the smallest non-negative solution t0 (if exists) is the solution to the system.\n\n But note: we can precompute the starting index for each pair (x,y) that satisfies the condition, and then count the number of occurrences.\n\n However, note: the constraints on m and k are small (<=1000). So we can iterate over all residues modulo g to check the condition for (x,y). But we have to do it for all pairs (x,y)? There are m*k pairs (which is 1e6 maximum) and then for each we do a GCD condition (which is cheap) and then we have to compute the smallest solution t0 (if exists) and then the count.\n\n But wait, we don't need to compute t0 for each (x,y) individually. We can use the following:\n\n        Let T = LCM(m,k) = m*k // g.\n\n        The equation: i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) is equivalent to:\n            i ≡ x (mod m)\n            i ≡ y (mod k)\n\n        The solution exists iff x ≡ y (mod g). Then we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to solve:\n\n            i = x + a*m = y + b*k\n\n        Rearranged: a*m - b*k = y - x.\n\n        But note: we are working modulo T, and the solution t0 is the smallest non-negative solution.\n\n However, note: the problem is that we have to do this for up to 1e6 pairs, and the extended Euclidean algorithm is O(log(min(m,k))) per equation, so total operations about 1e6 * log(1000) which is acceptable (log(1000) is around 10).\n\n But wait, we don't necessarily need the exact smallest solution t0 for each (x,y). We can use the following:\n\n        The set of i that satisfy the conditions is { t0 + j*T : j >= 0 and t0 + j*T < n }\n\n        Then the count is: max(0, 1 + (n - 1 - t0) // T)   if the solution exists.\n\n But note: we are going to do this for each (x,y) that satisfies the congruence condition. And we are going to do it for every (x,y) that appears? Actually, we are going to consider every (x,y) in the set of residues? But note: the rounds are defined by the indices i from 0 to n-1, and the pair (x,y) is determined by (i % m, i % k). So we must consider every (x,y) that appears in the entire sequence.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence of pairs (i % m, i % k) for i from 0 to n-1 is the same as the sequence of pairs (i % m, i % k) for i from 0 to T-1 repeated full_cycles times, and then the first remainder rounds.\n\n But the pairs that actually appear are those (x,y) for which there exists an i in [0, n-1] such that i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k). And the condition for existence is that (x - y) is divisible by g.\n\n So we can:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute g = gcd(m, k) and T = LCM(m,k) = (m*k)//g.\n\n   Step 2: For each x in range(m) and for each y in range(k):\n        Check if (x - y) % g == 0. If yes, then the system has a solution.\n\n        Then, we need to find the smallest non-negative solution t0 for the system:\n            t0 ≡ x (mod m)\n            t0 ≡ y (mod k)\n\n        We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, note that the modulus m and k are not necessarily coprime. But we already know that g divides (x-y).\n\n        How to compute t0?\n\n        We can set up the equation: t0 = x + a*m = y + b*k.\n\n        We can solve for a: we require that (y - x) is divisible by g, and then we can write:\n\n            t0 ≡ x (mod m)\n            t0 ≡ y (mod k)\n\n        There is a standard method: we can reduce the system to two congruences with coprime moduli by using the known solution for the system of congruences with modulus g. Alternatively, we can use the formula:\n\n        Let m1 = m//g, k1 = k//g, and d = (y - x) // g. Then we require that d is an integer.\n\n        Then we need to solve:\n            t0 ≡ x (mod m)\n            t0 ≡ y (mod k)\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n            t0 ≡ x (mod g*m1)   [but wait, the modulus is m, so we break down the modulus?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        We have:\n            t0 = x + a*m = y + b*k.\n\n        Then: a*m - b*k = y - x.\n\n        We can rewrite: a*m ≡ y (mod k)  => a ≡ (y / g) * inv(m/g, k/g) (mod k/g)   [because we divide by g and then the modulus becomes k/g]\n\n        But note: the equation a*m ≡ (y-x) (mod k) has a solution for a if and only if g divides (y-x). And the solution is unique modulo k/g.\n\n        Steps for solving the system:\n\n        We can solve the equation: m * a ≡ (y - x) (mod k)\n\n        Let g = gcd(m, k). We know g divides (y-x). Then we can reduce:\n\n            (m/g) * a ≡ (y-x)/g (mod k/g)\n\n        Then a0 = modular_inverse(m/g, k/g) * ((y-x)/g) mod (k/g)\n\n        Then the smallest non-negative solution for a is a0, then t0 = x + a0*m.\n\n        However, note: t0 must be less than T (the LCM). But we are looking for the smallest non-negative solution, and by the theory, the solution for t0 is unique modulo T, so we can compute t0 modulo T.\n\n        But note: we are only interested in the smallest non-negative solution.\n\n        However, note: we don't need the exact t0 for counting? Actually, we do: because the count for the pair (x,y) is the number of integers j>=0 such that t0 + j*T < n.\n\n        So: count = 0\n            if there is a solution and t0 < n:\n                count = 1 + (n - 1 - t0) // T   [because the next solution is t0 + T, then t0+2T, ... until less than n]\n\n        But wait, if t0 >= n, then there is no solution.\n\n   Step 3: For each pair (x,y) that has a solution, we compute the outcome of the round: \n        outcome = compare(A[x], B[y])\n        Then, if outcome is a win for Nikephoros (so loss for Polycarpus) then we add one to L2 (Polycarpus loses) and if outcome is a win for Polycarpus (so loss for Nikephoros) then we add one to L1 (Nikephoros loses). If draw, nothing.\n\n   However, note: the outcome function:\n\n        Define a function outcome(a, b) that returns:\n            if a == b -> 0 (draw)\n            else if (a,b) is one of the winning pairs: \n                ('R','S') -> win for R (so a wins, meaning Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses)\n                ('S','P') -> win for S\n                ('P','R') -> win for P\n\n        But note: our comparison: \n            When comparing A[x] (Nikephoros) and B[y] (Polycarpus):\n\n            If A[x] beats B[y]:\n                Then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n\n            If B[y] beats A[x]:\n                Then Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n        So we can define:\n\n            if A[x] == B[y]: \n                pass (draw)\n            else:\n                if (A[x], B[y]) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    then this round gives a loss to Polycarpus (so count one for Polycarpus's red spots)\n                else:\n                    then this round gives a loss to Nikephoros (so count one for Nikephoros's red spots)\n\n   Step 4: Sum over all pairs (x,y) that have a solution and that occur in the n rounds.\n\n   However, note: the same round index i might be represented by multiple (x,y)? Actually, each round i corresponds to one (x,y) = (i%m, i%k). So we are covering every round exactly once.\n\n   But note: we are iterating over all (x,y) in [0, m-1] x [0, k-1] and checking the condition. Then we are counting the number of times (x,y) appears in the n rounds. Then we multiply the outcome by the count.\n\n   Example: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4, g=gcd(3,4)=1, T=12.\n\n        We would consider every (x,y) in [0,2]x[0,3] and check if (x-y) is divisible by 1 -> always true.\n\n        Then for each (x,y) we compute the smallest solution t0, then the count for (x,y) is: 1 + (7-1-t0)//12, but note: t0 is the smallest index i (>=0) such that i%m=x and i%k=y.\n\n        Then we sum the outcomes for each (x,y) multiplied by its count.\n\n   However, note: the total number of rounds is 7, and the pairs (x,y) that actually appear in the 7 rounds are only those i from 0 to 6. But we are counting the same pair (x,y) for all i that satisfy the system, even if that i is beyond n? No, we only count the ones that are <= n-1.\n\n   But wait: the system solution t0 must be the smallest non-negative solution, and then we count the numbers of solutions <= n-1.\n\n   This method will work, but note: we have to do this for up to 1e6 pairs (if m=1000, k=1000, then 1e6 pairs). And for each pair we do:\n\n        Check condition: (x-y)%g==0 -> constant time.\n\n        Then, if condition holds, we do:\n            d = (y - x) // g   [since g divides (y-x)]\n            Solve: a0 = modular_inverse(m//g, k//g) * d % (k//g)   [but note: the equation is (m//g)*a ≡ d (mod k//g)]\n\n        Then t0 = x + a0*(m//g)*g? Actually, we have:\n\n            We reduced the equation to: (m//g) * a ≡ d (mod k//g)   [with d = (y-x)//g]\n\n            Then a0 is the solution modulo k//g.\n\n            Then the solution for a is a0 (mod k//g). Then the general solution for a is a0 + t*(k//g) for t in integers.\n\n            Then i = x + a*m = x + a0*m + t*(m*(k//g))   [but note: m*(k//g) = (m//g)*g*(k//g) = (m//g)*(k//g)*g = T? Actually, T = LCM(m,k) = (m*k)//g = (m//g)*k.\n\n            So i = x + a0*m + t*T.\n\n            Then the smallest non-negative solution is when t is chosen so that i is minimized. But note: we solved for a modulo k//g, so the solution for i is:\n\n                i0 = x + a0 * (m//g) * g   [but wait, we set a = a0, then i = x + a0*m] \n\n            But note: we must ensure that i0 is non-negative and minimal. However, note that the solution we found is the minimal solution modulo T, but it might not be the smallest non-negative? Actually, the solution we found for a is the minimal positive solution modulo k//g, so i0 might be negative? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n            We have: (m//g)*a0 ≡ d (mod k//g) and 0<=a0<k//g.\n\n            Then i0 = x + a0*m.\n\n            But note: we must check that i0 % k == y. Because we solved the equation modulo k//g, but the original equation was modulo k. However, note: we have:\n\n                i0 = x + a0*m.\n\n            And we know that i0 ≡ x (mod m) and i0 ≡ y (mod k) because we solved the system. \n\n        So we can set t0 = i0, and then the solutions are t0 + j*T for j>=0.\n\n        Then the number of occurrences is the number of j such that t0 + j*T < n.\n\n        But note: t0 might be negative? We are solving modulo k//g, so a0 is in [0, k//g-1]. Then i0 = x + a0*m.\n\n        Since x is in [0, m-1] and a0 is nonnegative, i0 is nonnegative.\n\n        However, we must ensure that i0 is the smallest solution. It is the smallest solution in the arithmetic progression, but is it the smallest nonnegative? It could be that a0*m + x is negative? No, because x>=0, a0>=0, m>=1.\n\n        So t0 = i0.\n\n   Then the count for (x,y) is: \n        if t0 >= n: 0\n        else: 1 + (n-1-t0)//T\n\n   Then we multiply the outcome of (A[x],B[y]) by that count.\n\n   But note: the same round i is represented by (x,y) = (i%m, i%k). And we are counting each round exactly once because each round i is uniquely determined by (x,y) and the solution t0 is the smallest index i that gives (x,y). Then we count the rounds that have (x,y) by the above formula.\n\n   However, wait: what if the same round i is represented by multiple (x,y)? No, because (x,y) is (i%m, i%k). And we are iterating over all (x,y) and each round i produces one (x,y). But note: the same (x,y) can appear in multiple rounds (if the system has a solution, then it appears periodically). \n\n   So the plan is:\n\n        g = gcd(m, k)\n        T = (m * k) // g\n\n        losses_Nikephoros = 0\n        losses_Polycarpus = 0\n\n        For x in range(m):\n            For y in range(k):\n                if (x - y) % g != 0:\n                    continue\n\n                # Condition holds, so there is a solution.\n                d = (y - x) // g\n                # Now, we want to solve: (m//g) * a ≡ d (mod k//g)\n\n                # Let M = m // g, K = k // g\n                M = m // g\n                K = k // g\n\n                # We need to solve: M * a ≡ d (mod K)\n\n                # But note: gcd(M, K) should be 1?

The inverse of 3 mod4 is 3 (because 3*3=9≡1 mod4). Then a0 = (3*1) %4 = 3.\n        t0 = 0 + 3*3 = 9.\n        Then count = 0 (since 9>=7) -> so we don't count.\n\n   Similarly, (x,y)=(0,2): \n        Condition: (0-2)%1==0 -> true.\n        d = (2-0)//1 = 2.\n        Solve: 3*a ≡ 2 (mod4). a0 = (3*2) %4 = 6%4=2.\n        t0 = 0+2*3=6 -> which is <7 -> count = 1 + (7-1-6)//12 = 1 + (0)//12 = 1.\n\n        Outcome: A[0]='R' vs B[2]='P': R vs P -> R loses (so Nikephoros loses). Then losses_Nikephoros += 1.\n\n   (x,y)=(0,3):\n        Condition: (0-3)%1==0 -> true.\n        d=(3-0)=3.\n        Solve: 3*a ≡ 3 (mod4) -> a0 = (3*3)%4 = 9%4=1.\n        t0=0+1*3=3 -> <7 -> count=1+(7-1-3)//12=1+3//12=1.\n        Outcome: A[0]='R' vs B[3]='P' (same as above? Actually, B[3] is the fourth char: \"RSPP\" -> index3 is 'P'. So same as (0,2)??? Wait, no: (0,2) was B[2] which is the third char, but B=\"RSPP\": \n            index0: 'R'\n            index1: 'S'\n            index2: 'P'\n            index3: 'P'\n\n        So (0,3) is 'R' vs 'P' -> same as (0,2). So outcome: loss for Nikephoros.\n\n        Then losses_Nikephoros += 1.\n\n   Now, let's check the rounds:\n\n        Round0: i=0 -> (0,0): draw -> no loss.\n        Round1: i=1 -> (1,1): A[1]='P', B[1]='S'. Outcome: 'P' vs 'S' -> 'P' loses to 'S'? Actually, the rules: \n            Rock beats scissors -> so if you have paper and opponent has scissors, then paper loses? No, wait: \n            - Rock beats scissors: so if I show rock and opponent shows scissors, I win.\n            - Scissors beats paper: so if I show scissors and opponent shows paper, I win.\n            - Paper beats rock: so if I show paper and opponent shows rock, I win.\n\n        So for (P, S): \n            Paper vs Scissors: by rule, scissors beats paper -> so Polycarpus wins (since he showed S and Nikephoros showed P). So that's a loss for Nikephoros.\n\n        But wait: in our representation, (x,y) = (1,1) is (A[1]='P', B[1]='S') -> so we should have:\n\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then Nikephoros wins.\n\n            Here, ('P','S') is not in that list. The list is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. So we go to the else: Polycarpus wins, so loss for Nikephoros.\n\n        Then for (1,1): loss for Nikephoros, count for (1,1) is 1 (since t0 for (1,1) is ...)\n\n        Now, we didn't compute (1,1) yet.\n\n        Condition for (1,1): (1-1)%1==0 -> true.\n        d = (1-1)=0.\n        M=3, K=4.\n        a0 = (inverse of 3 mod4)*0 %4 = 0.\n        t0 = 1 + 0*3 = 1 -> count = 1 + (7-1-1)//12 = 1 + 5//12 = 1.\n\n        Then losses_Nikephoros += 1.\n\n        Now, round2: i=2 -> (2,2): A[2]='S', B[2]='P'.

But note: we assumed (x-y)%g==0, so (x-y) is divisible by g. However, (0-1) is -1, and -1 is divisible by 1? Yes, because -1 = (-1)*1.\n\n            Then d = -1.\n            Solve: 3*a ≡ -1 (mod4) -> but we can do: 3*a ≡ 3 (mod4) because -1 mod4=3.\n            Then a0 = (3*3) %4 = 9%4=1.\n            t0=1+1*3=4 -> count=1+(7-1-4)//12=1+2//12=1.\n\n            Then losses_Polycarpus +=1.\n\n        Round5: i=5 -> (2,1): (A[5%3]=A[2]='S', B[5%4]=B[1]='S') -> draw.\n\n        Condition: (2-1)%1==0 -> true, d=(1-2)=-1 -> same as above, then we compute t0=2 + (solution for 3*a ≡ -1 mod4) -> same as above? Actually, the equation is independent of x and y except for d.\n\n            d = (y-x) // g = (1-2)//1 = -1.\n            Equation: 3*a ≡ -1 (mod4) -> same as above, a0=1, t0=2+1*3=5 -> count=1+(7-1-5)//12=1+1//12=1.\n\n            Outcome: draw -> skip.\n\n        Round6: i=6 -> (0,2): already computed above: loss for Nikephoros.\n\n        So total losses:\n            Nikephoros: rounds1, round3, round6 -> 3\n            Polycarpus: round2, round4 -> 2\n\n        Now, let's check our computation:\n\n            (0,0): 0 (draw) -> skip.\n            (0,1): 0 (count=0) -> skip.\n            (0,2): count=1 -> loss for Nikephoros (so 1)\n            (0,3): count=1 -> loss for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors for `n` rounds. The players use predefined sequences of moves that repeat cyclically. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the outcomes without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2·10^9.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players taking turns based on their respective sequences. Each round's outcome depends on the current positions in their sequences. The key observation is that the sequence of moves repeats every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one cycle and then multiplying the results by the number of full cycles, plus handling the remaining rounds.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For each possible pair of moves (one from each player's sequence), we check if there exists a solution to the system of congruences derived from their cyclic positions. If a solution exists, we calculate how many times this pair appears in the `n` rounds using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The outcome of each such pair determines whether it contributes to a loss for either player.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **GCD and LCM Calculation**: Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to determine the periodicity.\n   - **CRT Application**: For each valid move pair, use CRT to find the smallest index where the pair occurs and then count how many times it appears in `n` rounds.\n   - **Outcome Determination**: Based on the game rules, decide if the move pair results in a win, loss, or draw, and update the loss counts accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each possible pair of moves (up to 1,000,000 pairs for sequences of length 1000 each). For each pair, it performs constant-time operations, making the overall complexity O(m*k), which is feasible given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    losses_Nikephoros = 0\n    losses_Polycarpus = 0\n\n    for x in range(m):\n        for y in range(k):\n            if (x - y) % g != 0:\n                continue\n                \n            d_val = (y - x) // g\n            M = m // g\n            K = k // g\n            \n            inv_M = pow(M, -1, K)\n            a0 = (inv_M * d_val) % K\n            t0 = x + a0 * m\n            \n            if t0 >= n:\n                continue\n                \n            count = 1 + (n - 1 - t0) // T\n            \n            a_char = A[x]\n            b_char = B[y]\n            \n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n                losses_Polycarpus += count\n            else:\n                losses_Nikephoros += count\n                \n    print(losses_Nikephoros, losses_Polycarpus)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the two sequences `A` and `B` representing the moves of Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the GCD (`g`) and LCM (`T`) of the sequence lengths to determine the periodicity of the game.\n3. **Processing Move Pairs**: For each possible pair of moves (one from each sequence), check if they can occur in any round using the condition `(x - y) % g == 0`.\n4. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: If the condition is met, compute the smallest round index `t0` where the move pair occurs. Use this to count how many times the pair appears in `n` rounds.\n5. **Outcome Handling**: For each move pair, determine if it results in a loss for either player based on the game rules and update the respective loss counters.\n6. **Output**: Print the total losses for both players after processing all move pairs.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insights and periodicity to avoid brute-force simulation, making it suitable for large values of `n`.",
