Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   a list of n integers a0, a1, ..., an-1\n   a string s of length n (the binary representation of m, from most significant to least significant? Note: the problem says \"s0s1...sn-1\" and then m equals the sum of s_i * 2^(n-1-i) for i=0 to n-1? Actually, note the example: \n        Input: '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010'\n        Here, n=5, m is given by binary string \"11010\". \n\n But note: the example input has two test cases. However, the problem states that the first line is n, then the next line is the array, then the third line is the binary representation of m.\n\n Important: the function f(x) uses the bits of x. The array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the i-th element a_i corresponds to the bit at the i-th position in the binary representation of x? Actually, the problem says:\n        \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n But note: the example: n=4, x=11 (which is 1011 in binary) -> then we consider bits from 0 to 3? Actually, the positions might be indexed from 0 to n-1, but the example uses n=4 and then x=11 (which is 8+2+1, so bits 0,1,3). \n\n However, the problem states that the binary representation of x is used, and the array a has n elements. Also, the input for m is a string of n digits (zeros and ones). \n\n How does the binary representation of m relate to the bits of x? The constraint is 0<=x<=m, and m is given in base-2 as a string of n bits (without leading zeros? Actually, it's given as a string of exactly n bits, so if n=5, then m is represented with 5 bits).\n\n But note: the example input:\n        \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n        Here, n=2, array [3,8], m's binary representation is \"10\", which is 2 in decimal.\n\n Then the example says:\n        f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3.\n\n However, in the second sample:\n        \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\"\n        This means m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26? But wait, the example says m=11 (20+21+23) which is 2^0+2^1+2^3 = 1+2+8=11.\n\n Let me clarify: the problem says m is given by a sequence of n digits (without spaces) s0s1...s_{n-1}. Then m = s0*2^{n-1} + s1*2^{n-2} + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n So, the bits in the string are from the most significant (first character) to the least significant (last character). And the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x. The array a has index i (from 0 to n-1) and corresponds to the i-th bit (i.e., the bit at position i) in the binary representation? But note: the example x=11 for n=4: 11 in binary (with 4 bits) is 1011. Then:\n\n        bit(0): 1 -> use a0\n        bit(1): 1 -> use a1\n        bit(2): 0 -> skip a2\n        bit(3): 1 -> use a3\n\n However, the example says f(11)=a0+a1+a3, which matches.\n\n Now, note that the array a is given for indices 0 to n-1, and the bit positions are from 0 to n-1. But in the example, the first element a0 is used for the least significant bit? Actually, no: in the example, the bit positions are aligned with the array indices: the 0-th bit (LSB) is the last in the binary representation of m? \n\n Wait: the problem says \"binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\". The example: n=4, x=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires evaluating all integers \\( x \\) up to \\( m \\) (given in binary) and computing \\( f(x) \\) for each, then selecting the maximum value. However, directly checking all possible values of \\( x \\) is infeasible for large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^5 \\)), so we need an efficient approach.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums elements of \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit is set in \\( x \\). To maximize \\( f(x) \\), we should include as many positive elements from \\( a \\) as possible. However, \\( x \\) must not exceed \\( m \\), which constrains which bits can be set.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We process the binary digits of \\( m \\) from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). For each bit position, we decide whether setting it to 1 in \\( x \\) will allow us to include more positive elements without violating the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\). This involves:\n   - If the current bit in \\( m \\) is 1, we can consider setting it to 1 in \\( x \\), but if doing so might prevent setting subsequent bits (which could include larger positive elements), we might choose not to set it.\n   - We maintain two values: `tight` (indicating if \\( x \\) is exactly equal to \\( m \\) so far) and `ans` (the current maximum sum).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit of \\( m \\) once, leading to a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), which is optimal given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = sum(arr)\n    prefix_sum = [0] * n\n    suffix_sum = [0] * n\n    \n    prefix_sum[0] = arr[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + arr[i]\n    \n    suffix_sum[n-1] = arr[n-1]\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_sum[i] = suffix_sum[i+1] + arr[i]\n    \n    m_val = int(bin_str, 2)\n    \n    ans = 0\n    tight = True\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if not tight:\n            ans += total\n            break\n            \n        if bin_str[i] == '1':\n            candidate = prefix_sum[i] + (total - prefix_sum[i])\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n            else:\n                tight = False\n        else:\n            candidate = prefix_sum[i] + (total - prefix_sum[i])\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n            else:\n                tight = False\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays store cumulative sums of elements from the start and end of the array, respectively. They help in quickly calculating the sum of elements up to or from any index.\n3. **Binary Processing**: The algorithm processes each bit of \\( m \\) from left to right. For each bit:\n   - If the bit is 1, it considers including the corresponding element in the sum but checks if excluding it might allow including more positive elements later (using the prefix and suffix sums).\n   - If the bit is 0, it immediately stops considering further bits because setting any higher bit would violate \\( x \\leq m \\).\n4. **Output**: The maximum sum found during the processing is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging the constraints imposed by \\( m \\)'s binary representation, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
