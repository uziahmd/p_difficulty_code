Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x,y,z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, note that we have fixed ordering: \n   x <= y <= z.\n\nIn a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the only condition we need to check is: x + y > z.\n\nBut note: our sides are constrained by ranges: x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D]. \n\nWe can try to count the total number of triples (x,y,z) in these ranges and then subtract those that do not form a triangle? However, note that the range for y is from B to C, and note that the condition for a triangle is x+y>z.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate over z (from C to D) and for each z, determine the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B, min(C, z)] (because y must be at least B and at most C, but also note that for a fixed z, we require y<=z? Actually, wait: the condition does not require y<=z? But note the problem: the sides are x, y, z and we are told that the triangle must satisfy the usual triangle inequality. However, the problem does not state an ordering of the sides beyond the given constraints. But note: the problem says \"non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z\" and the constraints: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\nSo we have x<=y<=z. Therefore, the triangle condition becomes: x+y>z (since x<=y<=z, we have x+z>=x+y>z and y+z>=x+y>z, so the other two conditions are automatically satisfied).\n\nSo for a fixed z (from C to D), we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, \n   B <= y <= min(C, z)   [but wait, note the constraint: y must be <= C and also we have z>=C, so if z < C, then y would be up to z? Actually, no: the constraint for y is B<=y<=C, and for z is C<=z<=D. So for a fixed z (which is at least C) then y can be from B to C (so up to C, because C<=z, so y<=C<=z). But note: if z is very large (greater than C) then y is still only up to C. However, the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and since z>=C and y<=C, we require that x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the problem says the constraints are A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D.\n\nTherefore, we can break down the problem:\n\nLet L = A, R = B, M = B, N = C, P = C, Q = D. Actually, we have:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]\n   z in [C, D]\n\nSo the total number without the triangle condition is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). But we must subtract the degenerate ones? Or count directly.\n\nBut note: the triangle condition is x+y>z. Since x<=y<=z, the condition is equivalent to x+y>z.\n\nWe can fix z from C to D. For each z, we want to count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]\n   and x+y > z.\n\nBut note: the condition on y is independent of x, but the condition x+y>z depends on both.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) for a given z, but note that the ranges are large (up to 500000) so we cannot iterate over all z and then over all y and then over all x (that would be O(D) * (C) * (B-A) which is too slow).\n\nWe need a more efficient method.\n\nLet's reframe:\n\nWe want to count the triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n   and x+y > z.\n\nWe can fix z from C to D, and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight here is recognizing that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the triangle inequality simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) within specified ranges that satisfy the triangle inequality \\(x + y > z\\). Given the constraints \\(A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D\\), we can iterate over possible values of \\(z\\) (from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\)) and for each \\(z\\), count the valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), such that \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each fixed \\(z\\), the condition \\(x + y > z\\) must hold. Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are bounded by \\(A, B, C\\), we can determine the minimum value of \\(y\\) required for each \\(x\\) to satisfy the inequality. Specifically, for each \\(x\\), \\(y\\) must be at least \\(\\max(B, z - x + 1)\\) and at most \\(C\\). \n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Directly iterating over all possible \\(x, y, z\\) would be too slow for large ranges (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)). Instead, we use prefix sums to precompute counts of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs for different ranges, allowing us to answer each query in constant time.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Precompute Valid Pairs**: For each possible \\(y\\) (from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\)), compute the number of \\(x\\) values (from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)) such that \\(x < y\\) (since \\(x \\leq y\\)). This helps in quickly determining valid pairs when \\(z\\) is fixed.\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array to store cumulative counts of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs up to each \\(y\\). This allows efficient range queries for counting valid pairs for a given \\(z\\).\n   - **Iterate Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), calculate the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs by using the prefix sum array to find the count of pairs where \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n    \n    arr = [0] * (C + 1)\n    for y in range(B, C + 1):\n        low = A\n        high = min(B, y - 1)\n        if low <= high:\n            count = max(0, high - low + 1)\n        else:\n            count = 0\n        arr[y] = count\n        \n    prefix = [0] * (C + 2)\n    for i in range(1, C + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + arr[i]\n        \n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        y_low = max(B, 1)\n        y_high = C\n        if y_low > y_high:\n            continue\n            \n        y_min = max(B, z - B + 1)\n        if y_min <= B:\n            y_min = B\n            \n        if y_min > C:\n            continue\n            \n        count_y = max(0, C - y_min + 1)\n        total_triangles += prefix[y_high] - prefix[y_min - 1]\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Precomputing Valid Pairs**: For each \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), count how many \\(x\\) values (from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)) are less than \\(y\\). This is stored in an array `arr`.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array `prefix` is built from `arr` to allow efficient range sum queries. This helps in quickly calculating the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs for any given \\(y\\) range.\n4. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), determine the minimum \\(y\\) required such that \\(x + y > z\\) for some \\(x\\). Using the prefix sum array, count the valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs where \\(y\\) is in the range \\([y_{\\text{min}}, C]\\).\n5. **Output the Result**: The total count of valid triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to manageable computations using prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
