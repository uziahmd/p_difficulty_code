Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street [0, l] is lit.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The gap at the beginning: from 0 to the first lantern.\n        We need to cover from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must be placed such that d covers from 0 to at least the first lantern's position.\n        So, the required d for the left part is (first_lantern - 0) / 2? Actually, if the first lantern is at a0, then the light from the first lantern must reach 0.\n        Therefore, the leftmost coverage needed from the first lantern is from (a0 - d) to (a0 + d). To cover 0, we require a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0.\n\n    However, note: the entire street must be covered. The idea is to consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends.\n\n 3. We can think of the problem as having three parts:\n    a) The segment from 0 to the first lantern: the light must extend from the first lantern to 0. So the required d for this gap is a0 / 2 (if we only consider the first lantern) but actually we can have multiple lanterns. However, we are to find one d that works for all.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the two ends.\n\n    Let the sorted lanterns be a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\n    Conditions:\n      - The left end: the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. So the light must extend at least (a0 - 0) / 2 to the left? Actually, no: the requirement is that the entire street is lit. The first lantern must cover from (a0 - d) to (a0 + d). We require that 0 is covered: so a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0. But wait, if we set d = a0, then the first lantern will cover from 0 to 2*a0. However, we don't necessarily need to set d to a0 because there might be other lanterns that help the left side? Actually, no: the first lantern is the one at the smallest coordinate, so it must cover the leftmost part.\n\n    However, note: the problem requires a common d for all lanterns.\n\n    Another way: \n      - The entire street must be covered. We can break the street into segments:\n\n        Segment 1: from 0 to the first lantern (a0). The light must cover from 0 to a0. The first lantern can cover up to a0 + d. But also, the light from the first lantern must at least reach 0: so d must be at least (a0 - 0)/2? Not exactly: the light from the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0, so we require d >= a0. But wait, if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. However, if there is a gap between lanterns, we might not need to cover the entire a0 with just the first lantern?\n\n    Actually, let's think about the gaps:\n\n    The whole street must be covered. The coverage from a lantern is an interval [x-d, x+d]. We need the union of these intervals to cover [0, l].\n\n    We can do:\n\n    - The leftmost point is 0. The rightmost point is l.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n    2. Check the left end: the first lantern is at a0. The light must cover 0. Therefore, d must be at least a0 (because the first lantern must extend from a0 to 0, so d >= a0).\n\n    3. Then, for the gaps between consecutive lanterns (from i=0 to i=n-2): the gap between a[i] and a[i+1] is (a[i+1] - a[i]). For the entire street to be covered, the lights from the two lanterns must meet in the middle. The maximum gap that two adjacent lanterns can cover is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2. So d must be at least (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n    4. The right end: the last lantern is at a[n-1]. It must extend to l, so d must be at least (l - a[n-1]).\n\n    Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points along a street of length \\( l \\) are covered by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points on the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from its position. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n2. **Check Coverage Requirements**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (position 0). Therefore, the required \\( d \\) here is the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street, i.e., \\( \\text{first\\_lantern} - 0 \\).\n   - **Right End Coverage**: Similarly, the last lantern must cover the end of the street (position \\( l \\)). The required \\( d \\) here is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street, i.e., \\( l - \\text{last\\_lantern} \\).\n   - **Middle Gaps Coverage**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them that needs to be covered by their combined light is half the distance between them. The required \\( d \\) for each gap is \\( (\\text{next\\_lantern} - \\text{current\\_lantern}) / 2 \\).\n3. **Determine Minimum \\( d \\)**: The minimal \\( d \\) that satisfies all the above conditions is the maximum value among all the individual \\( d \\) values calculated from the left end, right end, and middle gaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    lanterns = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    lanterns.sort()\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l/2))\n        return\n        \n    gaps = []\n    gaps.append(lanterns[0])  # left end\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap_val = (lanterns[i] - lanterns[i-1]) / 2.0\n        gaps.append(gap_val)\n        \n    gaps.append(l - lanterns[-1])  # right end\n    \n    result = max(gaps)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns \\( n \\), the length of the street \\( l \\), and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no lanterns, the solution defaults to covering the entire street with a single lantern at the center, hence \\( d \\) is \\( l/2 \\).\n4. **Calculating Gaps**:\n   - **Left End Gap**: The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street.\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required \\( d \\) is half the distance between them to ensure they overlap sufficiently.\n   - **Right End Gap**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among all calculated gaps gives the minimal \\( d \\) needed to cover the entire street. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary coverage segments and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
