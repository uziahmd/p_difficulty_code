The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to change at most one number in the subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We are going to consider three cases:\n 1. The entire sequence is already strictly increasing -> then answer n (with 0 changes) or if not, we can have a longer segment by including some parts? Actually, note: we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n However, note that the problem allows changing one number to any integer. So we can fix one violation.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea: \n Let's precompute:\n   left[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change). For example, \n        left[0] = 1\n        left[i] = left[i-1] + 1 if a[i] > a[i-1] else 1\n\n Similarly, right[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment starting exactly at i.\n        right[i] = 1\n        for j from n-2 down to 0: right[j] = right[j+1] + 1 if a[j] < a[j+1] else 1\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one number. So we can break the sequence at one point and then merge two increasing segments.\n\n Cases to consider:\n\n Case 1: Entire segment is increasing -> then we can take the whole array (length n).\n\n Case 2: We can consider breaking the sequence at a point where there is a violation, and then check if we can merge the left and right parts by fixing the violating element.\n\n However, note: the change can be applied to one element, which might be an interior element. We can think:\n\n Consider a subsegment [l, r]. We want to check if by changing at most one element we can make it strictly increasing.\n\n How to do this efficiently?\n\n Another idea: we can consider each index i as the candidate for being changed, and then see how long a segment we can form that includes i and is strictly increasing, with the exception that the element at i is fixed (we can set it arbitrarily) and the rest must be strictly increasing.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Let L[i] = length of increasing subsegment ending at i (without change)\n Let R[i] = length of increasing subsegment starting at i (without change)\n\n Then, if we are allowed to change a[i], then we can potentially combine:\n   - The increasing segment ending at i-1 (if exists) and the increasing segment starting at i+1 (if exists)\n   But note: we must ensure that the last element of the left part (a[i-1]) is less than the first element of the right part (a[i+1]), because we can set a[i] to something between them.\n\n However, what if we don't have both left and right? Then we can just use the left or the right.\n\n So for index i, the candidate length would be:\n\n   If we change a[i]:\n      candidate = 1 (just the element at i) \n      plus the entire left increasing segment up to i (meaning from i-L[i]+1 to i-1) and the entire right increasing segment from i+1 to i+R[i])\n      But wait, we cannot simply concatenate the left and right without considering the gap at i.\n\n      Actually, we are replacing a[i] by a value that must be greater than a[i-1] (if we have a left segment) and less than a[i+1] (if we have a right segment). \n\n      Conditions for merging:\n        - If we have no left and no right, then the segment is just [i] -> length 1.\n        - If we have left but no right: then we can use the entire left segment (which ends at i-1) and then the single element i (which we set arbitrarily, and since there is no right we don't need to worry about the next) so total length = L[i] (which is 1 + ... but actually our left[i] does not include i because we are considering i separately). \n\n      Let me redefine:\n\n        Let L[i] = length of increasing segment ending at i (including i). Then the increasing segment from i-L[i]+1 to i.\n\n        Now, if we are going to change a[i], then we can use the left part (from i - L[i] + 1 to i-1) and the right part (from i+1 to i+R[i]) only if the last element of the left part (at i-1) is less than the first element of the right part (at i+1). Then the entire segment would be from (i - L[i] + 1) to (i + R[i]), and we set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1].\n\n        But note: if the left part doesn't exist",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a sequence where, by changing at most one number in the subsegment, the entire subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments that could potentially meet this condition after at most one modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: We first compute two arrays, `left` and `right`, where:\n   - `left[i]` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - `right[i]` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n\n2. **Check Entire Segment**: If the entire array is already strictly increasing, the answer is simply the length of the array.\n\n3. **Single Element Case**: For any single element, changing it trivially makes the subsegment strictly increasing (since a single element is always strictly increasing).\n\n4. **Merge Segments**: For each element in the array, consider the scenario where this element is the one to be changed. The potential subsegment length is the sum of the lengths of the increasing segments to the left and right of the element, provided that the elements immediately adjacent to the modified position can form a strictly increasing sequence when the current element is adjusted appropriately. Specifically, if the left segment ends at `i-1` and the right segment starts at `i+1`, then the merged segment is valid only if `a[i-1] < a[i+1]`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where there are no elements to the left or right of the current element, ensuring the solution works for all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    best = 1\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current = 1\n        if i >= 1 and i < n-1:\n            if left[i-1] >= 1 and right[i+1] >= 1:\n                if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                    current += left[i-1] + right[i+1]\n        elif i == 0:\n            current += right[0]\n        else:\n            current += left[i-1]\n            \n        if current > best:\n            best = current\n            \n        if left[i] > 1:\n            candidate = left[i]\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n        if right[i] > 1:\n            candidate = right[i]\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length `n` and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence length is zero, the output is trivially zero.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: The `left` array is computed by iterating from left to right, storing the length of the increasing segment ending at each index. Similarly, the `right` array is computed by iterating from right to left.\n4. **Best Segment Calculation**: For each element, the potential segment length is calculated by considering the left and right increasing segments around it. If merging these segments is valid (i.e., the elements before and after the current element satisfy the strictly increasing condition), the merged length is considered. The maximum valid segment length encountered during this process is stored as `best`.\n5. **Output**: The maximum segment length found is printed, which represents the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments by leveraging precomputed arrays and handles edge cases to ensure correctness for all input sizes.",
