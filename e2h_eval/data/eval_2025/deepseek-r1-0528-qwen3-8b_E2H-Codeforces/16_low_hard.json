Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The block containing a point can be described by the side of each line (either positive or negative). \n\n However, note that we are allowed to cross a road only at a common border (which is the entire line? but actually we can cross one road at a time, and the step from one block to another requires crossing one or more roads? Actually, the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that two blocks are adjacent (have a common border) if they share a segment of one of the roads (so they are separated by exactly one road). \n\n Therefore, moving from one block to an adjacent one requires crossing one road. But note: sometimes two blocks might be separated by more than one road, so you cannot jump from one to the other in one step. However, the problem says \"in one step\" you can move from one block to another if they have a nonzero common border. So the minimal step is 1 per road crossed, but wait: what if you cross two roads at once? Actually, if two blocks are separated by two roads, then you cannot go from one to the other by crossing just one road (because then you would land in a third block). Therefore, the minimal steps required is the number of roads that separate the home block from the university block? But note: we are not forced to cross one road at a time. Actually, the problem does not require us to cross roads one at a time, but the rule is: you can move from one block to another only if they share a common border (which is part of one road). So the entire journey must consist of crossing one road at a time.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n   Output: '2'\n\n Explanation: \n   Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1). There are two roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  -> y=0\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  -> x=0\n\n   The home (1,1) is above the x-axis (y>0) and right of the y-axis (x>0).\n   The university (-1,-1) is below the x-axis (y<0) and left of the y-axis (x<0).\n\n   To get from home to university, we must cross two roads: first the x-axis and then the y-axis (or vice versa). Each crossing moves us from one quadrant to an adjacent one. Therefore, two steps.\n\n How do we model this?\n\n Observation: Each road divides the plane. We can assign a sign (say, positive or negative) to each road for the home and for the university.\n\n Specifically, for a road defined by a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, we can define:\n   For the home (x1,y1): value1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i.\n   For the university (x2,y2): value2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i.\n\n Then, if value1 and value2 have opposite signs, then the two points lie on opposite sides of the road. In that case, the road separates the home and the university.\n\n Now, how many roads separate the two points? That is the number of roads for which the signs (with respect to the line) of the two points differ.\n\n However, note that even if a road does not separate the two points, it may still be crossed during the journey. But wait: the minimal steps must be the minimal number of roads that we must cross? And each step crosses one road? But note: when you cross one road, you change the side for that road, and then the next road might be crossed independently.\n\n However, consider: if we have two roads that separate the two points, then we need at least two steps (each step crosses one road). But is it always the case that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points?\n\n Let me think: \n   In the example, there are two roads separating the two points, and we need two steps.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n\n   The third road: x+y-3=0. \n   For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n   For university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n\n   So the third road does",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university in Crazy Town. The roads in Crazy Town are infinite lines that divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). Each step allows you to move from one block to another if they share a common border (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university blocks can be characterized by their positions relative to each road. Specifically, for each road, we can determine whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides of the road.\n2. **Intuition**: If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to move between their blocks. The minimal number of steps required to reach the university's block is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. This is because each such road must be crossed exactly once during the journey.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the linear equation (a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i) evaluated at the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, this road separates the two points and must be crossed. The total number of such separating roads gives the minimal steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    count = 0\n    for (a, b, c) in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients (a, b, c) for each road equation (ax + by + c = 0).\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, evaluate the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the evaluation results in opposite signs (one positive and one negative), it means the two points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus this road must be crossed.\n3. **Counting Steps**: The total number of such roads where the home and university lie on opposite sides directly gives the minimal steps required to reach the university's block, as each step involves crossing one such road.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is simply the count of these separating roads, printed as the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging geometric properties of lines and point positions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
