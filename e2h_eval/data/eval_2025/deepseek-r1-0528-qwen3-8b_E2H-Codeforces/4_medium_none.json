The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses the character at index (i mod m) from string A.\n   Polycarpus uses the character at index (i mod k) from string B.\n\n Then we determine the winner for that round (if any) and count the red spots (which is the number of losses).\n\n However, n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem into cycles. The entire game is a cycle of length LCM(m, k). But note: the rounds are independent and the two sequences are cyclic with periods m and k.\n\n We can compute the total number of rounds by considering one full cycle (with length T = LCM(m, k)) and then the remaining rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the outcome for each pair of moves (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B. There are 3x3=9 possibilities.\n\n    Define a function or a table:\n\n        If (a, b) is:\n            (R, R) -> draw\n            (R, S) -> lose (so Polycarpus wins, so we add one to Nikephoros's loss count, and one red spot for Nikephoros)\n            (R, P) -> win (Nikephoros wins, so no red spot for him)\n\n            (S, R) -> win\n            (S, S) -> draw\n            (S, P) -> lose\n\n            (P, R) -> lose\n            (P, S) -> win\n            (P, P) -> draw\n\n    Actually, we need to assign:\n        For a round, if Nikephoros loses, then he gets a red spot (so we add 1 to his red spots).\n        Similarly, if Polycarpus loses, then he gets a red spot.\n\n    So for a round (a, b):\n        If a beats b? (then Nikephoros wins, so no red spot for him, but Polycarpus loses -> add one to Polycarpus's red spots)\n        Else if b beats a? (then Polycarpus wins, so add one to Nikephoros's red spots)\n        Else, draw.\n\n    But note: what does it mean for a to beat b?\n        Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n\n    Alternatively, we can define a dictionary or a function for the outcome.\n\n 2. We are going to consider the entire sequence of rounds as composed of many cycles (each cycle of length T = LCM(m, k)), and then the remainder.\n\n    However, note: the two sequences have different periods. The state in round i is determined by (i mod m, i mod k). The pairs (i mod m, i mod k) will repeat every T rounds, where T is the least common multiple of m and k.\n\n    But note: we are not asked for the entire cycle of states, but the outcomes. We can precompute the outcome for each (a, b) and then for each position in the cycle (from 0 to T-1) we can compute the outcome.\n\n    However, T can be as large as m*k (if m and k are coprime) and m, k <= 1000, so maximum T is 10^6, which is acceptable because 2e9 rounds would then be broken down by cycles of T.\n\n    But wait: 2e9 / T might be a very large integer, but we can compute the total red spots by:\n\n        Let F(i) be the outcome (for a single round) as a tuple (nike_reds, poly_reds) for round i.\n\n        We want to compute:\n            total_nike_reds = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [F(i) for Nikephoros]\n            total_poly_reds = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [F(i) for Polycarpus]\n\n        We can break the n rounds into:\n            num_cycles = n // T\n            remainder = n % T\n\n        Then total_nike_reds = num_cycles * (sum of nike_reds over one cycle) + (sum of nike_reds for the first 'remainder' rounds)\n        Similarly for total_poly_reds.\n\n    But note: the rounds are indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n    However, the cycle T is the LCM(m,k). The state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)\n\n        Step 2: Precompute an array `cycle` of length T (if T is too big, but note m,k<=1000, so T<=1000*1000=10^6, which is acceptable)\n\n                For j in range(T):\n                    i = j  (but note: we don't use j directly, we use j mod m and j mod k)\n                    Actually, for round index j (from 0 to T-1), the move for A is A[j % m] and for B is B[j % k]\n\n                Then for each j in [0, T-1], compute the outcome (nike_red, poly_red) for that round.\n\n        Step 3: Let total_cycle_nike = sum(nike_red for each round in the cycle)\n                 total_cycle_poly = sum(poly_red for each round in the cycle)\n\n        Step 4: Then, for n rounds:\n\n                full_cycles = n // T\n                remainder = n % T\n\n                total_nike_reds = full_cycles * total_cycle_nike + (sum of nike_red for rounds 0 to remainder-1 in the cycle)\n                total_poly_reds = full_cycles * total_cycle_poly + (sum of poly_red for rounds 0 to remainder-1 in the cycle)\n\n        Step 5: Print total_nike_reds and total_poly_reds.\n\n 3. But wait: is the cycle T really the same for all rounds? Yes, because the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds.\n\n 4. However, note that the outcome of round i depends on the pair (A[i % m], B[i % k]), and since (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T, the outcomes also repeat.\n\n 5. Implementation details:\n\n        - How to compute GCD? We can use Euclid's algorithm.\n\n        - How to determine the outcome for a given (a, b):\n\n            We can define:\n\n            def outcome(a, b):\n                # returns (nike_red, poly_red) for this round\n                if a == b:\n                    return (0, 0)\n                elif (a, b) == ('R', 'S') or (a, b) == ('S', 'P') or (a, b) == ('P', 'R'):\n                    # a wins: then Nikephoros wins (so no red for him) and Polycarpus loses (so one red for Polycarpus)\n                    return (0, 1)\n                else:\n                    # then b wins: so Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros loses (one red for Nikephoros) and no red for Polycarpus.\n                    return (1, 0)\n\n            Alternatively, we can check:\n\n            mapping = {\n                ('R', 'S'): (0, 1),\n                ('S', 'P'): (0, 1),\n                ('P', 'R'): (0, 1),\n                ('R', 'P'): (1, 0),\n                ('S', 'R'): (1, 0),\n                ('P', 'S'): (1, 0),\n            }\n\n            But note: we must cover all cases. Actually, the above condition covers:\n\n                ('R','S'): a wins -> (0,1)\n                ('S','P'): a wins -> (0,1)\n                ('P','R'): a wins -> (0,1)\n\n                The other six? Actually, there are 9 distinct pairs. The remaining ones are:\n\n                ('R','R'): (0,0)\n                ('R','P'): (1,0) [because R vs P: P wins]\n                ('S','R'): (1,0) [because S vs R: R wins, so S loses -> (1,0)]\n                ('S','S'): (0,0)\n                ('P','P'): (0,0)\n                ('P','S'): (1,0) [because P vs S: P wins? Wait, no: the rule: P beats R, S beats P, R beats S. So P vs S: P loses? Actually, no: P beats R, but S beats P. So P vs S: S wins? Wait, let me check:\n\n                Actually, the rules:\n\n                    Rock beats Scissors -> R beats S.\n                    Scissors beats Paper -> S beats P.\n                    Paper beats Rock -> P beats R.\n\n                So:\n\n                    (R, P): R vs P -> P beats R -> so Polycarpus wins (if b is P and a is R) -> then (1,0) for Nikephoros (he loses) and Polycarpus doesn't get a red spot? \n\n                Actually, let me re-map:\n\n                    Outcome when a (Nikephoros) and b (Polycarpus):\n\n                    If a beats b: then b loses -> so we add a red spot to b (Polycarpus) and none to a (Nikephoros) -> (0,1)\n                    If b beats a: then a loses -> (1,0)\n                    If tie: (0,0)\n\n                So:\n\n                    (R, S): R beats S -> (0,1)\n                    (S, P): S beats P -> (0,1)\n                    (P, R): P beats R -> (0,1)\n\n                    (R, P): P beats R -> (1,0)\n                    (S, R): R beats S -> (1,0)   [because in (S,R): S vs R -> R beats S, so S loses -> (1,0)]\n                    (P, S): S beats P? No: wait, (P,S): P vs S -> the rule says S beats P, so S wins. Therefore, (P,S): S wins -> (1,0) because a (P) loses.\n\n                But wait: (P,S): a is P, b is S -> the rule: S beats P, so b wins. Then we should add a red spot to a (Nikephoros) -> (1,0). That matches.\n\n                Now, let's check (R,R): (0,0); (S,S): (0,0); (P,P): (0,0); and the rest we have covered.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    result = (0, 1)\n                elif (a, b) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                    result = (1, 0)\n                else:\n                    result = (0,0)\n\n        This is clear.\n\n 6. However, note: the cycle length T might be large (up to 10^6) and n up to 2e9, but 10^6 is acceptable for building an array and then doing a prefix sum.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        T = lcm(m, k)\n        cycle_outcomes = []  # for each j in range(T): (nike_red, poly_red)\n        for j in range(T):\n            a_char = A[j % m]\n            b_char = B[j % k]\n            outcome_tuple = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n            cycle_outcomes.append(outcome_tuple)\n\n        Then build two arrays: \n            nike_cycle = [outcome[0] for outcome in cycle_outcomes]\n            poly_cycle = [outcome[1] for outcome in cycle_outcomes]\n\n        Then compute:\n            total_cycle_nike = sum(nike_cycle)\n            total_cycle_poly = sum(poly_cycle)\n\n        And then for the remainder part, we can do:\n\n            prefix_nike = [0]*(T+1)\n            prefix_poly = [0]*(T+1)\n            for i in range(1, T+1):\n                prefix_nike[i] = prefix_nike[i-1] + nike_cycle[i-1]\n                prefix_poly[i] = prefix_poly[i-1] + poly_cycle[i-1]\n\n            Then:\n                full_cycles = n // T\n                rem = n % T\n\n                total_nike_reds = full_cycles * total_cycle_nike + prefix_nike[rem]\n                total_poly_reds = full_cycles * total_cycle_poly + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n 7. But note: the example input:\n\n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Expected Output: 3 2\n\n        Let's simulate the example with our method:\n\n        A = \"RPS\", m=3; B=\"RSPP\", k=4.\n\n        T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        We need to simulate 7 rounds (0-indexed to 6).\n\n        Round0: j=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> (0,0)\n        Round1: j=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> (0,1) [since P beats S? Actually, no: the rule: P beats R, but here we have P vs S -> S beats P, so outcome (1,0) because a='P' loses to b='S'.]\n\n        Correction: Our outcome function:\n\n            (a, b) = ('P','S'): \n                Check: \n                    ('P','S') is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no.\n                    Then check [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')] -> yes, so (1,0)\n\n        So Round1: (1,0)\n\n        Round2: j=2 -> A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> (0,1) [because S beats P? yes, so (0,1)]\n\n        Round3: j=3 -> A[0]='R', B[3]='P' -> (1,0) [because R vs P: P beats R -> (1,0)]\n\n        Round4: j=4 -> A[1]='P', B[0]='R' -> (0,1) [because P beats R -> (0,1)]\n\n        Round5: j=5 -> A[2]='S', B[1]='S' -> (0,0)\n\n        Round6: j=6 -> A[0]='R', B[2]='P' -> (1,0) [because R vs P: P beats R -> (1,0)]\n\n        Then the counts for the first 7 rounds:\n\n            Nikephoros: \n                Round0:0, Round1:1, Round2:0, Round3:1, Round4:0, Round5:0, Round6:1 -> total 1+1+1 = 3\n            Polycarpus:\n                Round0:0, Round1:0, Round2:1, Round3:0, Round4:1, Round5:0, Round6:0 -> total 1+1 = 2\n\n        So the example output is (3,2). \n\n        However, our simulation above for round1 was (1,0) and round2 (0,1) and round3 (1,0) and round4 (0,1) and round6 (1,0). \n\n        The example says: \n            Round1: P vs S -> Nikephoros loses (so 1 red for him) -> our outcome (1,0) is correct.\n            Round2: S vs P -> Polycarpus loses (so 1 red for Polycarpus) -> our outcome (0,1) is correct.\n\n        The example breakdown:\n\n            Round0: Draw -> (0,0)\n            Round1: P-S -> Nikephoros loses (so 1 red spot for Nikephoros) -> (1,0)\n            Round2: S-P -> Polycarpus loses (so 1 red spot for Polycarpus) -> (0,1)\n            Round3: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (so 1 red spot for Nikephoros) -> (1,0)\n            Round4: P-R -> Polycarpus loses (so 1 red spot for Polycarpus) -> (0,1)\n            Round5: S-S -> Draw -> (0,0)\n            Round6: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (so 1 red spot for Nikephoros) -> (1,0)\n\n        Total for Nikephoros: 3, for Polycarpus: 2.\n\n        So the code must count the red spots for each round and accumulate.\n\n 8.

So we don't need the else.\n                    # But wait, the two elifs are disjoint and together with the first if (same) cover all 9? \n                    # Let me list: \n                    #   (R,R): same -> (0,0)\n                    #   (R,S): in [('R','S')] -> (0,1)\n                    #   (R,P): in [('R','P')] -> (1,0)\n                    #   (S,R): in [('S','R')] -> (1,0)\n                    #   (S,P): in [('S','P')] -> (0,1)\n                    #   (S,S): same -> (0,0)\n                    #   (P,R): in [('P','R')] -> (0,1)\n                    #   (P,S): in [('P','S')] -> (1,0)\n                    #   (P,P): same -> (0,0)\n                    # So actually we have covered everything.

We can remove the else.\n\n            # Now, we have outcomes for T rounds.\n\n            # Build prefix sums for the cycle.\n            prefix_nike = [0]*(T+1)\n            prefix_poly = [0]*(T+1)\n\n            for i in range(1, T+1):\n                prev_nike = prefix_nike[i-1]\n                prev_poly = prefix_poly[i-1]\n                add_nike, add_poly = outcomes[i-1]\n                prefix_nike[i] = prev_nike + add_nike\n                prefix_poly[i] = prev_poly + add_poly\n\n            full_cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            total_nike = full_cycles * (prefix_nike[T]) + prefix_nike[rem]\n            total_poly = full_cycles * (prefix_poly[T]) + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n            print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\n 9. However, note: the example n=7, T=12, so full_cycles = 0, rem=7, so we take the first 7 rounds.\n\n 10. But wait, the example T=12, so we built outcomes for j in range(0,12). Then we take the first 7 rounds (index0 to index6) and sum their outcomes.\n\n 11. Let me test with the example: n=7, T=12.\n\n        full_cycles = 0, rem=7.\n\n        Then total_nike = 0 + prefix_nike[7] \n        prefix_nike[7] = sum of first 7 rounds: \n            Round0: (0,0) -> 0\n            Round1: (1,0) -> 1\n            Round2: (0,1) -> 0\n            Round3: (1,0) -> 1\n            Round4: (0,1) -> 0\n            Round5: (0,0) -> 0\n            Round6: (1,0) -> 1\n\n            Sum for Nike: 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n        Similarly for Poly: \n            Round0:0, Round1:0, Round2:1, Round3:0, Round4:1, Round5:0, Round6:0 -> 2.\n\n        So output \"3 2\".\n\n 12. Edge: n=0 -> then full_cycles=0, rem=0, then prefix_nike[0]=0, so (0,0)\n\n 13. Another edge: n=12, then full_cycles=1, rem=0, then total_nike = 1 * (sum of entire cycle) + 0.\n\n        What is the entire cycle? We computed 12 rounds. We don't know the exact value without simulating, but the example has T=12, and we have the outcomes for each round.\n\n        But note: the example input had n=7, and we are using T=12, so we did not simulate the entire cycle. However, the problem is independent of the example.\n\n 14. However, note: the example input provided two examples. The second example:\n\n        Input: \n            5\n            RRRRRRRR\n            R\n\n        Expected Output: 0 0\n\n        Explanation: because in each round, both players show 'R' (since A is \"RRRRRRRR\" and B is \"R\", so for round i, A[i%m] is 'R' (because m=8, but the string is 8 'R's) and B[i%k] is 'R' (k=1). So every round is a draw.\n\n        So the outcome for each round is (0,0). Then for n=5, total red spots = 0.\n\n        Now, with our code:\n\n            n=5\n            A_str = \"RRRRRRRR\", m=8\n            B_str = \"R\", k=1\n\n            T = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n            Then we simulate 8 rounds. But note: the outcome for round0: (A[0]='R', B[0]='R') -> (0,0)\n            round1: (A[1]='R', B[1%1=0]='R') -> (0,0)\n            ... so all rounds in the cycle are (0,0).\n\n            Then for n=5, full_cycles = 5//8 = 0, rem=5, and we take the first 5 rounds: 0.\n\n            Output: 0 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n 15. But wait, what if m or k is 0? The problem states m,k>=1, so we are safe.\n\n 16. However, note: the problem constraints say n can be up to 2e9, and m,k up to 1000, so T = LCM(m,k) can be up to 1000*1000 (if they are coprime) which is 1e6. We are iterating T (which is 1e6) and then building a prefix sum of length T+1. This is acceptable in Python if we do it once, because 1e6 is about 1 million iterations, which is acceptable in speed.\n\n 17. Let me test with worst-case: m=1000, k=1000, then T = (1000*1000)//gcd(1000,1000) = (1000000)//1000 = 1000. Actually, no: gcd(1000,1000)=1000, so T= (1000*1000)//1000 = 1000.\n\n        Worst-case for T is when m and k are coprime, then T = m*k. So if m=1000, k=997 (a prime near 1000) then T=1000*997=997000, which is less than 1e6.\n\n        Actually, the maximum T is 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n 18. Code:\n\n        We'll use math.gcd.\n\n        Note: We must import math.\n\n        However, note: the example input format: first line is n, then the next two lines are the strings.\n\n        Example input:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        But wait, the example input is provided as two separate inputs? Actually, the problem says:\n\n            Input:\n                The first line contains integer n ...\n                The second line contains sequence A ...\n                The third line contains sequence B ...\n\n        So we read:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A_str = input().strip()\n            B_str = input().strip()\n\n        We assume the input is provided in standard input.\n\n 19. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 20. One more note: the example input might have spaces? The problem says the string is given as a string of m characters. So we use strip() to remove any extraneous spaces.\n\n 21. Final code:\n\n        import math\n\n        def main():\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A_str = input().strip()\n            B_str = input().strip()\n\n            m = len(A_str)\n            k = len(B_str)\n\n            # If n is 0, then we output (0,0)\n            if n == 0:\n                print(\"0 0\")\n                return\n\n            # Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n            g = math.gcd(m, k)\n            T = (m * k) // g\n\n            # If T is 0, but m,k>=1 so no.\n            outcomes = []  # Each element is (nike_red, poly_red)\n            for j in range(T):\n                a_index = j % m\n                b_index = j % k\n                a_char = A_str[a_index]\n                b_char = B_str[b_index]\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    outcomes.append((0, 0))\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    outcomes.append((0,1))\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                    outcomes.append((1,0))\n\n            # Now, build prefix sums for the cycle of T rounds.\n            prefix_nike = [0] * (T+1)\n            prefix_poly = [0] * (T+1)\n\n            for i in range(1, T+1):\n                last_nike = prefix_nike[i-1]\n                last_poly = prefix_poly[i-1]\n                add_nike, add_poly = outcomes[i-1]\n                prefix_nike[i] = last_nike + add_nike\n                prefix_poly[i] = last_poly + add_poly\n\n            full_cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            total_nike = full_cycles * prefix_nike[T] + prefix_nike[rem]\n            total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[T] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n            print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\n 22. Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        outcomes for j=0 to 11:\n\n            j0: ('R','R') -> (0,0)\n            j1: ('P','S') -> (1,0)   [because ('P','S') in [('R','P'),('S','R'),('P','S')] -> yes, so (1,0)\n            j2: ('S','P') -> (0,1)\n            j3: ('R','P') -> (1,0)\n            j4: ('P','R') -> (0,1)\n            j5: ('S','S') -> (0,0)\n            j6: ('R','P') -> (1,0)   [Wait, j6: j%3=6%3=0 -> 'R'; j%4=6%4=2 -> 'P' -> (1,0)\n            j7: ('P','S') -> (1,0)   [j7: 7%3=1 -> 'P'; 7%4=3 -> 'P'? Wait, B_str=\"RSPP\": index3 is 'P'. So ('P','P') -> (0,0)\n            Correction: j7: A[7%3]=A[1]='P', B[7%4]=B[3]='P' -> same -> (0,0)\n\n            j8: A[8%3]=A[2]='S', B[8%4]=B[0]='R' -> (S,R): (1,0) because S loses to R.\n            j9: A[9%3]=A[0]='R', B[9%4]=B[1]='S' -> (R,S): (0,1)\n            j10: A[10%3]=A[1]='P', B[10%4]=B[2]='P' -> (P,P): (0,0)\n            j11: A[11%3]=A[2]='S', B[11%4]=B[3]='P' -> (S,P): (0,1)\n\n        So the outcomes for the cycle of 12 rounds:\n\n            [ (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (0,0), (0,1) ]\n\n        Then the total for the entire cycle (12 rounds) for Nike: \n            (0+1+0+1+0+0+1+0+1+0+0+0) = 5\n        For Polycarpus: \n            (0+0+1+0+1+0+0+0+0+1+0+1) = 4\n\n        Then for n=7: \n            full_cycles=0, rem=7 -> take first 7 rounds.\n\n            First 7: \n                (0,0) -> 0,0\n                (1,0) -> 1,0\n                (0,1) -> 0,1\n                (1,0) -> 1,0\n                (0,1) -> 0,1\n                (0,0) -> 0,0\n                (1,0) -> 1,0\n\n            Total for Nike: 1+1+1 = 3, for Poly: 1+1 = 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the example input was:\n\n            Input: \n                7\n                RPS\n                RSPP\n\n        But wait, in the example breakdown I did earlier, the rounds were:\n\n            Round0: (0,0)\n            Round1: (1,0)   -> P vs S: (1,0) [correct]\n            Round2: (0,1)   -> S vs P: (0,1) [correct]\n            Round3: (1,0)   -> R vs P: (1,0) [correct]\n            Round4: (0,1)   -> P vs R: (0,1) [correct]\n            Round5: (0,0)   -> S vs S: (0,0) [correct]\n            Round6: (1,0)   -> R vs P: (1,0) [correct]\n\n        But in our simulation above, the round6 was indeed (1,0). However, the example breakdown had 3 losses for Nikephoros and 2 for Polycarpus.\n\n        But wait, the example breakdown said:\n\n            Round1: P-S -> Nikephoros loses (so 1 red spot for him) -> (1,0) -> correct.\n            Round2: S-P -> Polycarpus loses (so 1 red spot for him) -> (0,1) -> correct.\n            Round3: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (1 red) -> (1,0) -> correct.\n            Round4: P-R -> Polycarpus loses (1 red) -> (0,1) -> correct.\n            Round5: S-S -> draw -> (0,0) -> correct.\n            Round6: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (1 red) -> (1,0) -> correct.\n\n        So total for Nike: 1 (round1) + 1 (round3) + 1 (round6) = 3.\n        For Polycarpus: 1 (round2) + 1 (round4) = 2.\n\n        The simulation for the cycle of 12 rounds gives 5 for Nike and 4 for Polycarpus, but that is for 12 rounds. The example n=7.\n\n        The code is correct.\n\n 23. However, note: the example input string for B was \"RSPP\", which is of length 4. So j=7: index=7%4=3 -> 'P', and j=6: index=6%4=2 -> 'P', so that was correct.\n\n 24. Submit the code.\n\n 25. But wait, note: the example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input:\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        The sample output is:\n\n            ['3 2', '0 0']\n\n        We have tested both.\n\n 26. One more edge: n=0, we handled.\n\n 27. However, note: if n==0, then we print (0,0). But what if n is very large, say 2e9? Our code uses T (the LCM) and then does two prefix arrays of length T+1. Since T is at most 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\n 28. Let me test with n=0, then the code prints (0,0) and returns.\n\n 29. But wait, the problem says n>=1, so n=0 is not in the input? The problem says: \"The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109)\".\n\n        So we don't need to handle n=0? But the problem says n>=1, so we can skip the if n==0.\n\n        However, the problem says n>=1, so we don't have to handle n=0. But the code above handles n=0. We can remove the if n==0, because the input n>=1.\n\n        But to be safe, we can keep the code without the special handling, because the rest of the code would work for n=0 as well. However,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use predefined sequences of moves that repeat cyclically. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2·10^9, a brute-force simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to compute the result efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move of each player. The key observation is that the sequence of outcomes repeats every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one cycle of `T` rounds and then scaling up to `n` rounds.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, the outcome is determined by comparing the current move of Nikephoros (from sequence A) and Polycarpus (from sequence B). If they are the same, it's a draw. Otherwise, one player wins based on the game rules. The number of red spots (losses) for each player is tracked over one full cycle of `T` rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute `T`, the LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B.\n   - For each round in `T`, determine the outcome (number of red spots for each player).\n   - Use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the total red spots over any number of cycles.\n   - For `n` rounds, compute the total red spots by multiplying the full cycles' contributions by the number of full cycles and adding the contribution from the remaining rounds.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes `T` rounds once, where `T` is at most 1,000,000 (since the sequences' lengths are up to 1000). This is feasible because 1,000,000 operations are manageable in Python. The overall complexity is O(T), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n\n    outcomes = []\n    for j in range(T):\n        a_char = A_str[j % m]\n        b_char = B_str[j % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            outcomes.append((0, 0))\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            outcomes.append((0, 1))\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'P'), ('S', 'R'), ('P', 'S')]:\n            outcomes.append((1, 0))\n\n    prefix_nike = [0] * (T + 1)\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (T + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        add_nike, add_poly = outcomes[i - 1]\n        prefix_nike[i] = prefix_nike[i - 1] + add_nike\n        prefix_poly[i] = prefix_poly[i - 1] + add_poly\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n\n    total_nike_reds = full_cycles * prefix_nike[T] + prefix_nike[rem]\n    total_poly_reds = full_cycles * prefix_poly[T] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n    print(f\"{total_nike_reds} {total_poly_reds}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Outcome Simulation**: For each position in the cycle `T`, the current moves of both players are determined using modulo arithmetic. The outcome of each round is recorded as a tuple indicating red spots for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n4. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums arrays are built to store cumulative red spots for each player over the cycle. This allows efficient calculation of red spots for any number of rounds.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total red spots are computed by considering full cycles and the remaining rounds separately. The result is printed as two integers representing the red spots for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging periodicity and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
