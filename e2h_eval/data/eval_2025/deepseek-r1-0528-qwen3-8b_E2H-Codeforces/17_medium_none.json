He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and then `2*n-2` strings. There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n We know that the string `s` of length `n` has:\n   - One proper prefix (length from 1 to n-1) and one proper suffix for each length.\n\n However, the input gives us two strings for each length (so total 2*(n-1) = 2n-2 strings). We don't know which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\n Conditions: \n   - The entire string must be consistent, meaning that for the string `s` of length `n`, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of `s`, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\n Since there might be multiple possibilities, we can output any valid assignment.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the correct string be `s` of length `n`.\n\n For a given length `k` (from 1 to n-1), we have two candidate strings, say `a` and `b`. One of them is a prefix (so `a = s[0:k]`) and the other is a suffix (so `b = s[n-k:n]`).\n\n But note: the problem does not require to reconstruct the string, only to assign each of the 2n-2 strings as either 'P' or 'S'. And the assignment must be such that there exists at least one string `s` of length `n` that satisfies all the conditions.\n\n How to think?\n\n Observation: \n   The entire string `s` must satisfy: \n     Let the prefixes be `p1, p2, ..., p_{n-1}` (each of length 1 to n-1) and suffixes be `q1, q2, ..., q_{n-1}` (each of length 1 to n-1).\n\n   Then, the string `s` must start with `p1` and end with `q_{n-1}` (the longest suffix). Also, the prefix of length k must equal the first k characters, and the suffix of length k must equal the last k characters.\n\n However, note: we are not told which string is which. But we are guaranteed that the set consists of the proper prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n Alternate idea:\n\n Since the problem says that the given strings are the prefixes and suffixes (two for each length from 1 to n-1) and they are from some existing string, we can try to use the following:\n\n   For each length k (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings. One of them must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n   Now, what if we consider the entire string? We don't know the string, but we can check consistency by assuming that the two strings for a given length k are the prefix and the suffix. However, the same string might appear twice? The problem says \"exactly two strings of each length\", so no duplicates for the same length? Actually, note: the example input: \n        Input: \n          5\n          ba\n          a\n          abab\n          a\n          aba\n          baba\n          ab\n          aba\n\n   Here, the string \"a\" appears twice (and also \"aba\" appears twice). So we have duplicate strings.\n\n   But note: the guarantee is that there are exactly two strings of each length. So for length 1, we have two strings (here both are \"a\") and for length 2, we have two strings (one is \"ba\", the other is \"ab\"? Actually, wait: the example input is given as:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          ba\n          a\n          abab\n          a\n          aba\n          baba\n          ab\n          aba\n\n   This is 8 lines. The lengths should be from 1 to 4 (since n=5). So:\n\n        length 1: two strings: ['a', 'a'] (but wait, there are two 'a' and one more 'a'? Actually, let me count:\n\n        Line 1: \"ba\" -> length 2\n        Line 2: \"a\" -> length 1\n        Line 3: \"abab\" -> length 4\n        Line 4: \"a\" -> length 1\n        Line 5: \"aba\" -> length 3\n        Line 6: \"baba\" -> length 4\n        Line 7: \"ab\" -> length 2\n        Line 8: \"aba\" -> length 3\n\n   So actually, the two strings for length 1 are two \"a\"s, for length 2: \"ba\" and \"ab\", for length 3: \"aba\" and \"aba\" (so two identical \"aba\"), and for length 4: \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\n   So duplicates are allowed.\n\n   How to proceed?\n\n   We can group the strings by their length. Then for each length k (from 1 to n-1), we have two candidates: one for prefix and one for suffix.\n\n   But note: the entire string must be consistent. Consider the constraints:\n\n     Let the string be `s` (of length n). Then:\n\n        Prefix of length 1: s[0:1] = candidate1 (one of the two in length1)\n        Prefix of length 2: s[0:2] = candidate2 (one of the two in length2)\n\n        Similarly for suffixes.\n\n   Also, note that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must not overlap arbitrarily. In fact, we can relate the entire string by:\n\n        s[0:k] = prefix_k\n        s[n-k:n] = suffix_k\n\n   And for k=1, we have the first character, and for k=2, the first two, etc.\n\n   Another observation: the prefix of length k must be the first k characters of the string, and the suffix of length k must be the last k. Therefore, for two different lengths, we can build a candidate string by:\n\n        candidate_string = prefix_1 + ... (but we don't know the rest) \n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire string must have:\n\n        s[0] = first character (from length1 prefix) and also the last character (from length1 suffix) is the same as the first character? Not necessarily.\n\n   However, we can use the fact that the prefix of length 2 must start with the prefix of length 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the suffix of length 1.\n\n   But wait: we don't know which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\n   Idea: \n\n   We are allowed to output any valid assignment. We can try to assign the two strings for each length arbitrarily, but we must ensure that the entire string we form is consistent.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read n and the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n   2. Group the strings by their length. For each length k (from 1 to n-1), we have a list of two strings (which may have duplicates).\n\n   3. Now, we need to assign one of the two to be the prefix and the other to be the suffix for each k.\n\n   4. The challenge: how to choose the assignment for each length so that the entire string can be built?\n\n   Consider: \n        Let the string be s. Then the prefix of length k is s[0:k] and the suffix of length k is s[n-k:n].\n\n        Additionally, the prefix of length k-1 must be s[0:k-1] and the prefix of length k must be s[0:k] = prefix_{k-1} + [next character].\n\n        Similarly, the suffix of length k must be s[n-k:n] and the suffix of length k-1 is s[n-k+1:n] (if we consider the suffix of length k-1 as the last k-1 characters). But wait, the suffix of length k is the last k, so the last k-1 of the suffix of length k is the same as the suffix of length k-1? Actually, no: the suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters, which is the last k-1 of the entire string, but the last k-1 of the suffix of length k is the same as the entire string's last k-1.\n\n        However, the prefix and suffix are independent except for the entire string.\n\n   How about we try to build the entire string from the information?\n\n   Since n is at most 100, but the string we build is of length n (so 100) and we have n-1 conditions, we can try to use the following:\n\n        We know the two candidates for each length. We can assume that the entire string must have:\n\n            s[0] = the first character of the prefix of length 1.\n            s[0:2] = the prefix of length 2 (which must start with the first character above).\n\n        Similarly, the last character must be the first character of the suffix of length 1 (if we assign the suffix of length 1 as the last character) and the last two must be the suffix of length 2 (which must end with the last character above).\n\n        However, we don't know the assignment for each length.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   Note: The problem says that the given set of strings are the proper prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n   We can try to fix the entire string by using the longest prefix and suffix. But note: the longest prefix and suffix are of length n-1. Then we know:\n\n        Let the two strings for length n-1 be A and B. Then one of them is the prefix (so the first n-1 characters) and the other is the suffix (the last n-1 characters). Then the entire string must be of the form:\n\n            If A is the prefix and B is the suffix, then the entire string is A + (the last character of the entire string must match the last character of B? Actually, the entire string is of length n, so the prefix is the first n-1 and the suffix is the last n-1. Then the entire string is:\n\n                s = A + c   and also s = d + B, where c is the last character (which is the same as the first character of the suffix of length 1) and d is the first character (same as the last character of the prefix of length 1). But wait, the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1, so the entire string is:\n\n                s = [prefix of length n-1] + [last character] = A + (character at position n-1) and also s = (first character) + [suffix of length n-1] = (first character) + B.\n\n                Therefore, the first character must be the last character of B (if we assume B is the suffix) and the last character must be the first character of A (if we assume A is the prefix)? Actually, no: the entire string is fixed. \n\n        Actually, the entire string must satisfy:\n\n            s[0:n-1] = A (if we choose A as prefix) and s[1:n] = B (if we choose B as suffix). Then the entire string is:\n\n                s = A + (last character) but the last character is the same as the first character of B? Not exactly: the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1, so:\n\n                s = [A] + [last_char] and s = [first_char] + [B]\n\n                So: A + [last_char] = [first_char] + B.\n\n                Then, the first character of A must be the first_char, and the last character of B must be the last_char.\n\n                Also, the last character of A must equal the first character of B (because the entire string is A + last_char, and also the entire string is first_char + B, so the last character of A is the same as the first character of B).\n\n        But wait, if we choose A as the prefix and B as the suffix, then the entire string is:\n\n                s = A + B[-1]   [because the last character is the last character of the suffix B, which is the last character of the entire string]\n\n                and also s = A + (the last character) and that last character is the last character of B.\n\n                Also, the entire string must start with the first character of A, and the entire string must end with B.\n\n                But note: the entire string is also: [first character] + B. The first character is the first character of A, so:\n\n                s = A + B[-1] = A[0] + ... + B[-1]\n\n                And also, the entire string is the first character (A[0]) and then the next n-1 characters must be B. But wait, the next n-1 characters are A[1:] and then we require that the entire string from index 1 to n-1 is B? \n\n                Then: A[1:] must be the same as B[0:-1] (because the entire string from index 1 to n-1 is the suffix of length n-1, which is B, but wait: the entire string is A (which is the first n-1) and then we appended the last character (which is B[-1]), but the entire string is also the first character (A[0]) and then the next n-1 (which is B). \n\n                So: A[0] + B = A + B[-1] must hold.\n\n                Therefore: A[0] + B = A + B[-1]  =>  A[0] + B = A + B[-1]  =>  B = A[1:] + B[-1] ?\n\n                Actually, let me break it down:\n\n                    Entire string s: \n                        s = A + [B[-1]]   (because we appended the last character of the suffix to the prefix A)\n\n                    But also, s = [A[0]] + B.\n\n                    Then: [A[0]] + B = A + [B[-1]]\n\n                    So: A[0] + B = A + [B[-1]]\n\n                    Then, the first character of A is the same as the first character of B? No, because the entire string is the prefix A (which is the first n-1) and the entire string is also the first character (which is A[0]) and then the suffix B (which is the last n-1). \n\n                    Actually, the entire string is:\n\n                        s = A + [B[-1]]   (this is the first n-1 and then the last character)\n\n                    But also:\n\n                        s = [A[0]] + B   (this is the first character and then the last n-1)\n\n                    Therefore, the entire string must be the same. So:\n\n                        A[0] + B = A + [B[-1]]\n\n                    This implies:\n\n                        A[0] + B = A + [B[-1]]\n\n                    Then, the first character of A must be the first character of B? Actually, the entire string is defined by both. \n\n                    We can write:\n\n                        s = A + B[-1]   --> length n: A has length n-1, so total length is n.\n\n                    and \n\n                        s = A[0] + B    --> also length n.\n\n                    Then, we must have:\n\n                        A[0] + B = A + B[-1]\n\n                    So:\n\n                        B = A[1:] + [B[-1]]\n\n                    But wait, the length of B is n-1, and the length of A[1:] is n-2, so:\n\n                        B must be a string of length n-1: the first n-2 characters are A[1:], and the last character is B[-1]. \n\n                    But note: the last character of B is already the last character of B, so this equation holds if and only if:\n\n                        B = A[1:] + B[-1]   [but the last character of B is just the last character, so we are saying that the entire B is A[1:] concatenated with its own last character? That doesn't hold in general.\n\n        Let me try with the example: n=5, so n-1=4. The two strings for length4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\". \n\n        Suppose we choose \"abab\" as the prefix (so A=\"abab\") and \"baba\" as the suffix (so B=\"baba\"). Then:\n\n            Entire string by prefix and last char: \"abab\" + \"baba\"[-1] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\"\n\n            Entire string by first char and suffix: \"a\" + \"baba\" = \"ababa\"\n\n            They match.\n\n        Now, if we choose \"baba\" as the prefix and \"abab\" as the suffix:\n\n            Entire string by prefix and last char: \"baba\" + \"abab\"[-1] = \"baba\" + \"b\" = \"babab\"\n            Entire string by first char and suffix: \"b\" + \"abab\" = \"babab\"\n\n            But wait, is \"babab\" a valid string? Let's check the prefixes and suffixes for \"babab\":\n\n                Length1: prefix \"b\", suffix \"b\" -> but we have two strings for length1: both are \"a\" in the input. So we don't have \"b\" for length1. Therefore, this assignment is invalid.\n\n        So the assignment for the longest length must be chosen carefully.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the following:\n\n        For k from 1 to n-1, we have two strings. We need to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n        Conditions:\n\n            Condition 1: For each k, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be consistent with the entire string.\n\n        But note: the entire string must be consistent across all k. \n\n        However, we can use the following idea:\n\n            The entire string is determined by the longest prefix and the longest suffix. But we saw that the longest prefix and suffix must satisfy:\n\n                Let A (prefix for length n-1) and B (suffix for length n-1) then:\n\n                    s = A + B[-1] = B[0] + A   [because the entire string is the first char (which is B[0]) and then the suffix of length n-1 is A? Actually, no: the entire string is the first char and then the suffix of length n-1, so the entire string is B[0] + A? Wait, no: the entire string is the first char (which is the prefix of length1, which is one of the strings of length1) and then the next n-2? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n                The entire string must be such that for every k (from 1 to n-1):\n\n                    prefix_k = s[0:k]\n                    suffix_k = s[n-k:n]\n\n                And note that the prefix of length k is the first k characters, and the suffix of length k is the last k.\n\n        We can try to build the entire string from the longest prefix and longest suffix, but we must check consistency for all k.\n\n   However, the problem says that the assignment must be such that there is at least one string. And we are allowed to output any.\n\n   Proposed algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Group the input by length.\n\n        Step 2: For the longest length (n-1), we have two candidates. We try both assignments (if the two candidates are the same, then we only have one option).\n\n        But note: the example input for n=5 had two distinct strings for length4. However, the example input for n=2: \n\n            Input: \n                2\n                a\n                c\n\n            Output: 'PS'\n\n            Here, n=2, so the two strings are of length1. The entire string must be of length2. The two possibilities:\n\n                Option1: assign the first string (say 'a') as prefix and the second ('c') as suffix -> then the entire string must be:\n\n                    By prefix: \"a\" (so first char is 'a')\n                    By suffix: \"c\" (so last char is 'c')\n                    Then the string is \"ac\"\n\n                Option2: assign the first string as suffix and the second as prefix -> then the entire string must be:\n\n                    By prefix: \"c\" (so first char is 'c')\n                    By suffix: \"a\" (so last char is 'a')\n                    Then the string is \"ca\"\n\n            Both are valid. So we can output either \"PPSS\" (if we assign both as prefix) or \"SPSP\" (if we assign the first as suffix and the second as prefix) or any combination? \n\n            But wait, the output is a string of length 2n-2 (which is 2*2-2=2) of 'P' and 'S'. \n\n            In the example, the input has two strings. The output must be two characters. \n\n            The problem says: the i-th character is 'P' if the i-th input string is the prefix, and 'S' otherwise.\n\n            The input order is:\n\n                First string: 'a'\n                Second string: 'c'\n\n            So if we assign the first string as prefix and the second as suffix, then output is \"PS\".\n\n            If we assign the first string as suffix and the second as prefix, then output is \"SP\".\n\n            Both are acceptable.\n\n        How do we decide?\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n            We know that the entire string must be consistent for all lengths. But note: for n=2, we only have length1. Then we don't have any condition for the entire string beyond the two characters. \n\n        However, for longer n, we have multiple lengths. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            For each length k (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings. We want to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n            We can try to build the entire string from the two longest ones (n-1) and then check if the entire string matches the prefixes and suffixes for all k.\n\n        But the problem says: we can output any valid assignment.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Option: \n\n            Let L = sorted lengths from 1 to n-1 in increasing order? Actually, we can process from longest to shortest.\n\n            However, we can also use the following:\n\n                The entire string must have:\n\n                    s[0] = the prefix of length1 (one of the two in length1)\n                    s[0:2] = the prefix of length2 (one of the two in length2)\n\n                and so on.\n\n            But note: we don't know the assignment for each length.\n\n        Alternative Insight from known solutions of similar problems (like CodeForces problems) is to use the following:\n\n            Since the set of prefixes and suffixes must come from the same string, we can consider that the string must be such that the prefix of length k is the first k characters and the suffix of length k is the last k. \n\n            Moreover, the entire string is fixed by the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Then, we can use the following:\n\n                Let A be the set of two strings for length n-1. We try both possibilities (if they are distinct) for the longest prefix and longest suffix.\n\n                Then, we can define the entire string as:\n\n                    s = A_prefix + (last character of A_suffix)   [if we choose A_prefix for the prefix and A_suffix for the suffix]\n\n                But wait, we also have the condition from the suffix: the entire string must end with A_suffix. And the entire string is A_prefix + (last character of A_suffix). Then the last n-1 characters must be A_suffix. \n\n                Therefore, the last n-1 characters of s are the last n-1 characters of (A_prefix + last_char) = last_char is the last character, so the last n-1 is A_prefix[1:] + last_char? \n\n                Actually, the entire string is of length n: A_prefix (length n-1) and then we add one character (the last_char). Then the last n-1 characters are the substring from index 1 to n-1 (0-indexed) of the entire string? \n\n                Example: n=5, A_prefix=\"abab\", last_char='a' (from A_suffix=\"baba\") -> entire string \"ababa\". Then the last 4 characters are \"baba\", which is A_suffix.\n\n                So the condition is automatically satisfied if we use the entire string built from the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix.\n\n                Similarly, if we use the longest suffix and the first character of the longest prefix, we get the same entire string.\n\n            Then, once we fix the entire string, we can check for every length k (from 1 to n-1) that:\n\n                The prefix of length k is the first k characters of the entire string.\n\n                The suffix of length k is the last k characters of the entire string.\n\n            Then, we assign:\n\n                For each length k, the string that equals the first k characters of the entire string is the prefix, and the other is the suffix.\n\n            But note: the entire string we built is from the longest prefix and the longest suffix. However, we must check that for every length k, the two strings provided for that length are exactly the prefix and the suffix we are getting from the entire string.\n\n            However, what if we choose the wrong assignment for the longest length? Then the entire string we build might not match the other lengths.\n\n            Therefore, we must try both possibilities for the longest length, and then for the remaining lengths, we can assign the two strings arbitrarily? Actually, no: the entire string is fixed by the longest prefix and suffix, so we must check that for all k, the prefix of length k (from the entire string) is one of the two candidates for length k, and similarly for the suffix.\n\n            But note: the problem states that the given set of 2n-2 strings are exactly the proper prefixes and suffixes of the string. So if we build a string from the longest prefix and suffix, then the prefixes and suffixes of that string must be the same as the input set.\n\n            However, we are allowed to output any valid assignment. So we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Group by length.\n\n                Step 2: For the longest length (n-1), we have two strings: say X and Y.\n\n                Step 3: Try two possibilities:\n\n                    Possibility 1: \n                         Let s1 = X + Y[-1]   (if we take X as prefix and Y as suffix)\n                    Possibility 2: \n                         Let s2 = Y + X[-1]   (if we take Y as prefix and X as suffix)\n\n                Then, for each possibility, we can check:\n\n                    Build the entire string s (either s1 or s2) of length n.\n\n                    Then, for each length k from 1 to n-1:\n\n                         prefix_k_expected = s[0:k]\n                         suffix_k_expected = s[n-k:n]\n\n                    Then, for each k, the set {prefix_k_expected, suffix_k_expected} must be exactly the set of the two strings of length k (with duplicates handled appropriately).\n\n                If one of the possibilities works, then we can assign:\n\n                    For each length k (from 1 to n-1):\n\n                         If prefix_k_expected is in the list for length k, then mark that occurrence as 'P', and the other as 'S'.\n\n                But note: the input order is given. We must output the assignment in the input order.\n\n            However, the input order is arbitrary. We have to output the answer for the input order.\n\n            How to do that?\n\n            We can:\n\n                Step 1: Read the input and store the strings along with their original index.\n\n                Step 2: Group by length, but remember the index.\n\n                Step 3: After building the entire string s (from one of the possibilities), for each string in the input (in the original order) we check:\n\n                    If the string is a prefix (i.e., it equals s[0:len(string)]) then output 'P', else output 'S'.\n\n            But wait: the problem says that the two strings for a given length are the prefix and the suffix. However, the entire string we built must have the prefix of length k being the first k characters and the suffix of length k being the last k. \n\n            However, note: the set of prefixes and suffixes must be exactly the set of the first k characters and the last k characters for each k. \n\n            But what if the entire string s1 (built from X and Y) has a prefix of length k that is not one of the two strings in the input for length k? Then this possibility is invalid.\n\n            So we must check for each k from 1 to n-1 that:\n\n                The two strings for length k are exactly {s1[0:k], s1[n-k:n]} (or possibly the same if duplicates, but note the problem says there are two strings for each length, but they might be duplicates).\n\n            Actually, the example n=5 had two 'a' for length1, so the set for length1 is {'a','a'} and the expected for the entire string \"ababa\" is:\n\n                prefix1: 'a'\n                suffix1: 'a'\n\n            So the set is {'a','a'} which matches.\n\n            Example n=3: \n                Input: \n                  3\n                  a\n                  aa\n                  aa\n                  a\n\n                Actually, wait: the input has 2*3-2=4 lines. The two strings for length1: ['a','a'], for length2: ['aa','aa'].\n\n                Then the entire string must be of length3. \n\n                Possibility: \n                    Take the two strings for length2: two 'aa'. Then:\n\n                    Possibility 1: s1 = 'aa' + (last character of the suffix, which is one of the length2? Actually, wait: we are using the longest length (n-1=2). The two strings for length2 are both 'aa'. Then:\n\n                    s1 = 'aa' + 'aa'[-1] = 'aa'+'a' = \"aaa\"\n\n                    Check the prefixes and suffixes of \"aaa\":\n\n                        length1: prefix='a', suffix='a' -> matches the two 'a's for length1.\n                        length2: prefix='aa', suffix='aa' -> matches the two 'aa's for length2.\n\n                So this works.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Read n and the 2n-2 strings, storing (index, string, length).\n\n                Step 2: Group the strings by length.\n\n                Step 3: Let L = n-1 (longest length). \n\n                Step 4: For the group of length L, we have two strings: X and Y.\n\n                Step 5: Try two possibilities:\n\n                    Possibility 1: \n                         s = X + Y[-1]   (if we assume X is the prefix and Y is the suffix)\n                    Possibility 2: \n                         s = Y + X[-1]   (if we assume Y is the prefix and X is the suffix)\n\n                Step 6: For each possibility, check for every length k from 1 to n-1:\n\n                         Let the two expected strings for length k be:\n                             p_k = s[0:k]\n                             s_k = s[n-k:n]\n\n                         Then, the multiset (or set if duplicates are considered as multiple) of the two strings in the group for length k must be {p_k, s_k} (with multiplicity).\n\n                Step 7: If one possibility works, then we have our entire string s.\n\n                Step 8: Then, for each string in the original input order, we check:\n\n                         Let the string be t (with length L0). Then, if t is the prefix of s (i.e., t == s[0:L0]) then output 'P', else output 'S'.\n\n            But wait: the entire string s is built from the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix. However, the prefix of length k (for k < n-1) is the first k characters of s, and the suffix is the last k. \n\n            However, the input might have duplicates, so we must compare the entire string s for the prefix and suffix.\n\n            However, note: the entire string s is built from the two longest strings, and then we check for all k. So if the possibility passes step 6, then the entire string is consistent.\n\n            But note: the entire string s is built from the two longest strings, so the prefix of length L (n-1) is fixed (we used the one from the group) and the suffix of length L is fixed (we used the other). Then for k < L, we are just taking the first k and last k of s.\n\n            Example: n=5, s=\"ababa\". Then for k=2, the prefix is \"ab\", and the suffix is \"ba\" (last 2 of \"ababa\" is \"ba\"). But wait, the input for length2 was two strings: \"ba\" and \"ab\". So we have to assign \"ab\" as prefix and \"ba\" as suffix.\n\n            However, in the entire string \"ababa\", the prefix of length2 is \"ab\", and the suffix of length2 is \"ba\". So we assign the string \"ab\" as prefix and \"ba\" as suffix.\n\n            But note: the input order for the two strings of length2 was:\n\n                We read: \n                    Line1: \"ba\" (length2)\n                    Line2: \"a\" (length1)\n                    Line3: \"abab\" (length4)\n                    Line4: \"a\" (length1)\n                    Line5: \"aba\" (length3)\n                    Line6: \"baba\" (length4)\n                    Line7: \"ab\" (length2)\n                    Line8: \"aba\" (length3)\n\n            So the two strings of length2 are \"ba\" (at line1) and \"ab\" (at line7). Then we must output:\n\n                For the first string \"ba\": since the entire string's suffix of length2 is \"ba\", so we output 'S' for the first string? \n\n                But wait: the first string is \"ba\", which is of length2. In the entire string, the prefix of length2 is \"ab\", and the suffix of length2 is \"ba\". So \"ba\" is the suffix, so we output 'S'.\n\n                For the second string of length2 (\"ab\"): it is the prefix, so we output 'P'.\n\n            However, the output string must be of length 2n-2 (8) and in the input order.\n\n            Steps for output:\n\n                We have the entire string s (from the possibility that passed the check).\n\n                Then, for each input string (in the order they were given), we check:\n\n                    Let t be the string, and L0 = len(t)\n\n                    Then, if t == s[0:L0] then output 'P'\n                    Else if t == s[len(s)-L0:] then output 'S'\n                    Otherwise, something is wrong (but the problem guarantees that the set is the prefixes and suffixes, so one of these must hold).\n\n            However, note: the same string might appear twice (like two 'a' for length1). Then we must assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n            Example: two 'a' for length1. Then, the entire string s must start with 'a' and end with 'a'. Then, for each occurrence of 'a' (length1), we assign:\n\n                If we see the first 'a': we don't know if it's the prefix or suffix? Actually, we know: the entire string starts with 'a', so the prefix is 'a'. But wait, the prefix and suffix of length1 are both 'a'. \n\n            Then, we must assign one occurrence as 'P' and the other as 'S'. But which one?\n\n            However, the problem says: the i-th character of the output is 'P' if the i-th input string is the prefix, and 'S' otherwise.\n\n            So we must assign the two 'a' strings: one as prefix and one as suffix. \n\n            How do we know which one is which? \n\n            Actually, we don't. But note: the entire string is fixed. The prefix is the first character and the suffix is the last. So if we have two identical strings for length1, then we have two choices: which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix.\n\n            But wait: the entire string must have the same first and last character (if the two strings for length1 are the same). So then we can assign arbitrarily, but we must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n            However, the problem says: the set of the given strings is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes. \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                For each string in the input, we check:\n\n                    if the string is the prefix (i.e., the first |string| characters of s) then output 'P'\n\n                    else output 'S'\n\n            But note: the entire string s has the prefix of length k as the first k characters, and the suffix of length k as the last k. \n\n            Since the two strings for length1 are both 'a', then both the prefix and the suffix of length1 are 'a'. \n\n            Then, we must assign one occurrence of 'a' as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n            But the problem does not specify which one is which. So we can assign arbitrarily, as long as one is 'P' and the other is 'S'. \n\n            However, the input order is given. \n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Print one string of length 2n-2 — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters '",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves verifying consistency across all possible prefixes and suffixes derived from the input strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The input consists of `2n-2` strings, which are exactly the proper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`) of the unknown string `s`. The task is to assign each string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that there exists at least one string `s` of length `n` consistent with these assignments.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The entire string `s` can be derived from the longest possible prefix and suffix (length `n-1`). By combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix, we form a candidate string. This candidate must match all other prefixes and suffixes of varying lengths to be valid.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Grouping by Length**: First, group all input strings by their lengths (from 1 to `n-1`).\n   - **Candidate Construction**: For the longest length (`n-1`), try both possible combinations (one as prefix, the other as suffix) to form candidate strings.\n   - **Validation**: For each candidate string, check if all other prefixes and suffixes (for lengths 1 to `n-2`) derived from the candidate match the corresponding input strings.\n   - **Assignment**: Once a valid candidate is found, assign each input string as 'P' if it matches the prefix of the candidate, otherwise 'S'.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each string once during grouping and validation, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraint `n ≤ 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for i in range(total_strings):\n        parts = data[index].splitlines()\n        if not parts:\n            index += 1\n            continue\n        s_line = parts[0].strip() if parts else \"\"\n        strings.append(s_line)\n        index += 1\n\n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in groups:\n            groups[l] = []\n        groups[l].append(s)\n\n    L_max = n - 1\n    cand1 = None\n    cand2 = None\n\n    if L_max in groups:\n        lst = groups[L_max]\n        if len(lst) == 2:\n            cand1, cand2 = lst[0], lst[1]\n        elif len(lst) == 1:\n            cand1 = cand2 = lst[0]\n\n    if cand1 is None or cand2 is None:\n        if L_max in groups:\n            lst = groups[L_max]\n            if len(lst) >= 1:\n                cand1 = lst[0]\n            if len(lst) >= 2:\n                cand2 = lst[1]\n\n    possibilities = []\n    if cand1 is not None and cand2 is not None:\n        s1 = cand1 + cand2[-1]\n        s2 = cand2 + cand1[-1]\n        possibilities.append((s1, cand1, cand2))\n        possibilities.append((s2, cand2, cand1))\n    elif cand1 is not None:\n        s1 = cand1 + cand1[-1]\n        possibilities.append((s1, cand1, cand1))\n\n    for poss in possibilities:\n        s_candidate, prefix_long, suffix_long = poss\n        valid = True\n        for k in range(1, L_max):\n            if k not in groups:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            expected_prefix = s_candidate[:k]\n            expected_suffix = s_candidate[len(s_candidate)-k:]\n            actual_group = groups[k]\n            if len(actual_group) == 2:\n                if set(actual_group) != {expected_prefix, expected_suffix}:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            elif len(actual_group) == 1:\n                if expected_prefix != actual_group[0] and expected_suffix != actual_group[0]:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n        if valid and len(s_candidate) == n:\n            result_chars = []\n            for s_in in strings:\n                L0 = len(s_in)\n                prefix_part = s_candidate[:L0]\n                suffix_part = s_candidate[len(s_candidate)-L0:]\n                if s_in == prefix_part:\n                    result_chars.append('P')\n                elif s_in == suffix_part:\n                    result_chars.append('S')\n                else:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            if valid:\n                print(''.join(result_chars))\n                return\n\n    if possibilities:\n        s_candidate, prefix_long, suffix_long = possibilities[0]\n        result_chars = []\n        for s_in in strings:\n            L0 = len(s_in)\n            prefix_part = s_candidate[:L0]\n            suffix_part = s_candidate[len(s_candidate)-L0:]\n            if s_in == prefix_part:\n                result_chars.append('P')\n            elif s_in == suffix_part:\n                result_chars.append('S')\n            else:\n                pass\n        print(''.join(result_chars))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into individual strings, grouped by their lengths.\n2. **Candidate Generation**: The longest possible prefix and suffix (length `n-1`) are used to generate candidate strings by appending the last character of the suffix to the prefix.\n3. **Validation**: Each candidate string is checked against all other prefixes and suffixes (for lengths 1 to `n-2`). If they match, the candidate is valid.\n4. **Output Assignment**: For a valid candidate, each input string is classified as 'P' if it matches a prefix of the candidate, otherwise 'S'. The result is printed immediately upon finding a valid candidate.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates and ensures correctness by leveraging the problem constraints and guarantees.",
