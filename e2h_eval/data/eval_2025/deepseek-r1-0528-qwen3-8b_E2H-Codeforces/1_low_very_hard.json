The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))x(h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n So, for the i-th ring, the ring itself is the outer layer of the inner rectangle. How many cells does that ring have?\n\n For an inner rectangle of size (w') x (h'), the border (ring) has:\n   If the rectangle has only one row or one column, then we cannot form a ring? But note the constraints: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). And we start with the original w,h which are at least 3.\n\n Actually, the ring for a rectangle of size a x b (with a>=1, b>=1) is calculated as follows:\n\n   If a <= 1 or b <= 1, then the ring would be broken? But note the condition on k: it is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). This ensures that we don't go beyond the plate.\n\n However, let's break down:\n\n For the first ring (i=1):\n   The inner rectangle is (w) x (h) -> but wait, actually the first ring is the outermost border. Then the next ring is two cells away, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4).\n\n The ring itself is the perimeter of the inner rectangle. But note: the entire plate is w x h. The first ring uses the outer border: \n   top row: h cells\n   bottom row: h cells\n   left column (excluding the corners already counted): h-2 cells\n   right column (excluding the corners already counted): h-2 cells\n\n But wait, actually we can compute the number of cells in the ring (which is the border) for a rectangle of size a x b as:\n\n   If a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n   Otherwise, if a==1: then the ring is just the single row with b cells? But wait, our rings are defined by inner rectangles that shrink by 4 each time. However, note that the problem states that the first ring is the edge of the plate (so the entire outer border). \n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   The ring for the i-th step (i from 1 to k) is the set of cells that are at exactly distance i from the outer border, but only the outer layer of the inner rectangle.\n\n Actually, the standard way to compute the perimeter of a rectangle (with the ring having width 1) is:\n\n   The total cells in the ring = 2 * (a + b) - 4   [because each side has a length, but the corners are shared]\n\n But wait, let me check with a simple example:\n\n   Example: 3x3 (first ring). Then the ring is the outer border: \n        top row: 3, bottom row: 3, and then the middle row doesn't count because we only take the border. But actually, the border of a 3x3 is the entire outer frame. However, note that the problem says the first ring goes along the edge. In a 3x3, the edge is the outer frame. How many cells? 8.\n\n   Using the formula: 2*(3+3) - 4 = 2*6 -4 = 12-4=8. That matches.\n\n   Now, the second ring (if exists) would be for the inner rectangle of size (w-4) x (h-4). For 3x3, w-4= -1 -> so k must be chosen such that we don't exceed. But the input constraint ensures k is within bounds.\n\n   Another example: 7x9, first ring (k=1): \n        a=7, b=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4 = 28 -> matches the example output.\n\n   Second ring (k=2): \n        The inner rectangle is (7-4)=3 x (9-4)=5 -> then the ring for this inner rectangle is 2*(",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. The key observation here is that each ring corresponds to the perimeter of an inner rectangle that shrinks by 4 cells in both dimensions for each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the number of cells in each ring up to the k-th ring. Each ring is defined by the perimeter of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). The number of cells in the perimeter (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b is given by the formula: 2*(a + b) - 4. This formula accounts for the four corners being shared between adjacent sides.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Using these dimensions, apply the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in that ring. Sum the cells of all k rings to get the total number of cells to be gilded.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the k rings once, performing constant-time calculations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints (k ≤ floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        inner_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        inner_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if inner_w <= 0 or inner_h <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (inner_w + inner_h) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n        \n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Calculate the inner dimensions of the rectangle for the current ring by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both width and height.\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, break the loop as further rings are not possible.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the perimeter formula: 2*(inner_w + inner_h) - 4.\n   - Add the computed cells to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of cells after processing all k rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness within the problem constraints.",
