The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) for chests and one of m integers (b_j) for keys.\n\n Condition: a chest i can be opened by key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) is odd, i.e., \n   (a_i % 2 == 0 and b_j % 2 == 1) OR (a_i % 2 == 1 and b_j % 2 == 0)\n\n Since one key can open at most one chest and vice versa, we are to find the maximum matching between chests and keys that satisfy the condition.\n\n Observation:\n   The condition depends only on the parity (even/odd) of the numbers.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_count = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_count = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest requires an odd key.\n   - An odd chest requires an even key.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to a bipartite matching where:\n   Left side: chests (split into two sets: even_chests and odd_chests)\n   Right side: keys (split into two sets: even_keys and odd_keys)\n\n But note: we cannot use an even key on an even chest and an odd key on an odd chest.\n\n Actually, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n   Graph1: even_chests can only connect to odd_keys.\n   Graph2: odd_chests can only connect to even_keys.\n\n However, the total matching is constrained by the counts and the fact that each key can only be used once.\n\n But note: there is no further constraint because the keys of the same parity are interchangeable for the same type of chest.\n\n Therefore, the problem becomes:\n\n   We want to match as many chests as possible. We have two independent sets:\n\n     Set A (even_chests) must be matched with Set B (odd_keys)\n     Set C (odd_chests) must be matched with Set D (even_keys)\n\n However, the catch is that the same key cannot be used twice. But since the two graphs are disjoint (because even_chests require odd_keys and odd_chests require even_keys), we can independently assign:\n\n   Let x = min(even_chests, odd_keys)   [we can use up to min(even_chests, odd_keys) from even_chests]\n   Let y = min(odd_chests, even_keys)   [we can use up to min(odd_chests, even_keys) from odd_chests]\n\n Then the answer would be x + y.\n\n But wait: is that correct? \n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n        even_chests: [14,6,2] -> count=3\n        odd_chests: [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n        even_keys: [8,4,20] -> count=3\n        odd_keys: [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then by our method:\n        x = min(3, 1) = 1\n        y = min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 3 -> which matches the example.\n\n   Another example: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n        x = min(5,1)=1\n        y = min(0,0)=0\n        total=1 -> matches.\n\n   Third example: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n        Chests: [10] -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n        x = min(1,0)=0\n        y = min(0,4)=0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: what if we have more keys than required but the matching is limited by the other set?\n\n Actually, the above reasoning is correct because the two types of matches are independent.\n\n But note: the matching in one graph does not affect the other. So we can take at most min(even_chests, odd_keys)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - An even-numbered chest must be matched with an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest must be matched with an even-numbered key.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on counting the number of even and odd numbered chests and keys separately. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the chest list.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the key list.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for each category (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys) and summing them up.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each element in the chest and key lists exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (up to 10^5 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chests = len(chests) - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = sum(1 for num in keys if num % 2 == 0)\n    odd_keys = len(keys) - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's remainder when divided by 2.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of matches by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys for one category, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys for the other category. The sum of these two minima gives the total number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two independent maximum matches.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal number of chests to open, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
