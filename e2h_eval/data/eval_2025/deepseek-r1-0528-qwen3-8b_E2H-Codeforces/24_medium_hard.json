She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r.\n\n The cursor starts at `pos` (which is between 1 and n) and there are n tabs.\n\n Operations allowed in one second:\n   - Move the cursor left: from current tab i to max(i-1, a), where a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs.\n   - Move the cursor right: from current tab i to min(i+1, b), where b is the current maximum index of unclosed tabs.\n   - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor: then the new minimum index becomes the current cursor position (so a = i).\n   - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor: then the new maximum index becomes the current cursor position (so b = i).\n\n However, note that after some operations, the set of open tabs is [a, b] and the cursor must be within [a, b].\n\n The goal is to have the open tabs as [l, r]. So we must close all tabs outside [l, r].\n\n There are two parts: closing the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). We can do these in any order.\n\n Let's consider:\n\n Case 1: If the entire initial set is already [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n, then we don't need to do anything? But wait, we start with n tabs. Actually, the problem says we have n tabs initially, and we want to leave [l, r]. So if the segment [l, r] is the entire set, then we don't need to close any tabs. But note: the input condition is 1<=l<=r<=n.\n\n However, note the example: \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0.\n\n So when [l, r] covers [1, n], then we don't need to do anything.\n\n But what if the current tab set is [1, n] but the cursor is somewhere? Then we don't need to close any tabs, so 0 seconds.\n\n However, note: the problem says we start with n tabs (from 1 to n) and we want to leave only [l, r]. So if [l, r] is [1, n], then we leave everything, so 0.\n\n Similarly, if we already have the desired set, we do nothing.\n\n Steps:\n\n We need to close:\n   - All tabs with index < l (if any)\n   - All tabs with index > r (if any)\n\n But note: the cursor is initially at `pos`. We can move the cursor and use the close operations.\n\n How to think?\n\n We have two boundaries to close: left (l) and right (r). We can choose to close from the left or the right first.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n   - To close the left part, we must have the cursor at a tab >= l (because we cannot close below the current tab? Actually, closing left from a tab i closes [a, i-1]. To close everything to the left of l, we must have the cursor at a tab that is at least l (so that a becomes at least l) and then we can close the left part. But note: the operation \"close left\" will set the new a to the current cursor's index. So if we are at a tab i (>= l) and we close left, then we remove everything from the current minimum (initially 1) up to i-1. But we only want to remove up to l-1. So we must have i <= l? Actually, no: we can close the left part by having the cursor at a tab i such that i <= l? Let me clarify:\n\n   Operation: \"close all the tabs to the left\" (i.e., [a, i-1]) sets a = i. So to remove all tabs to the left of l, we need to set a = l. Therefore, we must have the cursor at a tab i >= l, because if we are at i (>= l) then the left close operation will remove [a, i-1] and then the new minimum becomes i. But note: we don't want to remove too much? Actually, we are allowed to remove more than necessary? But wait, the goal is to leave [l, r]. So if we set a = l, then we have removed everything below l. However, if we set a = i (with i > l) then we have removed everything from a (initial) to i-1, which includes [a, l-1] and [l, i-1]. That is acceptable because we are leaving [l, r] and we don't care about the intermediate tabs. But note: we cannot leave any tab outside [l, r]. So we must remove everything outside [l, r]. \n\n However, the process may not necessarily require removing exactly [1, l-1] and [r+1, n] separately. We can also remove more than needed and then correct? Actually, the problem requires leaving exactly [l, r]. So we must remove everything outside [l, r]. But note: the operations are defined on the entire left/right side. \n\n Important: The problem states that after a close operation, the remaining tabs are the ones that were not closed. So we can only close entire segments from the current cursor to one end.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the problem constraints are small (n <= 100), we can try to reason about the cases.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire set is already [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n) then answer 0.\n\n But wait: what if the desired segment is [l, r] and we start with n tabs? Then we must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. However, if [l, r] is the entire set, then l==1 and r==n, so we don't need to close anything.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we have two parts to close: left (from 1 to l-1) and right (from r+1 to n).\n\n However, note: the cursor might be initially inside [l, r] or even outside? But the input condition says: 1<=l<=r<=n and 1<=pos<=n. And the problem states that initially there are n tabs (from 1 to n). So the cursor is always in [1, n]. But if the desired segment is [l, r] and the cursor is at `pos`, then `pos` must be in [l, r]? Not necessarily: consider the example \"6 3 2 4\": here n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The cursor is at 3, which is in [2,4]. But what if the cursor is outside [l, r]? For example, input \"6 1 2 4\", meaning n=6, cursor at tab1, and we want to leave [2,4]. Then the cursor is not in [l, r]. Then we must move the cursor into [l, r] first.\n\n However, the problem states: \"the cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab\", and the input condition does not guarantee that `pos` is in [l, r]. \n\n Example: \n   Input: \"6 1 2 4\" -> we want to leave [2,4]. The cursor is at 1, which is outside.\n\n Steps for \"6 1 2 4\":\n\n   We must close the left part (tab1) and the right part (tabs5,6). But note: to close the left part, we can close from the left if the cursor is at 1? Then we can close left: but wait, the operation \"close left\" from tab1 would close [a,0] which doesn't exist? Actually, the operation is defined as: close all the tabs to the left of the cursor. At the beginning, the set is [1,6]. If the cursor is at 1, then there is no tab to the left, so closing left does nothing? Or is the operation defined only when there are tabs to the left? The problem says: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" (if the cursor is at i, then we close [a, i-1]). If i=1, then [a,0] is empty. So it does nothing.\n\n Alternatively, we can move the cursor to the right until we are at a tab >= l (which is 2) and then close the left part? But note: when we move the cursor, the set of open tabs remains the same until we close. So we can move the cursor to 2 (by moving right once). Then we can close the left part (which is [1,1]) by closing left from tab2. Then we are left with [2,6]. Now we need to close the right part (tabs5,6). Then we must move the cursor to 4 (since we are at 2, then we move right twice: 2->3->4). Then close the right part.\n\n Steps:\n   Start: [1,6], cursor at 1.\n   Step1: move right to 2 (1 sec) -> [1,6], cursor at 2.\n   Step2: close left (now the set becomes [2,6], and a becomes 2) (1 sec) -> total 2.\n   Step3: move right from 2 to 4 (2 moves: 2->3, 3->4) (2 sec) -> total 4.\n   Step4: close right (set becomes [2,4]) (1 sec) -> total 5.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider doing the right part first? But we are at 1, and we cannot close right from 1 to remove [5,6] because the operation \"close right\" from 1 would remove [2,6] (if we didn't move) and then we are left with [1] only, which is too little. So we must be careful.\n\n However, note: the operation \"close right\" from a tab i removes [i+1, b]. So if we are at 1, we can close the right part from 1? That would remove [2,6] and then we are left with [1]. Then we have to fix the left part (we don't need to remove 1 because 1 is not in [2,4]? Actually, we want [2,4], so 1 is not desired and must be removed. But wait: if we close the right part from 1, we remove everything to the right, leaving only [1]. Then we still have to remove 1. But 1 is to the left of the cursor? The cursor is now at 1. Then we can close left from 1: which removes [a,0] (nothing) so it doesn't help.\n\n Alternatively, we can move the cursor to the right to 4 (then we have moved 3 steps: from 1 to 2,3,4) and then close the left part from 4 (removing [1,3]) and then we are left with [4,6] and then we have to close the right part from 4 (removing [5,6]), but then we have [4] which is too little. \n\n Actually, the goal is to leave [2,4]. So we must not remove 2 and 4. \n\n How about:\n\n   Start: [1,6], cursor at 1.\n   Step1: move right to 2 (1 sec) -> [1,6]\n   Step2: close left (removes [1,1]) -> [2,6] (cursor at 2) (1 sec) -> total 2.\n   Step3: move right to 4 (2 sec) -> [2,6] (cursor at 4) (total 4)\n   Step4: close right (removes [5,6]) -> [2,4] (1 sec) -> total 5.\n\n But wait, after step2 we have [2,6] and the cursor at 2. Then we can also close the right part from 2? Because [3,6] is the right part, but we don't want to remove 3,4,5,6? Actually, we want to remove only the ones above 4. But the operation \"close right\" from 2 would remove [3,6] (everything from 3 to the current maximum 6). Then we are left with [2] and then we have to remove the right part from 2 again? \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Start: [1,6], cursor at 1.\n   Step1: move right to 4 (3 seconds) -> [1,6], cursor at 4.\n   Step2: close left (removes [1,3]) -> [4,6] (cursor at 4) (1 sec) -> total 4.\n   Step3: close right (removes [5,6]) -> [4] (cursor at 4) (1 sec) -> total 5.\n\n Then we are left with [4] only. That's not [2,4]. So we must not close the left part beyond 2? \n\n How can we leave [2,4]?\n\n We must ensure that we don't close the desired part. The operation \"close left\" from a tab i closes [a, i-1]. So if we are at i, then we set a = i. Similarly, \"close right\" sets b = i.\n\n So to leave [2,4], we must set a = 2 and b = 4.\n\n How can we set a = 2? By having the cursor at 2 or higher and then closing the left part. Similarly, to set b = 4, we must have the cursor at 4 or lower and then close the right part.\n\n Therefore, the procedure must be:\n\n   We need to set a = 2 and b = 4.\n\n   One way:\n     1. Move the cursor to 2 (from 1: 1 move) -> now the set is [1,6] (until we close, the set remains the same) and cursor at 2.\n     2. Close the left part: then the set becomes [2,6] (a=2) (1 second) -> total 2.\n     3. Then we need to set b=4. We are at 2. We must move the cursor to 4 (2 moves: from 2 to 3 to 4) (2 seconds) -> total 4.\n     4. Close the right part: set becomes [2,4] (1 second) -> total 5.\n\n   Another way:\n     1. Move the cursor to 4 (from 1: 3 moves) -> total 3.\n     2. Close the right part: set becomes [1,4] (b=4) (1 second) -> total 4.\n     3. Now we need to set a=2. We are at 4. We must move the cursor to 2 (2 moves: 4->3->2) (2 seconds) -> total 6.\n     4. Close the left part: set becomes [2,4] (1 second) -> total 7.\n\n   This is worse.\n\n   Another way: \n     1. Move the cursor to 2 (1 move) -> 1 second.\n     2. Close the left part (set a=2) -> 1 second (total 2).\n     3. Now we are at 2, and the set is [2,6]. Then we need to close the right part to 4. But we are at 2. We can move to 4 (2 moves) and then close the right part (1 second): total 5.\n\n   Alternatively, after step2 (set a=2) we are at 2. Then we can also close the right part from 2? But that would set b=2, and then we get [2,2] which is too little. So we must move to 4 first.\n\n   What if we do two moves to the right from 2: \n        Step1: from 2 to 3 (1 sec) -> set [2,6]\n        Step2: from 3 to 4 (1 sec) -> set [2,6]\n        Then close the right part (1 sec) -> total 4 (from the two moves and one close) plus the initial 2 seconds for moving to 2 and closing left: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n   So 5 is the minimal.\n\n But note: we can also consider moving the cursor to 3 (from 2) and then closing the right part? Then we set b=3, and then we have [2,3] (which is a subset of [2,4]) but we haven't removed the right part above 4. Then we have to remove from 4 to ... but we are at 3. Then we can move to 4 and close the right part? Then we set b=4, but then we remove [5,?] but we already set b=3, so the set is [2,3] and then we close the right part from 3: that removes [4,?] but wait, the set is [2,3] so the maximum is 3, so closing the right part from 3 does nothing.\n\n Actually, the set changes only by the close operations. The close operations change the boundaries. Once we set a=2, the set is [2,6] (until we set b). Then we can move arbitrarily and set b=4.\n\n After setting a=2, the set is [2,6] (so the maximum is 6). Then we can move the cursor to 4 and then close the right part to set b=4.\n\n So the minimal time is 5.\n\n However, let me consider the example provided: \n   Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> output 5.\n\n But wait, the example input was: \n   ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n   Output: ['5', '1', '0']\n\n So the first example is 5, which matches.\n\n Now, the second example: \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n Let's analyze: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n We must close the right part (tabs 4,5,6). The left part is from 1 to 0? None. So we only need to close the right part.\n\n Steps:\n   We can close the right part from the current cursor (at 3). Then we set b=3, so the set becomes [1,3]. That is the desired set.\n\n   Time: 1 second (for closing the right part).\n\n   But wait: we don't need to move the cursor. So total 1 second.\n\n   However, what if the cursor was at 3 and we close the right part, then we are done.\n\n   But note: the operation \"close right\" sets the maximum to the cursor's index. So we don't need to move.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\n The third example: \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0.\n\n   We must close the left part? None (since l=1) and the right part? None (since r=5). So 0.\n\n Now, let's consider a general approach:\n\n We have two boundaries to set: a = l and b = r.\n\n The operations that set a and b are the \"close left\" and \"close right\". Each such operation requires being at a specific position (to the right of the left boundary we wish to remove for \"close left\", and to the left of the right boundary we wish to remove for \"close right\").\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the cursor is already in [l, r] (which is always true because the initial set is [1, n] and l and r are within [1, n] and the cursor is in [1, n]? Not necessarily: if the desired [l, r] is [2,4] and the cursor is at 1, then we are outside. So we must check: the cursor is initially at `pos`. \n\n 2. We have to consider two types of operations: moving and closing.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Option A: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n   Option B: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n\n But note: we might not need to close one of them.\n\n Conditions:\n\n   If l == 1, then we don't need to close the left part (because there are no tabs to the left of 1). Similarly, if r == n, then we don't need to close the right part.\n\n So the problem reduces to:\n\n   Let left_needed = (l > 1)   [meaning we need to remove tabs from 1 to l-1]\n   Let right_needed = (r < n)  [meaning we need to remove tabs from r+1 to n]\n\n   Then we have two independent tasks, but the order and the movement required depend on the starting position.\n\n How to compute the minimal seconds?\n\n We can break into cases:\n\n Case 1: No closing needed (left_needed and right_needed are false). Then answer 0.\n\n Case 2: Only left needed (right_needed is false). Then we must close the left part. We can do:\n\n        Option 1: Move the cursor to l (if we are not already at or beyond l) and then close the left part.\n\n        But note: we can also close the left part without moving if we are already at a position >= l? Actually, to close the left part, we must set the new minimum to l. The operation \"close left\" from a tab i sets a = i. So if we are at i, then we remove [a, i-1]. We want to remove [1, l-1]. So we must set a = l. Therefore, we must have i >= l (because if i < l, then we remove [a, i-1] which is [1, i-1] and leaves [i, n] which still has [l, i-1] if i < l, which is not desired). \n\n        Actually, to remove [1, l-1], we must set the new a to l. The operation \"close left\" sets a = i. So we must have i >= l. Then we remove [a, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] and possibly more (if i > l). But that's okay because we are allowed to remove more than needed? Actually, no: we must leave [l, r]. If we set a = i (with i>l) then we have removed [1, i-1] and then we are left with [i, n]. But we want [l, r]. So if i>l, then we have removed [1, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] and [l, i-1] (which is part of the desired set). That is bad.\n\n        Therefore, we must set a = l exactly. So we must have the cursor at a tab i such that i >= l, and then we do the close left operation. But note: the close left operation sets a = i. So to set a = l, we must have i = l. Therefore, we must be at l to close the left part without affecting the desired set.\n\n        Similarly, for closing the right part: we must be at r to set b = r.\n\n        So the operations:\n\n          To close the left part (only): we must move the cursor to l (if not already there) and then close left (1 second).\n\n          To close the right part (only): we must move the cursor to r (if not already there) and then close right (1 second).\n\n        But wait: what if we are already at a position >= l? Then we can move to l and then close left? Or maybe we can close left from a position greater than l? Then we set a = i (with i>l) which removes [1, i-1] and then we are left with [i, n]. Then we must also remove [i+1, n] if i != r? But wait, we are only closing the left part. However, our goal is to leave [l, r]. So if we set a = i (with i>l) then we have removed [1, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] and [l, i-1]. But we want to keep [l, r]. So if i-1 >= r, then we have removed [l, r] as well? That is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, to close the left part, we must set a = l. So we must be at a tab i >= l, and then the close left operation sets a = i. To set a = l, we must have i = l.\n\n        Similarly, for the right part: we must set b = r, so we must be at r.\n\n        Therefore, the procedure for one part is:\n\n          For closing the left part (only):\n            - If we are not at l, then we must move to l (the distance |pos - l| moves? But note: the set of tabs is contiguous and the cursor moves one tab per second, and we can move either direction. However, we are in the entire set [1, n] until we close. So the movement from pos to l is |pos - l| seconds.\n\n          Then close left (1 second). Total: |pos - l| + 1.\n\n          But wait: what if we are already at l? Then we just do the close left (1 second).\n\n          However, what if we are at a position greater than l? Then we can move left to l (which takes (pos - l) seconds) and then close left (1 second). \n\n          Similarly, if we are at a position less than l, then we must move right to l (which takes (l - pos) seconds) and then close left (1 second).\n\n        But wait: what if we are at a position greater than l? Then we can close left from a position greater than l? Then we set a = i (with i>l) and then we have removed [1, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] and [l, i-1]. Then the set becomes [i, n]. Then we must also adjust the set to [l, r] (but we are only closing the left part, and the problem requires leaving [l, r]). So this is incorrect.\n\n        Therefore, we must set a = l. So we must be at l to close the left part.\n\n        Similarly, for the right part: we must set b = r, so we must be at r.\n\n        However, what if we want to close both parts? Then we have two operations, each requiring being at a specific position (l for left and r for right). We can do:\n\n          Option 1: Go to l first, then go to r (after closing left, the set is [l, n] so we can move from l to r, and then close right).\n          Option 2: Go to r first, then go to l.\n\n        But note: after closing left, the set is [l, n] (so the maximum is n) and we can move freely from l to r. Similarly, after closing right, the set is [1, r] and we can move from r to l.\n\n        However, the minimal time is the minimum of:\n\n          Option 1: \n            Move from pos to l: |pos - l| seconds.\n            Then close left: 1 second.\n            Then move from l to r: |l - r| seconds.\n            Then close right: 1 second.\n            Total: |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1\n\n          Option 2:\n            Move from pos to r: |pos - r| seconds.\n            Then close right: 1 second.\n            Then move from r to l: |r-l| seconds.\n            Then close left: 1 second.\n            Total: |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1\n\n        But note: the movement from l to r is |l-r|, and from r to l is the same.\n\n        However, we might not need to move the entire distance if we can use the fact that we have already moved partially? Actually, the above calculation is for independent movements.\n\n        Also, we must consider: what if we can combine the two operations? For example, if we are at pos, and we need to go to l and then to r, but if pos is between l and r, then we don't need to go back and forth.\n\n        Actually, the above two options cover the two orders.\n\n        But wait: there's a third option: we don't necessarily have to go to the exact boundary? \n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n        We must set a = l and b = r.\n\n        Operation for left: set a = i (current cursor) and we require a = l, so i must be l.\n        Operation for right: set b = i (current cursor) and we require b = r, so i must be r.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at l at the moment of closing left, and at r at the moment of closing right.\n\n        So the sequence must include being at l and then (if we do left first) at r (after moving from l to r). Similarly, if we do right first, we must be at r and then at l.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal time is the minimum between:\n\n          Option1: (distance from pos to l) + 1 + (distance from l to r) + 1\n          Option2: (distance from pos to r) + 1 + (distance from r to l) + 1\n\n        But note: the distance from l to r is |l - r|, and from r to l is the same.\n\n        However, we can also consider if we are already in the interval [l, r] and we don't need to move the entire distance? Actually, the movement from pos to l is |pos-l|, and from pos to r is |pos-r|.\n\n        But note: the problem allows moving one step at a time and the boundaries are fixed until we close.\n\n        However, there is an edge: what if we are already at l? Then we don't need to move to l (0 seconds) and then we move from l to r (|l-r|) and then close right (1). Similarly, if we are already at r, then we don't need to move to r (0 seconds) and then we move from r to l (|r-l|) and then close left (1).\n\n        But wait: what if we are already at l and we don't need to close the right part? Then we don't do the second part. Similarly for r.\n\n        So we have to consider the conditions:\n\n          Let left_needed = (l > 1)\n          Let right_needed = (r < n)\n\n        Then:\n\n          If left_needed and right_needed:\n             ans = min( |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1, |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1 )\n\n          But note: |l-r| is the same as |r-l|, so we can write:\n\n             ans = min( |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2, |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2 )\n\n          However, we can also consider: what if we can do the two operations without moving the entire distance? Actually, we must be at l to do the left close and at r to do the right close. The movement from the starting position to l (or to r) and then to the other boundary is independent.\n\n        But wait: what if we are already at a position that is both in the path to l and to r? Then we don't have to move from l to r from scratch, but actually we are breaking the movements into two parts.\n\n        However, the above formula counts the entire movement from pos to l (or r) and then from l to r (or from r to l). But if we do the left close first, then we are at l and then we move to r (which is |l-r|). Similarly, if we do the right close first, we are at r and then we move to l (|r-l|). \n\n        But note: the movement from l to r is |l-r|, and from r to l is |r-l| (same).\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if we are already in [l, r]? Then we don't need to move from l to r if we did the left close first? Actually, no: we have to go from l to r, regardless.\n\n        Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\n          Option1: \n            Move from 5 to 3: 2 seconds.\n            Close left: 1 second -> set a=3, set becomes [3,10].\n            Then move from 3 to 7: 4 seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second -> set becomes [3,7].\n            Total: 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n          Option2:\n            Move from 5 to 7: 2 seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second -> set b=7, set becomes [1,7].\n            Then move from 7 to 3: 4 seconds.\n            Close left: 1 second -> set becomes [3,7].\n            Total: 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n        But wait, is there a better way?\n\n        Consider: we don't have to go all the way to 3 and then to 7. We are at 5 initially. We can move to 3 (2 moves) and then close left (1) and then we are at 3, and then we move to 7 (4 moves). Alternatively, we can move to 7 (2 moves) and then close right (1) and then move to 3 (4 moves) and then close left (1). \n\n        But note: after closing left (first option) we are at 3, and then we move to 7: that's 4 moves. Similarly, after closing right we are at 7 and then move to 3: 4 moves.\n\n        However, what if we move from 5 to 3 (2 moves), then close left (1), then instead of moving from 3 to 7, we can move from 3 to 5 (2 moves) and then to 7 (2 moves)? That would be 2+1+2+2=7, but then we haven't closed the right part. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Step1: move from 5 to 3 (2 seconds)\n          Step2: close left (1 second) -> [3,10], cursor at 3.\n          Step3: move from 3 to 5 (2 seconds) -> [3,10], cursor at 5.\n          Step4: move from 5 to 7 (2 seconds) -> [3,10], cursor at 7.\n          Step5: close right (1 second) -> [3,7].\n\n          Total: 2+1+2+2+1 = 8.\n\n        So no improvement.\n\n        But note: the problem allows closing the left part from a position that is not l? Actually, we saw that to set a=l we must be at l. So we must be at l to do the left close.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal time for two operations is the minimum of the two orders.\n\n        However, there is a possibility: we can do the two closes without moving the entire distance from l to r? \n\n        Actually, we are forced to move from l to r (if we do left first) because we need to be at r to close the right part.\n\n        But wait: after closing left, the set is [l, n] (so the maximum is n). Then to close the right part, we must be at r (to set b=r). So we must move from l to r.\n\n        Similarly, if we close right first, the set becomes [1, r] and then we must move from r to l.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        But wait: what if we are already at a position that is in the desired segment and we can do one close without moving to the boundary? \n\n        Example: only left part needed (l>1, r==n). Then:\n\n          We must set a = l. So we must move to l (if not already) and then close left.\n\n          Steps:\n            If we are at pos, then we move to l (|pos-l| seconds) and then close left (1 second). Total: |pos-l| + 1.\n\n          Similarly, if only the right part is needed, then: |pos-r| + 1.\n\n        Now, let's test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"6 3 2 4\" -> n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n          left_needed: 2>1 -> True\n          right_needed: 4<6 -> True\n\n          Then we do:\n\n            Option1: |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n            Option2: |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n          Example 2: \"6 3 1 3\" -> n=6, pos=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with n tabs, and the cursor is initially at position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right by one tab per second or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that to leave only the tabs from l to r, we must close all tabs to the left of l and all tabs to the right of r. The operations to close these tabs require the cursor to be positioned exactly at l (to close all tabs left of l) and at r (to close all tabs right of r). \n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), the answer is 0.\n   - If only tabs to the left of l need to be closed, move the cursor to l and then close the left tabs (cost: |pos - l| + 1 seconds).\n   - If only tabs to the right of r need to be closed, move the cursor to r and then close the right tabs (cost: |pos - r| + 1 seconds).\n   - If both left and right tabs need to be closed, consider two scenarios:\n     - Move to l first, then to r, and close both sides (cost: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2 seconds).\n     - Move to r first, then to l, and close both sides (cost: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2 seconds).\n   The minimal cost between these two scenarios is the answer.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for closing tabs and calculating the minimal time based on the initial cursor position and the required segment [l, r]. The algorithm efficiently computes the minimal steps by evaluating the movement and closure operations in the optimal order.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, resulting in a constant time complexity O(1), which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l_val > 1)\n    right_needed = (r_val < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if not left_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - r_val)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if not right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - l_val)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(r_val - l_val) + 2\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers: n (number of tabs), pos (initial cursor position), l_val (left boundary of the desired segment), and r_val (right boundary of the desired segment).\n2. **Immediate Exit Conditions**: If the entire range of tabs [1, n] is already the desired segment (l_val = 1 and r_val = n), the answer is 0 since no operations are needed.\n3. **Check for Left/Right Closure Needs**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (l_val > 1) or right (r_val < n).\n4. **Single-Side Closure Handling**: If only one side needs closure, calculate the time to move the cursor to the respective boundary and perform the closure operation.\n5. **Two-Side Closure Handling**: If both sides need closure, compute the time for both possible orders (left then right, or right then left) and choose the minimal time.\n6. **Output Result**: Print the computed minimal time based on the above conditions.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal time is calculated by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional logic.",
