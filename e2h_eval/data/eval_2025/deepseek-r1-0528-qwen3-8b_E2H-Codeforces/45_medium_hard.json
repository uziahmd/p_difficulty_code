There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament structure is constrained by the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to allow the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n The key idea is that the tournament can be broken down into rounds, but the constraint on the number of previous games for each player limits how the matches can be scheduled.\n\n We can model the tournament as a complete binary tree, but the constraint forces that the winner must face opponents that are \"close\" in terms of the number of wins (which is the same as the level in the tree).\n\n Actually, the problem is known to be solved by a recursive (or iterative) approach that breaks the tournament into two halves and then one half is used to build up the number of wins for the winner.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Let f(n) be the maximum number of games the winner can play when there are n players.\n\n Base cases:\n   n = 1 -> 0 games (but n>=2)\n   n = 2 -> 1 game\n   n = 3 -> 2 games? Actually, from example: input 3 gives output 2.\n\n However, let's try to understand with examples:\n\n Example: \n   n=2 -> 1\n   n=3 -> 2\n   n=4 -> 2\n   n=10 -> 4\n\n How to get these?\n\n Let's assume we can break the tournament into two parts: one part for the winner's path and the other for the rest.\n\n Another way: the winner must win k games. Then, the tournament must have at least k+1 rounds (if we consider each round as one game per player). But note: the constraint on the difference in games played.\n\n Actually, the problem can be related to the following:\n\n We want to arrange the tournament so that the winner plays as many games as possible. This means that we need to provide enough \"challenges\" (opponents) that are appropriately \"level\" (in terms of wins) for each game.\n\n Consider: \n   After the winner wins his first game, he has 1 win. Then, in the next game, he must play someone who has either 0, 1, or 2 wins? But wait, the rule says the difference is at most one. So the opponent must have 0, 1, or 2 wins? \n\n However, note that the entire tournament is fixed and we are free to arrange the grid as long as the rule holds.\n\n Insight:\n\n We can view the tournament as being built in stages. The winner must win k games. Then, for each stage (game) the winner has played, the number of players that have played i games must be sufficient to form the bracket.\n\n Alternatively, we can think about the entire tournament having a structure that is a balanced binary tree, but sometimes we may have to use a non-binary tree? Actually, the constraint allows two players to have at most one difference in the number of games.\n\n Known similar problem: CodeForces problem \"Tennis Championship\", but the solution is often solved by recursion or by using the fact that the maximum number of games for the winner is the maximum integer k such that:\n\n   k(k+1)//2 <= n-1   ?\n\n But wait, in the example:\n   n=2: k=1 -> 1*(2)//2 = 1 <= 1 -> valid, but k=2 would be 3 which is >1 -> so maximum k=1 -> correct.\n   n=3: k=2 -> 2*3//2 = 3 <= 2? No, because n-1=2. So that doesn't fit.\n\n Alternatively, consider that the tournament must have at least 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^k players? Actually, no.\n\n Another known approach for such problems is to use recursion:\n\n   Let f(1) = 0 (if one player, no game) but our n>=2.\n   We know that the tournament is arranged as a full binary tree? Not necessarily.\n\n Actually, from the examples:\n\n   n=2: 1 game -> winner has 1 win.\n   n=3: 2 games -> winner has 2 wins.\n   n=4: 2 games -> winner has 2 wins.\n\n Why can't the winner have 3 wins for n=4? Because if the winner plays 3 games, then we need 7 players (since a player who wins 3 games must beat 3 opponents, and the tournament must have at least 1 + 2 + 4 + 8? Actually, no. The minimal number of players for a winner to have k wins is: 2^k (if the winner beats 2^0, 2^1, ... , 2^(k-1) players). But wait, actually the minimal number of players is 2^k (if we have a linear chain, but the constraint allows a more balanced structure?).\n\n Actually, the minimal number of players required for a winner to have k wins is the (k+1)-th triangular number? Or perhaps a different structure.\n\n Let me define:\n\n   Let g(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can have k wins.\n\n   For k=0: 1 player -> 0 wins.\n   For k=1: 2 players -> 1 win.\n   For k=2: 3 players? Actually, with 3 players: the winner must win 2 games. But wait, with 3 players, the tournament is: \n        First game: two players, say A and B. Then the winner (say A) plays the third player (C). Then A wins. So that's 2 wins. So minimal players for 2 wins is 3.\n\n   For k=3: minimal players?\n        We require that the winner has 3 wins. Then the structure must have:\n          - In the first game, the winner (player 1) plays one opponent (with 0 wins) -> now has 1 win.\n          - Then, to play the second game, he must play someone who has either 0,1, or 2 wins. But the other branch: we have to set up the rest of the tournament.\n\n        Actually, we can think: the winner must defeat 3 opponents. But note: the tournament is single elimination. The minimal number of players is the total number of players that must be present to have a chain of wins for the winner.\n\n        The winner must defeat one player in each of his 3 games. Additionally, the players that the winner defeats must themselves have won their previous games. Moreover, the opponents for the winner must have been built from the remaining players.\n\n        The minimal configuration for k wins is: \n          - The winner must have beaten 1, 2, 4, ... ? Actually, no.\n\n        Alternatively, consider:\n\n          Let T(k) be the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\n          To have k wins, the winner must have played k games. In the last game (the k-th), the opponent must have played at most k-1 games (because the difference is at most one). But the opponent must have come from a subtree that requires T(k-1) players (if we consider the opponent must have played k-1 games, then we need a subtree that produces a winner with k-1 wins, which requires T(k-1) players). However, wait: the opponent in the k-th game must have played k-1 games, so that opponent must have won k-1 games. Therefore, the minimal number of players to produce an opponent with k-1 wins is T(k-1). \n\n        But also, the winner must have played k games, meaning that the first k-1 games must have been against opponents that were built from the remaining players.\n\n        However, note: the entire tournament must have the winner and the two subtrees (one for the opponent in the last game and the others for the rest of the opponents). \n\n        Actually, the minimal structure is:\n\n          T(0) = 1\n          T(1) = 2\n          T(2) = 3 + 1? Actually, for k=2: we have the winner (1) and then two opponents: one that lost to the winner in the first game and the one that the winner beat in the second game. But the second game opponent must have played one game (so we need two players for that opponent's path: one for the first game of that opponent and the one he beat). \n\n        Alternatively, we can build the minimal tournament for k wins:\n\n          - The winner must have k wins, so he must have k opponents.\n          - Each of these k opponents must have won some games. Specifically, the opponent in the i-th game (for i from 1 to k) must have played at least i-1 wins (because the difference between the winner's i wins and the opponent's wins must be at most 1, so the opponent must have at least i-2 wins? Actually, the rule is: at the time of the match, the two players must have numbers of wins that differ by at most one.\n\n        However, we can also use the following recurrence:\n\n          Let T(k) be the minimal number of players to have a winner with k wins.\n\n          Then, the tournament for k wins must include:\n            - The winner (1 player)\n            - The opponents: in the k-th game, the opponent must have k-1 wins (so we need a subtree that produces a player with k-1 wins, which requires T(k-1) players). But also, the winner must have faced k-1 other opponents (each from a separate subtree) and the condition for the earlier games.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          T(0) = 1\n          T(1) = 2\n          For k >= 2, the tournament must have:\n            - The winner's k opponents: one of them comes from a subtree of size T(k-1) (for the last game) and the others (k-1) can come from subtrees that are built with the condition that they have at most k-2 wins (because the winner's first k-1 games must have opponents that have at most k-2 wins, but wait: the rule is that the opponent must have at most one difference from the winner's current wins (which are from 1 to k-1). \n\n        Alternatively, note the following: the entire tournament must have the winner and the k opponents, and each opponent must be the winner of a subtree. The minimal number of players is:\n\n          T(k) = 1 + T(k-1) + T(k-2)\n\n        Why?\n          - The winner (1)\n          - The opponent in the last game (the one that requires k-1 wins) must be the winner of a subtree of T(k-1) players.\n          - The other k-1 opponents? Actually, wait: the first k-1 games: the winner must play k-1 games. But the rule says that the opponent in the i-th game (i from 1 to k-1) must have at most i wins (actually, the winner at that point has i-1 wins, so the opponent must have at least i-2 and at most i). However, we cannot mix arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, a better way is to note that the entire tournament can be split into three parts for the k-th win:\n\n          - The winner.\n          - The opponent for the last (k-th) game: which requires a subtree of T(k-1) players (to have an opponent with k-1 wins).\n          - The rest of the opponents (k-1 opponents) must be from subtrees that are built so that they can be scheduled without violating the rule. However, we can use the same structure recursively.\n\n        But note: the entire tournament must have exactly n players. And we are trying to maximize the number of wins (k) for the winner.\n\n        There is a known solution for this problem (from CodeForces) that uses the following:\n\n          We are to compute the maximum k such that the minimal number of players required for k wins is <= n.\n\n          The recurrence for the minimal number of players for k wins is:\n\n            T(0) = 1\n            T(1) = 2\n            T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)   [for k>=2]\n\n        Then, we are looking for the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n        However, let's check:\n\n          k=0: T(0)=1\n          k=1: T(1)=2\n          k=2: T(2)= T(1)+T(0)= 2+1=3\n          k=3: T(3)= T(2)+T(1)=3+2=5\n          k=4: T(4)=5+3=8\n          k=5:13, k=6:21, etc.\n\n        Now, compare with the examples:\n\n          n=2: k=1 -> T(1)=2 <=2 -> k=1, then k=2: T(2)=3>2 -> so max k=1 -> correct.\n          n=3: k=1: T(1)=2<=3, k=2: T(2)=3<=3 -> so k=2 -> correct.\n          n=4: k=1: T(1)=2<=4, k=2: T(2)=3<=4, k=3: T(3)=5>4 -> so k=2 -> correct.\n          n=10: \n            k=1:2<=10\n            k=2:3<=10\n            k=3:5<=10\n            k=4:8<=10\n            k=5:13>10 -> so k=4 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the maximum k such that T(k) <= n, where T is defined by:\n\n          T(0) = 1\n          T(1) = 2\n          T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)   for k>=2.\n\n        But note: the problem states that the winner must win k games. In our recurrence, k is the number of wins.\n\n        However, wait: the recurrence T(k) is the minimal number of players to have a winner with k wins. Then the answer for n is the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n        But note: the example n=10 gives k=4, which is the 4th term (indexing from 0: k=0,1,2,3,4). So we are counting k from 0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We need to compute the Fibonacci-like sequence until we exceed n.\n\n        However, note that n can be as large as 10**18, so we cannot iterate k from 0 until we exceed n (because k will be about O(log_phi(n)) which is around 100 terms, but we can do that).\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Let T0 = 1, T1 = 2.\n          k = 0\n          Then we start with k=0, then k=1, then k=2, etc.\n\n          But note: the problem says n>=2, and we are to output the maximum k (which is the number of wins) such that T(k) <= n.\n\n        However, note: the minimal number of players for k wins is T(k). But is that the only requirement? Yes, because if we have T(k) <= n, then we can arrange the tournament so that the winner has k wins. If we have T(k) > n, then we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the maximum k (number of wins) for which T(k) <= n.\n\n        But wait: the example n=10: k=4, so the answer is 4.\n\n        However, note: the example outputs for n=2,3,4,10 are [1,2,2,4]. So the output is k (the number of wins).\n\n        But wait, in the example n=10, the answer is 4, which is the number of wins.\n\n        However, note that the minimal number of players for k wins is T(k). We are not directly given k, we are given n (number of players). We must find the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We'll generate the sequence T(k) until T(k) exceeds n, counting k.\n\n          Then output k (the last k for which T(k)<=n) but note: k is the index (starting from 0) and the value T(k) is the minimal players for k wins.\n\n          However, note: the recurrence:\n\n            k=0: T(0)=1 -> wins=0, but we want the number of wins (games the winner plays) so k is the number of wins.\n\n          But wait, in the example n=2: we output 1, which is k=1.\n\n          So we are actually counting the wins as k.\n\n          Therefore, we need to compute the maximum k (which is the number of wins) such that T(k) <= n.\n\n        However, note that the recurrence T(k) is defined for k>=0, and the wins are k.\n\n        But wait: why does k=0 correspond to 0 wins? Then k=1 corresponds to 1 win.\n\n        So the answer is k (the index) and we are generating the sequence for k=0,1,2,...\n\n        But note: the minimal number of players for k wins is T(k). Then the maximum k is the maximum integer k for which T(k) <= n.\n\n        However, note: the sequence T(k) is:\n\n          k: 0 -> T(0)=1\n          k: 1 -> T(1)=2\n          k: 2 -> T(2)=3\n          k: 3 -> T(3)=5\n          k: 4 -> T(4)=8\n          k: 5 -> T(5)=13\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Let k = 0\n          a, b = 1, 2\n          while b <= n:\n              k += 1\n              # update a and b: next term is a+b\n              a, b = b, a+b\n\n          But wait, when we start, we have:\n            k=0: a=1, then we check if 1<=n? (n>=2, so yes). Then we move to k=1: then a=2, and check if 2<=n? Then k=2: a=3, then k=3: a=5, then k=4: a=8, then k=5: a=13 -> stop.\n\n          Then the answer is k (the last k for which T(k)<=n) but note: at the beginning, we haven't updated k for the initial state (k=0). Then we update k to 1 and then check the next value.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          k = 0\n          a, b = 1, 2\n          while b <= n:\n              k = 1   # no, we need to count the last k.\n\n          Actually, we want the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            k = 0\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n          Then k is the last index we computed, and T(k)=b, but then we break when b>n, so the last valid k is k-1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can count the steps.\n\n          Let me restructure:\n\n          We are going to iterate until the next term exceeds n, and we count the number of wins (k) we can achieve.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let k = 0 (current number of wins, and we have T(0)=1)\n            Then we want to go to k=1, then k=2, etc.\n\n            But note: the minimal players for k wins is T(k). We start with k=0, then k=1, then k=2, ... until T(k) > n.\n\n            We are to output k (the last k for which T(k) <= n).\n\n          However, we must note that the condition for k=0: T(0)=1 <= n (for n>=2, yes). Then we update to k=1: T(1)=2, then k=2: T(2)=3, etc.\n\n          But we cannot output k=0 for n>=2 because the winner must win at least one game.\n\n          Actually, the problem states: the winner must win all his/her games. So the minimal wins is 1 (if n>=2). \n\n          The recurrence gives:\n\n            k=0: 1 player -> 0 wins (not applicable for n>=2, but our n>=2, so we don't care about k=0 for n>=2).\n\n          How to handle:\n\n            We want the maximum k (number of wins) such that T(k) <= n.\n\n          But note: the minimal players for k wins is T(k). So we are just counting the maximum k for which T(k) <= n.\n\n          Since T(0)=1, T(1)=2, T(2)=3, T(3)=5, ... \n\n          Then for n=2: k=1 (because T(1)=2<=2, and T(2)=3>2 -> so k=1)\n          For n=3: k=2 (because T(2)=3<=3, and T(3)=5>3 -> so k=2)\n          For n=4: k=2 (because T(2)=3<=4, T(3)=5>4 -> so k=2)\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, note: the example n=10: k=4 (because T(4)=8<=10, T(5)=13>10 -> k=4)\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We can use:\n\n            a, b = 1, 2   # T(0) and T(1)\n            k = 0          # current k (meaning we have computed up to T(k))\n            wins = 0       # the maximum wins we can have (which is k, the last index we computed that is <= n)\n\n            But wait, we start with k=0 (T(0)=1) and then we update to k=1 (T(1)=2). We want to count the wins.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let k = 1   # because we are going to count the wins from 1 upwards, but note T(0) is base.\n\n          Actually, we want to count the index k (the number of wins) and we know that the minimal players for k wins is T(k). We start with k=0 (wins=0) and then we can have at least 1 win (k=1) if n>=2.\n\n          We can iterate:\n\n            k = 0\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            while True:\n                if b > n:\n                    break\n                # then update: we have found that for k=1, T(1)=b is <=n, so we can have at least 1 win.\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then the answer is k-1? Because when we break, k is one more than the last valid index.\n\n          Actually, let's simulate for n=2:\n\n            Start: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n            Condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n            Then update: a=2, b=1+2=3, k=1.\n            Then condition: 3>2 -> break.\n            Then answer = k? But wait, we broke after updating to k=1 and then we break. But k=1 is the last valid index (because T(1)=2<=2, and then T(2)=3>2). So we should output k (which is 1) but note: in the loop we updated k to 1 and then broke.\n\n          However, in the loop, we update a and b and then k++. Then we check the condition for the next iteration. But the condition is on the updated b (which is T(k+1))? \n\n          Let me reframe: we are storing the next term in b, and then updating. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            k = 0\n            a, b = 1, 2   # T(0)=a, T(1)=b\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n            Then, k is the last index we updated to (which is the number of wins). But wait, after updating, we break when the next b (which is T(k+1)) is greater than n.\n\n          Actually, let me change the order:\n\n            We start with a=1 (T0), b=2 (T1). Then we check if b<=n: yes, then update a and b to T1 and T2, and k becomes 1. Then we check if T2<=n? Then update to T2 and T3, and k becomes 2.\n\n          Then at the end, k is the number of wins (because we started with k=0 and then we did k+=1 for each update). And the last update made T(k) the current b (which is T(k) = a+b_old, but wait, we update a and b at the same time). \n\n          Actually, the variable k counts the number of wins (the index). The last term we computed (b) is T(k) (because we update: a becomes the old b, and b becomes the old a+b). Then we break when the next term (which we didn't compute) would be too big.\n\n          But note: we break the loop when the next term (which we are about to compute in the next iteration) is too big. However, in the loop condition we check the current b (which is the next term from the previous update). \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n            k = 0\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                k += 1\n\n          For n=2:\n            Start: a=1, b=2 -> 2<=2 -> enter loop.\n            Then: a becomes 2, b becomes 3, k becomes 1.\n            Then check 3<=2? -> false, break.\n            Then output k=1 -> correct.\n\n          For n=3:\n            Start: a=1, b=2 -> 2<=3 -> enter loop.\n            Then: a=2, b=3, k=1 -> then check 3<=3 -> enter loop.\n            Then: a=3, b=5, k=2 -> check 5<=3 -> false, break. Output 2 -> correct.\n\n          For n=4:\n            Start: a=1, b=2 -> enter.\n            Then: a=2, b=3, k=1 -> 3<=4 -> enter.\n            Then: a=3, b=5, k=2 -> 5<=4 -> false, break. Output 2 -> correct.\n\n          For n=10:\n            Start: a=1, b=2 -> enter.\n            Then: a=2, b=3, k=1 -> 3<=10 -> enter.\n            Then: a=3, b=5, k=2 -> 5<=10 -> enter.\n            Then: a=5, b=8, k=3 -> 8<=10 -> enter.\n            Then: a=8, b=13, k=4 -> 13<=10 -> false, break. Output 4 -> correct.\n\n        However, note that k counts the number of wins (the index). But wait, the index k=0 was the starting state (0 wins) and then we updated to k=1 (1 win) and then k=2 (2 wins) etc.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is k (the final value of k) which is the maximum number of wins.\n\n        But note: the problem says that the winner plays k games, so we output k.\n\n        However, wait: the example n=2: output 1, which is k=1.\n\n        But what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        But note: n can be up to 10**18, and the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially (about 1.618^k). So k will be at most around 100 (because 1.618^100 is about 1e31, which is bigger than 1e18). So we can safely iterate until k.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the initial values a=1, b=2, and then we update until b>n.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          if n == 1:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              a, b = 1, 2\n              k = 0\n              while b <= n:\n                  a, b = b, a+b\n                  k += 1\n              print(k)\n\n        But wait, the above code for n=1: we have the problem says n>=2, but let's assume n>=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a, b = 1, 2\n          k = 0\n          while b <= n:\n              a, b = b, a+b\n              k += 1\n          print(k)\n\n        Let me test with n=2,3,4,10.\n\n        But wait: in the loop, we update a and b and then k++. The initial a=1, b=2 (which is T0 and T1). Then the condition is on T1 (b) to be <=n. Then we update to T1 and T2 (a becomes 2, b becomes 3) and k becomes 1.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note that the minimal players for k wins is T(k). Our sequence:\n\n          k=0: T0=1\n          k=1: T1=2\n          k=2: T2=3\n          k=3: T3=5\n          k=4: T4=8\n\n        And the condition is: we can have k wins if T(k) <= n.\n\n        Therefore, we are counting k (the index) and we break when T(k+1) > n? Actually, in the loop we are checking the current b (which is T(k) for the next k) and then updating to T(k+1) and k++. \n\n        But note: the condition is checked on the current b (which is the next term to be considered for the next k). \n\n        Actually, the condition is: while the next term (which is the minimal players for k wins, i.e., T(k)) is <= n, then we can have k wins and we update to the next term (T(k+1)) and increment k.\n\n        Then, when we break, k is the maximum number of wins (because we broke when the next term T(k) (which is the term we just updated to) is greater than n? Actually, no: \n\n          In the code:\n\n            We start with a=T0, b=T1 (which is for k=1) and then check if T1<=n. Then update to T1 and T2 (so now a=T1, b=T2) and k=1. Then check if T2<=n, then update to T2 and T3, and k=2.\n\n          So the condition is checked on the current b (which is the next term) and then we update and increment k.\n\n          Then, when we break, the last term we checked (the condition) was that the current b (which is T_{k}) is <= n, then we updated to T_{k+1} and incremented k to k+1, and then the condition fails (because T_{k+1}>n). \n\n          But wait, let's step through n=2 again:\n\n            Start: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n            Condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n            Then update: a=2, b=3, k=1.\n            Then condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n            Then output k=1.\n\n          But note: the condition was checked on the current b (which was 2) and then we updated and then checked 3. So the condition for k=1 (which is T1=2) was true, and then we updated to T2=3 and set k=1 (meaning we achieved 1 win). Then we break because T2=3>2.\n\n          Actually, the variable k is the number of wins we have just achieved (because we updated from T0 and T1 to T1 and T2, and then we set k=1). \n\n          But wait, the minimal players for 1 win is 2, and we have n=2. So we can have 1 win.\n\n          The minimal players for 2 wins is 3, and we have n=2, so we cannot have 2 wins.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\n          So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the sequence T(k) is defined for k=0,1,2,... and the minimal players for k wins is T(k). The condition in the loop is: we can have k wins if T(k) <= n? Actually, no: the condition is that the minimal players for k wins is T(k). But in the loop, we are actually checking the next term (which is T(k)) for the next k (the k we are about to update to). \n\n        Let me reindex:\n\n          Let F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, ...\n\n          We want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n          The loop:\n\n            a, b = F(0), F(1)\n            k = 0   (this k is the index we are going to update, but initially we have k=0, and we are going to check F(1) (which is for k=1))\n\n          Then the condition is: while F(1) <= n -> then we update to F(1) and F(2) and set k=1.\n\n          Then condition: while F(2) <= n -> then update to F(2) and F(3) and set k=2.\n\n          Then condition: while F(3) <= n -> then update to F(3) and F(4) and set k=3.\n\n          Then condition: while F(4) <= n -> then update to F(4) and F(5) and set k=4.\n\n          Then break and output k.\n\n          So the variable k is the maximum index for which F(k) <= n.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a, b = 1, 2\n          k = 0\n          while b <= n:\n              a, b = b, a+b\n              k += 1\n          print(k)\n\n        But wait: what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't need to handle n=1.\n\n        However, the problem says n>=2.\n\n        Let me run with n=2,3,4,10, and a very large n.\n\n        Example: n=1e18.\n\n        We can run the while loop until b>1e18. Since the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, the number of iterations is about log_phi(1e18) which is around 90, so it's efficient.\n\n        Let me test with n=1e18.\n\n        We can compute the maximum k such that F(k) <= 1e18.\n\n        But we don't need to know the exact value, just that the loop runs about 90 times.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the initial condition: k=0, a=1, b=2.\n\n        But what if n=1? (even though the problem says n>=2, but to be safe we can note that n>=2). \n\n        Since the problem states n>=2, we assume that.\n\n        Final code:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a, b = 1, 2\n          k = 0\n          while b <= n:\n              a, b = b, a+b\n              k += 1\n          print(k)\n\n        But wait, let me test with n=2: outputs 1 -> correct.\n        n=3: outputs 2 -> correct.\n        n=4: outputs 2 -> correct.\n        n=10: outputs 4 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: in the example n=10, the minimal players for 4 wins is 8, which is <=10, so we can have 4 wins. Then the next term is 13, which is >10, so we break and output 4.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as ['2','3','4','10'] and expected outputs are [1,2,2,4].\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        However, let me consider: is there a possibility that the minimal players for k wins is not",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to have a certain number of wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that two players can only compete if their previous game counts differ by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of wins (games) the winner can achieve under these constraints.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves generating a sequence where each term represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have `k` wins. This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with different initial values (1 and 2).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use an iterative approach to generate terms of this sequence until the term exceeds the given number of players `n`. The number of terms generated before exceeding `n` gives the maximum number of wins the winner can have.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently computes the result by leveraging the exponential growth of the sequence, requiring logarithmic time relative to `n`, which is optimal for large values of `n` (up to 10^18).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 0\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the first two terms of the sequence. The variable `k` is initialized to 0 to count the number of valid terms.\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the current term `b` is less than or equal to `n`. Inside the loop, `a` and `b` are updated to the next terms in the sequence (`b` becomes the new `a`, and `a + b` becomes the new `b`), and `k` is incremented.\n3. **Termination**: The loop exits when the next term would exceed `n`. The value of `k` at this point is the maximum number of wins the winner can achieve, as it corresponds to the last term in the sequence that is ≤ `n`.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the value of `k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the properties of the sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
