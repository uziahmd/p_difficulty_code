The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the chests and keys by their parity (even or odd).\n Condition: a chest with number a_i can be opened by a key b_j if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, i.e., one is even and the other is odd.\n\n Therefore, we can split:\n   Chests: \n        even_chests = count of a_i that are even\n        odd_chests = count of a_i that are odd\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = count of b_j that are even\n        odd_keys = count of b_j that are odd\n\n Now, note:\n   - An even chest requires an odd key to open.\n   - An odd chest requires an even key to open.\n\n So, the matching is bipartite: \n   - The even_chests must be matched with odd_keys.\n   - The odd_chests must be matched with even_keys.\n\n However, we cannot use a key more than once. Therefore, the maximum number of chests we can open is:\n\n   Let x = min(even_chests, odd_keys)   [even_chests can be opened by odd_keys, but limited by the smaller of the two]\n   Let y = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n Then the total chests opened would be x + y?\n\n But wait: what if there is a conflict? Actually, the two sets of requirements are independent.\n\n However, note: the same key cannot be used twice, and the same chest cannot be opened twice.\n\n Since the matching conditions are separate (even chests require odd keys, odd chests require even keys) and the keys are partitioned by parity, we can independently assign:\n\n   We have two independent bipartite graphs: \n      Graph1: even_chests (left) and odd_keys (right)\n      Graph2: odd_chests (left) and even_keys (right)\n\n And the maximum matching in each is limited by the minimum of the two counts (because every even_chest requires one odd_key and every odd_chest requires one even_key, and we can use each key at most once).\n\n Therefore, the answer is: \n        ans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd\n        even_chests = 3, odd_chests = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8->even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even\n        even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then: \n        x = min(3, 1) = 1\n        y = min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 1+2 = 3 -> which matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n\n   Then: \n        x = min(5,1)=1\n        y = min(0,0)=0\n        total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n   Then: \n        x = min(1,0)=0\n        y = min(0,4)=0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: let me consider an example that might break this.\n\n Example 4: \n   Suppose we have:\n        Chests: [1,2] -> odd_chest=1, even_chest=1\n        Keys: [1,2] -> odd_key=1, even_key=1\n\n   Then: \n        x = min(1,1)=1 (even_chest uses odd_key)\n        y = min(1,1)=1 (odd_chest uses even_key)\n\n   So total=2.\n\n   Now, check: \n        Chest1 (odd): needs even key -> key2 (even) -> opens.\n        Chest2 (even): needs odd key -> key1 (odd) -> opens.\n\n   That's correct.\n\n Example 5: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and the number of even and odd keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of even chests and odd keys (since each even chest requires an odd key).\n   - The minimum of odd chests and even keys (since each odd chest requires an even key).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd values in the list of keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible openings as the sum of the two minima derived from the counts.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each element in the chests and keys lists exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    ans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even-numbered. The remaining are considered odd-numbered.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by taking the sum of:\n   - The smaller value between the count of even chests and odd keys.\n   - The smaller value between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the sum of these two minima, representing the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal solution without any complex computations or additional data structures.",
