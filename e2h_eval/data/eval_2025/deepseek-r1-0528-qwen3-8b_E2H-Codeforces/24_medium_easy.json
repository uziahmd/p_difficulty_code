She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (with boundaries defined by the current minimum and maximum unclosed tab indices)\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that initially all tabs from 1 to n are open, and we want to leave only [l, r].\n\n The idea is to consider that we might need to close the tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have to close some tabs.\n\n We can break the problem into two parts: closing the left part and the right part.\n\n However, note that we start at 'pos'. We can choose to close from one side first or the other, but sometimes it might be more efficient to move the cursor to an endpoint.\n\n Operations:\n  - To close the left part (tabs [1, l-1]): we must have the cursor at least at l (because if the cursor is at i, we can close [a, i-1]; so to close up to l-1, we must have i >= l). Similarly, to close the right part (tabs [r+1, n]), we must have the cursor at most at r.\n\n But note: after closing some tabs, the boundaries a and b change.\n\n However, note the operations:\n\n  Operation 1: Move the cursor (each move takes 1 second) until we are at the desired position.\n\n  Operation 2: Close all tabs to the left (then the new a becomes the current cursor position? Actually, according to the problem: when we close the left, we close [a, i-1] (so the new minimum index a becomes i, and the maximum index b remains unchanged). Similarly, closing the right closes [i+1, b] and the new maximum index b becomes i.\n\n But note: the problem says that after closing, the tab indices are updated (so the cursor might be at a tab that is still present).\n\n However, we are allowed to move the cursor even after closing, and the boundaries update.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's define:\n   left_side = the part [1, l-1] (if any)\n   right_side = the part [r+1, n] (if any)\n\n We can consider two strategies:\n\n  Strategy 1: First close the left side, then the right side.\n      Step 1: Move the cursor from 'pos' to l (because we need to be at a tab >= l to close the left part [a, l-1] with the cursor at l or beyond). Then close the left part. Then move the cursor from l to r (to be able to close the right part, we need to be at a tab <= r). Then close the right part.\n\n      However, note: after closing the left part, the minimum index a becomes l. So we start at l, then we can move to r (which is in the range [l, n]) and then close the right part.\n\n      Steps for Strategy 1:\n        - Move from pos to l: |pos - l| seconds.\n        - Close left: 1 second.\n        - Then move from l to r: |l - r| seconds (but note: after closing the left, the available tabs are from l to n. We are at l, so we can move right to r).\n        - Close right: 1 second.\n\n        Total: |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1\n\n      But wait: is moving from l to r necessary? Actually, to close the right part, we must be at a tab <= r (so that we don't close too much). Since we are at l (and l<=r) we can also close the right part from l? However, the operation to close the right part at position i (which is l) will close the tabs from [l+1, b] (where b is the current maximum, which is n). But we want to leave [l, r]. So if l < r, then we cannot close the entire right part from l because we would close [l+1, n] which includes [l+1, r] (which we don't want to close). Therefore, we must first move to r (or at least to a position <= r) to avoid closing the segment [l, r]?\n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"close all the tabs to the right of the cursor\". So if we are at l and we close the right, we close [l+1, n] which is too much because we want to leave [l, r]. So we must not close the entire right part from l. We must only close the part [r+1, n]. \n\n      Alternatively, we can break the closing of the right part: we can close the right part only from r. So we must move to r first (if we haven't already) to close the right part without affecting the desired segment.\n\n      But note: we can also close the right part in multiple steps? Actually, the operation is defined as \"close all the tabs to the right\", so it's a one-shot operation that closes everything from the next tab to the current maximum. Therefore, to leave [l, r], we must have the cursor at r (or less) to use the right close operation without including [l, r]? Actually, no: we can close the right part from a position i (which is <= r) and it will close [i+1, b]. Then we must ensure that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1? No, because then we wouldn't cover the entire unwanted right part.\n\n      Let me clarify: \n        We want to leave [l, r]. The right part to close is [r+1, n]. \n\n        If we are at position i (which is <= r) and we close the right, we close [i+1, b]. We require that this operation does not close any tab in [l, r]. So we require that i+1 > r? Actually, no: we require that the set [i+1, b] is exactly [r+1, n] (or at least a superset of [r+1, n]). But note: we can only close from the current maximum b, which might be n (if we haven't closed any right part yet) or less.\n\n        However, we can also close the right part from a position i that is greater than r? But wait, we are only allowed to have the cursor at a tab that is still open. After closing the left part, the available tabs are [l, n]. So if we are at a position i (which must be in [l, n]) and we close the right, then we close [i+1, n]. To avoid closing any tab in [l, r] we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1. But if we are at i = r, then we close [r+1, n] (exactly the part we want to remove). \n\n        So actually, we can close the right part from r. Similarly, we can close the left part from l (which closes [a, l-1] and since a is the current minimum, initially a=1, but after closing the left part from l, the new a becomes l, but we are already at l and we don't need to move for the left part again).\n\n        Therefore, the steps for Strategy 1 (closing left first, then right) can be:\n\n          Option A: \n            - Move from pos to l (|pos-l| seconds)\n            - Close left (1 second): now the tabs are [l, n] and cursor is at l.\n            - Then, we need to close the right part. To do that, we must be at a position i such that i >= r+1? Actually, no: we can be at any position i (as long as i is in [l, n]) and then the operation \"close the right\" will close [i+1, n]. But we only want to close [r+1, n]. So we require that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1. But if we are at l (which is <= r) then i+1 <= r+1, so if l <= r, then i+1 <= r+1. However, if l == r, then i+1 = r+1, so we close [r+1, n] without affecting [l, r]. But wait, if we are at l (which is r) then we close [r+1, n] which is correct.\n\n          Actually, let's check: \n            We are at l (which is <= r). We close the right from l: \n                We close [l+1, n]. \n                We want to leave [l, r]. So we must not close [l+1, r] (because that is part of the desired segment). \n\n          This means we cannot close the right part from a position i < r (because then i+1 <= r, so we close [i+1, n] which includes [i+1, r] which we don't want). \n\n          Therefore, to close the right part safely (without closing any desired tab), we must be at a position i >= r+1? But wait, if we are at a position i >= r+1, then we are closing [i+1, n] which is [r+2, n] (if i=r+1) or even more. But we want to close [r+1, n]. \n\n          Actually, to close the entire [r+1, n], we must have i >= r+1? No: if we are at i = r, then we close [r+1, n] which is exactly the part we want. \n\n          Correction: \n            Operation: close the right from i closes [i+1, b]. We want to close [r+1, n]. So we require that i+1 <= r+1 and b>=n. But note: we haven't closed the right part yet, so b is still n. Then the condition is: we want [i+1, n] to be exactly [r+1, n] (or a superset? Actually, we don't mind if we close a little more, but we must not leave any tab outside [l, r]). \n\n          However, if we close [i+1, n] and i+1 <= r, then we close [i+1, r] (which is desired) and then [r+1, n] (which is unwanted). That is bad.\n\n          Therefore, to avoid closing the desired segment [l, r], we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1. But wait, that doesn't work because if i>=r+1, then we are closing [i+1, n] which is [r+2, n] (if i=r+1) or even more, and we still have [r+1] unclosed. \n\n          Actually, we want to close [r+1, n]. We can do that by being at r: then we close [r+1, n]. \n\n          Why did I think being at r was a problem? Because if we are at r, then we close [r+1, n] and leave [l, r]. That's perfect.\n\n          So the condition is: we must be at a position i such that i >= r (so that the next tab is at least r+1). But actually, if we are at i = r, then we close [r+1, n] (exactly). If we are at i = r-1, then we close [r, n] which is bad because we leave r open but then we also close the tab at r? No, wait: the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" from i = r-1 would close [r, n] (if the current maximum is n). Then we lose the tab at r, which is part of [l, r]. \n\n          Therefore, we must be at a position i such that i >= r+1? Actually, no: we must be at a position i such that i >= r+1 to avoid closing the desired segment? \n\n          Let me re-read the operation: \"close all the tabs to the right of the cursor\" meaning we close every tab with index greater than i. So if we are at i, we close all tabs j where j>i and j is unclosed.\n\n          We want to leave [l, r]. So we must not close any tab in [l, r]. Therefore, we must have i >= r+1? Then we don't close any tab from [l, r] because all tabs we close are from [i+1, n] and i>=r+1 implies i+1>=r+2, so [i+1, n] is a subset of [r+1, n] but actually we are skipping r+1? \n\n          Actually, if we are at i = r, then we close [r+1, n] (which is correct). If we are at i = r+1, then we close [r+2, n] (which leaves the tab at r+1 open, which is part of the unwanted right part). \n\n          So the correct condition is: we must be at a position i such that i >= r (so that we don't close any tab in [l, r])? Actually, no: if we are at i = r, then we close [r+1, n] (good). If we are at i = r+1, then we close [r+2, n] (leaving the tab at r+1 open, which is bad). \n\n          Therefore, we must be at a position i such that i >= r+1 is not required. Instead, we must be at a position i such that i >= r+1 is not necessary. We just need to be at a position i that is at least r (so that we don't close any desired tab). \n\n          But note: if we are at i = r, we close [r+1, n] (good). If we are at i = r-1, we close [r, n] (bad). \n\n          So the rule is: we must be at a position i such that i >= r (so that the set of tabs we close, [i+1, n], does not include any tab in [l, r]). \n\n          Therefore, to close the right part, we must be at a tab i with i >= r.\n\n          Similarly, to close the left part, we must be at a tab i with i <= l-1? Actually, no: the left close operation closes [a, i-1]. We want to close [1, l-1]. So we must have i-1 >= l-1, i.e., i>=l, but also we must not close any desired tab. The desired tabs are [l, r]. So we must not close any tab in [l, r]. The left close operation closes [a, i-1]. We require that i-1 < l (so that we don't close any desired tab). Therefore, we must be at i < l? \n\n          Actually, if we are at i = l, then we close [a, l-1] (which is [1, l-1] if a=1) and that is exactly the left part we want to close. \n\n          So the conditions:\n\n            For closing the left part: we must be at a position i such that i <= l (so that the operation [a, i-1] covers [1, l-1] without covering [l, r] because i-1 < l). \n\n          However, wait: the operation is defined as [a, i-1]. Initially, a=1. After closing the left part, the new a becomes i (the current cursor position). But note: we are allowed to close the left part only if we are at a position i and then the operation sets a to i (because we close [a, i-1] and then the remaining tabs are from i to b). \n\n          But the condition for the left close is that we must not close any desired tab. The desired tabs are [l, r]. The left close operation closes [a, i-1]. We want to close [1, l-1] and leave [l, r]. So we require that [a, i-1] is a subset of [1, l-1]. \n\n          Initially, a=1. So we require that i-1 <= l-1, i.e., i <= l. And also, we require that i is at least 1 (which it is). \n\n          However, after closing the left part, the a becomes i (the current cursor) and the desired segment [l, r] must be entirely contained in the remaining tabs. So we must have i <= l. \n\n          Therefore, to close the left part, we must be at a position i <= l. \n\n          Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a position i >= r.\n\n Now, how to combine?\n\n We have two independent operations (left and right) that require being at specific positions (<=l for left and >=r for right). We can do:\n\n   Option 1: Close left first, then right.\n\n        Steps:\n          - Move from pos to l (if we are going to close left, we must be at a position <= l, and the best is to go to l because then we can also use l for the next part if needed). But wait: to close the left part, we can be anywhere from 1 to l. However, if we are at l, then we can close the left part and then we are at l. Then we need to move to at least r (to close the right part). \n\n          But note: after closing the left part, the available tabs are [l, n] (if we closed the left part). Then we are at l (if we moved to l) and we need to move to r (if r>l). \n\n          Alternatively, we could close the left part from a position less than l? Maybe that would save time? \n\n          Example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n          Strategy 1 (as per example): \n            Move from 3 to 2 (1 second)\n            Close left (now tabs are [2,6]) (1 second)\n            Then move from 2 to 4 (2 seconds)\n            Close right (1 second)\n            Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n          But what if we close the left part from a different position?\n\n          Actually, we can close the left part from any position i <= l. But note: we start at pos. We can move to any i <= l (which is 2). The minimal moves to get to a position <= l is |pos - i|, and we want the smallest i (in terms of movement) that is <= l. The best is to go to l (because if we go to a position < l, we might have to come back, but actually we don't need to: we can just go to l). \n\n          Similarly for the right.\n\n   Option 2: Close right first, then left.\n\n        Steps:\n          - Move from pos to r (|pos - r| seconds)\n          - Close right (1 second) -> now the tabs are [1, r]\n          - Then move from r to l (if l < r, then |r-l| seconds)\n          - Close left (1 second)\n\n        Total: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1\n\n   Option 3: Maybe we can close both from the same side? Or use a combination that minimizes the total movement.\n\n   However, note: we can also consider that we might not need to move to the exact boundary if we can close one part without moving to the boundary? Actually, we must be at the boundary (or beyond) to close the entire segment.\n\n   But wait, the operation \"close the left\" from a position i (<=l) will close all the left part (from a to i-1) and then the new a becomes i. We want to close [1, l-1]. If we are at i < l, then we close [a, i-1] and then the new a is i. Then we still have the tabs from i to n. We then need to close the rest (if any) from i to l-1? Actually, no: because we want to leave [l, r]. So if we are at i (which is < l) and we close the left, we close [a, i-1] and then the remaining tabs are [i, n]. But we don't want to leave tabs from i to l-1 because they are outside [l, r] (they are < l). \n\n   Actually, the problem requires leaving exactly [l, r]. So we must close all tabs not in [l, r]. \n\n   Therefore, we must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. \n\n   So we cannot stop at i (if i < l) because then we haven't closed [i+1, l-1] (if i+1 <= l-1). \n\n   Therefore, to close the left part completely, we must be at i <= l, and then the operation will close [a, i-1] (which is [1, i-1]). But if i < l, then [1, i-1] is a subset of [1, l-1] and we leave [i, l-1] still open (which are unwanted). \n\n   Hence, we must close the left part from i=l. Similarly, we must close the right part from i=r.\n\n   Therefore, the only safe positions to close the left part are at l, and for the right part at r.\n\n   Then the two strategies become:\n\n     Strategy 1: \n        Step 1: Move from pos to l (|pos-l| seconds)\n        Step 2: Close left (1 second)\n        Step 3: Move from l to r (|l-r| seconds)\n        Step 4: Close right (1 second)\n\n        Total1 = |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1\n\n     Strategy 2:\n        Step 1: Move from pos to r (|pos-r| seconds)\n        Step 2: Close right (1 second)\n        Step 3: Move from r to l (|r-l| seconds)\n        Step 4: Close left (1 second)\n\n        Total2 = |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1\n\n   But note: |l-r| is the same as |r-l|, so we can write:\n\n        Total1 = |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n        Total2 = |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n   However, we can also consider doing one of the closures without the other? For example, if there is no left part (l==1) then we don't need to close the left part. Similarly, if there is no right part (r==n) then we don't need to close the right part.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider:\n\n     Case 1: l == 1 and r == n -> 0 seconds.\n\n     Case 2: Only left part (l == 1) but r != n -> we only need to close the right part.\n\n        Then we can simply do:\n          Step 1: Move from pos to r (|pos - r| seconds)\n          Step 2: Close right (1 second)\n\n        Total = |pos - r| + 1\n\n     Case 3: Only right part (r == n) but l != 1 -> we only need to close the left part.\n\n        Then we can simply do:\n          Step 1: Move from pos to l (|pos - l| seconds)\n          Step 2: Close left (1 second)\n\n        Total = |pos - l| + 1\n\n     Case 4: Both parts exist (l>1 and r<n) -> then we have two strategies.\n\n        We can choose the minimum between:\n\n            Option A: Close left first then right: |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1\n            Option B: Close right first then left: |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1\n\n        But note: there is another possibility: we can close both from the same side? Actually, no, because we have to be at l to close the left and at r to close the right, and these are two distinct positions (unless l==r). \n\n        However, what if we do:\n\n            Move from pos to min(l, r) and then ...? \n\n        Actually, we must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right. The minimal total movement is the minimum of the two strategies.\n\n        But note: we might not need to go all the way to both boundaries. \n\n        Another idea: we might close the left part from a position that is the closest to the original pos and <=l, but we saw that we must be exactly at l to close the entire left part. Similarly for the right.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n          if l == 1 and r == n: 0\n          elif l == 1: # only close right\n              answer = min(|pos - r| + 1, ...)  # but we don't have left, so only one operation?\n          elif r == n: # only close left\n              answer = min(|pos - l| + 1, ...)  # only one operation?\n          else:\n              answer = min( |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2, |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2 )\n\n        However, wait: in the case of only one operation, we don't necessarily have to move to the boundary and then close. But note: we must be at the boundary to perform the closure.\n\n        But there is an alternative: what if we are already at the boundary? \n\n        Example: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=5 -> 0 seconds.\n\n        Example: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=4 -> we only need to close the right part. But we are at 3, which is less than r=4. So we must move to 4? Then close the right.\n\n            Steps: move from 3 to 4 (1 second) then close the right (1 second) -> total 2.\n\n            But can we close the right part from 3? \n                Operation: close the right from 3: closes [4,5] (which is exactly the part we want to close). So yes.\n\n            However, wait: the condition for closing the right part is that we must be at a position i>=r? In this case r=4, so we must be at i>=4. We are at 3 (which is <4). Then the operation would close [4,5] (since the cursor is at 3, and the next tab is 4, and we close from 4 to the current maximum). But the condition for the operation is: close all tabs to the right, and the current maximum is 5 (if we haven't closed anything) or whatever is left. \n\n            However, the problem states: \"if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [i+1, b]\". \n\n            So if we are at 3, then we close [4,5] (which is correct). \n\n            Therefore, we don't necessarily have to be at r to close the right part. We must be at a position i such that i >= r is not required. We must be at a position i such that i < r? Actually, no: the operation doesn't require being at r, it requires being at a position that is <= r (so that we don't close any desired tab). \n\n            But note: the desired segment is [1,4] (l=1, r=4). We are at 3 (which is in [1,4]). Then closing the right part from 3 will close [4,5] (which is the unwanted part). \n\n            So the condition for closing the right part is: we must be at a position i <= r (so that we don't close any desired tab). \n\n            Similarly, for the left part: we must be at a position i >= l (so that we don't close any desired tab). \n\n            Correction:\n\n              Left close: We close [a, i-1]. We require that [a, i-1] is a subset of [1, l-1] and does not include any desired tab. The desired tabs start at l. So we require that i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l. But wait, if i is in [l, n], then i-1>=l-1, so we might close [l, i-1] (which is desired). \n\n            Actually, to avoid closing any desired tab, we must have i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l. \n\n            Similarly, for the right close: we close [i+1, b]. We require that [i+1, b] is a subset of [r+1, n] and does not include any desired tab (which are [l, r]). So we require that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1? \n\n            But wait: the example above (n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=4) shows that we can close the right part from 3 (which is <4) and that works. \n\n            Let me reexamine the right close operation: \n                The operation closes [i+1, b]. We want to leave [l, r] (which is [1,4]). We are at 3, then we close [4,5]. The desired segment [1,4] includes 4. But note: the operation does not close the current tab (we are at 3, and we close from 4). So 4 is included in the set we close? \n\n            Actually, the operation is defined as [i+1, b]. The tab at i is not closed. So we are at 3, and we close [4,5]. The desired tab 4 is closed? Then we leave [1,3] which is not [1,4]. \n\n            Wait, this is a contradiction. \n\n            Therefore, the example input: \"6 3 2 4\" leads to 5 seconds, but if we try to close the right part from 3 (in the example) we would close [4,?] and then we lose the tab 4 which is desired.\n\n            Correction: In the example, the desired segment is [2,4]. So if we are at 3 and close the right part, we close [4,6] (if n=6). Then we leave [1,3] (after closing left) and then [2,3] (after closing right)? \n\n            Actually, let me read the example input: \n                Input: \"6 3 2 4\"\n\n            Steps in example solution:\n                shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 -> now at 2 (from 3 to 2: 1 second)\n                close all the tabs to the left of it -> closes [1,1] (if initially a=1, then [1,1] is closed). Now the tabs are [2,6] (a=2, b=6). (1 second)\n                then shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3 -> from 2 to 3: 1 second (so far 3 seconds)\n                then to the tab 4 -> from 3 to 4: 1 second (total 4 seconds)\n                then close all the tabs to the right of it -> closes [5,6] (1 second) -> total 5.\n\n            But wait, the example solution does not close the right part from 3. It moves to 4 and then closes.\n\n            Why can't we close the right part from 3 in the example? Because the example has desired [2,4]. From 3, closing the right part would close [4,6]. But 4 is desired! So we cannot do that.\n\n            Therefore, we must not close the right part from a position i that is less than or equal to r (because then i+1 <= r, so we close [i+1, n] which includes [i+1, r] (desired)). \n\n            Similarly, for the left part: we must be at a position i that is greater than or equal to l (so that we don't close the desired segment). \n\n            Actually, the left close operation: \n                We are at i, we close [a, i-1]. We require that i-1 < l (so that we don't close the desired segment [l, r]). But wait, if i-1 < l, then i <= l. \n\n            And for the right close:\n                We are at i, we close [i+1, b]. We require that i+1 > r (so that we don't close the desired segment [l, r]). \n\n            But wait, in the example with n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=4: \n                We want to close the right part. We are at 3. We require i+1 > 4, i.e., i>=4. So we must be at 4 or more. \n\n            How did we close the right part in that example then? \n\n            We didn't. The example had no left part (l=1) and only the right part. The example solution I described earlier (for the example \"6 3 2 4\") does not apply.\n\n            Let me recast the example for n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=4:\n\n                We want to leave [1,4]. We must close [5] (the right part). \n\n                Steps:\n                  Option 1: Close the right part from a position i>=5? But we only have tabs 1..5. We are at 3. We cannot move to 5 without passing through 4? \n\n                Actually, the operation to close the right part requires being at a position i>=5? But there is no tab 5 if we haven't moved? \n\n                Alternatively, we can move to 5 (which is the last tab) and then close the right part. But wait, the operation \"close the right part\" from 5: [6,?] -> but there is no tab 6, so it does nothing? \n\n                The operation definition: \"close all the tabs to the right of the cursor\" meaning from i+1 to b. At i=5, b=5, so [6,5] is empty. \n\n                So we must be at a position i such that i < 5 (so that i+1<=5) and then close [i+1,5]. \n\n                But if we are at 4, then we close [5,5] (which is the part we want). \n\n                So the condition for the right part is: we must be at a position i such that i+1 <= b (which is always true) and the operation will close [i+1, b]. We want to close [r+1, n] (which is [5,5] in this case). So we require that i+1 <= 5 and i+1 >= 5 (so that we close exactly [5,5])? \n\n                Actually, we can close from any i such that i < 5. But we must close [5,5]. The operation from i=4: [5,5] -> good. From i=3: [4,5] -> closes 4 (desired) and 5 (undesired) -> bad. From i=2: [3,5] -> closes 3,4,5 -> bad. From i=1: [2,5] -> bad.\n\n                Therefore, to close the right part [r+1, n] (which is [5,5]), we must be at a position i such that i+1 = r+1 (i.e., i = r) OR we can be at any position i such that i+1 <= r+1 and i+1 >= r+1? \n\n                Actually, we want to close [r+1, n] and not close [l, r]. \n\n                The operation from i closes [i+1, b]. We require that [i+1, b] = [r+1, n] (or a superset? but we cannot leave any unwanted tab). \n\n                So we require that i+1 <= r+1 and b>=n (which it is). But also, we must not close any part of [l, r]. \n\n                The part [l, r] is [1,4]. We are closing [i+1, n]. We must not intersect [1,4]. \n\n                Therefore, we require that i+1 > 4, i.e., i>=5. But there is no tab 5 if we are in the middle? \n\n                Wait, no: the tabs are 1..5, and we haven't closed any left part, so the entire set is open. We are at 3. We want to close [5,5]. \n\n                The operation from i=4: [5,5] -> good. The operation from i=5: [] -> bad (doesn't close 5).",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves analyzing different scenarios based on the initial cursor position and the segment [l, r] that needs to be left open.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing tabs outside the segment [l, r] efficiently. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (each move takes 1 second) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (each closure takes 1 second). The challenge is to minimize the total time by strategically choosing the order of operations.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **No Action Needed**: If the entire range of tabs [1, n] is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - **Only Left Closure**: If there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1), Luba must move the cursor to l and then close the left tabs.\n   - **Only Right Closure**: If there are tabs to the right of r (i.e., r < n), Luba must move the cursor to r and then close the right tabs.\n   - **Both Sides Closure**: If both left and right closures are needed, Luba can either close left first then right or vice versa. The optimal choice depends on which path minimizes the total movement and closure operations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - For cases where only one side needs closure, the solution involves moving to the boundary (l or r) and performing the closure.\n   - For cases requiring both closures, compute the total time for both possible orders (left then right, or right then left) and choose the minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if l_val == 1:\n        moves_needed = abs(pos - r_val)\n        print(moves_needed + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if r_val == n:\n        moves_needed = abs(pos - l_val)\n        print(moves_needed + 1)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(r_val - l_val) + 2\n    answer = min(option1, option2)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), the answer is 0 because no tabs need closing.\n2. **Left Closure Only**: If there are tabs to the left of l (l > 1), Luba moves the cursor to l (time taken is the absolute difference between current position and l) and then closes the left tabs (additional 1 second).\n3. **Right Closure Only**: If there are tabs to the right of r (r < n), Luba moves the cursor to r (time taken is the absolute difference between current position and r) and then closes the right tabs (additional 1 second).\n4. **Both Sides Closure**: If both left and right closures are needed, compute the time for two strategies:\n   - **Left then Right**: Move to l, close left, move to r, close right.\n   - **Right then Left**: Move to r, close right, move to l, close left.\n   The minimum time between these two strategies is chosen as the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible scenarios by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
