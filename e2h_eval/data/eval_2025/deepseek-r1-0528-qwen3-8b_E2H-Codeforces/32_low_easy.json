Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to do the following:\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the list of n integers.\n 3. Sort the array.\n 4. The instability after removing an element is defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n Observation:\n  After removal, the new array's min and max can be one of two cases:\n    Case 1: The smallest element is removed -> then the new min is the second smallest (if exists) and the max remains the same.\n    Case 2: The largest element is removed -> then the new max is the second largest (if exists) and the min remains the same.\n    Case 3: Removing an element that is not the smallest or largest? Then the min and max remain the same as the original.\n\n However, note: if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest, the min and max do not change, so the instability is the same as the original.\n\n Therefore, we only need to consider removing one of the extreme elements (the smallest or the largest) because:\n   - Removing any other element doesn't change the min or max (so the instability remains the original max-min).\n\n But wait: what if there are duplicates?\n Example: [1, 3, 3, 7] \n   Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n   Removing the 7: then the array becomes [1,3,3] -> instability = 3-1 = 2.\n   Removing the 1: then the array becomes [3,3,7] -> instability = 7-3 = 4.\n   Removing a 3: then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability = 7-1 = 6.\n\n So indeed, the best is to remove an extreme. But note: sometimes removing the smallest might lead to a lower instability if the next smallest is closer to the original max? Actually, the idea is:\n\n Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1].\n\n Option 1: Remove the first element (min). Then the instability is b[n-1] - b[1].\n Option 2: Remove the last element (max). Then the instability is b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n And note: if we remove an element in the middle, the instability is the same as the original (b[n-1]-b[0]). But wait, what if we have duplicates at the ends?\n\n Actually, we must consider that if there are multiple same min or max, then removing one of them might leave another one. But note: the instability is defined by the entire array.\n\n However, the above two options are sufficient because:\n\n   - The minimum value in the remaining array is either b[0] (if we don't remove the first occurrence of min) or if we remove the first occurrence then it becomes b[1] (if there is at least two elements and the first element is the smallest).\n   - Similarly for the maximum.\n\n But note: we cannot assume that the array has distinct elements. However, we can consider:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (if there are multiple smallest, removing any one of them will result in the same new min? Actually, no: the new min is the next smallest distinct value, but if there are duplicates, then the next smallest might still be the same value (if we remove one duplicate, the next min is the same value). \n\n However, note: the array is sorted. Let's say we have [1,1,2,3,4]. \n   Removing the first 1: the array becomes [1,2,3,4] -> min=1, max=4 -> instability=3.\n   Removing the second 1: the array becomes [1,2,3,4] -> same.\n\n But wait, what if we have [1,2,2,3]? \n   Removing the first 1: [2,2,3] -> instability=3-2=1.\n   Removing the first 2: [1,2,3] -> instability=3-1=2.\n   Removing the last 2: [1,2,3] -> same as above.\n   Removing the 3: [1,2,2] -> instability=2-1=1.\n\n So actually, we should consider:\n\n   Option 1: Remove the smallest element (any occurrence) -> then the new min is the next smallest element (which is the second element in the sorted array, unless there are duplicates, but note: the sorted array has the same min repeated consecutively). So the instability becomes (max - the next smallest element). However, the next smallest element might be the same as the original min? Then we have to look until we find a bigger one.\n\n Actually, we can break the problem down:\n\n   Let the sorted array be `b`.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array affects the instability only if the removed element is either the current minimum or the current maximum. If we remove any other element, the minimum and maximum remain unchanged, hence the instability stays the same as the original array.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can easily identify the smallest and largest elements. The optimal solution involves either removing the smallest element (if present) or the largest element (if present), whichever results in a smaller instability.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - **Candidate Instabilities**: Calculate two candidate instabilities:\n     - Removing the smallest element: instability becomes `b[n-1] - b[1]`.\n     - Removing the largest element: instability becomes `b[n-2] - b[0]`.\n   - **Result Selection**: The answer is the minimum value between these two candidates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    arr.sort()\n    \n    candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    \n    print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to arrange elements in ascending order, which allows easy access to the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - `candidate1` represents the instability when the smallest element is removed (the new minimum is the second smallest element).\n   - `candidate2` represents the instability when the largest element is removed (the new maximum is the second largest element).\n4. **Result**: The minimum of these two candidates is printed, which gives the smallest possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to considering only two potential scenarios, leveraging sorting for simplicity and optimal performance. The solution handles edge cases such as duplicate elements seamlessly due to the nature of sorting and the way instability is recalculated after removal.",
