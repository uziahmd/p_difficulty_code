Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (with 3<=n<=10^5, 1<=a<=180)\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Important: The angle in the polygon is formed by two edges from v2. In a regular convex polygon, the interior angles are fixed, but note that the problem allows forming an angle by taking any two edges from the polygon (but the polygon is convex so the angle must be less than 180). However, note that the angle we form might not necessarily be the interior angle of the polygon. It can be any angle that has its vertex at one of the polygon's vertices and whose sides pass through two other vertices (which are adjacent in the polygon? Actually, no: the problem says \"three distinct vertices\" and the sides of the angle lie along the lines connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n But note: the polygon is regular and convex. So the entire figure is symmetric.\n\n How do we compute the angle?\n\n Consider: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n Now, if we consider an angle at vertex v2, we can think of it as being formed by two chords from v2 to two other vertices. However, note that the problem does not require the angle to be the interior angle of the polygon, but just any angle at v2 with two sides going through two other vertices.\n\n Actually, note: the problem says \"the angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\". This means that the two sides of the angle are the rays from v2 through v1 and from v2 through v3. Since the polygon is convex, we can assume that the angle we form is the one that is inside the polygon? Or outside? \n\n But note: the example: \n   Input: \"3 15\" -> Output: \"1 2 3\"\n   Here, the triangle (n=3) has only one interior angle per vertex (which is 60). However, if we take vertex 2, then we can form an angle by choosing two sides: one side from 2 to 1 and the other from 2 to 3. That gives the interior angle 60.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"if there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any\". And the sample input \"4 67\" leads to 45 being chosen (because |45-67| < |90-67|). Similarly, \"4 68\" leads to 90.\n\n However, note: in a square (n=4), what angles can we form?\n   Consider vertex 2 (or any vertex). The two adjacent vertices are 1 and 3. Then the angle at vertex 2 for the two adjacent sides is 90 degrees (interior angle). But also, we can choose non-adjacent vertices? For example, from vertex 2, we can go to vertex 1 and vertex 4 (which is adjacent in the other direction). However, the problem states the polygon is convex and the vertices are numbered in clockwise order.\n\n Let's label the square: \n   1 -- 2\n   |   |\n   4 -- 3\n\n Actually, the problem says the vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. So for a square, let's say:\n   vertex1, vertex2, vertex3, vertex4, with edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1.\n\n Then from vertex2 (which is the top-left in a typical square drawn with 1 at bottom-left? Actually, clockwise: so if we start at 1, then next is 2, then 3, then 4, then back to 1. So the square:\n\n   1--2\n   |  |\n   4--3\n\n But wait: clockwise: 1->2->3->4->1. Then from 1 to 2 is right, 2 to 3 is down, 3 to 4 is left, 4 to 1 is up. So the square:\n\n   1: (0,0), 2: (1,0), 3: (1,1), 4: (0,1)\n\n Then from vertex2 (at (1,0)): \n   Adjacent: 1 (left) and 3 (up). The interior angle is 90 degrees.\n\n But can we form other angles? For example, from vertex2, we can take the ray to vertex1 and the ray to vertex4. Then the angle between these two rays would be 45 degrees (because the square's diagonal). However, note that the problem says the sides of the angle must lie on the sides of the polygon? Actually, no. The problem says: \"v1 and v3 lie on its sides\". This means that the sides of the angle are the lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But note: the polygon is convex and the vertices are distinct. The angle we form is the one at v2 between points v1 and v3.\n\n However, the key is: the angle is determined by the two vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n But note: the problem does not restrict that the two sides must be edges of the polygon. They can be any two chords from v2 to two other vertices. However, in a convex polygon, the angle at v2 for two vertices can be calculated using the central angles.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two vertices i and j is (number_of_edges_between * (360/n)) but actually the central angle between two vertices separated by k steps is k*(360/n).\n\n But note: the angle at the vertex (on the circumference) between two chords from that vertex to two other vertices can be related to the central angles.\n\n However, there is a known fact: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. But note: our angle is at the vertex (which is on the circle) and we are looking at the arc between v1 and v3.\n\n Actually, we can use the following:\n\n Let the center of the polygon be O. Then the angle at v2 between v1 and v3 is half the difference of the two arcs? Or is it the inscribed angle?\n\n But wait: the inscribed angle theorem: the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle at the center. However, note that our angle at v2 is formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The arc that is opposite to the angle is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n However, note: the polygon is convex and we are allowed to pick any two distinct vertices. The angle at v2 can be either the minor arc or the major arc? Actually, since the polygon is convex and we are taking two distinct vertices, we have two possibilities. But the problem states that the angle is measured as the smaller one? Or the one that lies in the polygon? Actually, the problem says the polygon is convex, so the angle we form must be less than 180.\n\n How to compute the angle?\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n The entire circle is 360. The n-gon divides the circle into n equal arcs of 360/n.\n\n Consider two vertices v1 and v3 from the perspective of v2. Let d1 = the number of edges from v2 to v1 (in one direction) and d2 = the number of edges from v2 to v3 (in the other direction). But note: the two directions: we can go clockwise and counterclockwise.\n\n Actually, the two rays from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 will divide the circle into two arcs. The angle at v2 is the one corresponding to the smaller arc? Or the one that is inside the polygon? \n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which side of the angle. But in a convex polygon, the angle we are considering is the one that lies entirely within the polygon? Actually, no: the angle could be the exterior one too, but note the condition: the polygon is convex and the vertices are distinct. The angle we form must be the one that is the smaller one (since the polygon is convex, the interior angle is <= 180, and the exterior angle is >= 180, but we are only concerned with the one that is less than 180?).\n\n But the problem says: the angle is defined by the two sides. In the context of the polygon, the two sides are the two rays that go from v2 through v1 and through v3. The angle we get is the one that is the intersection of the two half-planes that start at v2 and go through v1 and v3. In a convex polygon, the angle we are measuring must be the one that is facing the interior of the polygon? Or can we also consider the reflex angle (which is >180)? \n\n The problem says: the polygon is convex and the vertices are distinct. The angle must be the one that is less than 180 because otherwise (if we take the reflex angle) it would be the exterior angle and that is not considered? Actually, the problem does not specify, but note the examples:\n\n Example: square (n=4) and a=67. The two candidate angles are 45 and 90. The absolute differences are |45-67|=22 and |90-67|=23. So 45 is chosen.\n\n So we are considering both acute and obtuse angles? But note: in a square, the interior angle is 90. Also, from a vertex we can form an angle of 45 by taking two vertices that are two steps away (like from vertex2: take v1 (vertex1) and v3 (vertex4) then the angle is 45). But wait, in the square, the two vertices that are two steps away are actually the opposite ones? \n\n Let me draw the square again:\n\n   1--2\n   |  |\n   4--3\n\n From vertex2 (which is at (1,0)):\n   Adjacent: 1 (at (0,0)) and 3 (at (1,1)).\n   Then, if we take v1 = 1 and v3 = 4, then the angle at vertex2 between (1 and 4) is the angle between the vector from 2 to 1 (which is (-1,0)) and the vector from 2 to 4 (which is (-1,1)). The angle between these two vectors:\n\n        cos(theta) = ( (-1,0) dot (-1,1) ) / (1 * sqrt(2)) \n                   = (1 + 0) / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2) -> theta = 45 degrees.\n\n So yes, we can form 45 degrees.\n\n Therefore, the angle we form is the one that is the smaller angle between the two rays (so between 0 and 180). \n\n How to compute the angle given two points from v2?\n\n We can use the formula for the angle between two vectors. But note: the entire polygon is cyclic, so we can use the central angles.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Let the two points (v1 and v3) be separated from v2 by k and l steps (in the two directions). Then the central angles corresponding to the arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 are (k * (360/n)) and (l * (360/n)), but wait: the angle at v2 is not simply the central angle.\n\n However, there is a geometric relation: the angle at the circumference (vertex) is half the central angle of the opposite arc.\n\n But note: the angle we are measuring is the one that subtends the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2? Actually, the inscribed angle theorem applies when the angle is formed by two chords from a point on the circumference. The angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it.\n\n Specifically, if we consider the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2, then the angle at v2 is half that arc. But note: the entire circle is 360, and the arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 and the arc that does not contain v2 add up to 360. Which one do we use? The inscribed angle is always the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc? \n\n Actually, the standard inscribed angle theorem: the angle at the circumference is half the central angle of the arc that is subtended by the same endpoints. But note: the angle we are forming at v2 is the one that looks at the arc between v1 and v3 that is opposite to v2. However, in our case, we have two possibilities: we can take the minor arc or the major arc? But the angle we form is always the one that is less than or equal to 180, so we take the minor arc.\n\n However, note: the angle we form is the one that is the smaller one. So we can compute the two arcs between v1 and v3: one passing through v2 and one not. Then the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that does not pass through v2.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are at vertex v2. We can consider two directions: clockwise and counterclockwise.\n\n 2. Let the two vertices be at distances d1 and d2 (in terms of steps along the polygon) from v2 (without passing the opposite side). Actually, the total steps around the circle is n. The two arcs between v1 and v3 (from the perspective of v2) are:\n\n      arc1 = min(|i - j|, n - |i - j|)   [this gives the minor arc between v1 and v3]\n\n    But wait, that is the chordal distance. However, the angle at v2 is determined by the central angle of the opposite arc. Actually, the opposite arc (the one not containing v2) is the one that is the longer way? \n\n    Actually, let me reframe: the entire circle is 360. The arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2 is (say) A, and the other arc is B. Then A+B=360. The angle at v2 is half of the arc that does not contain v2? \n\n    According to the inscribed angle theorem: the angle at v2 is half the central angle of the arc that is opposite to it (the one that doesn't have the vertex). So if the arc opposite to v2 (between v1 and v3) is X, then the angle is X/2.\n\n    How to compute X?\n\n    The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the one that is the complement of the arc that goes from v1 to v3 via v2. The arc via v2 is (d1 + d2) * (360/n). But wait, let me define:\n\n        Let d1 = the number of edges from v2 to v1 in the clockwise direction (without crossing the opposite side). Similarly, d2 = the number of edges from v2 to v3 in the clockwise direction.\n\n        Then the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2 (clockwise) is (d1 + d2) * (360/n). Then the other arc (the one that does not go through v2) is 360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n).\n\n        Then the angle at v2 is half of that: (360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n)) / 2.\n\n    But wait, that doesn't sound right because the inscribed angle theorem uses the central angle of the opposite arc. And the opposite arc is the one that is the entire circle minus the arc that goes through the vertex. So:\n\n        central_angle_opposite = 360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n)   [if we are going from v1 to v3 via the long way?] \n\n    Actually, the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the entire circle minus the arc from v1 to v3 that does contain v2. And the arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 is the sum of the clockwise steps from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3? Not exactly: if we go from v1 to v2 to v3, then the arc length is (d1 + d2) * (360/n). But note: the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2 is the one that starts at v1, goes clockwise to v2, then to v3. So that arc is (d1 + d2) * (360/n). Then the opposite arc is 360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n).\n\n    Then the angle at v2 is (opposite_arc)/2 = [360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n)] / 2 = 180 * [1 - (d1+d2)/(n)].\n\n    But wait, let's test with the square (n=4) and the angle of 45 degrees.\n\n    In the square, from vertex2, we took v1=1 and v3=4.\n\n    How many steps from 2 to 1 clockwise? In the square, from 2 to 1: we can go directly (one step counterclockwise) but we are measuring clockwise? Actually, we have two directions.\n\n    Let me define: the clockwise distance from a vertex to another is the minimum steps in the clockwise direction? Actually, the polygon is cyclic. We can define:\n\n        Let the vertices be labeled 0 to n-1 (for simplicity, then convert to 1-indexed). Then the clockwise distance from i to j is (j - i) mod n, but then we want the smallest positive representation.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider the two arcs: the clockwise arc from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But note: the two arcs we are considering (from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3) are in opposite directions? Actually, no: the two rays from v2 can go in any two directions. But the entire circle is 360, and the two arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 (the two parts) must add up to 360.\n\n    However, the angle we form is the one that is the smaller one. So we have two possibilities: the angle can be either the one we calculated above (using the opposite arc) or the other possibility (if we take the other side, which would be the interior angle of the polygon). Actually, wait: the interior angle of the polygon is the one that uses the two adjacent edges. For a square, that is 90. The other possibility is the one we just calculated (45). \n\n    How do we relate this to the formula? \n\n    Actually, the inscribed angle theorem applies when the angle is formed by two chords from a point on the circle. The angle is half the central angle of the arc that is intercepted (the one that is opposite). But note: the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain the vertex. \n\n    So in the square example: \n        v2=2 (we'll use 0-indexed: so vertices 0,1,2,3 for a square? Let me set: \n            vertex0: 1, vertex1: 2, vertex2: 3, vertex3: 4? Actually, let me use 0-indexed for calculation and then map to 1-indexed.\n\n        Let the square: \n            Vertex0 (1) -> (0,0)\n            Vertex1 (2) -> (1,0)\n            Vertex2 (3) -> (1,1)\n            Vertex3 (4) -> (0,1)\n\n        Then from vertex1 (which is 2): \n            v1 = 0 (vertex1) and v3 = 3 (vertex4).\n\n        The central angle for the arc from 0 to 3 that does not contain 1: \n            The arc from 0 to 3: \n                Clockwise: 0->1->2->3: 3 steps -> 3*(360/4)=270 degrees.\n                Counterclockwise: 0->3: 1 step -> 90 degrees.\n\n            The opposite arc (the one not containing the vertex1) is the one that is 270 degrees? Actually, the arc from 0 to 3 that does not contain 1 is the 270-degree arc? But wait, the vertex1 is at 0, so the arc from 0 to 3 that goes clockwise passes through 1 and 2, so that is the 270-degree arc. The arc that does not contain 1 is the 90-degree arc (from 0 to 3 going counterclockwise). \n\n        Then the angle at vertex1 (2) is half of 90 = 45 degrees.\n\n        So the formula: \n            Let d = the number of edges in the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 (in the clockwise direction, we can define the arc as the minimal one? Actually, we take the arc that does not contain v2, which might be the larger one or the smaller one? \n\n        Actually, the inscribed angle theorem uses the minor arc? No, it uses the arc that is intercepted by the two chords. The intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. In the example, the intercepted arc is the 90-degree arc (the one that goes from 0 to 3 without passing through 1). \n\n        How to compute the intercepted arc? \n\n        The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not include v2. The length of that arc is the central angle: (min_steps) * (360/n) ? \n\n        Actually, we can compute the two arcs between v1 and v3: \n            Let d1 = the clockwise steps from v2 to v1 (without crossing the opposite side) and d2 = the clockwise steps from v2 to v3 (without crossing the opposite side). Then the two arcs between v1 and v3 are:\n                arc1 = d1 + d2   [the arc that goes from v1 to v3 passing through v2] \n                arc2 = n - (d1+d2) [the other arc]\n\n        Then the intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) is arc2, unless arc2 is greater than 180? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc? \n\n        But wait: the theorem says the angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. And the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. In a circle, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc. However, note that the angle at the circumference is always the minor arc? Actually, no: if the arc is greater than 180, then the inscribed angle is still half the arc, but then the angle would be more than 90. However, we are only considering angles <=180.\n\n        Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (arc < 180) and if the arc is greater than 180, we use the reflex angle? But note: our angle is defined as the smaller one (so <=180). So we take the intercepted arc as the one that is less than or equal to 180.\n\n        However, note: the two arcs between v1 and v3: one is d1+d2, the other is n-(d1+d2). The intercepted arc (the one opposite to v2) is the one that does not contain v2, which is the one that is the entire circle minus the arc that goes from v1 to v3 through v2. But wait, the arc that goes from v1 to v3 through v2 is d1+d2, so the other arc is n - (d1+d2). \n\n        Then the angle is (n - (d1+d2)) * (360/(2*n))? \n\n        Wait, no: the central angle for the intercepted arc is (n - (d1+d2)) * (360/n). Then the inscribed angle is half of that: (n - (d1+d2)) * (360/(2*n)) = (n - (d1+d2)) * (180/n).\n\n        Now, in the square example: n=4, d1=1 (from vertex1 to vertex0: from 1 to 0, clockwise: 1 step? Actually, from vertex1 (index1) to vertex0 (index0): in clockwise direction, we go from 1->2->3->0? That would be 3 steps. Alternatively, we can define the clockwise distance from a vertex to another as the minimum of the two ways.\n\n        But wait, the formula above uses the entire circle. Actually, we must consider the entire circle. The two arcs between v1 and v3 are the two parts: one part is the direct arc (without going through v2) and the other is the one that goes through v2.\n\n        However, we defined d1 and d2 as the clockwise steps from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. Then the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2 is the sum of the clockwise steps from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3. But note: from v2 to v1, we can also go counterclockwise. Actually, we should consider the two directions separately.\n\n        Let me redefine: \n\n        Let the polygon be represented as a circle with n points. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n.\n\n        The angle at vertex v2 (which is a point on the circle) between two points v1 and v3 is:\n\n            angle = (central_angle_opposite) / 2\n\n        where central_angle_opposite is the central angle of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n        How to compute central_angle_opposite?\n\n        The central angle between two vertices i and j is: min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|) * (360/n)   [this is the minor arc].\n\n        But wait, that is the minor arc. The intercepted arc (the opposite one) is the major arc if the minor arc is the one that contains v2? \n\n        Actually, the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is:\n\n            Let d = the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 (without passing v2) -> but we don't know which direction.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            Let the positions of v1, v2, v3 on the circle (as indices) be i, j, k (0-indexed). Then the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is:\n\n                arc_length = (n - |i-k|) * (360/n)   ??? Not exactly.\n\n        There is a better way: \n\n        The angle at the circumference is half the central angle of the opposite arc. The opposite arc is the one that is the entire circle without the arc from v1 to v3 that passes through v2. But note: the arc from v1 to v3 that passes through v2 is the one that goes from v1 to v2 to v3. The central angle for that arc is (the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 passing through v2) * (360/n). Then the opposite arc is 360 minus that.\n\n        But how to compute the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 passing through v2? \n\n        We can fix v2 at position 0 (by rotation). Then the positions of v1 and v3 are two numbers in [0, n-1]. Then the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 (without passing through v2) is the smallest arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain 0. But wait, we are fixing v2 at 0, and the two points v1 and v3 are arbitrary.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let d1 = the clockwise distance from v2 to v1 (without crossing the opposite side) -> but we don't know which direction is shorter.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider all pairs (v1, v3) for a fixed v2 and compute the angle. But n is up to 10^5, so we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n        Therefore, we need to find the angle that is closest to a without iterating over all pairs.\n\n        Insight:\n\n        The angle at v2 is determined by the two steps d1 and d2 (the clockwise and counterclockwise steps). Actually, the two arcs (clockwise and counterclockwise) from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 are independent. But note: the angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, and the angle is half the central angle of the opposite arc, which is:\n\n            angle = (180/n) * (n - (d1+d2))\n\n        But wait, in the square example: \n            n=4, and for v1=0 and v3=3 (from v2=1): \n            d1 = clockwise steps from 1 to 0: in a square, from 1 to 0: clockwise: 0->1->2->3->0 -> that's 3 steps? \n            d2 = clockwise steps from 1 to 3: 1->2->3 -> 2 steps.\n\n            Then d1+d2 = 5, then angle = (180/4)*(4-5) = 45 * (-1) -> negative? \n\n        That doesn't work.\n\n        Let me recast: \n\n        We can consider the entire circle. The central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2 (clockwise) is (steps_clockwise_from_v1_to_v3_through_v2) * (360/n). But note: the steps_clockwise_from_v1_to_v3_through_v2 is the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 plus the clockwise distance from v2 to v3.\n\n        However, we can also consider the entire circle: the two arcs from v1 to v3 are (clockwise) and (counterclockwise). The one that does not contain v2 is the one that is the entire circle minus the one that does contain v2.\n\n        So:\n\n            arc_that_contains_v2 = (clockwise_distance_from_v1_to_v3_through_v2) * (360/n)\n            arc_that_does_not_contain_v2 = 360 - arc_that_contains_v2\n\n        Then the angle at v2 is (arc_that_does_not_contain_v2)/2.\n\n        But how to compute arc_that_contains_v2? \n\n        Let the positions of v1, v2, v3 be i, j, k (0-indexed). Then the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 is (j - i) mod n, but then from v2 to v3 is (k - j) mod n. Then the total clockwise distance from v1 to v3 through v2 is (k - i) mod n, but note: that might not be the same as (j-i)+(k-j) because of modulo.\n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 is (j - i) mod n, but if j < i then (j-i) mod n = j-i+n. Similarly, from v2 to v3: (k - j) mod n. Then the entire clockwise distance from v1 to v3 through v2 is (j-i+n) + (k-j+n) if necessary? \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the clockwise distance from a to b as (b - a) % n, but then if negative, add n.\n\n        But note: we are only interested in the central angle, which is proportional to the number of edges.\n\n        Actually, the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 is the central angle for the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through v2. The number of edges in that arc is the number of steps from v1 to v2 and then to v3. The total number of edges is (the clockwise steps from v1 to v2) + (the clockwise steps from v2 to v3). But the clockwise steps from v1 to v2 is (j-i) if j>=i, else (j-i+n). Similarly for v2 to v3.\n\n        Then the central angle for the arc containing v2 is ((j-i+n) + (k-j+n)) * (360/n) ? \n\n        Actually, no: the central angle is the number of edges times (360/n). The entire arc from v1 to v3 containing v2 has (j-i+n) + (k-j+n) edges? But wait, the edge count from v1 to v2 is (j-i+n) and from v2 to v3 is (k-j+n). Then the total edges is (j-i+n) + (k-j+n) = k-i+2*n. But then we are counting the entire circle twice? \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 through v2 as (k - i) mod n, but that is the direct clockwise distance without going through v2? \n\n        I think we need to separate the two parts: \n\n        The arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 is the one that goes from v1 to v2 to v3. The length of that arc is the number of edges from v1 to v2 (which is (j-i) mod n) plus the number of edges from v2 to v3 (which is (k-j) mod n). But note: the entire circle has n edges, and the direct arc from v1 to v3 (without v2) is (k-i) mod n, which is the minimum between (k-i) and n-(k-i). \n\n        However, the arc that contains v2 might be the longer one. \n\n        Actually, the arc that contains v2 is not necessarily the longer one. It is the one that goes from v1 to v2 to v3. The length of that arc is the number of edges from v1 to v2 (in the clockwise direction) plus the number of edges from v2 to v3 (in the clockwise direction). This can be computed as:\n\n            d1 = (j - i) % n   [but if negative, adjust] -> but we want the clockwise distance, so if j>=i, then j-i, else j-i+n.\n\n            d2 = (k - j) % n   -> similarly, if k>=j, then k-j, else k-j+n.\n\n            Then the central angle for the arc containing v2 is (d1+d2) * (360/n).\n\n        Then the central angle for the arc not containing v2 is 360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n).\n\n        Then the angle at v2 is (360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n))/2 = 180 * (1 - (d1+d2)/n) degrees.\n\n        Now, in the square example: \n            n=4, i=0 (v1=1), j=1 (v2=2), k=3 (v3=4).\n            d1 = (1-0) %4 = 1, d2 = (3-1)%4 = 2.\n            Then angle = 180 * (1 - (1+2)/4) = 180 * (1-3/4) = 180 * (1/4) = 45. Correct.\n\n        Now, the interior angle of the square (adjacent vertices): \n            v1=0, v2=1, v3=2.\n            d1 = (1-0)%4=1, d2=(2-1)%4=1.\n            angle = 180*(1- (1+1)/4) = 180*(1-0.5)=90. Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we take v1=0 and v3=2? \n            d1 = (1-0)=1, d2=(2-1)=1 -> 90.\n\n        What if we take v1=0 and v3=1? \n            d1=(1-0)=1, d2=(1-1)=0 -> angle=180*(1- (1+0)/4)=180*(3/4)=135.\n\n        Is 135 a valid angle? In a square, from vertex2 (v2=1) to v1=0 and v3=1 (wait, v3=1 is the same as v2? no, distinct vertices. So v3 cannot be v2.\n\n        Actually, we must have distinct vertices.\n\n        Another example: n=3 (triangle), interior angle is 60. \n            Let v1=0, v2=1, v3=2.\n            d1 =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating potential angles without exhaustive checks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the angle formed at any vertex `v2` by two other vertices `v1` and `v3` can be derived using the central angles of the arcs between these vertices. The angle at `v2` is half the measure of the arc opposite to it (the arc not containing `v2`). \n\n2. **Geometric Insight**: For a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle at vertex `v2` between vertices `v1` and `v3` is calculated as `180 * (1 - (d1 + d2)/n)`, where `d1` and `d2` are the number of edges from `v2` to `v1` and `v2` to `v3` in the clockwise direction, respectively.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints (n up to 10^5), we cannot check all possible triplets. Instead, we recognize that the closest angle will either be the interior angle of the polygon or an angle formed by vertices separated by specific steps. We compute candidate angles around the given angle `a` and select the closest one.\n\n4. **Candidate Selection**: We consider angles formed by vertices separated by 1, 2, ..., up to floor((n-1)/2) steps. For each step count, we calculate the corresponding angle and check its proximity to `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == 0:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    base_angle = 180 * (1 - 2 / n)\n    if abs(base_angle - a) < 1e-7:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n\n    for k in range(1, (n-1)//2 + 1):\n        angle_val = 180 * (1 - (k + k) / n)\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = (1, 1+k+1, 1+k*2+1)\n            \n    for k in range(1, (n-1)//2 + 1):\n        angle_val = 180 * (1 - (k + (k+1)) / n)\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = (1, 1+k+1, 1+k*2+2)\n\n    if best_vertices is None:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired angle `a` is zero (though constraints ensure `a` is at least 1), it defaults to printing the first three vertices.\n2. **Base Angle Calculation**: Computes the interior angle of the polygon (when vertices are adjacent). If this matches `a`, it prints the first three vertices immediately.\n3. **Iterative Angle Check**: For each possible step count `k`, it calculates the angle formed by vertices separated by `k` and `k` steps (symmetrical case) and then by `k` and `k+1` steps (asymmetrical case). The closest angle to `a` is tracked throughout these iterations.\n4. **Output**: After evaluating all possible candidates, the vertices forming the closest angle are printed. If no better angle is found (unlikely due to symmetry), it defaults to the first three vertices.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential candidates by leveraging the polygon's symmetry and mathematical properties, ensuring optimal performance even for large `n`.",
