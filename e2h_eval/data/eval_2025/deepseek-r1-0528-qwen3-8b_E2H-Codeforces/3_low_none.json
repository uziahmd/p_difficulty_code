Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers for the lantern positions.\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The street must be from 0 to l.\n 3. We need to cover the entire street [0, l] with intervals centered at each lantern (each lantern covers [a_i - d, a_i + d]).\n 4. The idea is to find the minimum d such that there are no gaps.\n\n How?\n  - The first gap might be between 0 and the first lantern.\n    The first lantern must extend at least from 0 to its position. So the leftmost coverage needed from the first lantern is from 0 to a0 + d.\n    To cover from 0, we require d >= a0/2? Actually, we must have d >= (a0 - 0) because the lantern at a0 must cover 0: so d >= a0.\n\n  - Then, between two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}: the gap in coverage would be from (a_i + d) to (a_{i+1} - d). \n    To avoid gaps, we require that the next lantern's coverage starts before or at the current lantern's coverage ends. \n    Specifically, the requirement is: d must be at least half the gap between consecutive lanterns? Actually, the gap between two lanterns is (a_{i+1} - a_i). \n    The coverage from the left lantern must extend to at least the midpoint? Not exactly: the condition is that the right lantern must cover from the left one's coverage. \n    The condition is: the distance between the two lanterns is (a_{i+1} - a_i). The two lanterns together must cover the entire segment. \n    The left lantern covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d. We require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, which simplifies to d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n  - Similarly, the last gap is from the last lantern to l. The last lantern must cover up to l, so d >= l - a_last.\n\n However, note: we want the minimum d that satisfies all conditions.\n\n Conditions:\n   Condition 1: d >= a0   (to cover from 0 to a0)\n   Condition 2: for each i from 0 to n-2: d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2\n   Condition 3: d >= l - a_last   (to cover from a_last to l)\n\n But note: the first condition can be thought as: the leftmost point 0 must be covered by the first lantern: so we need a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0.\n   Actually, wait: the lantern at a0 covers from a0-d to a0+d. For 0 to be covered, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. But note that if the first lantern is at 0, then d>=0 is enough, but if it's not, then d must be at least a0.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire street being covered if the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] for all i covers [0, l].\n\n Another approach:\n   Let the leftmost edge of the street be 0. The first lantern must cover 0: so the leftmost point of the first lantern's coverage is a0 - d, and we require a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0.\n   Similarly, the rightmost edge is l. The last lantern must cover l: so the rightmost point of the last lantern's coverage is a_last + d, and we require a_last + d >= l -> d >= l - a_last.\n\n   For the gaps between two lanterns: consider two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (x < y). The coverage from the left lantern goes to x+d, and the right lantern starts at y-d. To have no gap, we require x+d >= y-d -> d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the maximum value among:\n   candidate1 = a[0]  (if the first lantern is at a0, then we need to cover from 0 to a0, so d must be at least a0)\n   candidate2 = (last element - first element) / 2? No, wait, for consecutive gaps: we take each consecutive pair and compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.\n   candidate3 = l - a[-1]\n\n However, note: the first candidate (a[0]) is actually the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Similarly, the last candidate is the distance from the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are covered by at least one lantern. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check End Conditions**: The street starts at point 0 and ends at point `l`. The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position, so the required `d` here is the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (i.e., `a[0]`). Similarly, the last lantern must cover from its position to the end of the street (`l`), so the required `d` here is the distance from the end of the street to the last lantern (i.e., `l - a[-1]`).\n3. **Check Middle Gaps**: For the segments between consecutive lanterns, the required `d` is half the distance between them. This ensures that the combined coverage of two adjacent lanterns meets or exceeds the distance between them, eliminating any gaps.\n4. **Determine Minimum `d`**: The solution involves finding the maximum value among the three types of required `d` values (left end, middle gaps, and right end). This ensures that all parts of the street are covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    positions.sort()\n    \n    d_candidates = []\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l / 2.0))\n        return\n        \n    d_candidates.append(positions[0])  # left end\n    \n    for i in range(len(positions)-1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        d_candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n        \n    d_candidates.append(l - positions[-1])\n    \n    answer = max(d_candidates)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(answer))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order from left to right.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no lanterns (`n == 0`), the entire street must be covered by a single lantern with radius `l/2`.\n4. **Calculating Coverage Requirements**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (`positions[0]`).\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required `d` is half the distance between them (`(positions[i+1] - positions[i]) / 2.0`).\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The distance from the end of the street to the last lantern (`l - positions[-1]`).\n5. **Finding the Minimum `d`**: The solution is the maximum value among all the calculated `d` values, ensuring that every part of the street is covered. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to ensure the entire street is covered by the minimal light radius, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal solution.",
