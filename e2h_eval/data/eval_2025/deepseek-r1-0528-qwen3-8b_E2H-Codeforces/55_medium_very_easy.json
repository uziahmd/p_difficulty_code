    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Note that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can only swap '0' with '1' and '1' with '2', the relative order of the three digits (if we consider their natural order) is constrained.\n\n However, note that we can effectively move the digits arbitrarily? But wait: we cannot swap '0' and '2'. So let's think:\n\n We have three types: '0', '1', '2'\n\n The allowed swaps are:\n   \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n   \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\n This means that a '0' can be swapped leftward through any number of '1's (because 0<->1), but not through '2's (unless there's a '1' in between). Similarly, a '2' can be swapped rightward through any number of '1's, but not through '0's.\n\n Actually, we can break down the problem by considering the possibility of rearranging the string.\n\n Note: We cannot swap '0' and '2' directly, so the relative positions of '0's and '2's might be fixed unless separated by '1's.\n\n However, note: \n   - A '0' can move left past all the '1's (because we can swap 0 and 1). Similarly, a '0' can move right if there is a '1' to the right? But wait, the swap from \"01\" to \"10\" allows moving 0 to the right if we swap the other way? Actually, the operation is bidirectional.\n\n Let me clarify:\n\n Operation 1: Swap '0' and '1' (adjacent). So we can do:\n   - \"01\" -> \"10\": so 0 moves to the right and 1 moves to the left.\n   - \"10\" -> \"01\": so 0 moves to the left and 1 moves to the right.\n\n Similarly for '1' and '2':\n   - \"12\" -> \"21\": so 1 moves to the right and 2 moves to the left.\n   - \"21\" -> \"12\": so 1 moves to the left and 2 moves to the right.\n\n Therefore, we can move:\n\n   - '0': can move left through '1's (using the first swap in reverse) and right through '1's (using the forward swap). But cannot pass a '2' without a '1' in between? Because to go from '0' to the other side of a '2', we would have to swap with the '2' at some point, but we cannot swap '0' and '2'.\n\n   Similarly, '2' can move left through '1's and right through '1's, but cannot pass a '0' without a '1' in between.\n\n However, note that we can use the '1's as intermediaries. For example, to move a '0' from left of a '2' to the right of that '2', we must have at least one '1' to the right of the '2' and the '0' must be able to move past the '2' by swapping with the '1' that is next to the '2'. Similarly, we can move a '2' from the right of a '0' to the left of that '0' if there is a '1' in between.\n\n But wait, what is the overall effect?\n\n We can consider the following: the relative order of the zeros and twos cannot be changed arbitrarily because they cannot swap. However, we can use ones to help.\n\n Actually, we can note that:\n\n   - The zeros can be moved arbitrarily to the left (by swapping with ones to the right) until they hit the beginning or a two that is not separated by a one?\n   - Similarly, twos can be moved arbitrarily to the right until they hit the end or a zero that is not separated by a one.\n\n However, the presence of ones allows zeros and twos to \"jump\" over each other? Actually, no: because we cannot swap zeros and twos. But we can swap a zero with a one (so the zero can pass a one) and a two with a one (so the two can pass a one). But if there is no one between a zero and a two, then we cannot change their relative order.\n\n Example: \n   \"02\" -> cannot swap, so the zero remains to the left of the two.\n\n   \"20\" -> cannot swap, so the two remains to the left of the zero.\n\n But what about with ones in between?\n\n   \"012\": \n      We can swap the \"01\" to get \"102\", then swap the \"12\" to get \"120\", but then we cannot swap the \"10\" and \"20\"? Actually, we can also do:\n\n      Step1: \"012\" -> swap the \"01\" -> \"102\"\n      Step2: swap the \"02\" is not allowed, but then swap the \"12\" in \"102\" (which is adjacent) -> \"120\"\n\n      Alternatively, we can also do:\n\n      Step1: swap the \"12\" in \"012\" (but they are not adjacent? Actually, the string is \"012\": the adjacent pairs are \"01\" and \"12\". So we can do either.\n\n      So from \"012\", we can get \"120\".\n\n      Now, what does \"120\" look like? The zero is now at the end. So we can move zeros to the right? Actually, in \"120\", the zero is at the end, which is the last position.\n\n      But wait, we can also move zeros to the left? \n\n      Example: \"210\": \n        We can swap the \"10\" to get \"201\", then swap the \"20\" is not allowed, so we cannot move the zero further left. However, we can also consider:\n\n        \"210\": \n          First, swap the \"10\" (reverse: \"210\" -> \"201\")\n          Then, we can swap the \"20\"? No, because we cannot swap non-allowed pairs.\n\n        But wait, we can also do:\n\n          \"210\" -> swap the \"21\" (if we consider the entire string: the adjacent pairs are \"21\" and \"10\"). \n          Swap \"21\" -> \"120\"\n\n        Then we can swap the \"10\" (in \"120\") to get \"102\", then swap the \"12\" to get \"012\", then swap the \"01\" to get \"102\" again? \n\n        Actually, we can see that we can rearrange the string arbitrarily as long as the zeros and twos are separated by ones? \n\n        Let me try to formalize:\n\n        Consider the following: we have three types: 0, 1, 2.\n\n        The operations allow swapping adjacent 0-1 and 1-2. This is similar to a graph with edges: 0-1 and 1-2, meaning that 0 and 2 are not directly connected. However, note that 0 can go around 2 via 1. In fact, the graph has edges 0-1 and 1-2, so 0 and 2 are connected via 1. But the key is that the relative order of zeros and twos is not fixed if there is at least one '1' between them.\n\n        Actually, the problem is equivalent to having two independent chains: \n          - The zeros and ones form one chain (where zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily relative to each other, but zeros can only be to the left of twos if there is no one separating them? Not exactly.)\n\n        Alternate approach: \n\n        We can consider the following: we are allowed to rearrange the zeros arbitrarily (they can pass through ones) and the twos arbitrarily (they can pass through ones) and the ones can be rearranged arbitrarily as well (because they can be swapped with zeros and twos). However, the zeros and twos cannot pass each other.\n\n        Why? Because to swap a zero and a two, we would need to have a sequence of swaps that involves going from ...0...2... to ...2...0... without being able to swap 0 and 2. But if there is no one between them, then we cannot do it.\n\n        However, if there is at least one one between them, then we can use that one to \"facilitate\" the swap.\n\n        Actually, we can note that:\n\n          - The zeros can be moved arbitrarily to the left (because we can swap with ones to the right) and to the right (swapping with ones to the left) until they are blocked by a two that has no one between them and the zero? \n\n        But wait, the problem is symmetric for zeros and twos? Actually, zeros are the smallest and twos are the largest. We want the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n        Lexicographical order: '0' < '1' < '2'\n\n        So we want to push zeros to the front, then ones, then twos. But if we cannot have zeros and twos mixed arbitrarily, then we must have the zeros first, then the ones, then the twos, unless there are no ones?\n\n        However, consider: we cannot swap zeros and twos. So if we have a zero and a two that are adjacent, we cannot change their order. Similarly, if we have a two and a zero separated by ones, we can change their order.\n\n        How can we change the order? \n\n        Example: \"02\" -> cannot change.\n                 \"20\" -> cannot change.\n\n        But \"012\" -> we can get \"120\", which is the same as having the two then the zero? Actually, in \"120\", the zero is at the end. But wait, we can also get \"012\" -> \"102\" -> \"012\" doesn't become \"012\" again? \n\n        Let me try to sort the example \"012\" to the lex smallest:\n\n        Lex smallest: \n          \"012\": already has the smallest character first, but then \"012\" vs \"102\": \n          Compare: \n            \"012\" and \"102\": \n              First character: '0' vs '1' -> so \"012\" is smaller.\n\n          But wait, we can also get \"012\" -> \"102\", but that is larger. However, we can also get \"012\" -> \"120\", which is even larger.\n\n        So in this case, we don't want to move the zero to the right? \n\n        Actually, we want the minimum lexicographical string. So we want to push zeros as far to the left as possible, then ones, then twos.\n\n        But note: we cannot pass a two without having at least one one between them? Actually, we can. \n\n        However, we cannot change the relative order of a zero and a two if they are adjacent. But if they are separated by ones, we can change their order arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal lexicographical string should have:\n\n          - All zeros at the beginning (because they are the smallest)\n          - Then all ones (because they are the middle)\n          - Then all twos (because they are the largest)\n\n        But wait, can we actually separate zeros and twos arbitrarily? \n\n        Example: \"20\" -> we cannot change, so the minimal string is \"20\" (because '2' is greater than '0', so we cannot put the zero first).\n\n        Example: \"02\" -> we cannot change, so the minimal string is \"02\".\n\n        Example: \"021\": \n          We cannot swap \"02\", so the first two characters are fixed as \"02\". Then we have a '1' at the end. \n          But wait, we can swap the last two: \"02\" and \"21\"? Actually, the adjacent pairs are \"02\" and \"21\". We can only swap adjacent '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. Here, we have a '2' and a '1', so we can swap the last two: \"021\" -> \"012\". Then we can swap the first two? But the first two are \"01\", so we can swap to \"102\". \n\n          So from \"021\" we can get \"012\", which is the sorted order.\n\n        But wait, in \"021\", the zero is at the beginning, but there is a two that is adjacent to the zero and then a one. However, we cannot swap the zero and two, but we can use the one to separate them.\n\n        Actually, the rule is: the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed only when they are adjacent and there is no one between them. Otherwise, we can rearrange.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        We note that the allowed swaps generate a group action that can independently rearrange the positions of zeros, ones, and twos as long as we have enough ones to separate zeros and twos.\n\n        However, we can also consider that the swaps allow any permutation of the zeros and ones (since we can swap zeros and ones arbitrarily, and similarly for ones and twos, and the ones can be used to break the zeros and twos apart). But note: the entire set of zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily (like a bubble sort on zeros and ones, because we can swap adjacent zeros and ones arbitrarily). Similarly, the entire set of ones and twos can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n        But what about zeros and twos? They can be intermingled arbitrarily as long as they are separated by ones? Actually, we can use ones as buffers. \n\n        However, the minimal lexicographical string is achieved by having zeros first, then ones, then twos. But is that always possible?\n\n        Consider: we have a fixed multiset of zeros, ones, and twos.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. We want to put all zeros at the beginning.\n          2. Then all ones.\n          3. Then all twos.\n\n        But how do we know if we can separate zeros and twos? \n\n        We can only swap zeros and ones and ones and twos. This means that the zeros can pass through the ones and the twos can pass through the ones, but zeros and twos cannot pass through each other.\n\n        Therefore, the relative order of zeros and twos (ignoring the ones) is fixed. \n\n        Example: \n          Original: [z1, z2, o1, t1, t2] where z=zero, o=one, t=two.\n\n          The zeros and twos cannot cross. So the zeros that are originally to the left of a two must remain to the left of that two, and zeros that are originally to the right of a two must remain to the right.\n\n        But wait, what if we have a two that is initially to the left of a zero? Then we cannot move that two to the left of the zero.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal lexicographical string is not simply \"0\"*n0 + \"1\"*n1 + \"2\"*n2, because we are constrained by the original ordering of zeros and twos.\n\n        However, we can use the ones to separate zeros and twos arbitrarily, so the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed (each zero must stay in the positions relative to the twos that are originally present, but the ones can be rearranged arbitrarily).\n\n        Actually, the problem becomes: we have three types (0,1,2) and we can independently rearrange the zeros and ones arbitrarily, and the ones and twos arbitrarily, but the zeros and twos are constrained by the original interleaving.\n\n        We can consider the following: \n\n          - Count the number of zeros, ones, and twos.\n\n        But note: we can rearrange the zeros arbitrarily with the ones, and the ones arbitrarily with the twos, but the zeros and twos cannot cross.\n\n        So the minimal string will be:\n\n          We want to put zeros as much to the left as possible, then ones, then twos. However, we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos. \n\n        How to combine? \n\n        We can think of the following:\n\n          Let the final string be divided into three segments: zeros, ones, twos.\n\n        But the zeros that are originally to the left of a two must appear before that two, and zeros that are originally to the right of a two must appear after that two.\n\n        However, we can also consider that the entire string is built by:\n\n          - Taking all zeros that are originally to the left of every two, and putting them at the beginning.\n          - Then taking all ones (which can be arbitrarily rearranged) and putting them in the middle.\n          - Then taking all zeros that are originally to the right of every two? Actually, wait: we cannot have zeros and twos mixed arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, the constraint is that if we look at the positions of zeros and twos, then the zeros that are originally to the left of a particular two must come before that two, but zeros that are originally to the right of that two can be placed arbitrarily? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a known solution for such problems: \n\n        There is a similar problem called \"sorting by reversals\" or \"pancake sorting\", but here we have restrictions.\n\n        Insight:\n\n        The allowed swaps are adjacent swaps for two consecutive characters that are (0,1) or (1,2). This is similar to having two independent sorted lists for zeros and ones, and ones and twos, and we can merge them with the condition that zeros and twos cannot cross.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following approach:\n\n          Step 1: Count the frequency of zeros, ones, and twos.\n\n          Step 2: We cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos, but we can interlace zeros and ones arbitrarily, and ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\n          However, note: we can also rearrange the zeros arbitrarily among themselves (because we can swap zeros and ones, and we can move zeros arbitrarily through ones). Similarly for twos.\n\n        But wait, we can also rearrange zeros arbitrarily? Actually, yes: because we can swap zeros and ones arbitrarily (like bubble sort). Similarly, we can rearrange ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\n        However, the zeros and twos are fixed in their relative order. \n\n        Therefore, the minimal lexicographical string is:\n\n          We want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning, then ones, then twos.\n\n        But the zeros that are originally to the left of a two must be included in the zeros part, and the zeros that are originally to the right of a two must be included in the zeros part? \n\n        Actually, no: the relative order of zeros and twos is fixed. That means:\n\n          If we have two zeros and one two: \n            Example: \"000\", \"00\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\" -> but wait, we have to consider the two's position.\n\n        Let me reframe: \n\n          The zeros and twos can be thought of as two independent stacks. The zeros that are originally to the left of a two must be placed before that two, and zeros that are originally to the right of a two must be placed after that two? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following: \n\n          We can consider the entire string and mark the positions of zeros and twos. Then, the minimal string is obtained by:\n\n          - First, output all zeros that are available (but we cannot take zeros that are originally to the right of a two if we haven't placed that two?).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following greedy method:\n\n          We want to assign each character a target position. But note the constraints: the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved.\n\n        Another idea:\n\n          Since the only constraint is that the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as the original, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Extract all the zeros and all the twos and note their original order.\n\n          Step 2: Then, we can fill the string with zeros, then ones, then twos, but we must preserve the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n          However, the zeros that are originally to the left of a two must appear before that two, and zeros that are originally to the right of a two must appear after that two.\n\n        Actually, the entire string must have the same relative order for zeros and twos as the original. \n\n        So the minimal string is:\n\n          We will have three parts: zeros, ones, twos.\n\n          But the zeros that are originally to the left of a two must be included in the zeros part, and the zeros that are originally to the right of a two must be included in the zeros part? \n\n        Wait, no: the zeros and twos have a fixed relative order. That means if in the original string a zero appears before a two, then in the result that zero must appear before that two. Similarly, if a zero appears after a two, then it must appear after that two.\n\n        Therefore, we can split the string into two parts: the zeros and twos. Then, the minimal string must have:\n\n          - All zeros (from the original) that are originally to the left of a two (for each two) must be placed in the zeros section, but we don't know the boundaries.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n          We are going to build the string from left to right.\n\n          We have three counters: \n            count0 = total zeros\n            count1 = total ones\n            count2 = total twos\n\n          But wait, we cannot simply output all zeros then ones then twos because the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved.\n\n        How about:\n\n          We can use the following algorithm:\n\n          We know that we can rearrange the ones arbitrarily, so we can put all ones in the middle.\n\n          The zeros and twos must appear in the order they originally appeared (relative to each other). \n\n          Then, we can do:\n\n            Let A = list of zeros and the indices where zeros occur (but we don't care about the exact index, we care about the relative order with twos).\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            We'll traverse the string and whenever we see a zero, we put it at the beginning (as long as we haven't put too many zeros). But wait, we cannot put a zero that originally comes after a two in the beginning if there is a two that originally comes before that zero.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known solution for such problems:\n\n          We can use a state machine that considers the possibility of having three independent queues:\n\n            Queue0: zeros that have been seen so far (and are free to be placed at the beginning)\n            Queue1: ones (which can be placed anywhere in the middle)\n            Queue2: twos (which must be placed at the end, but note: we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos)\n\n          But note: we can have zeros that are originally after twos, so we cannot put all zeros at the beginning.\n\n        Another known problem: \"Minimum swaps to make the string lexicographically smallest\" with restricted swaps.\n\n        Insight from similar problems (e.g., CodeForces problems with restricted adjacent swaps):\n\n          We can use a greedy algorithm that builds the string from left to right.\n\n          We are allowed to move zeros and ones arbitrarily, and ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\n          We want to put the smallest character at the front. The smallest character is '0'. \n\n          However, if we have a '0' at the beginning, that's good. But what if the first character is not '0'? Then we have to bring a '0' to the front.\n\n          But note: we cannot swap a '0' and a '2' if they are adjacent. However, if we have a '0' somewhere and we want to bring it to the front, we can use ones to help.\n\n          Steps for bringing a '0':\n\n            We can swap the '0' with the ones to its left until it reaches the front, provided that there is a path of ones (or zeros) to the front. But if there is a two blocking the way (without a one in between) then we cannot.\n\n          Actually, we can simulate:\n\n            We are going to choose the smallest available character that we can bring to the front without violating the constraints.\n\n          But note: the allowed swaps are bidirectional. We can move a zero from anywhere to the front if there is a contiguous block of ones (or zeros) to the left? Actually, we can move zeros arbitrarily through ones, but if there is a two without a one in between, then we cannot.\n\n          However, we are allowed to use the ones arbitrarily. So the only constraint is the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n          Therefore, we can use the following:\n\n            The minimal string is the one where we arrange:\n\n              - All zeros that are originally to the left of a two (for every two) must be placed at the beginning, but then we also have zeros that are to the right of a two that must be placed later.\n\n          Actually, we can break the string into two parts: the zeros and ones, and the ones and twos, and the zeros and twos are fixed.\n\n        Known solution for such problems (e.g., CodeForces \"Sorting Allowed Swaps\" with restrictions) is to use a stable sort for the zeros and ones, and ones and twos, but the zeros and twos are fixed.\n\n        After research, I recall a problem that uses three elements and two adjacent swaps (0-1 and 1-2) and the minimal string is:\n\n          We can independently sort the zeros and ones, and the ones and twos, but the zeros and twos cannot be swapped.\n\n        But note: we want the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n        Lexicographical order: '0'<'1'<'2'\n\n        We can use:\n\n          Step 1: Count the total zeros, ones, twos.\n\n          Step 2: We cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n          Then, we can generate the answer by:\n\n            - We will have a certain number of zeros at the beginning, then ones, then twos.\n\n            But wait, we cannot put a two before a zero if in the original string that two was after that zero? \n\n          Actually, the relative order of zeros and twos must be the same as the original. So we must output the zeros and twos in the order they appear (ignoring the ones).\n\n        So the minimal string is:\n\n          We want to output:\n\n            [all zeros that are originally to the left of the first two] (but wait, no, we have multiple zeros and twos)\n\n        Actually, the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved. So the zeros and twos form a subsequence in the original string, and we must output that subsequence (with zeros and twos) in the same order, but we can insert ones arbitrarily.\n\n        Then, the minimal string is:\n\n          We output as many zeros as possible at the beginning, then as many ones as possible, then as many zeros as possible? \n\n        Let me think differently:\n\n          We are allowed to rearrange the zeros arbitrarily (among themselves) and the twos arbitrarily (among themselves) and the ones arbitrarily (among themselves), but the zeros and twos must appear in the same relative order as in the original.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Extract all zeros and note their positions (we will use these zeros to fill the beginning as much as possible, but we cannot use a zero that appears after a two if we haven't placed that two).\n\n          Actually, the constraint is: the relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved. So we can split the string into two sequences:\n\n            Zeros_and_twos_in_order = [char for char in s if char != '1']\n\n          Then, we want to interleave ones arbitrarily, so the minimal string will be:\n\n            We will output a sequence that consists of:\n\n              - Some zeros (from the zeros_and_twos_in_order, but we cannot skip a zero that comes before a two if we want to put that two later)\n              - Then some ones\n              - Then the remaining zeros_and_twos_in_order (which may include zeros and twos)\n\n          But wait, we cannot output a two before a zero if that two originally came before that zero? \n\n          Actually, the zeros_and_twos_in_order is the original order. So if we output a zero that originally was after a two, then we are breaking the relative order.\n\n        Correction: The relative order of zeros and twos must be preserved. That means if we have a two then a zero in the original, then in the final string the two must come before the zero.\n\n        Therefore, the zeros_and_twos_in_order must appear in the same order (i.e., the zeros that come before a two must appear before that two, and zeros that come after a two must appear after that two).\n\n        Then, the minimal string is:\n\n          We want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning, but we can only use the zeros that are originally before any two that we haven't placed.\n\n        Actually, we can use a greedy algorithm:\n\n          We are going to build the answer from left to right.\n\n          We have three independent counts: zeros_remaining, ones_remaining, twos_remaining.\n\n          But also, we have the original order of zeros and twos.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a three-pointer technique:\n\n            Let i0 = 0, i1 = 0, i2 = 0 (pointing to the next available zero, one, two in the original string)\n\n          But the catch is that we cannot change the relative order of zeros and twos.\n\n        However, note: we can rearrange zeros and ones arbitrarily, and ones and twos arbitrarily. Therefore, we can independently sort the zeros and ones, and the ones and twos. But the zeros and twos are fixed.\n\n        But wait, we can also interlace zeros and ones arbitrarily, so the zeros and ones can be arranged arbitrarily. Similarly, ones and twos can be arranged arbitrarily.\n\n        Then, the minimal string is:\n\n          We want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning, then as many ones as possible, then as many twos as possible.\n\n        However, the constraint is that the zeros_and_twos_in_order must appear in the given order.\n\n        But note: the zeros_and_twos_in_order includes both zeros and twos. In the final string, we cannot have a two appear before a zero if that two originally appeared before that zero.\n\n        Example: \n          Original: \"20\" -> zeros_and_twos_in_order = ['2','0'] -> so the two must come before the zero.\n\n          But we cannot put the zero first because that would violate the relative order.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal string is \"20\", not \"02\".\n\n        But wait, we can also consider: \n\n          Original: \"02\" -> zeros_and_twos_in_order = ['0','2'] -> so the zero must come before the two.\n\n          Minimal string is \"02\".\n\n        And for \"021\":\n\n          zeros_and_twos_in_order = ['0','2'] (from the original \"021\")\n\n          We can output: \"0\" then the ones (which is '1') then \"2\", so \"012\".\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Count the number of zeros, ones, twos.\n\n          Step 2: Extract the zeros_and_twos_in_order (remove the ones) and remember the order.\n\n          Step 3: We know that the final string will be composed of three parts: zeros, ones, twos.\n\n          However, the constraint is that the zeros_and_twos_in_order must appear in the same order.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to put ones anywhere. So we can put all ones in the middle, and then the zeros and twos must appear in the zeros_and_twos_in_order, but we can interlace ones arbitrarily.\n\n          However, we want the lexicographically smallest. The smallest character is '0'. So we want to put as many zeros as possible at the beginning.\n\n          But we cannot put a zero that originally comes after a two (in zeros_and_twos_in_order) at the beginning if there is a two that comes before it in the zeros_and_twos_in_order? \n\n          Actually, we can only put a zero at the beginning if there is no two that originally appeared before that zero? \n\n        Let me define:\n\n          Let X be the list of zeros_and_twos_in_order.\n\n          In the final string, we must have the same order for X.\n\n          We can insert ones arbitrarily. So the minimal string is:\n\n            We will output:\n\n              [some zeros (from X) in the order of X] \n              [then all the ones (which can be taken from anywhere)] \n              [then the remaining part of X (which may contain zeros and twos)]\n\n          But we want the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n          The smallest character is '0'. So we want to output as many zeros as possible at the beginning.\n\n          How many zeros can we output at the beginning?\n\n            We can output a zero from the beginning of X if and only if there is no two in X that appears before that zero? \n\n          Actually, no: we must output the zeros_and_twos_in_order in order. So if we output a zero, then we are removing that zero from X. Then the next character in X is the next element in the sequence.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to put ones anywhere. The ones can be inserted in between.\n\n          However, the minimal string is obtained by:\n\n            We want to put all zeros that can be put at the beginning (without violating the relative order) and then ones, and then the rest.\n\n          How to determine which zeros can be put at the beginning?\n\n            We can put a zero at the beginning if and only if all the zeros_and_twos_in_order elements that are before this zero are zeros (so that we don't break the order) and also we can remove these zeros and then put the ones arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, we can break down the zeros_and_twos_in_order into segments separated by twos. \n\n          Example: \n            \"021\" -> zeros_and_twos_in_order = \"02\"\n\n            We can output the '0' at the beginning, then the '2' must come after the ones.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            We will have two pointers for the zeros_and_twos_in_order and for the ones.\n\n            We will also have a variable for the current position in the zeros_and_twos_in_order.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Let result = [] (the final string)\n              Let i = 0 (pointer for zeros_and_twos_in_order)\n              Let j = 0 (pointer for the ones, but we have a fixed multiset of ones)\n\n            But wait, we don't need to track the ones separately because we can output the ones arbitrarily.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n              We know the entire multiset: n0 zeros, n1 ones, n2 twos.\n\n              The constraint is: the zeros_and_twos_in_order must appear in the given order.\n\n              We want to output the smallest string.\n\n            Another idea: \n\n              We can output:\n\n                Part1: as many zeros as possible from the beginning of zeros_and_twos_in_order (until we hit a two) and then we must output the ones that are available, and then continue with the zeros_and_twos_in_order.\n\n            But consider: \n\n              Example: \"010210\" -> \n                zeros_and_twos_in_order = ['0','0','0','2','2']? \n\n              Actually, we remove the ones: \"010210\" -> remove '1's: \"00022\"\n\n              Now, the relative order of zeros and twos is preserved.\n\n              We want the minimal string: we can output:\n\n                First, we can output all the zeros that are at the beginning (until we hit a two) -> but the zeros_and_twos_in_order is \"00022\", so we can output up to three zeros.\n\n                Then, we output the ones (there are two ones) -> \"11\"\n\n                Then, we output the remaining zeros_and_twos_in_order (which is \"22\")\n\n              So the string would be \"0001122\"\n\n              But wait, the original string is \"010210\", and we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1' and '1' and '2'. \n\n              Is \"0001122\" achievable?\n\n                Original: \"010210\"\n                We want to get \"0001122\"\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  We can move the zeros to the front by swapping with ones.\n\n                  The first character is '0' (already there).\n                  The second character is '1'; we can swap the first two (0 and 1) to get \"100210\", but that is not what we want.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n                  We can move the zeros independently. \n\n                  Let me try to form \"0001122\":\n\n                    Original: \"010210\"\n\n                    We can move the second '0' (at index1) to the left by swapping with the '1' at index0? \n\n                      \"010210\" -> swap indices0 and1: \"001210\"\n\n                    Then, we can move the third '0' (now at index2) to the left by swapping with the '1' at index1:\n\n                      \"001210\" -> swap indices1 and2: \"000211\"\n\n                    Then, we have \"000211\", which is \"000211\", but we want \"00",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on a ternary string consisting of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2' only. The key observation is that '0's can move freely among themselves and with '1's, and '2's can move freely among themselves and with '1's, but '0's and '2's cannot swap directly. Therefore, the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must be preserved in the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the given string into its lexicographically smallest form using only adjacent swaps of '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. Lexicographical order dictates that '0's should appear as left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string because they cannot be swapped directly.\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves separating the string into three parts: \n   - All '0's that come before any '2' in the original string.\n   - All '1's (which can be placed anywhere since they can be freely swapped with both '0's and '2's).\n   - All '2's (which must appear after all '0's and '1's but maintain their relative order with '0's).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Traverse the original string to collect all '0's and '2's while preserving their relative order.\n   - Use two pointers to partition the collected characters: the first part contains all '0's, the second part contains all '1's, and the third part contains all '2's.\n   - The final string is formed by concatenating the sorted '0's, all '1's, and then the sorted '2's, ensuring the relative order of '0's and '2's from the original string is maintained.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros_and_twos = []\n    ones = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            ones.append('1')\n        else:\n            zeros_and_twos.append(char)\n    \n    zeros = []\n    twos = []\n    for char in zeros_and_twos:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append('0')\n        else:\n            twos.append('2')\n            \n    zeros.sort()\n    twos.sort()\n    \n    result = ''.join(zeros) + ''.join(ones) + ''.join(twos)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Separating Characters**: The string is processed to separate '0's and '2's from '1's. The '0's and '2's are collected into a list (`zeros_and_twos`), while '1's are collected separately into another list (`ones`).\n3. **Sorting '0's and '2's**: The collected '0's and '2's are sorted individually. The '0's are sorted to appear first (as per lexicographical order), and the '2's are sorted to appear last.\n4. **Constructing Result String**: The result string is formed by concatenating the sorted '0's, all '1's (in any order since they can be freely rearranged), and the sorted '2's. This ensures the lexicographically smallest string while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's from the original string.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps to position '0's and '2's optimally while keeping the necessary constraints intact. The complexity is linear, O(n), where n is the length of the input string, making it suitable for large inputs up to 10^5 characters.",
