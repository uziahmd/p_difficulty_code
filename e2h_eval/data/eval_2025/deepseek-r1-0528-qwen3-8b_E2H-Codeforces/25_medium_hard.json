При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it is the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions for error:\n  - The two messages are identical and of length n (so the original transmission would have been s+s without error, but with error they merged).\n  - The merge happens by overlapping at some positive length k (1 <= k < n) such that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s.\n  - The resulting string t must be: \n        t = s + s[k:]   OR   in other words, t = s + (the part of s starting from index k)\n\n But note: the problem says that if we get a string that is just two copies of s without any overlap, then that is not considered an error. So we require that there was a non-zero overlap (but less than the full length).\n\n However, note that the example: \n      \"abcd\" -> NO (because no error)\n      \"abcabc\" -> NO (because even though it can be split as s=\"abc\", then s+s = \"abcabc\", but the error requires that the two copies overlapped by at least one character (and less than the whole). In this case, the overlap is 3 which is the whole length? Actually, wait: the condition is that the overlap must be positive and less than the length. So for s=\"abc\", the length is 3. Then we cannot have an overlap of 3 because that would mean the second s starts exactly at the end of the first, and then the merged string would be \"abc\" (if we take k=3, then the second s's part from index 3 is empty). But note the example: \n          \"abrakadabra\" + \"abrakadabra\": \n          Without error: \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\"\n          With error (overlap 1): \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n          With error (overlap 4): \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n How do we interpret the problem?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are to check: Is there a string s and an integer k (1<=k<len(s)) such that:\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n 2. Also note: the problem says that if we get a string that can be split into two parts that are the same s, then we must have had an error only if the two messages overlapped (so the entire string is not two independent copies). But note: the problem also says that the entire string being two copies without overlap is not considered an error. Therefore, we must have an overlap.\n\n However, note the example: \n        Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n Why? Because if we try to split 'abcabc' into two parts, we can split it as:\n        s1 = 'abc', s2 = 'abc'\n        Then if we consider that the first copy was transmitted correctly, and the second copy was overlapped by 3, then we get:\n            t = 'abc' + '' = 'abc' -> but that's not 'abcabc'. \n        Alternatively, we might consider splitting differently: \n            Maybe s is not 'abc'? \n        Let's assume s is 'abcab'. Then the second copy would start at index 3 (overlap of 3). Then the second copy's tail is 'cab', so the entire string would be 'abcab' + 'cab' = 'abcabcab', which is too long.\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem does not require that the two copies were the same as the entire string. We are allowed to break the string t into two consecutive transmissions of the same message s, but with an overlap.\n\n How about: \n        Let n = len(t). We want to find an integer i (from 1 to floor(n/2)) such that:\n          Let s = t[0:i]   [then the second message must be s again, so the entire string should be built as: s + (a suffix of s)]\n\n        But note: the second message is s, so the second part of the transmission is s, and we are allowed to drop the prefix of s that overlaps with the end of the first s.\n\n        Condition: \n          t = s + s[k:]   for some k in [1, len(s)-1]\n\n        And note: the length of t must be len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*len(s) - k.\n\n        So we have: n = 2*i - k, and k is between 1 and i-1. Therefore, n must be at least i+1 (because k>=1 => 2*i - k <= 2*i-1, and also n must be at least i+1 because k<=i-1 => n = 2*i - k >= 2*i - (i-1) = i+1).\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over possible s. Since the length of t is at most 100, we can try all splits.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are going to consider: \n   For each possible split where the first part is s (from index0 to i) and the second part is the rest (from i to n). But note: the second part is not necessarily the entire second copy of s, because it is overlapped by k. \n\n However, note: the entire message t must be formed by two consecutive transmissions of s. The first transmission gives s. The second transmission gives s, but we can drop the initial k characters of s (which were already received) and then send the rest. Therefore, the second part of the string (after the first |s| characters) must be equal to the substring of s starting from k.\n\n But note: the second part of the string is exactly from index i to n, and that must be s[i:] (if we assume s is t[0:i])? Actually, wait: the second message is s, so the entire second message is s. But we are only sending the part that hasn't been sent (because the overlapping part was already received). So the entire string t is:\n\n        t = s + (s without the first k characters)\n\n        But note: the second copy's data is s, but we are only receiving the part that wasn't covered by the first copy. So the total length is |s| + (|s| - k) = 2|s| - k.\n\n        Now, we don't know k. But note that the entire string t must be consistent: the first |s| characters are s, and the next (|s| - k) characters must be the tail of s (starting at index k).\n\n        However, we don't know s. We can try:\n\n        Let i be the length of s (from 1 to n//2, because the minimum length of t is i+1, and i must be at least 1). Then we require:\n\n          Condition 1: The first i characters of t are s.\n          Condition 2: The next part (from i to n) is the substring of s starting at k (for some k in [1, i-1]), so the part from i to n must be equal to s[k:].\n\n        But note: the entire second copy is s, so the part we send is from k to the end of s, which is i-k. Therefore, the length of the second part is i - k, and the total length is i + (i - k) = 2*i - k.\n\n        So we must have: n = 2*i - k, and since k is at least 1 and at most i-1, then n must be in the range [i+1, 2*i-1]. \n\n        Actually, we can express k = 2*i - n.\n\n        Then we must have: \n            1 <= k <= i-1   =>  1 <= 2*i - n <= i-1\n\n        Rearranged for n: \n            n <= 2*i - 1   (from k>=1) and n >= i+1   (from k<=i-1: 2*i - n <= i-1  => n >= i+1)\n\n        So i must satisfy: i+1 <= n <= 2*i-1.\n\n        Then we can write:\n\n        For i from max(1, ceil((n+1)/2)) to floor(n/2) [but wait, let me check the boundaries]:\n\n        Actually, we can iterate i from 1 to n//2 (integer division) and check:\n\n          Condition 1: n = 2*i - k, and k must be in [1, i-1] -> so n must be in [i+1, 2*i-1].\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate i from 1 to n//2 (because if i > n//2, then 2*i >= n+1, but then n>=2*i, which contradicts the condition that n<=2*i-1).\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let n = len(t)\n\n        For i in range(1, n//2+1):   # i is the length of s, then the total length should be 2*i - k, and k=2*i-n must be in [1, i-1]\n            if n < i+1 or n > 2*i-1:\n                continue\n\n            Then, s = t[0:i]\n            k = 2*i - n   (this must be an integer and in the valid range)\n\n            Then, the remaining part of t (from index i to the end) should be equal to s[k:].\n\n            Additionally, note: the entire second copy is s, but we only send from k to the end. So the length of the second part is i - k, and indeed, the length of t from index i is n-i, and we have n-i = i - k, because k = 2*i - n, then i-k = i - (2*i - n) = n - i. So the length matches.\n\n            Then, we check: t[i:] == s[k:]\n\n        If we find such an i and s, then we output:\n            \"YES\"\n            s\n\n        However, note: there might be multiple possibilities. We can output any.\n\n        What if we don't find any i? Then output \"NO\".\n\n        But note: what if the string t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap, but we are breaking the string at the wrong point? \n\n        Example: \n            t = \"abababab\" (example from input)\n\n        Let's try i=4: \n            s = \"abab\"\n            n = 8, then k = 2*4 - 8 = 0 -> invalid (k must be at least 1). So skip.\n\n        i=5: but 5>n//2? n=8, i from 1 to 4.\n\n        i=3: \n            n=8, then k=2*3-8 = -2 -> invalid.\n\n        i=2: \n            n=8, then k=2*2-8=-4 -> invalid.\n\n        i=1: \n            n=8, then k=2*1-8=-6 -> invalid.\n\n        So why is the example output for \"abababab\" is \"YES\\nababab\"?\n\n        Wait, the example output says: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So for \"abababab\", the answer is YES and s = \"ababab\".\n\n        How does that work?\n\n        Let s = \"ababab\", then the length i=6, but n=8, then k=2*6-8=4. \n        Then the second part should be s[4:] = \"ab\", and the entire string t should be s + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which matches.\n\n        But wait, our loop only goes to n//2. Here n=8, so i goes up to 4. We didn't check i=6.\n\n        Correction: the condition for i is that n must be at most 2*i-1. For i=6: 2*i-1=11, which is >=8, so i=6 is acceptable.\n\n        But how do we iterate i? The condition for i is that i must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1 (because k>=1, so n<=2*i-1, so i>=ceil((n+1)/2)). \n\n        However, note: the length of s (i) must be at least (n+1)//2? Actually, from n<=2*i-1, we have i>= (n+1)//2.\n\n        So i must be at least (n+1)//2 and at most n-1 (because k>=1 and k<=i-1, and also i must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1). But wait, note that the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so the length of s (i) must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1.\n\n        However, note that we have: n = 2*i - k, and k is at least 1 and at most i-1. Therefore, i must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1.\n\n        But wait, the condition i>=ceil((n+1)/2) comes from n<=2*i-1. \n\n        How do we iterate i?\n\n        We require:\n            i_min = ceil((n+1)/2)   [since n<=2*i-1 => i>=ceil((n+1)/2)]\n            i_max = n-1   [because k>=1, so i cannot be n (then k=2*n-n=n, which is not allowed because k must be < i)].\n\n        However, note: the length of s is i, and the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so the maximum i can be is n-1 (because k=2*i-n must be at least 1 and at most i-1, and 2*i-n>=1 => i>=(n+1)//2, and 2*i-n<=i-1 => i>=n+1, which is not necessarily true). \n\n        Actually, from k<=i-1: 2*i-n <= i-1  => i <= n-1.\n\n        So i ranges from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\n        But note: the example \"abababab\": n=8, then i_min = ceil(9/2)=5, i_max=7. We found i=6 works.\n\n        Another example: \"acacacaca\" (n=10). Then i_min = ceil(11/2)=6, i_max=9. Then k=2*i-10, and we require 1<=k<=i-1.\n\n        For i=6: k=2*6-10=2 -> valid. Then s = t[0:6] = \"acacac\", and the second part should be s[2:] = \"cacaca\", and the entire string t should be \"acacac\" + \"cacaca\" = \"acacaccacaca\", but the given t is \"acacacaca\". Wait, that doesn't match.\n\n        Let me check: \n            t = \"acacacaca\" (length 10)\n            s = \"acacac\" (length 6), then the second part is s[2:] = \"cacaca\", which is 6 characters, so total length would be 6+6=12, but we have 10. \n\n        Actually, wait: the formula is n = 2*i - k. For i=6, k=2, then n=2*6-2=10, which matches.\n\n        Then the second part is s[2:] and its length is 6-2=4, so the entire string would be 6 + 4 = 10. So the second part is only 4 characters? But s[2:] is \"cacaca\" which is 6 characters.\n\n        This indicates a misunderstanding.\n\n        Let me re-read the condition: \n            The two messages are s and s. The first is transmitted fully, the second is transmitted from index k to the end. So the second part is s[k:], which has length (len(s)-k) = i-k.\n\n        Then the total length is i + (i-k) = 2*i - k.\n\n        So for i=6 and k=2, the second part is s[2:] which is 4 characters? Actually, no: the string s has length 6, so s[2:] is from index 2 to the end, which is 4 characters. But wait: \n            s = \"acacac\" -> indices 0 to 5.\n            s[2:] = \"cacac\" (5-2+1=4 characters? Actually, from index2 to the last, so 5-2+1=4? Actually, in Python, slicing [2:] gives from index2 to the end, so 4 characters: \n                \"acacac\"[2:] -> 'cacac' (5th character is included? Actually, the string \"acacac\" has 6 characters. \n                Index: 0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a, 5:c -> so from index2: 'a','c','a','c' -> that's 4 characters.\n\n        Then the entire string t = s + s[2:] = \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" = \"acaccacac\", which is 10 characters? \n            \"acacac\" (6) + \"cacac\" (5) -> wait, 6+5=11, but we have 10.\n\n        Let me count: \n            s = \"acacac\" -> 6 letters.\n            s[2:] = s[2:6] (if we use 0-indexed and the slice goes until the end) -> that's 4 letters.\n\n        Then the total length is 6+4=10, so it matches.\n\n        But wait, the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"YES\\nacaca\". That means they found s = \"acaca\", which is of length 5.\n\n        Let me check with s=\"acaca\", i=5, then k=2*5-10=0 -> invalid (k must be at least 1). So that doesn't work.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe they used a different s? \n\n        The example input says: \n            Input: 'acacacaca' -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n        But according to our reasoning, with s=\"acaca\" (i=5) we get k=0, which is invalid.\n\n        Let me check with s=\"acacac\" (i=6) as above: \n            t = \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" = \"acaccacac\" (which is 10 characters) but the input is \"acacacaca\", which is 10 characters.\n\n        Compare: \n            Our constructed: \"a c a c a c c a c a c\" -> wait, let me write without spaces: \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" = \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" -> \n            \"a c a c a c\" and then \"c a c a c\" -> \"acacac\" + \"cacac\" = \"acacaccacac\" -> 6+5=11? \n\n        Actually, let me count: \n            \"acacac\" -> 6\n            \"cacac\" -> 5\n            Total: 11, but the string \"acacacaca\" is 10.\n\n        So there is a discrepancy.\n\n        Let me reexamine the condition: \n            The entire string t is built as: s + (s without the first k characters)\n\n            For s=\"acacac\" (length 6) and k=2, then the second part is s[2:] which is 4 characters: \n                s[2:] = \"cacac\" -> wait, no: \n                    s = \"acacac\"\n                    s[2:] = s[2:6] (if we consider 0-indexed and the string has indices 0..5) -> \n                    index2: 'a' (from the third character) then index3: 'c', index4:'a', index5:'c'. So that's 4 characters: \"acac\"? \n\n            Actually, wait: \n                s = \"acacac\": \n                    index0: 'a'\n                    index1: 'c'\n                    index2: 'a'\n                    index3: 'c'\n                    index4: 'a'\n                    index5: 'c'\n\n            Then s[2:] is from index2 to the end: \"a\" at index2, then 'c','a','c' -> so \"acac\", which is 4 characters.\n\n            Then the entire string: \"acacac\" + \"acac\" = \"acacacacac\", which is 10 characters? \n                \"acacac\" (6) + \"acac\" (4) = 10.\n\n            Now, compare with the input \"acacacaca\": \n                Our constructed: \"acacacacac\"\n                Input:         \"acacacaca\" -> wait, they are different.\n\n            Input: \"acacacaca\" is 10 characters: \n                a c a c a c a c a -> wait, let me count: \n                a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a -> 9 characters? \n\n            Actually, the example input is given as 'acacacaca'. Let me count: \n                a c a c a c a c a -> that's 9 letters? But the example output says YES, so the input must be 10.\n\n        I see: the example input is written as 'acacacaca', which is 9 characters.\n\n        Wait, the problem says: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n        Count the strings:\n\n            abrakadabrabrakadabra: 21\n            acacacaca: 9\n            abcabc: 6\n            abababab: 8\n            tatbt: 5\n\n        So the example input for the second example is 9 characters.\n\n        Then our calculation for n=9:\n\n        We are trying to find s and k such that n=9=2*i-k, and 1<=k<=i-1.\n\n        Then i must be at least ceil((9+1)/2)=5, and at most 8.\n\n        Let me try i=5: \n            k=2*5-9=1 -> valid (1<=1<=4)\n            s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n            Then the second part should be s[1:] = \"caca\", so the entire string should be \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is 5+4=9, and matches the input.\n\n        Then the answer for \"acacacaca\" is s=\"acaca\", which is what the example output says.\n\n        So the mistake was: the example input \"acacacaca\" is 9 characters, not 10.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Let t be the input string, n=len(t)\n\n        Step 1: Iterate i from max(1, (n+1)//2) to n-1 (inclusive) [because i_min = ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1)//2 (if n is odd, then (n+1)//2 is an integer; if even, then (n+1)//2 is a float and we take ceil, but in integer division, (n+1)//2 is the ceiling for odd and floor+0.5 for even? Actually, for even n: (n+1)//2 is (n+1)/2 rounded down, but we need ceil((n+1)/2) for the lower bound.\n\n        Actually, we require i>=ceil((n+1)/2). How to compute that in integer?\n            ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 if n is even? No.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate i from i_min to n-1, where i_min = (n+1)//2 if n is odd? Actually, the condition is i>=ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        We can set i_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0) ? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n            i_min = (n+1) // 2   # This is floor division. But note: \n                if n is odd: say n=9 -> (9+1)//2 = 10//2=5 -> correct.\n                if n is even: say n=8 -> (8+1)//2 = 9//2=4 (in integer floor division) -> but we need ceil(9/2)=5? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: n<=2*i-1 -> i>=(n+1)/2.\n\n        So i_min = ceil((n+1)/2). We can compute that as (n+1)//2 if (n+1) is even? Actually, in Python, for positive integers, ceil(a/b) can be computed as (a-1)//b + 1, but here we have (n+1)/2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: i_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0) doesn't work.\n\n        Actually, for integer n, ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 if n is even? \n\n        Let me check:\n            n=8 -> (8+1)=9, ceil(9/2)=5 -> (8+1+1)//2 = 10//2=5 -> correct.\n            n=9 -> (9+1)=10, ceil(10/2)=5 -> (9+1+1)//2=11//2=5 (floor division) -> correct.\n\n        But wait, we don't need to add 1 always. Actually, we can use:\n\n            i_min = (n+1) // 2\n            if (n+1) % 2 != 0: then we need to round up? \n\n        Actually, no: the condition is i>=ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid computing ceil and use:\n\n            i_min = (n+1) // 2\n            if (n+1) % 2 != 0: then i_min = (n+1)//2 + 1? \n\n        But wait, (n+1)//2 is floor((n+1)/2). Then ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1)//2 if (n+1) is even, and (n+1)//2 + 1 if (n+1) is odd.\n\n        Actually, for integer x, ceil(x/2) = (x+1)//2.\n\n        So for x = n+1, then ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 = (n+2)//2.\n\n        But wait, let me test:\n            n=8 -> x=9 -> ceil(9/2)=5, (9+1)//2=10//2=5 -> correct.\n            n=9 -> x=10 -> ceil(10/2)=5, (10+1)//2=11//2=5 -> correct? \n\n        Actually, ceil(10/2)=5, but (10+1)//2=5 (since 11//2=5). So it's the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            i_min = (n+1) // 2   # floor((n+1)/2) is not the same as ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        Actually, we want the smallest integer i such that i>=ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        But note: the condition is i>=ceil((n+1)/2). We can set i_min = (n+1+1)//2? \n\n        Actually, standard way: ceil(a) = -floor(-a) for real numbers, but for integers, we can use:\n\n            i_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0) \n\n        But wait, (n+1)%2==0 when n+1 is even, then (n+1)//2 is an integer. Otherwise, we need to round up.\n\n        Actually, we can use: \n            i_min = (n+1) // 2\n            if (n+1) % 2 == 0:\n                i_min = (n+1)//2\n            else:\n                i_min = (n+1)//2 + 1\n\n        But note: (n+1)//2 is floor((n+1)/2). Then ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1)//2 if (n+1) is even, and (n+1)//2 + 1 if (n+1) is odd.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            i_min = (n+1) // 2\n            if (n+1) % 2 != 0:\n                i_min += 1\n\n        However, there is a simpler way: \n            i_min = (n+1) // 2   # This is floor((n+1)/2). Then if (n+1) is even, we are done. If odd, then we need to set i_min to the next integer.\n\n        But note: our condition is i>=ceil((n+1)/2). The smallest integer i satisfying that is ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        We can compute ceil((n+1)/2) as (n+1+1)//2? \n\n        Actually, for integer x, ceil(x/2) = (x+1)//2 (using integer floor division). \n\n        So for x = n+1, then ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 = (n+2)//2.\n\n        Then i_min = (n+2)//2.\n\n        Let me test:\n            n=8 -> (8+2)//2=10//2=5 -> correct.\n            n=9 -> (9+2)//2=11//2=5 (in integer floor division) -> correct.\n\n        So we can set i_min = (n+2)//2.\n\n        Then i from i_min to n-1 (inclusive).\n\n        Steps:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        i_min = (n+2)//2\n        for i in range(i_min, n):   # i from i_min to n-1\n            k = 2*i - n   # must be in [1, i-1]\n            if k < 1 or k >= i: \n                continue   # actually, k must be at least 1 and less than i (so k<=i-1). But note: k>=1 and k<=i-1.\n\n            Then, s = t[0:i]\n            Then, the second part of t (from index i to the end) should be s[k:]\n\n            Check if t[i:] == s[k:]\n\n            If yes, then we found a solution.\n\n        However, note: the entire string t must be exactly s + s[k:]. The length of s is i, and the length of the second part is n-i, and the length of s[k:] is i - k. And we have n-i = i - k (because k=2*i-n) so the lengths match.\n\n        Example: \"abababab\", n=8, i_min = (8+2)//2 = 5, then i from 5 to 7.\n\n        i=5: k=2*5-8=2 -> valid (1<=2<=4). Then s=t[0:5]=\"ababa\", then s[2:]=\"bab\", and t[5:] should be \"babab\", but wait:\n\n            t = \"abababab\"\n            t[0:5] = \"ababa\"\n            t[5:] = \"bab\" (from index5 to the end: 8-5=3 characters: \"bab\")\n            s[2:] = \"aba\" (because s=\"ababa\", so from index2: 'a','b','a') -> \"aba\", which is 3 characters.\n\n            Then we compare: t[5:]==\"bab\", s[2:]==\"aba\" -> not equal.\n\n        i=6: k=2*6-8=4 -> valid (1<=4<=5). Then s=t[0:6]=\"ababab\", then s[4:]=\"ab\", and t[6:]=\"ab\" -> matches.\n\n        So we output s=\"ababab\".\n\n        Example: \"abcabc\", n=6, i_min=(6+2)//2=4, then i from 4 to 5.\n\n        i=4: k=2*4-6=2 -> valid (1<=2<=3). Then s=t[0:4]=\"abcabc\"[:4]=\"abca\", then s[2:]=\"ca\", and t[4:]=\"bc\" -> \"ca\" vs \"bc\" -> not equal.\n\n        i=5: k=2*5-6=4 -> valid (1<=4<=4). Then s=t[0:5]=\"abcab\", then s[4:]=\"b\", and t[5:]=\"c\" -> not equal.\n\n        So output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        Example: \"tatbt\", n=5, i_min=(5+2)//2=7//2=3 (floor division). Then i from 3 to 4.\n\n        i=3: k=2*3-5=1 -> valid. s=t[0:3]=\"tat\", then s[1:]=\"at\", and t[3:]==\"bt\" -> \"at\" vs \"bt\" -> no.\n\n        i=4: k=2*4-5=3 -> valid (1<=3<=3). s=t[0:4]=\"tatt\", then s[3:]=\"t\", and t[4:]=\"b\" -> no.\n\n        So output \"NO\".\n\n        One more example: \"abcabc\" is NO, but what if we try to break differently? \n\n        However, note: the problem states that the two messages are identical. So the first message is s and the second is s. The entire string is built as s + s[k:].\n\n        There is no other way.\n\n        But note: the problem says the error is that two identical messages are sent and then merged. So the first part must be the entire first message, and the second part is the second message without the overlapping part.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Read t from stdin.\n\n        n = len(t)\n        i_min = (n+2)//2   # This is the smallest i (length of s) we need to consider.\n\n        for i in range(i_min, n):\n            k = 2*i - n\n            if k < 1 or k >= i:   # k must be at least 1 and less than i (so k <= i-1)\n                continue\n\n            s = t[:i]\n            # The second part should be from index i to the end, and it should be s[k:]\n            if t[i:] == s[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s)\n                exit(0)   # or break and then after the loop we output NO.\n\n        After the loop, if we didn't find any, output \"NO\".\n\n        However, note: there might be multiple solutions, but the problem allows any.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is empty? The problem states that t is non-empty.\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (n=21)\n            i_min = (21+2)//2 = 23//2 = 11 (floor division)\n            Then i from 11 to 20.\n\n            We need to find i such that k=2*i-21 is in [1, i-1]. \n\n            i=11: k=2*11-21=1 -> valid. Then s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabr\" (wait, the example output says s=\"abrakadabra\", which is 11 letters? Actually, \"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters.\n\n            Then the second part should be s[1:] = \"brakadabra\", and the entire string t should be \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 22 characters? \n\n            But wait, the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be a positive number of characters less than the length of `s`. The solution involves checking all possible valid splits of the string `t` into two parts where the first part is `s` and the second part is `s[k:]` for some `k` (1 ≤ k < len(s)).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by two consecutive transmissions of the same string `s` with an overlap. The overlap means that the end of the first transmission of `s` matches the beginning of the second transmission of `s` for at least one character but less than the entire string length.\n2. **Intuition**: For a string `t` of length `n`, we need to find a substring `s` of length `i` such that when `s` is concatenated with `s[k:]` (where `k` is the overlap length), it results in `t`. The overlap length `k` must satisfy `1 ≤ k < i`, and the total length of `t` must be `2*i - k`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over possible lengths `i` of `s` starting from `(n + 2) // 2` (the minimum required length) up to `n - 1`. For each `i`, compute `k = 2*i - n` and check if `k` is within the valid range. If valid, verify if the substring `t[i:]` matches `s[k:]`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible split once, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is efficient given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    i_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    found = False\n    for i in range(i_min, n):\n        k_val = 2 * i - n\n        if k_val < 1 or k_val >= i:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:i]\n        tail = t[i:]\n        if tail == s[k_val:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s)\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read from standard input.\n2. **Initial Check**: If the string is empty, output \"NO\" immediately as per the problem constraints.\n3. **Finding Valid Splits**: Calculate the minimum length `i_min` for `s` using integer division. For each possible length `i` from `i_min` to `n-1`, compute the overlap length `k_val = 2*i - n`.\n4. **Validation Check**: Ensure `k_val` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k_val < i). If valid, check if the substring `t[i:]` matches `s[k_val:]`. If they match, print \"YES\" followed by `s` and exit.\n5. **Output Result**: If no valid split is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by two overlapping transmissions of `s`, leveraging simple string slicing and comparison operations.",
