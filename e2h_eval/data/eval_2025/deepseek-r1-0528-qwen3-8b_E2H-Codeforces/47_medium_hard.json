    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized. If there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n Observation:\n Let d = (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b (constant). Then note that the two numbers are (a+k) and (b+k) and their difference is fixed (a-b). The LCM of two numbers x and y is |x*y| / GCD(x,y). Since x-y is fixed, we can use the following:\n\n Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then note that g must divide the difference (a-b). So g divides |a-b|. Therefore, g must be a divisor of |a-b|.\n\n Also, note that the two numbers are (a+k) and (b+k). We can write:\n   Let d = a-b (could be positive or negative, but we can take absolute value for divisors).\n\n Then, we can consider k such that (a+k) and (b+k) have a common divisor g (which divides |a-b|). In fact, we require that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k), so it must divide (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b.\n\n Moreover, note that when k increases, the two numbers increase by 1 each time. However, the LCM is not monotonic. But we can relate k to the divisors of |a-b|.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider: \n   Let d = a-b (without loss of generality, we can assume a>=b? Actually, we can let d = a-b, then the two numbers become (a+k) and (b+k) = (a+k) and (a+k-d). \n\n Then, the condition for having a common divisor g is that g divides d. Then, we require that k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g, which is equivalent to k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-a+d) mod g, and since g divides d, then d mod g is 0, so the congruences are consistent if and only if g divides d.\n\n So, for a divisor g of |d| (if d=0, then we handle separately), we can set k0 to be the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) is divisible by g. That k0 is: \n   k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g   [but note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0]\n\n However, note: we are looking for k that makes both (a+k) and (b+k) divisible by g. Since g divides d, then (a+k) divisible by g implies (b+k) divisible by g (because (a+k) - (b+k)=d is divisible by g). So we only need one condition.\n\n Now, note that the LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). But in our case, the gcd(x,y) is at least g, and we can also note that the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized when the numbers are as close as possible? Not exactly, because we are taking LCM, but note that LCM(x,y) = (x*y)/gcd(x,y). \n\n However, we can also think: what is the minimal LCM? We know that the LCM must be at least max(a+k, b+k). And the minimal LCM might occur when the two numbers are as close as possible (like consecutive integers) but also the gcd might be large.\n\n But note: the problem says the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k). We can also note that the LCM is at least (a+k)*(b+k)/|a-b| (since gcd(x,y) divides |a-b|, so the gcd is at most |a-b|, and hence the LCM is at least (a+k)*(b+k)/|a-b|). However, this doesn't immediately help.\n\n Another idea: the problem is symmetric in the sense that we can consider k from 0 to |a-b| (and beyond)? Actually, note that the difference between the two numbers is fixed (a-b). The LCM of two numbers with fixed difference is minimized when the two numbers are consecutive? Not necessarily. For example, when the two numbers are consecutive, their gcd is 1, so LCM = product. But if they share a large gcd, then the LCM can be smaller.\n\n Example: (6,10): \n   k=0: (6,10) -> LCM(6,10)=30\n   k=1: (7,11) -> LCM(7,11)=77\n   k=2: (8,12) -> LCM(8,12)=24\n   k=3: (9,13) -> LCM(9,13)=117\n   k=4: (10,14) -> LCM(10,14)=70\n\n So the minimum is at k=2.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Insight: the candidate k's are the ones such that (a+k) and (b+k) have a common divisor that is a divisor of |a-b|. Moreover, the k must satisfy k ≡ (-a) mod g for some divisor g of |a-b|.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If a == b, then the two numbers are the same: a+k and a+k. Then the LCM is a+k. We want to minimize a+k, so we take k=0.\n\n 2. Let d = abs(a-b). Then, we consider all divisors of d (both positive and negative? but we are dealing with absolute divisors). Actually, we can consider positive divisors.\n\n    But note: the equation (a+k) mod g == 0, and g divides d. The divisors are positive, so we can consider all divisors of d (positive).\n\n    However, note: the condition is that g divides d, and then k must be chosen so that (a+k) is divisible by g. The smallest non-negative k for divisor g is:\n        k = (g - a % g) % g\n\n    But wait: we require that (a+k) % g == 0. Then k should be the smallest non-negative solution to k ≡ (-a) mod g.\n\n    Similarly, we can consider the divisors of d (all divisors, positive and negative? Actually, the divisors we consider are the divisors of d, and the gcd is always positive, so we take positive divisors.\n\n    However, note: the divisors of d are the positive divisors (and negative, but gcd is positive, so we only consider positive divisors).\n\n 3. But note: what if d=0? Then we already handled a==b.\n\n 4. Now, for each divisor g of d, we compute k0 = (g - a % g) % g. Then, we can compute the LCM for (a+k0) and (b+k0) and compare.\n\n However, note: the divisor g must divide both (a+k0) and (b+k0). But we know that (a+k0) is divisible by g, and since (a+k0) - (b+k0)=d is divisible by g, then (b+k0) is divisible by g.\n\n 5. But wait: is k0 the only candidate? Actually, for a fixed divisor g, the k must be such that (a+k) is divisible by g. The smallest non-negative k is k0. But note: the problem requires the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. However, we are iterating over divisors and computing k0 for each divisor. Then, we are going to compare the LCM at these k0's.\n\n 6. But note: the LCM is defined for positive integers, and k0 is non-negative.\n\n However, note: the problem says that there might be multiple k giving the same minimal LCM, then we choose the smallest k. Our method for each divisor gives a candidate k0, but note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors? Then we have to avoid duplicates? Or we can just compute the LCM for each candidate and then choose the minimal LCM and then the smallest k.\n\n 7. But wait: are these the only candidates? Actually, we must consider that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) is actually a divisor of d, but note that the gcd might be any divisor of d (or even a divisor of d that is not necessarily the one we considered). However, note that if g is a divisor of d, then the gcd might be any divisor of d, but we are considering every divisor. Also, note that the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k) must divide d, so the candidate k's are exactly those k that make (a+k) divisible by some divisor of d.\n\n However, is that sufficient? Consider: if the gcd is g, then g divides d, and k must be chosen so that (a+k) is divisible by g. So the candidate k's are the k's that are solutions to k ≡ (-a) mod g for some divisor g of d. Therefore, we are covering all possibilities.\n\n 8. But note: the divisors of d (positive) are many. However, d can be up to 10^9, and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable (around 10000 divisors worst-case).\n\n 9. Steps:\n\n    - If a == b: print 0.\n    - Else:\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        Find all divisors of d (positive).\n        Initialize:\n            best_lcm = None\n            best_k = None\n\n        For each divisor g in divisors (including 1 and d):\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g   # This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0.\n\n            But note: k0 might be 0, and that's acceptable.\n\n            Then, we compute:\n                x = a + k0\n                y = b + k0\n                current_gcd = gcd(x, y)   # Note: the gcd should be at least g, but actually it might be a multiple of g? Wait, no: we fixed that g divides d and we set k0 so that g divides x (and hence y). But the gcd might be larger than g. However, note: the gcd must divide d, and the gcd might be a divisor of d that is a multiple of g? Actually, no: g is a divisor of d, but the gcd might be any divisor of d. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we will also consider the gcd itself and possibly larger divisors? \n\n            But wait: if we fix g, then we get a candidate k0. Then the actual gcd for (x,y) might be a divisor of d that is a multiple of g (if g is a divisor, then the gcd could be any divisor that divides both x and y, and note that x and y are multiples of g, so the gcd is at least g). However, the LCM is (x * y) / gcd(x,y). \n\n            We cannot assume that the gcd is exactly g. But note: we are not required to know the exact gcd to compute the LCM, we can compute gcd(x,y) easily.\n\n            However, we are iterating over divisors, and we are generating candidate k0's for each divisor. But note: the same k0 might appear for different divisors. We don't care about duplicates because we are going to record (k0, LCM) and then pick the minimal LCM and then the smallest k0.\n\n        But wait: is it possible that a candidate k0 generated by a divisor g does not yield the minimal LCM? No, because the condition is necessary: the gcd must divide d, so the candidate k's are the ones that make the gcd at least a divisor of d. However, we are generating k0's that are minimal for each divisor. But note: there might be a k that is not generated by a divisor g (i.e., the gcd might be a divisor that we did not consider because we only considered divisors of d) but wait, the gcd must divide d, so we are covering all divisors.\n\n        However, note: the gcd might be a divisor of d, but we are generating k0 for every divisor. But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. We don't need to worry, because we are comparing the LCM and k0.\n\n        But wait: is it possible that a divisor g1 and g2 (both divisors) lead to the same k0? Then we are computing the same (a+k0, b+k0) twice. But that's okay.\n\n 10. However, note: the above method only considers k0 that are the minimal non-negative solutions for each divisor. But note: the LCM function is not linear and we are only checking one k per divisor. But is it safe to assume that the minimal LCM for a fixed divisor g occurs at k0? \n\n     Yes, because for a fixed divisor g, we require that (a+k) is divisible by g. The smallest k0 is the smallest non-negative k satisfying that. Then, the numbers (a+k0) and (b+k0) are the smallest we can get for that divisor. However, note that the LCM might be lower if we use a larger divisor (i.e., a multiple of g) but we are iterating over all divisors.\n\n 11. But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. We can use a set to record the k0's we've already seen to avoid redundant calculations? Or we can just compute the LCM for each candidate and then update the best.\n\n 12. However, note: there might be k values that are not generated by any divisor? Actually, no: the condition is that the gcd must divide d, so the candidate k must be such that there exists a divisor g (of d) that divides (a+k). So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n 13. But wait: what about k=0? It is covered by the divisor g=1 (always) because 1 divides everything.\n\n 14. However, note: the divisors of d include 1 and d. So k0 for divisor 1 is (1 - a%1)%1. But modulo 1: a % 1 is 0, so k0 = (1-0)%1 = 1%1=0. So k0=0 is generated by divisor 1.\n\n 15. But note: the problem says that k must be non-negative. Our k0 is non-negative.\n\n 16. But wait: what if d is very large? We have to factorize d (which is up to 10^9) and then iterate over all divisors. Factorizing a number up to 10^9 is acceptable in Python if done efficiently (with trial division up to sqrt(d)).\n\n 17. Implementation for divisors:\n\n        def get_divisors(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return []   # but d>0 because we handled a==b\n            divisors = set()\n            i = 1\n            while i*i <= n:\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    divisors.add(i)\n                    divisors.add(n//i)\n                i += 1\n            return divisors\n\n 18. Then, we do:\n\n        if a == b:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        d = abs(a-b)\n        divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n        best_k = None\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for g in divisors:\n            # k0 is the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0\n            # But note: if g is 0, skip, but d>=1 so g>=1.\n            # How to compute k0: we require (a+k0) mod g == 0.\n            # k0 = (-a) mod g, but we want non-negative.\n            # k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g\n            # However, if a % g == 0, then k0=0.\n\n            # But note: if g > a, then a % g = a, so k0 = (g - a) % g. But (g - a) is positive because g>a, so k0 = g - a, which is positive.\n\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n\n            # Now, we must check: is k0 the smallest non-negative solution? Yes.\n\n            # However, note: k0 is non-negative and the smallest.\n\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n\n            # Compute gcd of x and y. But note: since g divides d, and d divides (a-b), then g divides (a-b) so (a-b) % g == 0, and we have set k0 so that x % g == 0 and y % g == 0 (because y = x - d, and d % g ==0). But the gcd might be greater than g.\n\n            # We compute the gcd of x and y. But note: the gcd must divide d, so it is one of the divisors we are iterating. But we don't need that.\n\n            g_val = math.gcd(x, y)\n            # But note: the LCM formula: lcm(x,y) = (x * y) // g_val\n\n            # However, x and y can be very large (up to 10^9 + k0, and k0 can be up to g, which is <= d, so still within 10^9*2). The product might be up to 10^18, which is acceptable in Python for integers, but we have to be cautious.\n\n            # But note: the LCM might be huge, but we are only comparing. We can use integer arithmetic.\n\n            current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n\n            # But note: if we have two candidates with the same current_lcm, we choose the smallest k0.\n\n            if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                # Actually, we want to record the k0 and the current_lcm. But note: we are iterating and we want the minimal LCM and then the smallest k0.\n                # However, we are updating best_lcm and best_k. But if we find a candidate with the same LCM and a smaller k0, then we update.\n\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k0\n\n            # But wait: what if we have two divisors giving the same k0? Then we compute the same (x,y) and same LCM. So we don't need to worry.\n\n        print(best_k)\n\n 19. But wait: are we missing candidates? Consider k=0 is included (from divisor 1). What about k's that are not the minimal for a divisor? \n\n     Note: the problem says to choose the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. However, we are only checking k0 (the minimal k for divisor g). But is it possible that a larger k (for the same divisor g) leads to a smaller LCM? \n\n     Example: consider divisor g, and k0 is the minimal k. Then we have two numbers (a+k0) and (b+k0). If we take k = k0 + t*g (t>=1), then the two numbers become (a+k0+t*g) and (b+k0+t*g). The gcd of these two numbers is at least g, but might be larger. The LCM is ( (a+k0+t*g) * (b+k0+t*g) ) / gcd(...). \n\n     However, note that the product (a+k0+t*g)*(b+k0+t*g) is increasing with t (since a+k0+t*g and b+k0+t*g are increasing). The denominator (gcd) might also increase, but the LCM is generally increasing as t increases. Why?\n\n     Because the product increases, and the gcd might increase but not enough to compensate for the product. \n\n     However, we must be cautious: sometimes the LCM might decrease? \n\n     Example: Let a=6, b=10, and consider divisor g=4 (which divides d=4). Then k0 = (4 - 6%4) %4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then the numbers are (8,12) and LCM=24.\n\n     Now, next candidate for g=4: k=2+4=6. Then numbers are (12,16). LCM(12,16)=48, which is larger.\n\n     Similarly, for divisor g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0. Then numbers are (6,10) -> LCM=30.\n\n     So it seems that the minimal k (k0) for a divisor g gives the minimal LCM for that divisor.\n\n 20. But wait: consider another example. Suppose we have a=10, b=15, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n        divisor g=1: k0 = (1-10%1)%1 -> 0, then numbers (10,15): LCM=30.\n        divisor g=5: k0 = (5-10%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0, then same.\n\n        Now, what about k=5? Then numbers (15,20): LCM=60.\n\n        But wait, divisor g=5 also gives k0=0, and then k=5 is not the minimal k for divisor 5, but note: the gcd of (15,20) is 5, so k=5 is generated by divisor 5? Actually, yes: for divisor 5, the condition is that (10+k) %5==0. k=5: 10+5=15 -> 15%5==0, so k=5 is a solution for divisor 5. But our method for divisor 5 gives the minimal k (which is 0). However, we are not considering k=5 in our iteration because we only consider the minimal k for divisor 5.\n\n        But note: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So if k=0 gives LCM=30 and k=5 gives LCM=60 (which is worse), then we don't care.\n\n        However, what if we have a candidate k0 for divisor g, but there is a larger k (for the same divisor) that gives a smaller LCM? \n\n        Example: \n          a=5, b=10 -> d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n          k0 for divisor 1: (1-5%1)%1=0 -> (5,10): LCM=10.\n          k0 for divisor 5: (5-5%5)%5=0 -> same.\n\n          But consider k=5 for divisor 1: (10,15) -> LCM=30 (worse). \n          k=5 for divisor 5: (10,15) -> LCM=30 (worse).\n\n        Now, consider a different example: \n          a=4, b=10, d=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n          divisor 1: k0=0 -> (4,10): LCM=20.\n          divisor 2: k0=(2-4%2)%2= (2-0)%2=0 -> same.\n          divisor 3: k0=(3-4%3)%3=(3-1)%3=2 -> (6,12): LCM=12.\n          divisor 6: k0=(6-4%6)%6=(6-4)%6=2 -> same.\n\n          Now, is there a k that is not 0 or 2 that gives a smaller LCM? \n          k=1: (5,11) -> LCM=55\n          k=3: (7,13) -> LCM=91\n          k=4: (8,14) -> LCM=56\n          k=5: (9,15) -> LCM=45\n\n          So the minimal LCM is 12 at k=2.\n\n        Now, consider if we had a divisor g, and we found k0, but then a larger k for the same divisor might give a lower LCM? \n\n        Example: \n          a=1, b=3, d=2. Divisors: 1,2.\n\n          divisor 1: k0=0 -> (1,3): LCM=3.\n          divisor 2: k0=(2-1%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> (2,4): LCM=4.\n\n          Now, k=2: (3,5): LCM=15 -> worse.\n\n        But wait: what if we take k=3 for divisor 1? (4,6): LCM=12 -> worse.\n\n        Another example: \n          a=2, b=5, d=3. Divisors: 1,3.\n\n          divisor 1: k0=0 -> (2,5): LCM=10.\n          divisor 3: k0=(3-2%3)%3=(3-2)%3=1 -> (3,6): LCM=6.\n\n          Then k=4: (6,9): LCM=18 -> worse.\n\n        It seems that the minimal LCM for a divisor g is achieved at k0 (the minimal k). Why? Because the product (a+k)(b+k) is minimized when k is as small as possible (since the numbers are increasing). However, the LCM is (product)/gcd, and the gcd might change. But note: the gcd might be larger for a larger k, but the product is growing quadratically. \n\n        However, let me try:\n\n          a=1, b=2, d=1. Divisors: [1]\n\n          k0=0: (1,2): LCM=2.\n          k=1: (2,3): LCM=6 -> worse.\n\n        Now, a=2, b=4, d=2. Divisors: 1,2.\n\n          divisor1: k0=0 -> (2,4): LCM=4.\n          divisor2: k0= (2-2%2)%2=0 -> same.\n\n        But wait, consider a=9, b=15, d=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n          divisor1: k0=0 -> (9,15): LCM=45.\n          divisor2: k0= (2-9%2)%2=(2-1)%2=1 -> (10,16): LCM=80.\n          divisor3: k0= (3-9%3)%3=0 -> same as divisor1.\n          divisor6: k0= (6-9%6)%6=(6-3)%6=3 -> (12,18): LCM=36.\n\n          Now, k=3 gives 36, which is better than 45.\n\n          Now, what if we take k=6 for divisor3? (15,21): LCM=105 -> worse.\n\n        So the minimal k for divisor6 (k0=3) gives the minimal LCM for that divisor.\n\n        Why? Because the numbers (a+k) and (b+k) are increasing, and the gcd might change arbitrarily. But note: the LCM for a fixed divisor g is computed at k0, and for larger k (same divisor) the numbers are larger and the product is larger. The gcd might be larger (so the denominator is larger) but the product grows faster. \n\n        However, note: the gcd might be a divisor of d (which is fixed) so the gcd cannot exceed d. But the product is (a+k)(b+k) which is quadratic, so the LCM is roughly (a+k)(b+k)/g. And as k increases, the numerator increases without bound, so the LCM for a fixed divisor g will eventually increase.\n\n        Therefore, for a fixed divisor g, the minimal LCM occurs at the minimal k (k0). \n\n        BUT: wait, what if the gcd changes to a divisor h (that is also a divisor of d) that is larger than g? Then the LCM might be (a+k)(b+k)/h, which is smaller than (a+k)(b+k)/g. However, note that k is fixed by the divisor g. But if we use a different divisor (larger one) then we get a different k0.\n\n        So we are already considering all divisors, and for each divisor we get a candidate k0 and the corresponding LCM. \n\n        However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. But that's okay because we are storing the best LCM and the smallest k.\n\n 21. But wait: is it possible that a k that is not generated by any divisor (i.e., the gcd is a divisor of d, but we didn't consider it because we only considered divisors that are factors of d, and the gcd must be a divisor of d, so we are covering all possibilities) is not generated? \n\n        We are generating k0 for every divisor g of d. Then, the set of k0's is the set of minimal non-negative k's such that (a+k) is divisible by some divisor g of d. \n\n        However, note: the condition for the gcd to be a divisor g of d is that g divides (a+k). But the gcd might be a divisor that is not necessarily the one we used to generate k0. But note: if the gcd is h (a divisor of d), then k must satisfy (a+k) divisible by h. Therefore, k0 for divisor h is the minimal k. But we are iterating over all divisors (including h). So we are generating k0 for h, and that k0 is the minimal k that makes the gcd divisible by h (at least). \n\n        But note: the gcd might be a divisor h that is not necessarily the one we started with (we are using the divisor to set the condition). However, the condition for the gcd being h is that h divides (a+k) and h divides (b+k). We are setting k0 so that (a+k0) is divisible by h (and hence (b+k0) is divisible by h). Then, the gcd might be a multiple of h (but note: the gcd must divide d, and h divides d, so the gcd is a divisor of d and must be at least h). \n\n        However, we are not forcing the gcd to be exactly h. But note: the LCM is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). We are computing the actual gcd (by math.gcd) and then the LCM. So it's correct.\n\n 22. However, note: the problem constraints: a, b can be up to 10^9. We are factorizing d (which is up to 10^9) and then for each divisor we do a gcd computation (which is O(log(n))). The number of divisors is about 1344 (worst-case for numbers near 10^9). \n\n        But wait: the LCM computation: (a+k0)*(b+k0) might be very large (around (10^9 + divisor)^2, which is 10^18, and that is acceptable in Python because Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the multiplication and division might be heavy for 1344 divisors? \n\n        However, 1344 * (time for gcd and one multiplication) is acceptable.\n\n 23. But wait: what if a and b are very large and d is large? The divisors of d are many, but note that d = |a-b|, so if a and b are 10^9 apart, then d is 10^9, and the number of divisors is about 1344 (as above). \n\n        However, worst-case d might be highly composite, like 735134400 which has 1344 divisors. \n\n 24. But note: we must consider the case when d=0 (handled) and also note: the divisor g might be negative? No, we are taking positive divisors.\n\n 25. There's one more issue: the divisor g might be 0? But d>=1, so divisors are positive and >=1.\n\n 26. However, note: what if d is 1? Then divisors=[1]. Then k0=0.\n\n 27. But wait: what if a and b are very close? The above method works.\n\n 28. But wait: what if a and b are swapped? Our derivation uses d = abs(a-b). Then the divisors are the divisors of d. But note: the gcd condition is the same.\n\n 29. However, note: the above method does not consider k values beyond the divisors? But we argued that the minimal k for a divisor gives the minimal LCM for that divisor, and we are iterating over all divisors.\n\n 30. But wait: what if the minimal k overall is not generated by any divisor? \n\n        We argued that the gcd must divide d, so the condition for the gcd to be a divisor of d is necessary. Therefore, the candidate k must be such that there exists a divisor g of d that divides (a+k). \n\n        Therefore, we are covering all k that can possibly yield the minimal LCM.\n\n 31. But wait: what if the minimal LCM is achieved at a k that does not make the gcd a divisor of d? Then we would miss it. However, the gcd must divide d (because the gcd divides the difference). So the condition is necessary.\n\n 32. Therefore, the plan is:\n\n        if a == b: print(0)\n        else:\n            d = abs(a-b)\n            divisors = all positive divisors of d\n            best_k = None\n            best_lcm = None\n            for each divisor g in divisors:\n                k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n                x = a + k0\n                y = b + k0\n                g_val = gcd(x, y)   # This gcd divides d, so it is one of the divisors (but we don't know, but we compute it)\n                current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n                update best_lcm and best_k accordingly.\n\n            print(best_k)\n\n 33. However, wait: what if the divisor g is not the gcd? Then we are computing the actual gcd (which might be larger) and then the LCM. That is correct.\n\n 34. But note: the LCM formula: LCM(x,y) = (x*y)//gcd(x,y) is correct.\n\n 35. But wait: the example above (a=6, b=10) gave d=4, divisors=[1,2,4]. \n\n        divisor1: k0=0 -> (6,10): gcd=2, LCM= (6*10)//2 = 30.\n        divisor2: k0=0 -> same as divisor1? Actually, divisor2: (2-6%2)%2= (2-0)%2=0 -> same k0=0, so same calculation.\n        divisor4: k0=(4-6%4)%4=(4-2)%4=2 -> (8,12): gcd(8,12)=4, LCM=(8*12)//4=24.\n\n        Then we choose k0=2.\n\n 36. But wait, why did divisor1 and divisor2 give the same k0? Because 6%2=0, so k0=0 for divisor2. But note: divisor1 and divisor2 are different, but they both require the same condition? Actually, the condition for divisor1 is trivial (any k is acceptable because 1 divides everything). But the minimal k for divisor1 is 0. Similarly, for divisor2, the minimal k is 0 because 6 is divisible by 2.\n\n        However, note: we are not forced to use the divisor to generate k0, but the condition is: we want the smallest k such that (a+k) is divisible by g. For g=1, we don't need any adjustment (k0=0). For g=2, we don't need any adjustment (k0=0). For g=4, we need k0=2.\n\n 37. But note: the divisor g must be a divisor of d. In our example, d=4, so divisors are 1,2,4.\n\n 38. However, there is an alternative: we can also consider divisors that are not necessarily the gcd, but we are already doing that.\n\n 39. But wait: the divisor g must divide d, and the condition for the gcd is that it divides d, so we are covering.\n\n 40. However, note: the above method might be inefficient if d is very large (with many divisors) but worst-case is 1344 divisors, which is acceptable.\n\n ",
