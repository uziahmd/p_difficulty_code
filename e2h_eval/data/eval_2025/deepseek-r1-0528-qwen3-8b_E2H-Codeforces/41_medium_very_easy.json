There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Since n, m, and h are at most 50, we can use a dynamic programming approach that considers the restrictions and the fact that the profit is the sum of squares.\n\n However, note that the restrictions are given as intervals [l_i, r_i] with maximum height x_i. We have to satisfy all restrictions.\n\n Idea:\n We can try to assign heights to each spot, but the state space might be too high if we consider the actual height (from 0 to h) for each spot.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Observation: The profit function is separable (each house's profit is its own square). However, the restrictions couple the houses in intervals.\n\n We can use DP that goes over the spots from left to right, and keep track of the current height and the active restrictions that must be satisfied by the remaining houses.\n\n But note: There are multiple restrictions, and a restriction applies to an interval. We need to ensure that for every restriction [l, r] with maximum x, the maximum height in that interval is <= x.\n\n Since n, m, and h are small (<=50), we can try to use state = (current index, last k restrictions that are still active) but that might be too many.\n\n Another idea: since the restrictions are independent and the condition is that the entire interval has height <= x, we can think of the problem as having constraints on contiguous segments.\n\n However, note: the restrictions are not necessarily disjoint. So we have to remember for each spot what is the minimum maximum height that must be enforced from the restrictions that cover this spot and extend to the right.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each position i, the set of restrictions that cover it, and then the condition for the entire street is that for each restriction j, the maximum height in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j.\n\n But how to enforce? We can combine the restrictions: for each position i, let the maximum allowed height at i be the minimum x_j among all restrictions that include i? Not exactly, because the same restriction might require that the entire segment has height <= x_j, so even if a house at i is not the maximum in its segment, the segment might have a higher house elsewhere. However, note: if we set a house at i to a value, then we must ensure that in every restriction that includes i, the maximum height in that restriction's interval is <= x_j. But if we set the house at i to a value greater than x_j, then that restriction is violated. So actually, for each house i, the height must be <= the minimum x_j of all restrictions that include i.\n\n However, wait: consider two restrictions: one [1,3] with x=2, and another [2,4] with x=3. Then house 2 is included in both. The maximum allowed at house 2 cannot exceed min(2,3)=2? Actually no: the first restriction requires that the entire [1,3] (including house2) is <=2, so yes. But what if the restriction [1,3] with x=2 and [2,4] with x=3: then house2 must be <=2 because of the first restriction.\n\n However, note: the second restriction only requires that the entire [2,4] is <=3. But if house2 is 2, then house3 must be <=2 (from the first restriction) and house4 must be <=2 (because the first restriction doesn't cover house4, but the second restriction requires house4<=3). But wait: the first restriction does not require anything about house4. However, the second restriction requires house4<=3.\n\n So the above reasoning is correct: for each house i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_j such that the restriction j covers i.\n\n But wait: what if two restrictions do not cover the same house? Then we don't impose any direct constraint from the other restriction on that house. However, the restriction's requirement is that the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has height <= x_j. Therefore, if a house i is in restriction j, then house i must be <= x_j. Conversely, if a house i is not in a restriction j, then that restriction j doesn't constrain house i.\n\n However, there is a catch: the same restriction j constrains an entire interval. So even if we set a house i to a value, we must ensure that in the entire interval of a restriction j that contains i, no house exceeds x_j. But note: the condition is that the tallest house in the interval must be <= x_j. Therefore, if we set a house i to a value v, then we must make sure that no house in the interval [l_j, r_j] (which includes i) is > x_j. However, if we set house i to v and v <= x_j, but later we set a house in the same interval to a value larger than x_j, then the restriction is broken.\n\n Therefore, the initial idea of setting each house i to at most min_{j covering i} x_j is necessary but not sufficient. Why? Because we must also ensure that within the entire interval of a restriction j, no house exceeds x_j. However, if we set every house i to at most min_{j covering i} x_j, then for a given restriction j, the maximum house in [l_j, r_j] would be at most max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} (min_{k covering i} x_k). But note: the restriction j requires that the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. However, we set each house i to at most x_j (if j covers i) and also by definition the min_{k covering i} x_k is <= x_j (since j covers i). But what if there is another restriction k that covers i and has x_k < x_j? Then the house i is set to at most x_k (which is < x_j) and that is fine. However, in the interval [l_j, r_j], we might have a house that is constrained by a different restriction (with a lower x) and that house is set to that lower x, which is <= x_j. So the entire interval [l_j, r_j] would have houses at most the minimum x over all restrictions covering each house, and then the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is the maximum of these minima, which might be less than or equal to x_j? Actually, we require that the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has maximum <= x_j. But note: the house in [l_j, r_j] that is constrained by a restriction k (which has x_k <= x_j) is set to at most x_k (<=x_j). However, what if the house is constrained by a restriction k that does not cover the entire interval? \n\n Let me reframe: We have two types of constraints:\n 1. For each house i, the height must be at most the minimum x_j for which the restriction j covers i.\n 2. Additionally, for each restriction j, the entire interval [l_j, r_j] must have maximum <= x_j.\n\n Condition 1 is necessary because if a house i is in restriction j, then if we set it above x_j, condition 2 is violated. But condition 2 might impose additional constraints: even if a house i is not covered by a restriction j, we might set it arbitrarily (but up to h) but then if we set a house in the interval [l_j, r_j] to a value above x_j, then condition 2 is violated.\n\n However, note: the restriction j requires that the entire interval [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. Therefore, for every house i in [l_j, r_j], the height must be <= x_j. This is equivalent to saying: for each house i in [l_j, r_j], the height is at most x_j. But wait: if we set the house i to a value above x_j, then condition 2 is broken. Therefore, condition 2 is equivalent to: for each house i in [l_j, r_j], the height must be <= x_j.\n\n Now, note that if a house i is covered by multiple restrictions, then the effective maximum for that house is the minimum x_j of all restrictions that cover i. However, condition 2 for each restriction j that covers i requires the house i to be <= x_j, so the overall constraint for house i is the minimum x_j over all restrictions j that cover i. And for a restriction j that does not cover i, we don't care about i's height. But condition 2 for restriction j requires that every house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j, and if i is in [l_j, r_j] then we already have i<=x_j (by condition 1 if j covers i, or by condition 2 if we enforce that separately). \n\n However, the key point is: condition 2 is enforced by condition 1 if we consider all restrictions that cover i. But wait: what if a house i is not covered by any restriction? Then condition 1 gives no upper bound (we can set it to h). But condition 2: there might be a restriction j that does not cover i, but if i is in [l_j, r_j]? Actually, no: condition 2 says that if i is in [l_j, r_j] then the house i must be <= x_j. But if we define the constraint for house i as the minimum x_j for which the restriction j covers i, then if i is in [l_j, r_j] but j is not listed as covering i (by our initial definition) then we did not account for it. \n\n Actually, we defined \"cover i\" as the restriction j has l_j<=i<=r_j. So condition 2 for each restriction j requires that every i in [l_j, r_j] satisfies the house i <= x_j. Therefore, the constraint for house i is the minimum x_j over all j such that [l_j, r_j] contains i.\n\n So we can compute for each house i:\n   max_allowed[i] = min{ x_j | j such that l_j <= i <= r_j } \n   If there is no restriction covering i, then we set max_allowed[i] = h (since the only constraint is the global h).\n\n Then, we can set each house i to any integer between 0 and min(max_allowed[i], h). But note: the problem says the maximum height is h, so we cannot exceed h. However, if max_allowed[i] is less than h, then we are limited by max_allowed[i]. So effectively, the constraint for house i is min(h, min_{j covering i} x_j).\n\n Now, is that sufficient? Consider two restrictions: one [1,3] with x=2, and [2,4] with x=3. Then for house1: only restriction [1,3] -> max_allowed[1]=2. House2: both restrictions -> max_allowed[2]=min(2,3)=2. House3: [1,3] -> 2. House4: [2,4] -> 3. Then we set house4 to 3, but wait: the restriction [2,4] requires that house4<=3, and we set it to 3, which is okay. However, what if we set house3 to 2 and house4 to 3? Then the entire interval [2,4] has maximum 3, which is okay. But what if we set house3 to 3? Then the first restriction [1,3] would require that house3<=2, so we cannot set house3 to 3. So our constraint for house3 is 2. \n\n However, now consider: what if we have a restriction [1,3] with x=2 and [1,4] with x=1. Then house1: min(2,1)=1, house2: min(2,1)=1, house3: min(2,1)=1, house4: 1 (from [1,4]). Then we set all houses to 1. But what if we set house1 to 1, house2 to 1, house3 to 1, house4 to 1: then the restriction [1,3] is satisfied (max=1<=2) and [1,4] is satisfied (max=1<=1). \n\n Now, is it always optimal to set each house i to min(h, min_{j covering i} x_j)? \n\n Let's test with the example: \n Example 1: Input \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n   n=3, h=3, m=3\n   Restrictions: \n        [1,1] with x=1 -> house1: min(1) = 1\n        [2,2] with x=3 -> house2: min(3)=3\n        [3,3] with x=2 -> house3: min(2)=2\n\n   Then we set house1=1, house2=3, house3=2 -> profit 1+9+4=14.\n\n Example 2: Input \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n   n=4, h=10, m=2\n   Restrictions:\n        [2,3] with x=8 -> house2: min(8)=8; house3: min(8)=8\n        [3,4] with x=7 -> house3: min(8,7)=7; house4: min(7)=7\n\n   Then we set house1: no restriction -> 10 (global h)\n        house2: 8\n        house3: 7\n        house4: 7\n   Profit: 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n But wait: the example output is 262.\n\n However, consider: is it always optimal to set the house to the maximum allowed (min(h, min_{covering} x))? \n\n The profit is the sum of squares. The square function is convex and increasing for nonnegative numbers. Therefore, to maximize the profit we want to set each house as high as possible. And the constraint for house i is that it must be <= min(h, min_{covering} x). So indeed, the optimal for house i is to set it to min(h, min_{covering} x) (if we ignore the interactions between restrictions). But wait: what if two restrictions interact? \n\n Example: \n   Suppose we have two restrictions: [1,2] with x=1, and [2,3] with x=2. Then for house2, the constraint is min(1,2)=1. \n   If we set house2 to 1, then house1 and house2 are 1, and house3 can be set to 2 (because the second restriction allows up to 2 and the first doesn't cover house3). \n   But what if we set house2 to 1? Then the profit is 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 1+1+4=6.\n\n   What if we set house2 to 0? Then house1=1, house2=0, house3=2 -> profit 1+0+4=5 -> worse.\n\n   However, is there a way to set house2 to more than 1? No, because the first restriction forces house2<=1.\n\n   But note: the first restriction says the entire [1,2] must be <=1. So if we set house2 to 1, then house1 must be <=1 and house2<=1, and house3 is independent (except for the second restriction). \n\n   Now, what if we set house2 to 1 and house1 to 1, and house3 to 2: that's valid.\n\n   However, what if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 1? Then we get 0+1+4=5, which is worse.\n\n   So the greedy assignment (each house set to the maximum allowed) is optimal for that house, and the restrictions are independent per house? \n\n   But wait: consider a more complex scenario. Suppose we have two restrictions that overlap and we are forced to set a house to a low value because of one restriction, but then the next house is constrained by a different restriction. The above method sets each house independently to the maximum allowed by the restrictions covering it (and h). Since the profit function is separable and convex, and the constraints are independent per house (the constraint for house i is just an upper bound), then the optimal solution is to set each house to the maximum allowed.\n\n   Why? Because if we set a house i to less than the maximum allowed, we are missing out on the profit. And the constraints do not couple the houses in a way that forces us to reduce a house's height for the benefit of others. Each restriction is about the entire interval, but we are breaking down the constraint per house: the house i must be <= the minimum x_j of covering restrictions. And the condition that the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has maximum <= x_j is automatically satisfied if each house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j (because the maximum of the interval is the maximum of the individual houses). \n\n   Therefore, we can solve the problem by:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute for each house i (from 1 to n) the minimum x_j among all restrictions j that cover i. If there is no restriction covering i, then the constraint is h.\n\n   Step 2: For each house i, set its height to min(h, constraint_i). Then the profit is the sum of squares of these heights.\n\n   However, wait: in the example above, we set house i to the maximum allowed. But what if we set house i to a value lower than the maximum allowed? Then the profit would be less. So to maximize the profit, we set each house to the maximum allowed.\n\n   But wait: is that always true? Consider if the restrictions force a lower maximum in the entire interval, but maybe we can set some houses to lower values to allow others to be higher? \n\n   Example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=5\n\n        Then the constraint for house1 and house2 is 5. Then we set both to 5, profit=5^2+5^2=50.\n\n        Now, what if we set house1 to 10 and house2 to 0? Then the entire interval [1,2] has maximum 10, which violates the restriction (must be <=5). So we cannot do that.\n\n   Therefore, the constraint is global for the entire interval. But note: the constraint per house is the minimum x_j for covering restrictions. In this case, the constraint for house1 is 5 (from the restriction [1,2]) and for house2 is 5. So we set both to 5.\n\n   Now, consider: what if we have two restrictions that are conflicting? \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x=5\n\n        Then house1:5, house2:5 -> profit 50.\n\n   Now, what if we have:\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1] with x=10\n\n        Then house1: min(5,10)=5, house2: min(5)=5 -> profit 50.\n\n   But wait, the second restriction [1,1] doesn't cover house2. The first restriction [1,2] requires house1 and house2 <=5. The second restriction [1,1] requires house1<=10, but the first restriction is tighter.\n\n   However, note: the first restriction is [1,2] with x=5. That means house1 and house2 must be <=5. The second restriction [1,1] with x=10 is redundant for house1 (because 5<10) and doesn't constrain house2.\n\n   Therefore, the method of computing the constraint for each house i as the minimum x_j of all restrictions j that cover i, and then setting the house to that constraint (if the constraint is less than h, otherwise h) is valid.\n\n   But wait: what if we have overlapping restrictions with different x?\n        Example: \n            n=3, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n            Restriction2: [1,2] with x=8\n\n        Then:\n            house1: min(5,8)=5\n            house2: min(5,8)=5\n            house3: min(5)=5\n\n        Profit: 5^2+5^2+5^2=75.\n\n        But note: the second restriction [1,2] only requires that the maximum in [1,2] is <=8. But we set house1 and house2 to 5, which is <=8. The first restriction requires the entire [1,3] is <=5. So house3 must be <=5, which we set.\n\n        However, what if we set house1 to 5, house2 to 8, house3 to 5? \n            Then the first restriction: [1,3] has max(5,8,5)=8 -> violates the first restriction (which requires <=5). \n\n        So we cannot set house2 to 8. The constraint for house2 is min(5,8)=5, so we must set house2 to 5.\n\n   Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read n, h, m.\n   2. Initialize an array `constraints` of length n+1 (indexed 1 to n) with a large number (or h+1) for the minimum x.\n   3. For each of the m restrictions (l, r, x):\n          For each house i from l to r:\n              constraints[i] = min(constraints[i], x)\n\n   4. Then, for each house i from 1 to n:\n          actual_height = min(constraints[i], h)\n          profit += actual_height * actual_height\n\n   5. Print the profit.\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Constraints array initially: [inf, inf, inf] (for indices 0-indexed we'll ignore index0, so for 1 to 3: [inf, inf, inf])\n\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=1 -> update house1: min(inf,1)=1.\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x=3 -> update house2: min(inf,3)=3.\n        Restriction3: [3,3] with x=2 -> update house3: min(inf,2)=2.\n\n        Then set house1=min(1,3)=1, house2=min(3,3)=3, house3=min(2,3)=2.\n        Profit = 1^2+3^2+2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Constraints array: [inf, inf, inf, inf] for houses 1 to 4.\n\n        Restriction1: [2,3] with x=8 -> update houses 2 and 3: \n             house2: min(inf,8)=8\n             house3: min(inf,8)=8\n        Restriction2: [3,4] with x=7 -> update houses 3 and 4:\n             house3: min(8,7)=7\n             house4: min(inf,7)=7\n\n        Then set:\n            house1: min(inf,10)=10\n            house2: min(8,10)=8\n            house3: min(7,10)=7\n            house4: min(7,10)=7\n        Profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   However, wait: the example input was given as two lines: \n        \"4 10 2\"\n        \"2 3 8\"\n        \"3 4 7\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple restrictions that cover the same house? We are taking the minimum x, so that's correct.\n\n   However, consider the following: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=3\n\n        Then house1: min(5,3)=3, house2: min(5,3)=3 -> profit=3^2+3^2=18.\n\n        But if we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 3, then the first restriction [1,2] is satisfied (max=3<=5) and the second restriction [1,2] is satisfied (max=3<=3). \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the restrictions are inconsistent? For example, two restrictions that say the same interval must have max <= a and max <= b, but a and b are different. Then we take the minimum. And that's the tightest constraint.\n\n   However, what if we have two restrictions that are not on the same interval but their constraints conflict via the houses? \n        Example: \n            n=3, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n            Restriction2: [2,3] with x=3\n\n        Then:\n            house1: min(5)=5\n            house2: min(5,3)=3\n            house3: min(3)=3\n\n        Then the entire [1,2]: max(5,3)=5 -> okay (<=5). [2,3]: max(3,3)=3 -> okay.\n\n        But note: house1 is set to 5, which is okay for the first restriction, and house2 is set to 3, which is okay for both. \n\n   This seems correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have two restrictions that do not cover the same house but together they constrain adjacent houses? \n        Example: \n            n=3, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n            Restriction2: [3,3] with x=3\n\n        Then house1:5, house2: no restriction ->10, house3:3.\n\n        Now, check the restrictions: \n            Restriction1: house1=5 <=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: house3=3<=3 -> ok.\n\n        But note: there is no restriction that constrains house2. So we set it to 10, which is the global maximum.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is simple.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the maximum height in each spot is h. So we must not exceed h. Our method sets the house to min(constraint, h). \n\n   But what if a constraint (min of the restrictions) is greater than h? Then we set the house to h. But the constraint is the minimum x_j of the covering restrictions, and x_j is between 0 and h. So the constraint (minimum x_j) is at most h. Therefore, min(constraint, h) is just constraint (if constraint<=h) or h (if constraint>h). But note: x_j is in [0, h], so constraint (being the minimum of x_j) is at most h. So we don't need to worry about constraint>h. \n\n   However, if there is no restriction, then we set to h. \n\n   But wait: what if there is a restriction with x_j > h? The problem states: \"0<=x_i<=h\", so x_j is at most h. Therefore, the constraint for a house is at most h.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply set each house i to the constraint (the minimum x_j for covering restrictions) and then take min(constraint, h) is redundant because constraint is at most h.\n\n   However, we can keep the code as:\n\n        constraints[i] = min_{j covering i} x_j   (if no restriction, then we set constraints[i] = h)\n\n   But wait: if there is no restriction, then we set constraints[i] to h. But the problem says the house can be at most h. So if we set constraints[i] to h, then the house is set to h. \n\n   Alternatively, we can initialize constraints[i] to h+1, then after processing, set it to min(constraints[i], h). But since constraints[i] is the minimum of x_j (which are <=h) and we are taking min(..., h) at the end, we can do:\n\n        constraints[i] = min(constraints[i], h)\n\n   But note: if there is no restriction, we want the house to be set to h. So:\n\n        Step 1: Initialize constraints[i] = a big number (like 10**9) for each house i from 1 to n.\n\n        Step 2: For each restriction (l, r, x): for i from l to r, constraints[i] = min(constraints[i], x)\n\n        Step 3: For each house i, set height = min(constraints[i], h)   [But note: if constraints[i] is the big number, then min(bignum, h)=h]\n\n   Alternatively, we can initialize constraints[i] = h+1, then do the min, then at the end set to min(constraints[i], h). But then if we get a constraint x_j that is h+1, we set to h. But x_j is at most h, so we can skip that.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        constraints = [10**9]*(n+1)   # for indices 1 to n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for i in range(l-1, r):   # if we use 0-indexing for the array\n                if constraints[i] > x:\n                    constraints[i] = x\n\n        Then, for i in range(n):\n            if constraints[i] == 10**9:\n                # meaning no restriction, so set to h\n                height = h\n            else:\n                height = constraints[i]\n\n        But wait, the above loop for the restriction: we are updating from l-1 to r-1 (if we use 0-indexed array). But note: the problem labels from 1 to n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use 1-indexed indexing for the constraints array.\n\n        Let's do 1-indexed:\n\n        constraints = [10**9] * (n+1)   # index from 0 to n; we use 1..n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n                if constraints[i] > x:\n                    constraints[i] = x\n\n        Then, profit = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            height = constraints[i]   # but if no restriction, constraints[i] is 10**9, but then we must set to h?\n            if constraints[i] == 10**9:\n                height = h\n            else:\n                height = constraints[i]\n            profit += height * height\n\n        But wait: if we update with x (which is at most h) and then set to h if no restriction, then we are good.\n\n   However, we can simplify: since the constraints are at most h, and if we never update a house then we set it to h. But note: if we update a house with an x that is less than or equal to h, then we don't need to set it to h. \n\n   But note: the problem says the maximum height is h, so even if there is no restriction, we cannot exceed h.\n\n   However, the above method sets a house to the minimum x_j (which is <=h) if there is a restriction, and to h if there isn't. This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if a house is covered by a restriction with x_j = 10, but h=5? Then we set the house to min(10,5)=5. However, our method above does not do that. \n\n   Correction: We must set the house to min(constraint, h). But note: the constraint (the minimum x_j) might be greater than h? But the problem says x_i is between 0 and h, so no. But wait: what if we have a restriction with x_i=h, then the house is set to h. But if we have a restriction with x_i>h? The problem says x_i<=h, so we are safe.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"0<=x_i<=h\", so x_i cannot be greater than h.\n\n   Therefore, we don't have to take min(constraint, h) because constraint is <= h. So we can simply set:\n\n        constraints[i] = min(constraint, h)   -> but we already know constraint<=h, so it's the same.\n\n   But wait: what if we initialize with 10**9 and then update with x_i (which is <=h) then the constraint is <=h. Then we set the house to constraint (which is <=h). \n\n   However, if there is no restriction, we set to h. So we have two cases: \n        Case 1: There is at least one restriction: then constraint <= h, and we set to constraint.\n        Case 2: No restriction: set to h.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the maximum height is h, so even if there is a restriction with x_i = h, we can set the house to h. And if there is no restriction, we can set the house to h. \n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        constraints = [10**9] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed: index 0 unused, 1..n used\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n                if constraints[i] > x_val:\n                    constraints[i] = x_val\n\n        total_profit = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            if constraints[i] == 10**9:\n                # no restriction, use h\n                height = h\n            else:\n                height = constraints[i]\n            total_profit += height * height\n\n        print(total_profit)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        constraints = [10**9]*4\n\n        Process first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> update index1: 10**9->1\n        Process second: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> update index2: 10**9->3\n        Process third: l=3, r=3, x=2 -> update index3: 10**9->2\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: height=1 -> 1\n            i=2: height=3 -> 9\n            i=3: height=2 -> 4\n            total_profit=14\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        constraints = [10**9]*5\n\n        First restriction: [2,3] with x=8 -> update index2:8, index3:8\n        Second restriction: [3,4] with x=7 -> update index3: min(8,7)=7, index4:7\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: no restriction -> 10 -> 100\n            i=2: 8 -> 64\n            i=3: 7 -> 49\n            i=4: 7 -> 49\n            total_profit=100+64+49+49=262\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, wait: what if the same house is updated by multiple restrictions? We are doing a for-loop for each restriction. We are updating each house i in [l, r] with the minimum x. \n\n   But note: we are updating by iterating over the restrictions and for each house in the interval, we set constraints[i] to the minimum between the current constraint[i] and x. So if we have two restrictions: one with x=5 and then one with x=3, we will update to 3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the restrictions must be satisfied. This method ensures that for each house i,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to certain zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints specify that the tallest house in certain intervals must not exceed a given height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction requires that the maximum height in a specified interval does not exceed a given value. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive (smallest) value among all restrictions that include that house. This is because any house within a restriction's interval must not exceed the restriction's specified height. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Initialization**: We start by initializing an array to keep track of the minimum allowable height for each house. Initially, each house can be built up to the global maximum height `h`.\n   - **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, we update the allowable heights for all houses within its interval to the minimum of their current allowable height and the restriction's specified height.\n   - **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, we calculate the profit by summing the squares of the allowable heights for each house. If no restriction applies to a house, its height is set to the global maximum `h`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction and updates the allowable heights for all houses in its interval. Given that the number of restrictions `m` and the number of houses `n` are both up to 50, the total operations are manageable (O(m * n)), making the solution efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    h_global = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    constraints = [10**9] * (n + 1)\n    \n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index + 1])\n        x_val = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if constraints[i] > x_val:\n                constraints[i] = x_val\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if constraints[i] == 10**9:\n            height = h_global\n        else:\n            height = constraints[i]\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are the number of houses `n`, the global maximum height `h_global`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `constraints` is initialized with a large value (10^9) for each house, indicating no restrictions initially.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the `constraints` array for all houses within the specified interval `[l, r]` to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's height `x_val`.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the allowable heights for each house. If a house has no restrictions, its height is set to `h_global`.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures all restrictions are met while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the square function and careful constraint handling.",
