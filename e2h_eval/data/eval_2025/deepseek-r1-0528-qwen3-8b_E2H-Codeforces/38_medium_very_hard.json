    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000). We need to:\n 1. Find the minimum number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with n nodes that is p-reachable.\n    - Definition: A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable (i.e., they form a strongly connected component).\n\n 2. Among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, there's a path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Observation for part 1:\n\n Let the graph have n nodes. The condition for being p-reachable is that the graph has exactly p pairs (u, v) with u < v that are in the same strongly connected component.\n\n Note: In a directed graph, we can decompose it into strongly connected components (SCCs). However, the problem does not require the entire graph to be strongly connected. But note: the definition counts only the pairs (u, v) with u < v that are mutually reachable.\n\n We can think of the graph as having several SCCs. The mutual reachability within an SCC of size k gives exactly C(k,2) = k*(k-1)//2 pairs (since every two distinct nodes are mutually reachable). However, note the definition: \"there exists a path from u to v and from v to u\", so indeed within an SCC, every two distinct nodes form a pair (u,v) with u<v (and also v<u, but we count only u<v). \n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly p\" such pairs. So if we have multiple SCCs, then the total number of pairs is the sum over each SCC of C(size_i, 2). However, note that the graph must be built with minimum n (nodes). Also, we are allowed to have edges arbitrarily? But we are counting unidirectional pairs and we want to maximize the unidirectional pairs for the same n.\n\n However, note: the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs (for the given p). So we need to choose a set of SCCs (each being a complete directed graph? or any strongly connected graph) such that the sum of C(size_i,2) for all SCCs is p, and we use the minimum total nodes.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have multiple SCCs? Actually, the entire graph is built arbitrarily. However, the condition is that the graph has exactly p pairs (u, v) with u<v that are mutually reachable. This means that the entire graph can have multiple SCCs, but the total number of pairs (u, v) (with u<v) that are in the same SCC is p.\n\n Now, how to minimize the number of nodes? We want to represent p as the sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number T_k = k*(k-1)//2) and the total nodes is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs. However, we cannot break a node: each node must belong to exactly one SCC.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have isolated nodes? Then an isolated node does not contribute to any mutual pair. However, if we have an isolated node, then we can put multiple isolated nodes together to form an SCC? Actually, no: an SCC must be maximal. But the problem doesn't specify the entire graph must be strongly connected. So we can have multiple SCCs.\n\n However, note: the condition is about pairs (u, v) with u < v. We are free to assign edges arbitrarily as long as the mutual reachability condition holds.\n\n But here's the catch: the graph must be built with the minimum number of nodes. How do we build a graph with exactly p mutual pairs?\n\n We can use a set of complete directed graphs (each edge in both directions) for each SCC. Then the number of mutual pairs in an SCC of size k is T_k = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n Then the problem reduces to: represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each at most as large as the maximum we can get from the minimal node set). However, we are free to choose the triangular numbers arbitrarily (nonnegative integers) and the total nodes is the sum of the k_i (the sizes of the SCCs). But note: we don't require to use all nodes in SCCs? Actually, we can have nodes that are not in any mutual pair (isolated nodes) but then they don't contribute to p. However, including an isolated node would add an extra node without contributing to p, so we don't want that because we are minimizing the total nodes.\n\n Therefore, we want to decompose p as a sum of triangular numbers (without exceeding the total node constraint) and minimize the total nodes.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we want to form a set of SCCs (complete directed graphs) of sizes k_1, k_2, ..., k_m such that:\n   Sum_{i} [k_i*(k_i-1)//2] = p\n   And we want to minimize the total nodes: n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m.\n\n But note: we can also have an SCC of size 1? Then T_1 = 0. Similarly, an SCC of size 2: T_2=1, size3:3, etc.\n\n However, we can also use a graph that is not necessarily a disjoint union of complete directed graphs. But note: if we have two nodes in an SCC, then we must have two edges (each direction). But the problem doesn't specify the graph structure beyond the mutual reachability. However, to minimize the total nodes, we want to pack as many mutual pairs as possible in a small number of nodes.\n\n Since the mutual pairs are defined by the SCCs, we can consider that the graph is partitioned into SCCs (each being strongly connected). Then the condition is satisfied.\n\n So the problem becomes: represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each T_k for k>=1, and T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=3, ...) and minimize the total nodes (which is the sum of k_i). Note that we can use the same k multiple times.\n\n However, we are allowed to have multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n But note: we can also use an SCC of size k that is not complete? Actually, to get T_k mutual pairs, we need the entire complete directed graph? Actually, no: any strongly connected graph on k nodes has at least k mutual pairs? Actually, the minimal number of edges for an SCC of size k is k (a cycle). Then the number of mutual pairs is still k*(k-1)//2? \n\n Wait, no: the definition of mutual reachability is independent of the edges. If the SCC is strongly connected, then every two distinct nodes are mutually reachable. So the number of mutual pairs is always T_k. So we can assume that we use complete directed graphs (or any strongly connected graph) for the SCCs.\n\n However, note: the entire graph might have more edges. But the condition for p is only the mutual pairs (within the same SCC). The rest of the graph (edges between SCCs) don't create mutual pairs (if there's an edge from u to v and u and v are in different SCCs, then they are not mutually reachable). So we can ignore the edges between SCCs for the p condition.\n\n Now, the problem is: find nonnegative integers k_1, k_2, ... such that \n   T(k_1) + T(k_2) + ... = p, \n   where T(k) = k*(k-1)//2, and we want to minimize n = k_1 + k_2 + ...\n\n But note: we can use k=1 (which gives 0) arbitrarily. However, using k=1 doesn't help to reduce the total nodes because we are just adding a node that doesn't contribute to p. So we want to avoid using k=1 unless necessary? Actually, we don't need to use k=1 because we can adjust the other k_i to make up the remainder.\n\n However, there is a known greedy way to represent a number as a sum of triangular numbers? Actually, we can use dynamic programming, but p can be up to 200000.\n\n Alternatively, note that the triangular numbers grow quadratically. We can try to use as many large triangular numbers as possible.\n\n But observe: the triangular numbers are T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, T(5)=10, ... \n\n We can also note: the minimal representation (minimizing the total nodes) for a given p is achieved by using as large triangular numbers as possible (because a larger k gives more pairs per node). \n\n However, let's compare:\n   Using one SCC of size k: nodes = k, pairs = T(k)\n   Using two SCCs: say k1 and k2, then we require T(k1)+T(k2)=p, and total nodes = k1+k2.\n\n But note: we can use multiple SCCs arbitrarily.\n\n We are going to use the following:\n\n   Let n be the total number of nodes. Then the maximum p we can represent with n nodes is the maximum sum of T(k_i) for which the k_i are positive integers and sum k_i <= n.\n\n How to compute the maximum p for a given n? \n   We can use the largest triangular numbers: \n        Use as many as possible of the largest k (with T(k) being as large as possible) until the remaining p is less than T(k) for the next k.\n\n But actually, we want to know: for a given p, what is the minimal n?\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the minimal n for each p from 0 to 200000.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Precompute an array dp[0..max_p] (max_p = 200000) such that dp[p] = minimal total nodes required to form p mutual pairs.\n\n  2. We know that we can use any set of SCCs. The triangular numbers available are T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, T(5)=10, ... until the triangular number is <= p.\n\n  3. We can use dynamic programming:\n\n        dp[0] = 0\n\n        Then, for each triangular number t (for k from 2 upwards: t = k*(k-1)//2), we can update:\n\n            for j from t to max_p:\n                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n        But note: we can use the same k multiple times.\n\n        However, the triangular numbers are increasing and we can use unlimited supply. But the triangular numbers are not contiguous and the same k can be used repeatedly.\n\n        But wait: the same k (same SCC size) can be used multiple times. So we have an unbounded knapsack.\n\n        However, the triangular numbers are distinct and we are allowed to use each k (each triangular number) as many times as we want.\n\n        But note: the triangular number T(k) is defined for k>=1 (with T(1)=0, so we skip k=1 because it doesn't help). We start from k=2.\n\n        However, including k=1 (which gives T(1)=0) doesn't change the state, so we can ignore.\n\n        But note: we can also use k=0? No, k>=1. And k=1 gives 0.\n\n        But we can also use an SCC of size 1 arbitrarily (it doesn't use any edge and doesn't contribute to p). So we can use k=1 to fill the gap? Actually, we don't need to because if we have a remainder r (0<=r<next_triangular) then we can use an SCC of size 2 if r==1, but if we have an odd remainder? Actually, we have to use the triangular numbers.\n\n        However, note: the triangular numbers are not complete modulo anything. But we can use the standard coin change (unbounded) for the triangular numbers.\n\n        But the triangular numbers are not canonical? We have to use the minimal nodes.\n\n        Example: p=1 -> we use k=2 (nodes=2). p=2 -> we cannot use a single SCC (because T(2)=1, T(3)=3) so we use two SCCs of size 2: 2+2=4 nodes? But wait, we can also use two nodes (two separate SCCs of size 2) to get 1+1=2 mutual pairs, so nodes=4. Alternatively, is there a way to get 2 mutual pairs with fewer nodes?\n\n        Actually, we can use one SCC of size 3: T(3)=3, which is too big. Or two SCCs of size 2: 1+1=2. But what if we use one SCC of size 3 and then remove one edge? Then the SCC of size 3 would break? Actually, we must have the entire SCC as a strongly connected component. So we cannot break an SCC.\n\n        So the representation must be as a sum of triangular numbers.\n\n        For p=2: minimal nodes = 4.\n\n        But wait, consider: we have 3 nodes. Can we form 2 mutual pairs? \n            We can have one SCC of size 3: that gives 3 mutual pairs (too many). \n            Or two SCCs: one of size 2 (which gives 1) and one of size 1 (0). Then total mutual pairs=1, not 2.\n            Or one SCC of size 2 and one SCC of size 2? Then we have two SCCs of size 2: that uses 4 nodes and gives 2 mutual pairs.\n\n        So minimal nodes for p=2 is 4.\n\n        Similarly, p=3: we can use one SCC of size 3 (nodes=3) -> 3 mutual pairs. So minimal nodes=3.\n\n        p=4: we can use one SCC of size 3 (3 pairs) and one SCC of size 2 (1 pair): total 4, nodes=3+2=5. \n              Or two SCCs of size 3: 3+3=6 -> too many. Or four SCCs of size 2: 1*4=4, nodes=8. \n              Or one SCC of size 4: T(4)=6 -> too many. \n              So minimal nodes=5.\n\n        However, wait: we can have two SCCs of size 3? Then we get 3+3=6, which is too much. Alternatively, we can have one SCC of size 3 and one of size 2: 3+1=4. \n\n        So the minimal nodes for p=4 is 5.\n\n        Now, we need to compute dp for p from 0 to 200000.\n\n        The triangular numbers we need: k from 2 to ? \n\n        The triangular numbers: T(2)=1, T(3)=3, T(4)=6, T(5)=10, ... \n\n        The maximum k such that T(k) <= 200000: \n            k*(k-1)//2 <= 200000 -> k^2 ~ 400000 -> k ~ 632 (approx). So we'll generate all triangular numbers for k from 2 to 632.\n\n        Then use unbounded knapsack for p from 0 to 200000.\n\n        However, note: the state p goes up to 200000, and the number of coins (triangular numbers) is about 630, so the DP would be O(max_p * number_of_triangular_numbers) which is 200000*630 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline. But note: the triangular numbers are increasing and we can use a different order? Actually, we can iterate over the triangular numbers and update the dp array in a forward manner.\n\n        Steps for DP:\n\n            dp[0] = 0\n            Let coins = sorted list of triangular numbers (for k from 2 to about 632) [1, 3, 6, 10, ...]\n\n            Then for each t in coins:\n                for j from t to max_p:\n                    if dp[j-t] is not infinity, then dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)   # but wait, we are storing the node count, and the coin t corresponds to an SCC of size k (so node count k).\n\n            However, note: we are iterating by the value of the triangular number, but we need to know which k (node count) corresponds to t. Alternatively, we can store the list of (t, k) and then update with k.\n\n        But note: we can use the same triangular number multiple times.\n\n        However, the above DP will work because we are doing unbounded knapsack.\n\n        But note: the triangular numbers are distinct and we are allowed to use the same k multiple times, so we can use the same coin multiple times.\n\n        But wait: we have multiple coins? Actually, we have one coin for each k (from 2 to 632). Each coin has value t = T(k) and weight k.\n\n        We want to minimize the total weight (number of nodes) for a given total value (p).\n\n        So the recurrence is:\n\n            dp[0] = 0\n            for j from 1 to max_p: initially dp[j] = a big number (or infinity)\n\n            for each k from 2 to max_k:\n                t = k*(k-1)//2\n                for j from t to max_p:\n                    if dp[j-t] != inf:\n                        dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n        Then, we can answer the first part: for input p, output dp[p] (if dp[p] is computed) and then proceed to the second part.\n\n        However, note: we can also use the same k multiple times, so we are doing a classic unbounded knapsack. But the above loop (for each k, then update from t to max_p) is the standard way for unbounded knapsack.\n\n        But wait: what if we use two different k's? Then we must iterate over all k's and update the whole array. The above loop does that.\n\n        However, the problem: we are only allowed to use SCCs (each with node count k) and the total node count is the sum of the k's.\n\n        But note: the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs. And the mutual pairs come from the SCCs.\n\n        This DP will give us the minimal total nodes for p mutual pairs.\n\n        But wait: is this correct? Consider p=2. We have:\n            k=2: t=1, then we update dp[1]=2.\n            Then for k=3: t=3, which is >2, so we skip.\n\n            Then we need to update dp[2]: from dp[2-1] (dp[1]) = 2, so dp[2] = dp[1] + 2 (but wait, we are using two SCCs of size 2: so we are using two coins of k=2) but our update for k=2 was done only once. \n\n        Actually, in the standard unbounded knapsack, we should iterate over the coins and then for each coin, iterate from t to max_p. This will allow using the same coin multiple times.\n\n        However, in the above code, we are iterating k from 2 to max_k, and for each k we update the entire dp array from t to max_p. This is the standard way for unbounded knapsack (each item can be used multiple times). \n\n        But note: the coin for k=2 (value=1, weight=2) is used twice for p=2: \n            First, we update dp[1] = 2 (using one k=2).\n            Then, when updating for k=2 again (in the same outer loop iteration? Actually, no: we are updating for each k only once, but then the inner loop for j from t to max_p will use the updated dp[j-t] which might have been updated by the same k already? \n\n        Actually, the typical way for unbounded knapsack is to iterate the coin and then the j from coin_value to max_p. That allows using the same coin multiple times. But note: we are iterating k from 2 to max_k, and for each k we update the entire dp array. This is the \"unbounded\" version because we are allowed to use the same k multiple times (we are effectively allowing multiple uses of the same coin).\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the above loop for a fixed k updates the entire dp array for multiples of k. But note: the order of the loops (first k then j) is the standard way for unbounded knapsack.\n\n        But wait: we are missing the possibility of combining different k's? Actually, no: because we are iterating over all k's and updating the entire dp array for each k, and we are doing it in increasing order of k (which is the weight). \n\n        However, we must note that the triangular numbers are increasing with k. So the smallest triangular number is 1 (k=2) and then 3 (k=3), etc.\n\n        But the problem: the dp array is updated in increasing j, and we are processing coins in increasing order of k. This is acceptable.\n\n        But note: we must process all k's (all triangular numbers) and update the entire dp array. \n\n        However, the triangular numbers are distinct and we have about 630 coins. The total operations would be about 630 * 200000, which is 126000000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be slow. But 126e6 iterations is acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python we might need to optimize the inner loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different method: since the coins are increasing, we can break early for j that are beyond max_p.\n\n        But note: p only goes up to 200000, and we are iterating j from t to 200000 for each coin. The total operations is the sum_{k=2}^{max_k} (max_p - t + 1) which is about 630 * 200000 = 126000000. This is acceptable in Pyton if we use a compiled language, but in pure Python we might need to use efficient loops (like using list comprehensions or using PyPy, but the problem says p up to 200000, so we must handle 200000).\n\n        However, 126e6 iterations in Python might take a few seconds (each iteration is a simple min and array access). We can try to optimize by using local variables and avoiding function calls in the inner loop.\n\n        But note: we are only required to handle one input p (one query). So we can precompute dp[0..max_p] once and then answer the input.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            max_p = 200000\n            dp = [10**9]*(max_p+1)   # initialize with a big number\n            dp[0] = 0\n\n            max_k = 1\n            while max_k*(max_k-1)//2 <= max_p:\n                max_k += 1\n            max_k -= 1   # now max_k is the maximum k such that T(k)<=max_p\n\n            coins = []\n            for k in range(2, max_k+1):\n                t = k*(k-1)//2\n                if t > max_p:\n                    break\n                coins.append(t)\n\n            # But wait, we need to know the k (node count) for each coin. So we should store (t, k) for each k.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            # We'll iterate k from 2 to max_k, and for each k, we have t = k*(k-1)//2.\n\n            # Then, for each k, we update the dp array.\n\n            # However, we must use the k for the weight (node count).\n\n            # Let's do:\n\n            # dp = [a big number] * (max_p+1)\n            # dp[0] = 0\n\n            # for k in range(2, max_k+1):\n            #   t = k*(k-1)//2\n            #   if t > max_p:\n            #       break\n            #   for j in range(t, max_p+1):\n            #       if dp[j-t] != 10**9:\n            #           dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + k)\n\n            # Then, for the input p, we output dp[p] (if dp[p] is 10**9 then it's impossible, but p is at most 200000 and we have triangular numbers covering all p? Actually, we can represent all p as a sum of triangular numbers? \n\n            # But note: the triangular numbers are not complete, but we have the coin 1 (from k=2) so we can represent any p>=0? \n            #   p=0: yes (dp[0]=0)\n            #   p=1: yes (k=2)\n            #   p=2: we can use two k=2: so 1+1=2, nodes=4. But note: we don't have a triangular number for 2? So we have to use two coins of 1. Our DP will do that.\n\n            # However, the above DP uses the same k (size 2) twice. So we are allowing multiple uses of the same k.\n\n        But wait: what is the minimal node count for p=0? 0 nodes? Or we can use 0 nodes.\n\n        However, the problem: the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs. For p=0, we can have no edges and any number of nodes? But the minimal nodes is 0? Or we must have at least one node? \n\n        The problem: \"minimum number of nodes\". For p=0, we can have 0 nodes? But typically, a graph with 0 nodes has 0 mutual pairs. But the problem says \"ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) with u < v\". With 0 nodes, there are no pairs, so p=0.\n\n        However, the example input includes p=0, and the output is \"0 0\".\n\n        But note: the problem says \"among all such p-reachable graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let G denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs\". For 0 nodes, there are no edges, so 0 unidirectional pairs.\n\n        So for p=0, we output (0,0).\n\n        But our DP: dp[0]=0, which is correct.\n\n        Now, the second part: for the minimal node set n = dp[p], we need to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n        What is a unidirectional pair? An ordered pair (u, v) (u != v) such that there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n        In our graph, we have a set of SCCs and edges between them. \n\n        Within an SCC of size k, there are no unidirectional pairs (because if u and v are in the same SCC, then both directions exist). \n\n        Between two different SCCs: \n          We can have edges from one SCC to another. But note: the graph is built arbitrarily. However, we are allowed to choose the graph arbitrarily as long as the mutual pairs are exactly p (which is the sum of the triangular numbers of the SCCs). \n\n        How to maximize the unidirectional pairs?\n\n        Note: The entire graph has n nodes (the minimal n we found). We have broken the graph into SCCs (with sizes k_1, k_2, ..., k_m) such that the sum of T(k_i) is p.\n\n        Now, we can add edges arbitrarily between the SCCs, as long as we do not create any mutual reachability between two different SCCs. \n\n        However, if we have two SCCs A and B, and we add an edge from A to B, then we cannot add an edge from B to A (otherwise, they would merge). \n\n        Moreover, we can have multiple edges. But note: the definition of unidirectional pair is for ordered pairs (u, v) (u != v). \n\n        The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) (u != v) is n*(n-1). \n\n        Then, the unidirectional pairs are the pairs (u, v) that are not symmetric. \n\n        But note: the graph has some mutual pairs (exactly p) and the rest are either unidirectional or absent.\n\n        Actually, the entire graph has n*(n-1) directed edges? No, we can have arbitrary edges. But note: the mutual pairs are defined by the existence of paths. \n\n        However, we can control the edges arbitrarily (as long as we don't merge SCCs). \n\n        The key: we want to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. \n\n        Note: the unidirectional pairs are the edges that are one-way. But note: we are counting ordered pairs (u, v) (so (u,v) and (v,u) are two different pairs). \n\n        The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) (u != v) is n*(n-1).\n\n        Now, the graph is partitioned into m SCCs (say S1, S2, ..., Sm). \n\n        The mutual pairs are exactly the pairs (u, v) such that u and v are in the same SCC (and u<v, but we are counting ordered pairs in the unidirectional definition as two distinct directions). \n\n        Actually, the problem says: unidirectional pair (u, v) requires:\n            - u != v\n            - there exists a path from u to v\n            - there is no path from v to u.\n\n        And note: the mutual pairs (the p pairs) are defined by the condition: u<v and there is a path from u to v and from v to u. \n\n        But note: the unidirectional pairs are defined for ordered pairs (u, v) (so both (u,v) and (v,u) can be considered separately). \n\n        However, the entire graph is built arbitrarily. The mutual pairs (within an SCC) are fixed (we have to have the SCCs). But the edges between SCCs can be chosen arbitrarily (as long as we don't merge two SCCs). \n\n        How many unidirectional pairs can we have?\n\n        Consider two distinct SCCs, say A and B. \n          Let |A| = a, |B|=b.\n\n          We can choose edges from A to B arbitrarily (without creating a cycle between A and B) and from B to A arbitrarily, but we cannot have both (u->v and v->u) for any u in A and v in B (because then A and B would be mutually reachable).\n\n          Actually, we can have a directed acyclic graph (DAG) on the SCCs (the condensation graph) and then the edges between two SCCs can be from one to the other but not back.\n\n          Now, consider a pair (u, v) where u is in A and v is in B. \n            - There is a path from u to v if and only if we have an edge from A to B (or a path through other SCCs) but note: we are allowed to have arbitrary edges (but we don't have to use the direct edges). \n\n          However, to maximize unidirectional pairs, we should ensure that for every ordered pair (u, v) (u in A, v in B) we have a path from u to v but not from v to u. \n\n          But wait: we can have a DAG ordering of the SCCs. Suppose we fix a topological order of the SCCs (if the condensation graph is a DAG). Then for any two SCCs A and B, if A comes before B, then we can have all edges from A to B and no edges from B to A. Then for every u in A and v in B, there is a path from u to v (via the direct edges? Actually, we can set the edges arbitrarily. But note: we are allowed to set the edges arbitrarily as long as we don't create mutual reachability. \n\n          However, we can set the edges so that the condensation graph is a complete DAG: for every two distinct SCCs, we choose one direction (from the earlier to the later in the topological order). Then:\n\n            For two distinct SCCs A and B:\n                If A is before B, then we have edges from A to B (so that there is a path from any node in A to any node in B) and no edges from B to A.\n\n            Then, for a pair (u in A, v in B) (with A before B): \n                There is a path from u to v (by the direct edge or by the edges we set) and no path from v to u (because we set no edges from B to A and no other SCCs can provide a path from B to A if we maintain the topological order).\n\n            Similarly, for (u in B, v in A): \n                There is no path from u to v (because we set edges only from earlier to later, and B is after A) and there is a path from u to v? Actually, no: we set edges from B to somewhere else, but not to A. So (u in B, v in A) is not a unidirectional pair? \n\n            Actually, the definition of unidirectional pair is: \n                There exists a path from u to v, and there is no path from v to u.\n\n            For (u in B, v in A): \n                We have no path from u (in B) to v (in A) (because the condensation graph is acyclic and we have an edge from A to B, but not the reverse) and there is no requirement for a path from u to v. So (u in B, v in A) is not unidirectional because the first condition fails.\n\n            Therefore, the unidirectional pairs only occur for (u in A, v in B) when A is before B.\n\n            Then, the total unidirectional pairs from edges between SCCs is:\n\n                Sum_{i<j} [a_i * a_j]   (where a_i is the size of the i-th SCC, and we consider the SCCs ordered by the topological order) ?\n\n            But wait, if we have multiple edges? Actually, we are setting the edges arbitrarily (but we must avoid mutual reachability). The above complete DAG (with all edges from earlier to later) gives:\n\n                For every pair of nodes (u, v) such that u is in an earlier SCC and v is in a later SCC, we have a path from u to v. And for (u, v) with u in a later SCC and v in an earlier SCC, there is no path.\n\n            Therefore, the unidirectional pairs from edges between SCCs are:\n\n                For each ordered pair (A, B) of distinct SCCs (A before B), every node u in A and v in B forms an unidirectional pair (u, v).\n\n            So the total unidirectional pairs from inter-SCC edges is:\n\n                Sum_{i} [ (sum_{j: j>i} a_j) * a_i ]   (if we order the SCCs arbitrarily, but note: the topological order is fixed by the DAG? Actually, we can choose the topological order arbitrarily. To maximize the unidirectional pairs, we want to maximize the product of the sizes of the SCCs that are connected by edges.\n\n            However, note: the entire graph's unidirectional pairs also include pairs that are not covered by the inter-SCC edges? \n\n            Actually, the graph has two types of pairs:\n\n                Type 1: Within an SCC: no unidirectional pairs (because both directions exist for every pair, so the condition for unidirectional (only one direction) fails for both (u,v) and (v,u)).\n\n                Type 2: Between two different SCCs: as above, we can arrange the edges so that for every pair (u, v) with u in an earlier SCC and v in a later SCC, we have a unidirectional pair (u, v). \n\n            But note: what about pairs (u, v) that are not directly connected by an edge, but by a path through multiple SCCs? \n\n            However, in our arrangement (the complete DAG), we have set edges from every earlier SCC to every later SCC. Then the path from u (in an earlier SCC) to v (in a later SCC) is direct (if we set the direct edges) or via intermediate SCCs? Actually, we set edges from each SCC to every SCC that comes after it. Then the path from u (in A) to v (in B) is direct (if we set the direct edge from A to B) or via multiple steps? But the problem counts any path. \n\n            However, note: the definition of unidirectional pair requires the existence of a path from u to v and the absence of a path from v to u. \n\n            In our arrangement, we have set the edges so that if A is before B, then there is a path from A to B (either direct or via other SCCs). But note: we set edges from A to every SCC after A. Then the path from u (in A) to v (in B) is direct (if we set the edge from",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is exactly p-reachable, and among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) where u < v and there exists a path from u to v and from v to u (mutual reachability).\n   - The goal is to find the minimal number of nodes required to achieve exactly p such pairs. Additionally, among all graphs with this minimal node count, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (pairs where only one direction of path exists).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Mutual Reachability**: Each strongly connected component (SCC) of size k contributes \\( \\binom{k}{2} = k(k-1)/2 \\) mutual pairs.\n   - **Unidirectional Pairs**: These arise from edges between different SCCs arranged in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) order. Specifically, for any two SCCs A and B, if all edges go from A to B (and not vice versa), then every node in A paired with every node in B forms a unidirectional pair.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use an unbounded knapsack approach to compute the minimal nodes required for each possible p. The DP state tracks the minimal nodes needed to achieve a certain number of mutual pairs by summing triangular numbers (each corresponding to an SCC size).\n   - **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal node count is determined, the maximum unidirectional pairs are calculated by considering all possible pairs of nodes across different SCCs, arranged in a topological order to maximize directed edges.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Precomputation**: The DP involves processing up to 630 triangular numbers (for k up to 632) and updating a DP array of size 200,001. This results in approximately 126 million operations, which is feasible given the constraints.\n   - **Query Handling**: Each query is answered in constant time by accessing the precomputed DP array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    p = int(data[0])\n    max_p = 200000\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    dp = [10**9] * (max_p + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    max_k = 1\n    while max_k * (max_k - 1) // 2 <= max_p:\n        max_k += 1\n    max_k -= 1\n    \n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        t_val = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if t_val > max_p:\n            break\n        for j in range(t_val, max_p + 1):\n            if dp[j - t_val] != 10**9:\n                if dp[j] > dp[j - t_val] + k:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j - t_val] + k\n                    \n    n_nodes = dp[p]\n    \n    if n_nodes == 10**9:\n        print(\"Impossible\")\n        return\n        \n    total_unidirectional = 0\n    scc_sizes = []\n    temp = p\n    k_val = max_k\n    while temp > 0 and k_val >= 2:\n        t_val = k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2\n        if dp[temp] == k_val:\n            count = temp // t_val\n            scc_sizes.extend([k_val] * count)\n            temp %= t_val\n        k_val -= 1\n        \n    if temp != 0:\n        k_val = 2\n        while temp > 0:\n            t_val = k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2\n            if t_val <= temp:\n                count = temp // t_val\n                scc_sizes.extend([k_val] * count)\n                temp %= t_val\n            k_val += 1\n            \n    scc_sizes.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    total_nodes = n_nodes\n    total_unidirectional_pairs = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(scc_sizes)):\n        a = scc_sizes[i]\n        rest = total_nodes - sum(scc_sizes[:i])\n        total_unidirectional_pairs += a * rest\n        \n    print(f\"{n_nodes} {total_unidirectional_pairs}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer p, representing the number of mutual pairs required.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the solution is trivially 0 nodes and 0 unidirectional pairs.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The DP array is initialized to store the minimal nodes needed for each p from 0 to 200,000.
