Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour.\n   - After burning, we get a burned candle. We can collect these burned candles to form new ones (each new candle requires 'b' burned candles).\n\n Steps:\n   Let hours = 0\n   We start with 'a' candles.\n\n   While we have at least one candle (whether new or made from leftovers) to burn:\n     - Burn all the candles we have (which gives us as many hours as the number of candles we have in this round).\n     - Then, we get as many new candles as the floor division of total burned candles by 'b'. The leftover burned candles (if any) are carried over.\n\n   However, note that the problem can be solved by simulating the process until we don't have enough candles (both new and recycled) to burn.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a mathematical approach:\n\n   Let:\n     total_hours = 0\n     current_candles = a\n\n   But note: the example: \n        Input: 4 2 -> Output: 7\n        Input: 6 3 -> Output: 8\n\n   Another way: \n        We burn 'a' candles -> we get a hours, and then we have a burned candles. Then we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we have a % b leftover.\n\n        Then we set a = floor(a / b) [the new candles] and add the leftover to the next round? Actually, the leftover burned candles are kept.\n\n   However, note: when we burn the new candles, we also get burned candles from them. So we must account for the entire cycle.\n\n   We can simulate:\n\n        candles = a\n        burned = 0\n        total = 0\n\n        while candles > 0:\n            # Burn all current candles\n            total += candles\n            burned += candles   # because each candle burns and becomes one burned candle\n            # Now, using the burned candles, we can make new ones\n            new_candles = burned // b\n            candles = new_candles\n            burned = burned % b\n\n        Then output total.\n\n   But wait, let's test with the first example: a=4, b=2\n\n        Initially: candles = 4, burned = 0, total=0.\n\n        Iteration 1:\n            total = 4\n            burned = 4\n            new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2\n            candles = 2\n            burned = 0 (since 4 % 2 = 0)\n\n        Iteration 2:\n            total = 4+2 = 6\n            burned = 2\n            new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1\n            candles = 1\n            burned = 0\n\n        Iteration 3:\n            total = 6+1 = 7\n            burned = 1\n            new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0\n            candles = 0, so we break.\n\n        Output 7 -> matches.\n\n   Second example: a=6, b=3\n\n        Iteration 1:\n            total = 6\n            burned = 6\n            new_candles = 6//3 = 2\n            candles = 2\n            burned = 0\n\n        Iteration 2:\n            total = 6+2 = 8\n            burned = 2\n            new_candles = 2//3 = 0\n            candles = 0 -> break.\n\n        Output 8 -> matches.\n\n   However, note that we are burning the candles and then getting new ones from the burned ones. The above simulation seems correct.\n\n   But wait: in the second iteration, we only have 2 candles. We burn them (so 2 more hours) and then we get 2 burned candles. Since 2 < 3, we cannot make a new candle. So total is 8.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, consider an edge case: if b==1, then we can always make a new candle from every burned one. Then we would have an infinite loop unless we break the condition.\n\n   But the problem states: 2<=b<=1000, so we don't have to worry about b=1.\n\n   Also, note that a>=1, so we always have at least one candle.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle\", meaning that we need exactly b burned candles to make one new candle.\n\n   The above simulation uses integer floor division, which is correct.\n\n   However, the problem constraints are small (a up to 1000, b up to 1000). The simulation will run at most around log_b(a) + log_b(remaining) which is very safe.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a formula without explicit loops (using math) but the iterative method is straightforward and efficient.\n\n   Code:\n\n        Read the input line and split into two integers: a and b.\n\n        Initialize:\n            total = 0\n            current = a   # current available candles (new or recycled)\n            burned_count = 0   # we haven't burned any yet\n\n        While current > 0:\n            total += current\n            burned_count += current\n            # Now, from burned_count, we can make new_candles = burned_count // b\n            current = burned_count // b\n            burned_count = burned_count % b\n\n        Print(total)\n\n   However, note: we are updating burned_count for the next round, but the next round's current is set from the entire burned_count (from the previous burning) divided by b.\n\n   This matches the process.\n\n   But wait: what if we have burned_count from previous rounds? In the first iteration, we start with a, then we update burned_count to a, then current becomes a//b, and burned_count becomes a % b.\n\n   Then in the next iteration, we add the current (a//b) to burned_count (which was the remainder from the previous burning). So we are accumulating the burned candles from all the candles we've burned.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let me test with a=1, b=2: \n        Input: 1 2 -> Output?\n\n        We burn 1 candle -> 1 hour, then burned_count=1 -> new_candles = 0, so done. Total=1.\n\n        Example: \n            Hours: 1.\n\n        But according to the problem: \n            He has 1 candle. He burns it for 1 hour, then he has 1 burned candle. Since 1 < 2, he cannot make a new candle. So 1 hour.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Another test: a=10, b=5\n\n        Iteration1: \n            total = 10\n            burned_count = 10\n            current = 10//5 = 2\n            burned_count = 0\n\n        Iteration2:\n            total = 12\n            burned_count = 2\n            current = 2//5 = 0 -> stop.\n\n        Total=12.\n\n        Let's verify: \n            First 10 hours: burn 10 candles -> get 10 burned, then make 2 new.\n            Then burn 2 candles -> 2 hours, then get 2 burned -> cannot make a new one (since 2 < 5). Total 12.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: we are not required to store the burned_count separately for the next round? Actually, we are: because the burned_count from the previous round is the leftover that hasn't been converted to new candles, and then we add the current round's burned candles (which are the current candles we just burned) to it.\n\n   The above code does exactly that.\n\n   But note: the variable names might be confusing. We are tracking:\n        current: the number of candles we have to burn in the current round (could be initial or recycled)\n        burned_count: the total number of burned candles from all previous rounds (including the current one after burning)\n\n   However, in the code above, we update burned_count at the beginning of the loop by adding the current candles. Then we compute the next round's current from the entire burned_count.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: in the next round, we are burning the current candles (which were made from the burned_count) and then we add those to burned_count again. So we are indeed accumulating the burned candles.\n\n   However, we are modifying burned_count and then using it to compute the next current. Then we update burned_count to be the remainder from the entire burned_count (which includes the current round's burned candles).\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let me restructure the code to avoid confusion. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total = 0\n        current = a\n        while current > 0:\n            total += current\n            # The current round's burning produces 'current' burned candles\n            # Add to the total burned so far (we are going to use these to make new candles)\n            # But we don't need to keep separate burned_count beyond the fact that we can convert floor(total_burned / b) into new candles.\n\n        However, note: the burned candles from different rounds are additive.\n\n   Actually, we can combine the burned candles from all rounds. But in our simulation, we are doing:\n\n        burned_count = 0\n        current = a\n        while current > 0:\n            total += current\n            burned_count += current\n            current = burned_count // b\n            burned_count = burned_count % b\n\n   This is equivalent.\n\n   But note: we are updating burned_count at the beginning of the loop and then using it to compute the next current. However, in the next iteration, we are adding the current (which is from the previous burned_count//b) to burned_count again. This is the same as accumulating the burned candles from all the candles we've ever burned.\n\n   However, we can also think: the total burned candles after the first round is a, then after the second round is a + (a//b), etc.\n\n   But the above simulation is clear.\n\n   Let me try with a=3, b=2:\n\n        Iteration1:\n            total = 3\n            burned_count = 3\n            current = 3//2 = 1\n            burned_count = 1\n\n        Iteration2:\n            total = 4\n            burned_count = 1 + 1 = 2\n            current = 2//2 = 1\n            burned_count = 0\n\n        Iteration3:\n            total = 5\n            burned_count = 1\n            current = 1//2 = 0 -> break.\n\n        Output 5.\n\n        Let's verify:\n            Hour 1-3: burn 3 candles -> 3 hours, get 3 burned.\n            Then we make 1 new candle (because 3//2=1) and leave 1 burned.\n            Then burn the 1 new candle -> hour 4, get 1 burned, now total burned is 1 (leftover) + 1 = 2.\n            Then we make 2//2 = 1 new candle.\n            Then burn the 1 new candle -> hour 5, get 1 burned, which is less than 2, so we stop.\n\n        So 5 hours is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that Vasily can act optimally. The above simulation does exactly that.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We read the input from stdin.\n\n   Example input format: \n        ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n   But note: the input is one single line with two integers.\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but the problem says there are two integers, so we assume there are.\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n            total = 0\n            current = a\n            burned_count = 0\n\n            while current > 0:\n                total += current\n                burned_count += current\n                current = burned_count // b\n                burned_count = burned_count % b\n\n            print(total)\n\n   This should work.\n\n   However, we can optimize by noticing that the process is logarithmic and we don't need to use a loop if we use a different method, but the constraints are small.\n\n   But let me consider: worst-case a=1000, b=2. How many iterations?\n\n        Iteration 1: 1000 -> burned_count=1000, current=500, burned_count=0\n        Iteration 2: 500 -> burned_count=500, current=250, burned_count=0\n        Iteration 3: 250 -> current=125, burned_count=0\n        Iteration 4: 125 -> current=62, burned_count=1 (because 125 % 2? wait, no: in the code we do:\n            burned_count is updated by adding current, then we do current = burned_count//b and burned_count %=b.\n\n        Actually, in the first iteration, we do:\n            current = 1000\n            burned_count = 0 + 1000 = 1000\n            then current = 1000//2 = 500, and burned_count = 0 (because 1000 % 2 ==0)\n\n        Then second iteration: current=500, then burned_count=500, current=250, burned_count=0.\n\n        So we reset burned_count to 0 at every step because we are doing modulo b. But wait, what if we have an odd number?\n\n        Example: a=3, b=2: \n            First iteration: \n                current=3, burned_count=3 -> then current=3//2=1, burned_count=3%2=1.\n\n        Then second iteration: \n                current=1, then burned_count=1+1=2 -> then current=2//2=1, burned_count=0.\n\n        Then third iteration: \n                current=1, then burned_count=1 -> then current=0, so break.\n\n        So the modulo operation does accumulate the remainder from the previous rounds.\n\n        But in the even case, we reset to zero. This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above simulation is standard for this kind of problem.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   But wait, there is an alternative solution that doesn't use a loop and uses a while loop with the condition being that we have at least one candle (new or old). Our simulation is correct.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples through the code:\n\n        Example 1: 4 2 -> 7\n        Example 2: 6 3 -> 8\n\n   It works.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, considering that he can recycle burned-out candles into new ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour and produces one burned-out candle. These burned-out candles can be combined to form new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles needed to create a new candle (`b`).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: While there are candles available (either initial or recycled):\n   - **Burn Candles**: Add the current number of candles to the total hours. Each candle burns for one hour.\n   - **Recycle Burned Candles**: Calculate how many new candles can be made from the total burned candles (both initial and recycled). The number of new candles is the floor division of the total burned candles by `b`. The remaining burned candles (if any) are carried over to the next iteration.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when no more candles can be made (i.e., the remaining burned candles are insufficient to form a new candle).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles until no more candles can be produced, ensuring optimal usage of all available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total = 0\n    current = a\n    burned_count = 0\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        burned_count += current\n        current = burned_count // b\n        burned_count = burned_count % b\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (burned candles needed per new candle).\n- **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn (`current > 0`). In each iteration:\n  - **Burning Phase**: The current number of candles (`current`) is added to the total hours (`total`), simulating their burning for one hour each.\n  - **Recycling Phase**: The total burned candles (`burned_count`) is updated by adding the current candles. New candles are calculated as the integer division of `burned_count` by `b`, and the remainder becomes the leftover burned candles for the next iteration.\n- **Output**: Once no more candles can be made (loop condition fails), the total hours (`total`) is printed.\n\nThis method efficiently models the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring the maximum possible burning time by leveraging all available resources optimally.",
