    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find a non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized, and if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n Let d = (a+k) and e = (b+k). Then note that d - e = a - b (constant). Without loss of generality, assume a >= b. Then we can let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then note that g must divide (a-b). Also, we have:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / g\n\n But note: (a+k) = (b+k) + (a-b). So the difference between the two numbers is fixed (a-b). However, we can also consider symmetry: if a < b, then we can swap the roles.\n\n Alternatively, we can set x = k, and note that the two numbers are (a+x) and (b+x). The LCM of two numbers u and v is |u*v| / gcd(u,v). Since they are positive, we can write:\n\n   LCM(a+x, b+x) = (a+x)*(b+x) / gcd(a+x, b+x)\n\n We know that gcd(a+x, b+x) = gcd(a+x, (a+x)-(b+x)) = gcd(a+x, a-b). Similarly, if we set d = |a-b|, then the gcd divides d.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: for each divisor g of |a-b| (if a != b), we can set g = gcd(a+x, b+x) and then note that g must divide d = |a-b|. Moreover, for a fixed divisor g, we require that:\n   g divides (a+x) and g divides (b+x). But since g divides (a-b) and (a+x) - (b+x) = a-b, then it is sufficient to require that (a+x) mod g == 0 and (b+x) mod g == 0.\n\n But note: because g divides (a-b), then (a+x) mod g = (a mod g + x mod g) mod g, and similarly for b. However, we can also think of the condition as: x ≡ (-a) mod g and x ≡ (-b) mod g. But note that (-a) ≡ (-b) mod g? Actually, because g divides (a-b), we have a ≡ b mod g, so -a ≡ -b mod g. Thus, the condition is that x ≡ (-a) mod g (or equivalently x ≡ (-b) mod g).\n\n Then the smallest non-negative x satisfying x ≡ (-a) mod g is:\n   x0 = (-a) mod g, but note that we want non-negative. Actually, we can compute:\n   x0 = (g - a % g) % g   [but wait: we want the smallest non-negative x such that (a+x) is divisible by g, i.e., x ≡ (-a) mod g]\n\n However, note: we can write x ≡ (-a) mod g, so x = (g - (a % g)) % g? But if a % g == 0, then we get x=0. Otherwise, we get x = g - (a % g). But note: we can also have negative a mod g? We are using modulus in a non-negative way.\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n   Let r = a % g. Then we require (a+x) % g == 0 -> x ≡ (-r) mod g. The smallest non-negative x is:\n        if r == 0: then x0 = 0\n        else: x0 = g - r\n\n However, note that we are also allowed to use x that is at least 0. But note: the same divisor g must also be the gcd. Actually, the gcd might be greater than g? \n\n Important: The gcd(a+x, b+x) is actually the gcd of (a+x) and (a-b). Why? Because gcd(a+x, b+x) = gcd(a+x, a-b). And note that g (the divisor) divides (a-b). But the actual gcd may be any divisor of (a-b) that divides both (a+x) and (b+x). However, we are iterating over divisors of (a-b). For a divisor g0, we set g = g0 and then solve for x. But note: the gcd(a+x, b+x) might be a multiple of g0? Actually, no: because the gcd must divide (a-b) and we are taking g0 as a divisor of (a-b). But when we set x to be the solution for the congruence, then the gcd will be at least g0. However, it might be larger. But note: we are not forcing the gcd to be exactly g0. We are considering the condition that the gcd divides g0? Actually, we are iterating over divisors and then the actual gcd might be a multiple of g0? Let me clarify:\n\n We know that the gcd(a+x, b+x) must divide (a-b). Therefore, we can consider all divisors of (a-b). But note: the equation for x is defined by the condition that the gcd(a+x, b+x) divides (a-b). However, the minimal LCM might come from a divisor that is not necessarily the one we started with, but we are iterating over all divisors.\n\n Actually, we are going to consider each divisor g0 of |a-b| (if a==b, then we have a special case). Then we set x0(g0) to be the smallest non-negative solution to the congruence: \n        x ≡ (-a) mod g0   [which is equivalent to (a+x) ≡ 0 mod g0]\n\n Then, for this x0, the gcd(a+x0, b+x0) might be a multiple of g0. But note: the condition we have set only requires that g0 divides (a+x0) and (b+x0). The actual gcd is the gcd(a+x0, b+x0) = gcd(a+x0, a-b) [since (a+x0) - (b+x0)=a-b]. And the gcd(a+x0, a-b) might be greater than g0. However, note that we are iterating over all divisors of |a-b|, and the gcd(a+x0, a-b) is a divisor of |a-b| (so it will be considered as well). Therefore, we must consider that the same x0 might be generated by a divisor g0 and also by a divisor that is the gcd (which is larger). But we are iterating over every divisor, so we'll get the candidate x0 for each divisor. Then we can compute the LCM for each candidate x0 and take the minimum.\n\n However, note: the condition that the gcd is exactly g0 is not enforced. But we don't need to enforce that. We just need to consider that the gcd is a divisor of |a-b|. And we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If a == b, then we have two identical numbers. Then the LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k. We want to minimize a+k. The smallest k is 0, giving LCM = a (or b). So answer is 0.\n\n 2. Let d = |a-b|. Then consider all divisors of d.\n\n 3. For each divisor g0 (positive divisor) of d, we compute the smallest non-negative k (let's call it candidate_k) such that (a + candidate_k) is divisible by g0. This candidate_k is:\n        candidate_k = (g0 - a % g0) % g0   [But note: if a % g0 == 0, then candidate_k=0, else candidate_k = g0 - (a % g0)]\n\n    However, note: the condition is that (a+k) is divisible by g0, and (b+k) is automatically divisible by g0 because g0 divides (a-b) and (a-b) is the difference, and (a+k) - (b+k)=a-b, so if g0 divides (a+k) then it divides (b+k) as well.\n\n 4. But wait: what if we consider divisors that are negative? We are only considering positive divisors since divisors are positive in this context.\n\n 5. However, note: the condition above gives candidate_k for each divisor. Then we must compute the LCM for (a + candidate_k, b + candidate_k). But note: the gcd(a+candidate_k, b+candidate_k) is not necessarily g0, but we can compute it as:\n        gcd_val = gcd(a+candidate_k, b+candidate_k)\n        Then LCM = (a+candidate_k)*(b+candidate_k) // gcd_val\n\n 6. But note: the same candidate_k might appear from multiple divisors? Then we should avoid duplicate calculations? Or we can just store the candidate_k and the corresponding LCM, and then take the minimum LCM and then the smallest candidate_k.\n\n However, note: the candidate_k computed from divisor g0 is the minimal non-negative k that makes (a+k) divisible by g0. But different divisors might yield the same candidate_k? Yes, if candidate_k is a multiple of several divisors? Then we would compute the same candidate_k multiple times. To avoid redundant calculations, we can use a set for candidate_k.\n\n But note: the range of d is up to 10^9, so the number of divisors is around O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable (about 10^4.5 divisors in worst-case, which is around 10^5 divisors? Actually, worst-case for divisor count is about 1344 divisors for numbers near 10^9).\n\n However, we must be cautious: we are iterating over divisors, and for each divisor we do a modulus operation and then a gcd computation (which is logarithmic). The total operations would be about O(divisor_count * log(min(a,b))) which is acceptable.\n\n 7. But wait: is candidate_k always the best k for divisor g0? What if there is a smaller k that is not generated by any divisor? \n\n Let me think: note that the condition for the gcd is that it must divide (a-b). Therefore, the gcd must be one of the divisors of (a-b). However, the condition for k is that the gcd must be a divisor of (a-b). But note: the minimal LCM might be achieved by a k that does not necessarily make (a+k) divisible by a divisor of (a-b)? \n\n Actually, note: the gcd(a+k, b+k) must divide (a-b). So the gcd is a divisor of (a-b). Therefore, the condition we are iterating over (all divisors) covers all possibilities.\n\n However, note: the minimal k that minimizes the LCM might not necessarily be one that makes (a+k) divisible by a divisor of (a-b). But wait: we are forced to have that the gcd divides (a-b). Therefore, the condition is necessary. But note: the gcd might be a divisor of (a-b) and that divisor must divide (a+k) and (b+k). Therefore, k must be chosen such that (a+k) is divisible by the gcd. And the gcd is a divisor of (a-b). So k must be chosen so that (a+k) is divisible by at least one divisor of (a-b). But note: we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. We don't want to compute the same k multiple times. So we can use a set to record the candidate_k values.\n\n 8. Algorithm:\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        exit()\n\n    d = abs(a-b)\n    Find all divisors of d.\n\n    candidates = set()\n    For each divisor g0 (positive) of d:\n        k0 = (g0 - a % g0) % g0   # This gives the smallest non-negative k0 such that (a+k0) is divisible by g0.\n        candidates.add(k0)\n\n    Now, we have candidate_k values. But note: we must also consider k=0? Actually, we are including all divisors, and if g0 is a divisor, then k0 is computed. However, note that k0 might be 0 even if g0 is not 1? Actually, if a is divisible by g0 then k0=0.\n\n    But wait: what if we consider the divisor g0=1? Then k0 = (1 - a%1) % 1. But note: a % 1 is 0, so k0=0. So k0=0 is included.\n\n    However, note: the problem might have multiple k that lead to the same LCM. We are to choose the smallest k.\n\n    Now, we must also note: the minimal k might not necessarily come from a divisor of d? Actually, we argued that the gcd must divide d, so the condition is necessary. But is that true for the minimal k? \n\n    Let me reexamine: the gcd(a+k, b+k) must divide (a-b). So for the k we choose, the gcd is a divisor of (a-b). Therefore, the condition on k is that (a+k) must be divisible by the gcd, and the gcd is a divisor of (a-b). But note: we are iterating over all divisors, so we are generating all k that make (a+k) divisible by at least one divisor of (a-b). However, is it possible that the minimal LCM is achieved by a k that is not making (a+k) divisible by any divisor of (a-b)? \n\n    No, because then the gcd would not divide (a-b) (contradiction). Therefore, we must consider only these k.\n\n    However, note: the LCM formula: LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / gcd(a+k, b+k). And the gcd(a+k, b+k) divides (a-b). So the gcd is one of the divisors we are iterating over.\n\n    Therefore, we are covering all possibilities.\n\n 9. But wait: what about k that are not generated by any divisor? They would have a gcd that is not a divisor of (a-b) -> but that's impossible. So we are safe.\n\n 10. However, note: the above method generates candidate_k for each divisor. But what if there is a divisor g0 that is very large? Then k0 = g0 - (a % g0) might be very large. But note: we are only interested in the minimal LCM and then the minimal k. We have to consider all divisors.\n\n 11. There is an alternative: sometimes k might be negative? But k>=0. And our candidate_k is non-negative.\n\n 12. But note: the problem says \"non-negative integer k\". So k>=0.\n\n 13. Now, we must compute for each candidate_k (from the set) the value of LCM(a+k, b+k). Then we choose the candidate_k that minimizes the LCM, and if there are multiple, the smallest candidate_k.\n\n    However, note: the set of candidate_k might be large (number of divisors). But the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)) which is acceptable for d up to 10^9 (worst-case about 10^5 divisors? Actually, the worst-case divisor count for numbers up to 10^9 is around 1344, so we can do it).\n\n 14. But wait: is it efficient to compute the gcd for each candidate_k? The gcd computation is logarithmic in the size of the numbers (which are up to 10^9 + candidate_k). candidate_k can be as large as the divisor (which is up to 10^9). So the numbers we are computing gcd for are up to 2e9, and the gcd algorithm is O(log(min(a+k, b+k))) which is about 30 steps. So total operations: about 1344 * 30, which is acceptable.\n\n 15. However, note: we must factorize d to get all divisors. How to factorize d (up to 10^9)? We can do trial division up to sqrt(d) (which is about 31622). Then generate divisors. Then for each divisor, compute candidate_k and then the LCM.\n\n 16. But wait: there is a catch. The divisor g0 must be a divisor of d, but note that the condition for candidate_k is that (a+k) is divisible by g0. However, note that the gcd(a+k, b+k) is not necessarily g0. It is the gcd(a+k, a-b) (which is at least g0, but could be larger). Therefore, the LCM might be smaller if we use a larger divisor? \n\n    Example: Let a=6, b=10, then d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n    For g0=1: candidate_k0 = (1-6%1)%1 -> 0 (since 6%1=0). Then numbers: (6,10). gcd(6,10)=2, so LCM=30.\n\n    For g0=2: candidate_k1 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0. Then numbers: (6,10). Same as above.\n\n    For g0=4: candidate_k2 = (4-6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then numbers: (8,12). gcd(8,12)=4, LCM=24.\n\n    So the minimal LCM is 24, and k=2.\n\n    But note: we also have to consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. In this example, k=0 was generated by divisors 1 and 2. Then we compute the LCM for k=0 and k=2. \n\n 17. However, note: we are storing candidate_k in a set, so we avoid duplicate k.\n\n 18. But wait: are there other k that we haven't considered? For example, k=1: \n        (7,11): gcd(7,11)=1, LCM=77 -> worse than 24.\n        k=2: 24, k=3: (9,13) -> gcd=1, LCM=117; k=4: (10,14): gcd=2, LCM=70 -> worse than 24.\n\n    So k=2 is the best.\n\n 19. However, note: the above approach only considers k that are the minimal solution for each divisor. But what if there is a k that is not the minimal solution for any divisor? \n\n    Let me clarify: the condition for the gcd is that it must divide (a-b). Then for the k we choose, let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then g divides (a-b). Therefore, k must satisfy (a+k) mod g = 0. But note: the minimal k that satisfies (a+k) mod g = 0 is the one we computed (the smallest non-negative). However, we are also allowed to use a larger k? \n\n    Example: for g0=4 in the example, we got k=2. But k=6 is also a solution for g0=4: (6+6)=12 divisible by 4. Then we should consider k=6? \n\n    However, note: the LCM for k=6: (12,16) -> gcd=4, LCM=48, which is worse than 24. Similarly, k=2 is better.\n\n    But wait: is it possible that a larger k gives a smaller LCM? \n\n    Consider: We have two numbers (a+k) and (b+k). The LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k, b+k). Note that (a+k)*(b+k) increases as k increases. However, the denominator (gcd) also increases (if the gcd increases) then the LCM might decrease. But note: the gcd cannot exceed min(a+k, b+k). \n\n    However, note that the gcd is bounded by (a-b) (the divisor). Actually, the gcd must divide (a-b). Therefore, the gcd is at most (a-b) (unless a-b=0, but we handled that). \n\n    But note: the gcd might be larger than the divisor we are using? Actually, no: we are iterating over divisors of (a-b). The gcd must divide (a-b), so the gcd is one of the divisors. Therefore, the gcd cannot exceed (a-b). \n\n    However, note: the divisor we are using (g0) is a divisor of (a-b). The gcd might be a multiple of g0? No, because the gcd divides (a-b) and g0 is a divisor, but the gcd is the gcd of (a+k) and (a-b). It is possible that the gcd is a multiple of g0? Actually, no: the gcd is a divisor of (a-b). But note: we are using g0 as a divisor, and the gcd might be any divisor of (a-b). \n\n    But note: our candidate_k is generated for each divisor. However, we are not generating all k that make the gcd equal to any divisor. We are generating the minimal k for each divisor. Then we must consider that the same divisor might be the gcd or a multiple? Actually, the gcd is the gcd of (a+k) and (a-b). It is the greatest common divisor. It might be that the gcd is a divisor of (a-b) and we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering the possibility.\n\n    However, note: the minimal k for a divisor g0 might not yield the gcd being g0. For example, in the example above, k0=0 for divisor 2, but the gcd was 2 (so it matched). But for divisor 4, k0=2 and the gcd was 4 (which is the divisor). \n\n    But consider: a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n        divisor 1: k0=0 -> (5,10): gcd=5 -> LCM=10\n        divisor 5: k0=(5-5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0 -> same as above.\n\n    Now, what if we take divisor 5 and use k=5? \n        (10,15): gcd=5, LCM=30 -> worse.\n\n    But wait, why did we not consider k=0 for divisor 1 and divisor 5 separately? We did, and we stored k0=0. Then we computed the LCM for k=0.\n\n    However, note: the minimal k for divisor 1 is 0, and for divisor 5 is 0. Then we computed the LCM for k=0. But is there another k that we are missing? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, he needs to choose the smallest one.\" So we are collecting candidate_k and then we are going to compute the LCM for each candidate_k and then choose the smallest k that minimizes the LCM.\n\n    But note: there might be a k that is not the minimal solution for any divisor but still yields a gcd that is a divisor of (a-b). \n\n    Example: a=5, b=10, d=5. Consider k=5. Then the gcd is 5 (divisor). But k=5 is not the minimal solution for divisor 5? The minimal solution for divisor 5 is 0 (because 5 is divisible by 5). But note: the condition for divisor 5 is that (a+k) is divisible by 5. The minimal non-negative k is 0. Then k=5 is a solution too, but we are not generating k=5 from divisor 5 because we only take the minimal solution.\n\n    However, note: the minimal solution is the smallest non-negative k. But the problem does not require that we consider only minimal solutions per divisor. We must consider all k? \n\n    But wait: the problem asks for the smallest k (over all k) that minimizes the LCM. Therefore, we must consider all k? But k can be arbitrarily large. \n\n    However, note: the LCM is a function of k. The two numbers (a+k) and (b+k) are increasing with k. The product (a+k)*(b+k) is increasing, but the denominator (gcd) can also increase. The LCM might first decrease then increase. But note: the minimal LCM might occur at a relatively small k.\n\n    Insight: the gcd must divide (a-b). Therefore, the gcd is bounded (at most |a-b|). Then the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd, and the gcd is at most |a-b|. Therefore, the LCM is at least (a+k)*(b+k)/|a-b|. But note: as k increases, the numerator increases without bound, so the LCM will eventually become very large. Therefore, the minimal LCM must occur for a k that is not too large. \n\n    But how large? \n\n    However, note: the minimal k we are generating (the minimal solution for each divisor) might not be the only candidate. But note: the condition for the gcd is that it must divide (a-b). Therefore, the gcd is one of the divisors. Then the minimal LCM must occur at one of the k that is the minimal solution for one of the divisors? \n\n    Why? Because for a divisor g0, the condition is that (a+k) is divisible by g0. The minimal k0 is the smallest k that satisfies that condition. Then for k0, the gcd is at least g0 (because g0 divides (a+k0) and (a-b)). But note: the gcd might be a multiple of g0 (if (a+k0) has more factors). However, the LCM for k0 is (a+k0)*(b+k0)/g, where g is the gcd (which is a divisor of (a-b) and at least g0). \n\n    But consider: if we take a k that is the minimal solution for a divisor g0, then we are ensuring that (a+k) is divisible by g0. Then the gcd is at least g0. Therefore, the denominator is at least g0, so the LCM is at most (a+k0)*(b+k0)/g0.\n\n    Now, if we take a larger k, then the product (a+k)*(b+k) is larger, and the gcd might be the same or larger. But the LCM might be larger.\n\n    However, note: there is a possibility that a k that is not the minimal solution for any divisor might yield a smaller LCM. \n\n    Example: a=8, b=12, d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n        divisor1: k0=0 -> (8,12): gcd=4, LCM=24.\n        divisor2: k0= (2-8%2)%2=0 -> same as above.\n        divisor4: k0= (4-8%4)%4=0 -> same.\n\n    Now, what about k=1: (9,13): gcd=1, LCM=117.\n        k=2: (10,14): gcd=2, LCM=70.\n        k=3: (11,15): gcd=1, LCM=165.\n        k=4: (12,16): gcd=4, LCM=48 -> worse than 24.\n\n    But wait, why didn't we get k=4 from divisor4? We did: divisor4 minimal solution is 0. Then we computed the LCM for k=0 (which is 24) and then for k=4 we didn't compute. \n\n    However, note: the minimal solution for divisor4 is 0, but k=4 is also a solution. But the problem: we are to choose the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. We found k=0 gives LCM=24. Then k=4 gives LCM=48, which is worse.\n\n    But is it possible that a non-minimal solution for one divisor gives a better LCM than the minimal solution for that divisor? \n\n    Example: a=8, b=12, divisor4: minimal solution is 0. Then k=4 (which is 0+4, and 4 is a multiple of 4) is the next solution. But the product at k=4 is (12*16)=192, and the gcd is 4, so LCM=48. Worse.\n\n    Another example: a=5, b=10, divisor5: minimal solution k=0. Then k=5: (10,15): gcd=5, LCM=30. Worse.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal solution for a divisor g0 is the best candidate for that divisor. But note: we are iterating over divisors, and the minimal solution for a divisor g0 might be large if g0 is large. \n\n    However, we must consider: the LCM might be minimized at a k that is the minimal solution for one divisor, and then we don't need to consider non-minimal solutions because they are worse.\n\n    But wait: what if we have two divisors: g0 and g1, and the minimal solution for g0 is k0, and the minimal solution for g1 is k1, but there exists a k that is not the minimal solution for either but the LCM is lower? \n\n    Example: a=9, b=15, d=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n        divisor1: k0=0 -> (9,15): gcd=3, LCM=45.\n        divisor2: k0= (2-9%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> (10,16): gcd=2, LCM=80.\n        divisor3: k0= (3-9%3)%3=0 -> same as divisor1.\n        divisor6: k0= (6-9%6)%6= (6-3)%6=3 -> (12,18): gcd=6, LCM=36.\n\n        Now, what about k=2?\n            (11,17): gcd=1, LCM=187 -> worse.\n        k=4: (13,19): gcd=1, LCM=247 -> worse.\n\n        So the minimal LCM is 36 at k=3.\n\n        But note: we also have k=0 and k=3. The LCM for k=0 is 45, for k=3 is 36. So we choose k=3.\n\n        Now, is there a k between 0 and 3? k=1,2 already considered.\n\n    But wait, why didn't we consider k=3 from divisor6? We did: divisor6 gives k0=3.\n\n    However, note: the divisor6 is a divisor of 6, and we considered it.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm is: iterate over all divisors of |a-b|, and for each divisor compute the minimal non-negative k (candidate_k) that satisfies (a+k) divisible by the divisor. Then compute the LCM for (a+k, b+k) for that candidate_k. Then select the candidate_k that minimizes the LCM, and if multiple, choose the smallest candidate_k.\n\n    But note: what if a-b is negative? We use absolute value.\n\n 20. However, note: the above example with a=9, b=15: we got k=3. But is k=3 the smallest k that minimizes the LCM? Yes, because k=0 gives 45, k=1 gives 80, k=2 gives 187, k=3 gives 36.\n\n 21. But wait: what if we consider k=- something? k must be non-negative.\n\n 22. One more example: the sample input ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'].\n\n    Example 1: \"6 10\"\n        a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n        divisor1: k0=0 -> (6,10): gcd=2, LCM=30.\n        divisor2: k0=0 -> same.\n        divisor4: k0= (4-6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2 -> (8,12): gcd=4, LCM=24.\n        So minimal LCM is 24 at k=2.\n\n    Example 2: \"21 31\"\n        a=21, b=31, d=10. Divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n        divisor1: k0=0 -> (21,31): gcd=1, LCM=651.\n        divisor2: k0= (2-21%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> (22,32): gcd=2, LCM=352.\n        divisor5: k0= (5-21%5)%5= (5-1)%5=4 -> (25,35): gcd=5, LCM=175.\n        divisor10: k0= (10-21%10)%10= (10-1)%10=9 -> (30,40): gcd=10, LCM=120.\n        Then the minimal LCM is 120 at k=9.\n\n    Example 3: \"5 10\"\n        a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n        divisor1: k0=0 -> (5,10): gcd=5, LCM=10.\n        divisor5: k0=0 -> same.\n        So k=0.\n\n 23. Implementation details:\n\n    - We need to factorize d = |a-b| to get all divisors. We can do:\n\n        def get_divisors(n):\n            import math\n            divs = set()\n            if n==0:\n                return set()\n            i = 1\n            # iterate up to sqrt(n)\n            while i*i <= n:\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    divs.add(i)\n                    divs.add(n//i)\n                i += 1\n            return divs\n\n    - Then, for each divisor g0 in the set of divisors (positive), compute candidate_k = (g0 - a % g0) % g0\n\n        But note: if a % g0 == 0, then candidate_k=0. Else, candidate_k = g0 - (a % g0)\n\n        However, the modulus operation: \n            candidate_k = (g0 - a % g0) % g0\n\n        This works because if a % g0 !=0, then (g0 - (a % g0)) is in [1, g0-1], and then mod g0 doesn't change it. And if a % g0==0, then (g0 - 0) % g0 = 0.\n\n    - Then, we must compute the LCM for (a+candidate_k, b+candidate_k). But note: the gcd is not necessarily g0, but we can compute it by:\n\n        g = math.gcd(a+candidate_k, b+candidate_k)\n        lcm_val = (a+candidate_k) * (b+candidate_k) // g\n\n    - Then we compare.\n\n 24. However, note: the candidate_k we get from divisor g0 might be the same as candidate_k from another divisor g1. Then we don't want to compute the same k twice. So we store the candidate_k in a set.\n\n 25. But wait: the minimal solution for divisor g0 is candidate_k0, and for divisor g1 is candidate_k1. If they are the same, then we compute the LCM once.\n\n 26. Steps:\n\n    Read a, b.\n\n    If a==b: print(0) and done.\n\n    d = abs(a-b)\n\n    Get divisors of d.\n\n    candidates_set = set()\n\n    for each divisor g0 in divisors:\n        k0 = (g0 - a % g0) % g0\n        candidates_set.add(k0)\n\n    Then, we also have to consider: are there other k that we should consider? According to our reasoning, no.\n\n    But note: what if d=0? Then we skip. But we have a==b, so handled.\n\n    Then, we also have to consider k=0? Actually, divisor1 is always a divisor, and then k0= (1 - a%1)%1. But note: a%1 is 0, so k0=0. So k=0 is always considered.\n\n 27. However, note: the above method does not consider k that are negative. But k>=0.\n\n 28. But wait: what if we have a divisor g0 that is greater than a? Then a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide the absolute difference \\( |a - b| \\). This insight allows us to consider all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) to determine potential values of \\( k \\) that could minimize the LCM.\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), we compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). This \\( k \\) is derived from the congruence \\( (a + k) \\mod g = 0 \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is trivially \\( 0 \\).\n   - For \\( a \\neq b \\), compute all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that satisfies the congruence condition.\n   - For each computed \\( k \\), calculate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - Track the \\( k \\) that yields the smallest LCM, choosing the smallest \\( k \\) in case of ties.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves factorizing \\( |a - b| \\), which can be done in \\( O(\\sqrt{n}) \\) time where \\( n \\) is \\( |a - b| \\).
