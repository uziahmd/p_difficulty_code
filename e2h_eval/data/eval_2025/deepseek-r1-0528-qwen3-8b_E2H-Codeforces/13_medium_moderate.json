For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. We need to determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number in a 12-note circle. The notes are: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] (note: H is the same as B? Actually, wait: the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And the circle: ... C, then after H comes C again.\n\n But note: the example input includes \"A B H\", and the example output is 'strange'. Also, the example says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (if going from E up to C, which is actually wrapping around). However, the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\" — but then they say the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. This implies that we consider the circle and the distance is the smallest way? Actually, no: because from E to C, if we go upwards: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: that's 8 semitones. But if we go downwards, it would be 4 (since 12-8=4). However, the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are always taking the positive direction (increasing) until we wrap.\n\n However, the definition for the chord requires ordering the notes so that the distances are as specified. So we have to consider the cyclic order.\n\n Approach:\n - Map each note to a number (0 to 11) in the circle starting at C=0, then C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11? But wait, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically: after H (which is 11) comes C (0). However, the example input has \"A B H\": \n   A=9, B=10, H=11 -> but then the circle is 12 notes.\n\n But wait: the problem lists 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So there are 12 distinct notes. Then H is the last one. So we can map:\n   C -> 0\n   C# -> 1\n   D -> 2\n   D# -> 3\n   E -> 4\n   F -> 5\n   F# -> 6\n   G -> 7\n   G# -> 8\n   A -> 9\n   B -> 10\n   H -> 11\n\n However, note the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's break that down:\n\n Input: \"C# B F\"\n\n Map:\n   C# -> 1\n   B -> 10\n   F -> 5\n\n Now, we have to consider the circular arrangement. We can arrange the three numbers in sorted order (considering the circle). One way is to duplicate the list (to account for circularity) and sort, then take three consecutive ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the distances by considering the circular distances. But note: the chord definition requires an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n   For major: distance(X,Y)=4, distance(Y,Z)=3, and then distance(X,Z)=7 (which is 4+3).\n   For minor: distance(X,Y)=3, distance(Y,Z)=4, and then distance(X,Z)=7.\n\n However, note that the chord is defined as an unordered set, so we can reorder arbitrarily.\n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. Map the input notes to numbers (0-11). The input will have three space separated notes.\n\n 2. Since the circle is 12, we can represent the three numbers and then consider all cyclic shifts and also the possibility of wrapping.\n\n 3. We need to check if there exists an ordering (a cyclic shift) of the three notes such that the distances between consecutive notes (in the circle) are either (4,3) or (3,4).\n\n How to compute the distances?\n\n Since the circle is 12, the distance from note a to note b (in the positive direction) is (b - a) % 12. But if we are going from a higher note to a lower one, we might need to adjust. However, note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. But in a circle, we can consider the minimal positive distance? Actually, the example says: the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (because we go from E to the next C, which is 12 - (E-C) mod 12? Actually, from E (4) to C (0): if we go forward, we do 0 - 4 = -4, but modulo 12, that's 8 (because 12 + (-4) = 8). \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". This suggests that we are to take the increasing direction until we complete the circle.\n\n However, in the chord definition, the ordering is arbitrary. We are allowed to rearrange the notes arbitrarily. So we want to assign the three notes to X, Y, Z in a circular manner so that the consecutive distances (going in the positive direction) are as required.\n\n Important: The chord must be considered in a circular arrangement. But the condition for major/minor requires that the entire chord spans 7 semitones (because 4+3=7). However, note that in a circle of 12, 7 is less than 12/2, so we don't have to worry about multiple ways? Actually, we have to consider the chord as a set and then arrange them in increasing order (with wrap-around).\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n - Convert the three notes to numbers: [n1, n2, n3] (each in 0..11)\n - Sort the list, but then also consider the circular wrap: so we can duplicate the list by adding n1+12 and n2+12 and n3+12, then sort and look for three consecutive numbers that are within a span of 12 (so that we can form a circle without crossing 12 twice). Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let the three numbers be a, b, c. Then we can arrange them in a circle and the gaps are the differences (with wrap). But note: the chord is defined by three consecutive notes in the circle.\n\n However, the problem says: the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to choose any starting point and then the next two in the circle.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Map the three input notes to numbers.\n\n 2. Since the circle is 12, we can arrange the three numbers in a circular manner. We can do:\n\n    Let arr = sorted([n1, n2, n3])\n    Then consider the three intervals: from arr[0] to arr[1], arr[1] to arr[2], and then from arr[2] to arr[0]+12.\n\n    But wait, we might have duplicates? The problem doesn't specify, but since there are 12 distinct notes, and three distinct notes (unless the input has duplicates, but the problem says \"chord\" and \"triads\", so probably distinct). So assume distinct.\n\n 3. Now, we can also consider the circular arrangement by duplicating the array with +12.\n\n    Let arr_extended = arr + [x+12 for x in arr]\n\n    Then we can consider the three consecutive numbers in arr_extended (the original three and the one wrapped) and check the gaps.\n\n    However, we are only interested in the three consecutive notes that form the chord. The condition for a major/minor chord is that the three notes must form two intervals of 3 and 4 semitones (in some order) when arranged in order.\n\n    Actually, the condition is: \n        In the ordered arrangement (without wrap), the distances between consecutive notes (in the circle) must be such that the entire chord covers 7 semitones (the sum of two adjacent intervals). But note: the chord is defined by two adjacent intervals: 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n    However, the entire chord (three notes) must span 7 semitones from the first to the last. But in a circle, the chord might be represented by two different arcs. Actually, the chord is defined by the three notes, and we can arrange them in increasing order (without wrap) and then the two intervals (from first to second, and second to third) must add up to 7 (because 7 < 12, so the chord does not wrap around more than once). Alternatively, we can also consider the other arc (the complement) but the condition requires that the two intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) and the total from the first to the third is 7.\n\n    But note: the example \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's map:\n\n        C# -> 1, B -> 10, F -> 5.\n\n    How to arrange them in the circle? We need to arrange the three numbers in increasing order (with wrap). The sorted order is [1,5,10]. Now, the gaps:\n\n        gap1 = (5 - 1) = 4\n        gap2 = (10 - 5) = 5\n        gap3 = (1 + 12 - 10) = 3   (because from 10 to 1: 1 - 10 + 12 = 3)\n\n    But wait, we are only concerned with the consecutive notes in the circle. The chord definition requires that we can order the notes so that the distances are 4 and then 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). \n\n    However, note: the chord definition does not require that the entire set of three notes is contiguous. It requires that there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 (or 3) and from Y to Z is 3 (or 4). \n\n    So we are allowed to pick any three consecutive notes in the circle? Actually, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. The chord is defined by the three notes, and we can arrange them in any order.\n\n    We can try all permutations of the three notes and check if there exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n\n        (distance(a, b) == 4 and distance(b, c) == 3) OR\n        (distance(a, b) == 3 and distance(b, c) == 4)\n\n    But note: the distance from a to b is defined as the positive (minimal) distance? Or the problem defines the distance as the upward distance (even if it wraps)? \n\n    The problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n    This means that the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but if we are going from a to b and we cross the boundary (like from E to C), then we add 12? Actually, the example says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". So the distance is defined as (b - a) mod 12, but if negative, we add 12 until positive. Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12   -> but this modulo operation gives a result between 0 and 11. However, note: if a=5, b=1 (which is F to C#), then (1-5) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8. So that matches.\n\n    So we define:\n\n        def dist(a, b):\n            d = (b - a) % 12\n            # But wait, what if we want the minimal distance? The problem does not say minimal, it says from the lowest to the uppest. However, the chord condition uses specific distances (4 and 3) and note that 4+3=7, which is less than 12, so we don't have an issue with minimal vs non-minimal.\n\n    However, the chord condition requires an ordering that yields 4 and then 3 (or 3 and then 4). But note: the entire chord must be contained in an interval of 7 semitones (because 4+3=7). \n\n    But wait: the example \"C# B F\": \n        Ordering: B, C#, F? \n        From B to C#: (1 - 10) % 12 = (1-10) = -9 -> then -9 % 12 = 3. \n        Then from C# to F: (5 - 1) = 4.\n\n        So the ordering (B, C#, F) gives 3 and then 4, which is minor.\n\n    However, note: the example input was given as \"C# B F\", but the ordering they used was \"B C# F\". \n\n    Therefore, we must check all cyclic orders? Actually, we can check all permutations of the three notes. There are 6 permutations.\n\n    But note: the chord is defined as an unordered set, and the ordering is arbitrary. So we can try:\n\n        For each permutation (a, b, c) of the three notes (represented as numbers):\n\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12   -> this gives the distance from a to b (in the positive direction, possibly wrapping)\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12   -> from b to c\n\n            Then we require that (d1, d2) is either (4,3) or (3,4)\n\n        But wait: the entire chord must be considered as a linear sequence? Actually, the chord is defined by the three notes and the ordering is the one that goes from the lowest to the highest? Not necessarily: the example used a different ordering (B, C#, F) even though B is the highest in the original set? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". The ordering is arbitrary. \n\n    But note: the distance is defined from the lowest to the uppest. So the ordering must be from low to high? Actually, the example says: the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (which is the positive direction). So the ordering is the increasing order (from low to high) in the circle? \n\n    However, the example for minor: \"B C# F\" — in the circle, B is 10, then C# is 1 (which is 10+12=13, but we are on a circle). Actually, the example uses the fact that the circle is cyclic. The ordering \"B C# F\" is not in increasing numerical order (10,1,5) — that's not increasing. \n\n    Let me clarify: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". This implies that we are always moving forward (in the direction of increasing tone) until we complete the circle.\n\n    In the example \"B C# F\": \n        Starting at B (10), then the next note is C# (1). To go from B to C# in the positive direction, we have to go from 10 to 12 (which is 2 steps) and then from 0 to 1 (1 step) so total 3 steps. But wait, the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones (because B->C->C# is two half steps: B to C is 1, C to C# is 1, so 2? Actually, let's list:\n\n        B -> C: 1 semitone (because after B is C? Actually, the note list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait! The problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n        So the order is: \n          0: C\n          1: C#\n          2: D\n          3: D#\n          4: E\n          5: F\n          6: F#\n          7: G\n          8: G#\n          9: A\n          10: B\n          11: H\n\n        Then after B (10) comes H (11) and then C (0). So from B to C: we have to go from 10 to 11 (H) and then to 0 (C) — that's 2 semitones.\n\n        But wait, the example says the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. So:\n\n        B (10) -> H (11): 1 semitone\n        H (11) -> C (0): 1 semitone (but then we are at C, then to C#: 1 more semitone, so total 3.\n\n        Therefore, the distance from B to C# is 3.\n\n        Similarly, from C# (1) to F (5): \n            C# (1) -> D(2) -> D#(3) -> E(4) -> F(5): that's 4 semitones.\n\n        So the ordering (B, C#, F) is valid.\n\n    So the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Map the input notes to numbers (0-11) using the provided list.\n\n        Step 2: Generate all permutations of the three notes (there are 6).\n\n        Step 3: For each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n                d1 = (b - a) % 12   [this is the distance from a to b in the positive direction]\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12   [distance from b to c]\n\n                Note: the entire chord must be contained in the interval from a to c (via b) and the total distance from a to c via b is (c - a) % 12, but we don't require that. We only require the two consecutive distances.\n\n                Conditions:\n\n                    Condition for major: d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n                    Condition for minor: d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\n                If we find a permutation that satisfies one of these, then we can break.\n\n        Step 4: If we found a major condition, output \"major\".\n                 If we found a minor condition, output \"minor\".\n                 Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n    However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we don't have to worry about both conditions being satisfied.\n\n    But wait: what if we have a permutation that gives (4,3) and another that gives (3,4)? That would be both major and minor. But the problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so that should not happen.\n\n    Let's test with a known major chord: \"C E G\"\n\n        Notes: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n\n        Permutations:\n\n          (0,4,7): d1=(4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n          (0,7,4): d1=(7-0)%12=7, d2=(4-7)%12= (4-7) mod12 = -3 mod12 = 9 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n          (4,0,7): d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2=(7-0)%12=7 -> no.\n\n          (4,7,0): d1=(7-4)%12=3, d2=(0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n\n          (7,0,4): d1=(0-7)%12=5, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n\n          (7,4,0): d1=(4-7)%12=9, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n\n        So only one permutation (0,4,7) works.\n\n    Now, minor chord: \"D F A\" — which is minor? Let's check: \n        D=2, F=5, A=9.\n\n        The minor triad: root, minor third (3 semitones), then perfect fifth (7 semitones from root). \n        Actually, the minor triad is built as: root, +3, +4. So D -> F (3 semitones: D->D#->E->F? Actually, from D to F: \n            D (2) -> D# (3) -> E (4) -> F (5): that's 3 semitones (because from D to F is 3 semitones: D to D#=1, D# to E=2, E to F=3? Actually, wait: the note list: D, D#, E, F. So from D to F is 3 semitones (because D to D# is 1, D# to E is 2, E to F is 3). Then from F to A: \n            F(5) -> F#(6) -> G(7) -> G#(8) -> A(9): that's 4 semitones.\n\n        So the chord \"D F A\" should be minor.\n\n        Now, check with our method:\n\n        Permutations:\n\n          (2,5,9): d1=(5-2)%12=3, d2=(9-5)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n          Others: \n          (2,9,5): d1=(9-2)%12=7, d2=(5-9)%12= (5-9) mod12 = -4 mod12=8 -> no.\n          (5,2,9): d1=(2-5)%12= (2-5) mod12 = -3 mod12=9, d2=(9-2)%12=7 -> no.\n          (5,9,2): d1=(9-5)%12=4, d2=(2-9)%12= (2-9) mod12=-7 mod12=5 -> no.\n          (9,2,5): d1=(2-9)%12= (2-9) mod12=-7 mod12=5, d2=(5-2)%12=3 -> no.\n          (9,5,2): d1=(5-9)%12= (5-9) mod12=-4 mod12=8, d2=(2-5)%12=9 -> no.\n\n        So only one permutation works.\n\n    Another example: \"A B H\"\n\n        A=9, B=10, H=11.\n\n        Check all permutations:\n\n          (9,10,11): d1=(10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 -> no.\n          (9,11,10): d1=(11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)= (10-11) mod12=11 -> no.\n          (10,9,11): d1=(9-10)= (9-10) mod12=11, d2=(11-9)=2 -> no.\n          (10,11,9): d1=(11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)= (9-11) mod12=10 -> no.\n          (11,9,10): d1=(9-11)= (9-11) mod12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n          (11,10,9): d1=(10-11)=11, d2=(9-10)=11 -> no.\n\n        So it's strange.\n\n    But wait, is there an alternative interpretation? The problem says the chord is an unordered set, but the ordering is arbitrary. However, the condition requires two consecutive intervals (4 and 3 for major, 3 and 4 for minor). So if we cannot find any permutation that gives (4,3) or (3,4), then it's strange.\n\n    However, note: the chord might be considered in a different way: the definition does not require that the entire chord is contained in one octave. But the problem says the circle is 12, so we are considering modulo 12.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Create a mapping from note name to number.\n\n        Note: the note names are: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n\n        Step 2: Read the input, split the string.\n\n        Step 3: Map each note to its number.\n\n        Step 4: Generate all permutations of the three numbers.\n\n        Step 5: For each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n                d1 = (b - a) % 12\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n                But wait: what if we have a chord that wraps around? For example, if we have the notes [10,0,3]: \n\n                Example: \"B C D#\" (B=10, C=0, D#=3)\n\n                We want to check the ordering (B, C, D#): \n                    d1 = (0-10)%12 = (0-10) mod12 = (-10 mod12) = 2. \n                    d2 = (3-0)%12=3.\n\n                This gives (2,3) which is neither (4,3) nor (3,4).\n\n                But wait, maybe we should consider the entire chord in the circle. The chord definition requires that the three notes are consecutive in the circle with the given intervals. However, the example \"B C# F\" was given as minor and we handled it by using the positive direction.\n\n                But note: the example \"B C# F\" did not use the entire circle? Actually, the chord is defined by the three notes, and we are allowed to choose any ordering. The ordering (B, C#, F) is valid because the distances are 3 and 4.\n\n                However, in the example above, we have [10,0,3]. Let's try the ordering (C, D#, B): \n                    C=0, D#=3, B=10.\n                    d1 = (3-0)%12=3, d2=(10-3)%12=7 -> no.\n\n                Another ordering: (C, B, D#): \n                    d1 = (10-0)%12=10, d2=(3-10)%12= (3-10) mod12= -7 mod12=5 -> no.\n\n                Another: (D#, C, B): \n                    d1 = (0-3)%12=9, d2=(10-0)%12=10 -> no.\n\n                Another: (D#, B, C): \n                    d1 = (10-3)%12=7, d2=(0-10)%12=2 -> no.\n\n                Another: (B, D#, C): \n                    d1 = (3-10)%12= (3-10) mod12= -7 mod12=5, d2=(0-3)%12=9 -> no.\n\n                So this chord [B, C, D#] is strange.\n\n        However, wait: is there a standard way to represent chords? The chord [B, C, D#] is actually a minor chord? Let me check:\n\n            Root: B (10)\n            Minor third: from B to D# (which is 10 to 3: 3-10 mod12=5, but 5 semitones is a diminished third? Actually, the minor third is 3 semitones.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider the chord in the key of B minor: B, D, F. But here we have B, C, D#. \n\n            This chord is actually a minor chord? Let me build a minor chord from B: \n                B (root) -> B+3 semitones: B->C->C#->D->D# (wait, that's 4 semitones for a major third, and 3 for minor). \n\n            Minor third from B: \n                B to C is 2 semitones (because B to C is two half steps: B->H->C? No, wait: the note list is fixed. From B (10) to C (0): \n                    B (10) -> H (11) -> C (0): that's 2 semitones (B to H is 1, H to C is 1). So 2 semitones is a minor second, not a minor third.\n\n            Actually, the minor third from B should be D (which is 2 semitones above B? Let's count:\n\n            B to C: 1 semitone (half step) -> that's 1.\n            B to C#: 2 semitones -> that's 2.\n            B to D: 3 semitones (from B to C is 1, C to C# is 1, C# to D is 1 -> total 3) -> so D is a minor third above B.\n\n            So the minor chord from B should be B, D, F (because the fifth is a perfect fifth: from B to F: \n                B->D (minor third, 3 semitones) and then D->F (major third, 4 semitones). \n\n            So the chord [B, D, F] is minor.\n\n            Our example [B, C, D#] is not a standard minor or major chord.\n\n        So the method of checking all permutations with (a,b,c) and computing (b-a)%12 and (c-b)%12 is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we don't have to worry about multiple matches.\n\n    Code:\n\n        notes_list = ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n        mapping = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if len(data) != 3:\n            # The problem says there are three, but just in case\n            # We'll take the first three?\n            pass\n\n        nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n\n        for perm in permutations(nums):\n            a, b, c = perm\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        if found_major:\n            print(\"major\")\n        elif found_minor:\n            print(\"minor\")\n        else:\n            print(\"strange\")\n\n    Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7] -> (4,3) -> major -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5] -> we need to check all 6 permutations.\n\n        We know that one of the permutations is (10,1,5) -> \n            d1 = (1-10) %12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3\n            d2 = (5-1)%12=4 -> minor -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11] -> none of the permutations yield (3,4) or (4,3) -> strange -> correct.\n\n    But wait: what if there's a chord that is major in one inversion and minor in another? The problem says it's unambiguous.\n\n    However, note: we are checking all permutations. The condition is very strict: two consecutive intervals must be exactly 3 and 4 (or 4 and 3). \n\n    This should work.\n\n    But wait: what if the chord is given in a different octave? For example, \"C E G\" could be given as \"C E G'\" (meaning G an octave higher) but the problem states that the circle is 12 and notes are repeated cyclically. However, the input will be given in the same set of 12 notes. So no octave transposition.\n\n    However, note: the example input \"C# B F\" — the note F is given without octave, so we assume it's in the same octave as the others? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but the circle is 12 and the notes are given in the list.\n\n    So we assume the input is in the same octave representation (i.e., the note names are from the 12-note set).\n\n    One more edge: what if the chord is given with a note that is the same as another? For example, \"C C# D\" — but the problem says triads (exactly three notes). But the input may have duplicates? The problem says \"three space-separated notes\", so duplicates are allowed? \n\n    According to the problem, the chord is an unordered set. But if there are duplicates, then it's not a set of three distinct notes. However, the problem says \"exactly three notes\", so we assume distinct.\n\n    But let's read the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is given as three distinct notes.\n\n    So we assume distinct.\n\n    However, to be safe, if there are duplicates, then we might have a problem. But the problem says: the teacher gave Vasya a triad (three notes). So we assume distinct.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"an unordered set of no less than three notes\", and then \"triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes\". So three distinct notes.\n\n    So we can assume distinct.\n\n    However, note: the mapping dictionary has unique keys.\n\n    Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7] -> found_major=True -> prints \"major\"\n\n    Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5] -> found_minor=True -> prints \"minor\"\n\n    Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11] -> found_major=False, found_minor=False -> prints \"strange\"\n\n    But wait: the example input is given as strings, and the mapping dictionary is built from the list of 12 notes. The note 'H' is in the list, so that's correct.\n\n    However, note: the example input \"C# B F\" — the note 'B' is in the list (at index 10) and 'F' is at index 5, and 'C#'=1. So the mapping is correct.\n\n    But wait: the example input \"C# B F\" is given as three separate tokens. We split the input and then map each token.\n\n    One more test: \"D F A\" (minor) — [2,5,9] -> (5-2)%12=3, (9-5)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n    Another test: \"E G B\" — this is a major chord? \n        E=4, G=7, B=10.\n        Check permutation (4,7,10): d1=(7-4)%12=3, d2=(10-7)%12=3 -> not major (needs 4 and 3) or minor (3 and 4). \n        But wait: 3 and 3? Not matching.\n\n        Let me check: E major chord is E, G#, B. Here we have E, G, B.\n\n        E to G: 3 semitones (because E->F->F#->G: that's 3 semitones) — so from E to G is 3, then from G to B: \n            G->G#->A->A#->B: that's 4 semitones? Actually, from G(7) to B(10",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique number (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All possible permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated. If the distances match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones), the corresponding chord type is identified.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the result is printed as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid chord configuration is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nnotes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nmapping = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_list` defines the order of musical notes starting from C. Each note is assigned a number from 0 to 11 for easy calculation of distances.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. These notes are converted into their corresponding numerical values using the predefined mapping.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all permutations of the three numerical values. For each permutation, it calculates the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation (mod 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale).\n4. **Chord Identification**: The distances are checked against the criteria for major and minor chords. If a permutation meets the major chord criteria (distances 4 and 3), `found_major` is set to True. Similarly, the minor chord criteria (distances 3 and 4) set `found_minor` to True.\n5. **Result Output**: Based on the flags `found_major` and `found_minor`, the code prints \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes.",
