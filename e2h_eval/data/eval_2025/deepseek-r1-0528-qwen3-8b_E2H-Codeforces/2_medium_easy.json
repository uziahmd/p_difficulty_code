Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input might use different letters (like 'x' and 'o', or 'w','s','p').\n\n Steps:\n  - Read n.\n  - Read the grid.\n\n  Let's define:\n    Let the main diagonal be from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1)\n    Let the anti-diagonal be from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0)\n\n  Conditions:\n    a) For every cell (i, j) on the main diagonal (i.e., i == j) OR on the anti-diagonal (i+j == n-1), the letter must be the same, say letter A.\n    b) For every cell not on these diagonals, the letter must be the same, say letter B, and letter B != letter A.\n\n  But note: there might be cases where the diagonals have multiple letters? Then we must check that all the diagonal cells are the same.\n\n  Approach:\n    Step 1: Traverse the grid and collect:\n        - The set of letters on the main diagonal.\n        - The set of letters on the anti-diagonal.\n\n    However, condition (a) requires that both diagonals have the same letter. So if the main diagonal has only one distinct letter and the anti-diagonal has only one distinct letter, and those two letters are the same, then condition (a) is satisfied.\n\n    Alternatively, we can check:\n        Let d1 = set of letters in the main diagonal.\n        Let d2 = set of letters in the anti-diagonal.\n\n        Condition (a): \n            len(d1) == 1 and len(d2) == 1 and the common letter from d1 and d2 is the same.\n\n    But note: it's possible that the diagonals have two different letters? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n    Step 2: Now, for the rest of the cells, we require they are all the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n        Let the diagonal letter be A (which is the one from d1 and d2, since they must be the same).\n\n        Then, for every cell (i, j):\n            if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): skip (we already checked these are A)\n            else: the cell must be B (a fixed letter) and B != A.\n\n        However, note: the entire non-diagonal part must be the same letter. So we can do:\n\n            Let B be the letter at the first non-diagonal cell (if any) or we can check the entire non-diagonal part.\n\n    But wait: what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Actually, when n>=3 and odd, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n        We can do:\n          Let diag_char = the letter found in the main diagonal (should be the same for all). Similarly for anti-diagonal, but they must match.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Check the main diagonal: \n             for i in range(n): \n                 if grid[i][i] != expected_diag_letter, then we break.\n\n          But we don't know expected_diag_letter until we check both diagonals. So:\n\n          Let's check:\n            diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n            diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n          Then:\n            if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1 or set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n                return \"NO\"\n\n          But actually, we need to check that both diagonals have the same letter. So we can do:\n\n            if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # But also, within each diagonal, all must be same. So we require set(diag1) has exactly one element.\n\n            if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n          However, note: if set(diag1)==set(diag2) and each set has one element, then they are the same.\n\n          So:\n\n            diag_letter = diag1[0]   (since they are same)\n\n          2. Now, check the rest of the grid:\n\n            non_diag_letter = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    # Otherwise, this cell must be the same as the others and different from diag_letter.\n                    if non_diag_letter is None:\n                        non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return\n\n            And also, we must ensure non_diag_letter != diag_letter.\n\n          However, what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Actually, when n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells. But we can handle by checking the first non-diagonal cell and then ensuring all non-diagonal cells are that and different from diag_letter.\n\n          But note: what if the grid is 3x3? Then the center is part of both diagonals. So we skip the center. The non-diagonal cells are the four corners and the edges? Actually, in a 3x3:\n\n            [0,0] [0,1] [0,2]\n            [1,0] [1,1] [1,2]\n            [2,0] [2,1] [2,2]\n\n            Diagonals: \n                main: [0,0], [1,1], [2,2]\n                anti: [0,2], [1,1], [2,0]\n\n            So the center [1,1] is skipped. The non-diagonal cells are [0,1],[0,2] -> wait, [0,2] is anti-diagonal, so skipped? Actually, [0,2] is anti-diagonal, so we skip. The non-diagonal cells are [0,1], [1,0], [1,2], [2,1].\n\n          So the above double loop would check these.\n\n          But note: the condition says \"all other squares\" (non-diagonal) must be the same.\n\n          However, there is an edge: the problem states that the non-diagonal squares must have the same letter and that letter is different from the diagonal ones.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            diag_set = set(diag1) | set(diag2)   # actually, since both are same, it's just {diag_letter}\n            non_diag_set = set()\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    non_diag_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\n            Then:\n            Condition 1: len(diag_set) == 1\n            Condition 2: len(non_diag_set) == 1\n            Condition 3: next(iter(diag_set)) != next(iter(non_diag_set))\n\n          But wait, what if the non-diagonal part has more than one distinct letter? Then non_diag_set has size>1 -> condition fails.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"all other squares\" (non-diagonal) contain the same letter. So we require non_diag_set has exactly one element.\n\n          But we can break early if we find a non-diagonal cell that is not the same as the first non-diagonal cell.\n\n          Considering performance: n < 300, so maximum 300*300=90000 cells, which is acceptable.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                line = input().strip()\n                grid.append(line)\n\n            # Extract main diagonal and anti-diagonal\n            diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n            diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n            # Condition 1: Both diagonals must have the same letter and that letter is the same throughout each.\n            if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            diag_letter = diag1[0]\n            anti_letter = diag2[0]\n            if diag_letter != anti_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Now, check non-diagonal part\n            non_diag_letter = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if non_diag_letter is None:\n                        non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n            # Now, we must have non_diag_letter set and it must be different from diag_letter.\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                # This means the grid has only diagonal cells? But n>=3, so there should be non-diagonal cells.\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            if non_diag_letter == diag_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n  However, consider the example input:\n\n      Example 1: \n        Input: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n        Let's check:\n          Diagonals: \n            main: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> set has {'x','o','s'} -> fails condition (len(set(diag1))!=1) -> so we output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n      Example 2:\n        Input:\n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n        Diagonals:\n          main: ['w','s','w'] -> set has {'w','s'} -> wait, but wait, let me check:\n\n          Actually, the main diagonal: \n            row0: index0 -> 'w'\n            row1: index1 -> 's'\n            row2: index2 -> 'w'\n\n          So set(diag1) = {'w','s'} -> two elements -> condition fails.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n        Let me reexamine the example:\n\n          Grid:\n            w s w\n            s w s\n            w s w\n\n          The main diagonal: \n            (0,0): 'w'\n            (1,1): 'w'\n            (2,2): 'w'\n\n          Wait, I see: the second row is \"sws\", so the middle of the second row is 'w'. So the main diagonal is indeed all 'w'.\n\n          How did I get 's'? Because I thought row1 index1 was 's'? Let me write the grid:\n\n            row0: \"wsw\" -> indices: [0][0]='w', [0][1]='s', [0][2]='w'\n            row1: \"sws\" -> [1][0]='s', [1][1]='w', [1][2]='s'\n            row2: \"wsw\" -> [2][0]='w', [2][1]='s', [2][2]='w'\n\n          So main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> all 'w'\n\n          Anti-diagonal: \n            [0][2] = 'w'\n            [1][1] = 'w'\n            [2][0] = 'w'\n\n          So both diagonals are 'w'. Then non-diagonal cells:\n\n            [0][1] = 's'\n            [0][2] is diagonal -> skip\n            [1][0] = 's'\n            [1][2] = 's'\n            [2][1] = 's'\n\n          So non-diagonal cells are all 's'. And 's' != 'w'. So condition holds.\n\n        Why did I get confused? In the example input, the second row is \"sws\", so the middle of the second row is 'w'. So I did:\n\n          diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(3)] -> ['w','w','w'] -> set is {'w'}\n\n          diag2 = [grid[i][2-i] for i in range(3)] -> \n            i=0: grid[0][2] -> 'w'\n            i=1: grid[1][1] -> 'w'\n            i=2: grid[2][0] -> 'w'\n\n        So that works.\n\n        But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n          Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n          Output: YES\n\n        And our algorithm would say:\n\n          Condition 1: set(diag1)= {'w'} -> ok, set(diag2)= {'w'} -> ok, and they are the same -> ok.\n\n          Then, non_diag_letter: \n            We iterate and set non_diag_letter to the first non-diagonal cell: [0][1] = 's'\n\n          Then check the rest non-diagonal cells: \n            [0][2] is diagonal -> skip\n            [1][0] = 's' -> matches\n            [1][2] = 's' -> matches\n            [2][1] = 's' -> matches\n            [2][2] is diagonal -> skip\n\n          Then check non_diag_letter ('s') != diag_letter ('w') -> yes.\n\n          Then output \"YES\".\n\n        Now, example 3:\n\n          Input:\n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n          Grid:\n            row0: \"xpx\"\n            row1: \"pxp\"\n            row2: \"xpe\"\n\n          Main diagonal: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='e' -> set(diag1) = {'x','e'} -> two distinct, so condition fails -> output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n        But wait, in the example input provided in the problem, the third example is:\n\n          Input: \n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n          Output: NO\n\n        However, note the main diagonal: \n          [0][0] = 'x'\n          [1][1] = 'p' (from row1: \"pxp\")\n          [2][2] = 'e'\n\n          So set(diag1) = {'x','p','e'}? Actually, we have two distinct: 'x','p','e' -> three distinct? Actually, we have:\n\n            row0: \"x p x\"\n            row1: \"p x p\"\n            row2: \"x p e\"\n\n          So diag1: \n            i=0: grid[0][0] = 'x'\n            i=1: grid[1][1] = 'x'\n            i=2: grid[2][2] = 'e'\n\n          So set(diag1) = {'x','e'} -> two distinct -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the code as above should work.\n\n        However, let me fix the code to use the correct anti-diagonal indexing.\n\n        The anti-diagonal: for a cell (i, j) such that i+j = n-1.\n\n        In the example 3x3, n=3, so n-1=2.\n\n        i+j=2: \n          i=0, j=2 -> grid[0][2] = 'x' (from \"xpx\")\n          i=1, j=1 -> grid[1][1] = 'x' (from \"pxp\"? Actually, row1: \"pxp\": so grid[1][0]='p', grid[1][1]='x', grid[1][2]='p')\n          i=2, j=0 -> grid[2][0] = 'x'\n\n        So anti-diagonal: ['x','x','x'] -> set is {'x'}, and the main diagonal is {'x','e'} -> so we fail because the main diagonal isn't all same.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the grid has the same letter in the main diagonal but the anti-diagonal has a different letter? Then we check:\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2): then NO.\n\n        Example: \n          3\n          xxx\n          xyy\n          xxx\n\n        Here, main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> set is {'x','y'} -> fails.\n\n        Another example: \n          3\n          aaa\n          aba\n          aaa\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> set is {'a','b'} -> fails.\n\n        Only when both diagonals are uniform and the same, and the non-diagonal is uniform and different, then YES.\n\n        Let me test with a 3x3 that should be NO because the non-diagonal part isn't uniform.\n\n        Example:\n          3\n          www\n          www\n          www\n\n        Then main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> set is {'w'}\n        Anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> set is {'w'} -> same.\n\n        Then non-diagonal part: \n          [0][1] = 'w'\n          [1][0] = 'w'\n          [1][2] = 'w'\n          [2][1] = 'w'\n\n        Then we set non_diag_letter = 'w', and then compare with diag_letter='w' -> same -> fails condition (must be different) -> output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        Another example: \n          3\n          abc\n          def\n          ghi\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','e','i'] -> not same -> NO.\n\n        One more: \n          3\n          aba\n          bab\n          aba\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> set {'a','b'} -> NO.\n\n        But wait, what if the non-diagonal part is uniform but the diagonals are uniform but different? \n\n        Example: \n          3\n          xxx\n          xyy\n          xxx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> set {'x','y'} -> NO.\n\n        Example: \n          3\n          xyz\n          zyz\n          zyz\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','z'] -> set {'x','y','z'} -> NO.\n\n        Example: \n          3\n          xyy\n          yyy\n          yyx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> set {'x','y'} -> NO.\n\n        Example: \n          3\n          xyx\n          xyy\n          xyx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> set {'x','y'} -> NO.\n\n        So the code is as follows:\n\n        However, note: the anti-diagonal extraction: \n          We did: diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        This is correct because for row i, the column index is n-1-i, which gives the anti-diagonal.\n\n        Let me test with a 5x5 example that should be YES.\n\n        Example 5x5:\n\n          xxxxx\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          xooox\n\n        Wait, the example input in the problem was:\n\n          Input: \n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\n        But wait, the example input says the first example is NO. Let me check:\n\n          The grid:\n\n          row0: \"xooox\" -> ['x','o','o','o','x']\n          row1: \"oxoxo\" -> ['o','x','o','x','o']\n          row2: \"soxoo\" -> ['s','o','x','o','o']\n          row3: \"oxoxo\" -> ['o','x','o','x','o']\n          row4: \"xooox\" -> ['x','o','o','o','x']\n\n        Main diagonal: \n          [0][0] = 'x'\n          [1][1] = 'x'\n          [2][2] = 'x'\n          [3][3] = 'x'\n          [4][4] = 'x'\n\n        Anti-diagonal: \n          [0][4] = 'x'\n          [1][3] = 'x'\n          [2][2] = 'x'\n          [3][1] = 'x'\n          [4][0] = 'x'\n\n        So both diagonals are 'x'. \n\n        Now, non-diagonal cells:\n\n          row0: [0][1]='o', [0][2]='o', [0][3]='o' -> but wait, [0][4] is diagonal -> so [0][1..3] are non-diagonal? Actually, [0][1] and [0][2] and [0][3] are non-diagonal, but [0][4] is diagonal.\n\n          Similarly, row1: [1][0] is non-diagonal? (0+1 !=4? 0+1=1 !=4 -> yes, so [1][0] is non-diagonal. [1][2] is non-diagonal? 1+2=3 !=4 -> yes. [1][4] is diagonal (because 1+4=5, but n=5 -> 5-1=4, so 1+4=5 !=4 -> wait, no! \n\n          Correction: anti-diagonal condition: i+j = n-1 -> 1+4=5, and n-1=4, so 5 !=4 -> so [1][4] is not anti-diagonal. But wait, the anti-diagonal for row1 should be column index n-1-1 = 3. So [1][3] is anti-diagonal.\n\n          So [1][0]: non-diagonal, [1][2]: non-diagonal, [1][4]: non-diagonal? But wait, the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning either main or anti-diagonal.\n\n          Actually, the problem states: \n            \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" \n            and \"all other squares (they are not on the diagonals)\"\n\n          So the diagonals are defined as:\n            main: i==j\n            anti: i+j == n-1\n\n          Therefore, [1][4] is not on the main (1!=4) nor anti (1+4=5 !=4) -> so it is non-diagonal.\n\n          But wait, the example input: \n            row1: \"oxoxo\" -> \n              [1][0]='o' -> non-diagonal\n              [1][1]='x' -> main\n              [1][2]='o' -> non-diagonal\n              [1][3]='x' -> anti\n              [1][4]='o' -> non-diagonal\n\n          So we have non-diagonal cells that are 'o'. \n\n          Now, the non-diagonal part must be the same letter. \n\n          Let's check the entire grid for non-diagonal:\n\n            row0: [0][1]='o', [0][2]='o', [0][3]='o' -> all 'o'\n            row1: [1][0]='o', [1][2]='o', [1][4]='o' -> all 'o'\n            row2: [2][0]='s' -> non-diagonal? 2+0=2 !=4 -> yes. So row2: \n                  [2][0]='s', [2][1]='o', [2][3]='o', [2][4]='o'\n            Here we have a problem: [2][0]='s' is non-diagonal, but the rest of the non-diagonal in row2 are 'o'. \n\n          So the non-diagonal part is not uniform.\n\n          Therefore, condition fails.\n\n          Our code:\n\n            diag1: all 'x' -> set {'x'}\n            diag2: all 'x' -> set {'x'}\n\n            Then we start scanning non-diagonal:\n\n              row0: \n                [0][1]: 'o' -> set non_diag_letter='o'\n                [0][2]: 'o' -> ok\n                [0][3]: 'o' -> ok\n\n              row1:\n                [1][0]: 'o' -> ok\n                [1][2]: 'o' -> ok\n                [1][4]: 'o' -> ok\n\n              row2:\n                [2][0]: 's' -> now we have 's' which is not 'o' -> fails.\n\n          So we output \"NO\", which matches the example.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          grid = []\n          for i in range(n):\n              grid.append(input().strip())\n\n          diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n          diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n          if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          diag_letter = diag1[0]\n\n          non_diag_letter = None\n          for i in range(n):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                      continue\n                  if non_diag_letter is None:\n                      non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                  else:\n                      if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                          print(\"NO\")\n                          exit(0)\n\n          if non_diag_letter is None:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          if non_diag_letter == diag_letter:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n        But wait, the set(diag1) != set(diag2) condition: \n          If diag1 = ['a','a','a'] and diag2 = ['a','a','a'], then set(diag1)==set(diag2) -> so we skip the condition and proceed.\n\n        Actually, the condition above checks two things: \n          First, that each diagonal is uniform (each set has one element).\n          Second, that the two sets are equal.\n\n        Since the sets are built from the diagonals, if the two diagonals are uniform and have the same set, then they have the same letter.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine:\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2) or len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        But note: if set(diag1) != set(diag2) then we break, but if set(diag1) has more than one element, we also break. So the condition is correct.\n\n        However, we can simplify:\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2) or len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        But wait, if set(diag1) has length 1 and set(diag2) has length 1, but they are different sets (like set1={'a'}, set2={'b'}), then the condition set(diag1) != set(diag2) is true, so we break.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        However, note: we already checked the uniformity of each diagonal with len(set(diag1)) != 1. So if one of them is not uniform, we break. Then we check if the sets are equal.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1 or set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        But note: if set(diag1) != set(diag2) then it's NO, but we have to make sure that each diagonal is uniform. So the condition is:\n\n          Condition1: len(set(diag1))==1\n          Condition2: len(set(diag2))==1\n          Condition3: set(diag1)==set(diag2)\n\n        But Condition3 implies that if Condition1 and Condition2 hold, then the diagonals have the same letter. \n\n        Actually, Condition3 is redundant if we know Condition1 and Condition2? No: because if Condition1 and Condition2 hold, then set(diag1) is {a} and set(diag2) is {b}. Then Condition3 is {a}=={b} which is false. So we need Condition3.\n\n        But we can do:\n\n          if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        Or:\n\n          if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1 or set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        But the condition `set(diag1) != set(diag2)` is independent and necessary.\n\n        Let me change the code to:\n\n          if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        This is clear.\n\n        However, note: the set(diag1) and set(diag2) are sets of one element, so set(diag1) != set(diag2) is equivalent to the single element in diag1 being different from the single element in diag2.\n\n        We can also do:\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2) or len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n        But wait, if set(diag1) != set(diag2) is True, then we break. But if set(diag1) has more than one element, then set(diag1) might be equal to set(diag2) (if both have two same elements) but then the condition set(diag1) != set(diag2) is False, and then we check len(set(diag1)) !=1 -> True, so we break.\n\n        But if set(diag1) has two elements and set(diag2) has two elements, but they are the same two? Then set(diag1)==set(diag2) and we don't break by the first part, but then we break by the second part (len(set(diag1)) !=1) -> so it's covered.\n\n        But the condition `set(diag1) != set(diag2) or len(set(diag1)) != 1` is not the same as the two-step condition above.\n\n        Let me break down:\n\n          Condition: set(diag1) != set(diag2) OR len(set(diag1)) != 1\n\n          Example: \n            diag1 = ['a','a','a'] -> set(diag1)={a}, len=1 -> condition fails for the OR if set(diag1)==set(diag2) and set(diag2)={a}. \n            Example: diag1=['a','a','a'], diag2=['b','b','b']: \n                set(diag1)={a}, set(diag2)={b} -> different -> condition true -> break.\n\n            Example: diag1=['a','a','a'], diag2=['a','a','a']: \n                set(diag1)==set(diag2) and len=1 -> condition false -> pass.\n\n            Example: diag1=['a','b','a'], diag2=['a','b','a']: \n                set(diag1)={a,b}, set(diag2)={a,b} -> same set, but len(set(diag1))=2 !=1 -> condition true -> break.\n\n          So this condition is equivalent to the two-step condition.\n\n        However, we want to break if either:\n          (a) the diagonals are not uniform (each diagonal must be uniform) OR\n          (b) the two diagonals have different letters.\n\n        The two-step condition is clearer.\n\n        I'll stick to the two-step condition.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          grid = []\n          for i in range(n):\n              grid.append(input().strip())\n\n          diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n          diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n          if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          diag_letter = diag1[0]\n\n          non_diag_letter = None\n          for i in range(n):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                      continue\n                  if non_diag_letter is None:\n                      non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                  else:\n                      if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                          print(\"NO\")\n                          exit(0)\n\n          # If there's no non-diagonal cell, then n must be 1?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first line contains the size of the grid (n), followed by n lines of n characters each.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Verify that all characters in both diagonals are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Characters**: Ensure all characters not on either diagonal are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n    diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n    \n    if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if set(diag1) != set(diag2):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    diag_letter = next(iter(set(diag1)))\n    \n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_letter == diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n`, which defines the grid size, followed by `n` lines of input which form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Extraction**: The main diagonal (`diag1`) consists of elements where the row index equals the column index. The anti-diagonal (`diag2`) consists of elements where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1`.\n3. **Uniformity Check**: Both diagonals must contain only one unique character. If either diagonal has more than one unique character, the output is \"NO\".\n4. **Diagonal Consistency**: The sets of characters from both diagonals must be identical. If they differ, the output is \"NO\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Check**: All characters not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal characters. The code iterates through each cell, skipping those on the diagonals, and checks for uniformity among the remaining cells.\n6. **Result Determination**: If all checks pass, the grid forms an \"X\", and the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\". \n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming the letter \"X\" by leveraging set operations and systematic traversal of the grid.",
