For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of 3 notes separated by spaces. The notes are from the set: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n Since the scale is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing semitones starting from C=0.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (each note as an integer in the range 0-11).\n    Let's define the mapping for the 12 notes:\n        C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5, F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 10? \n    Wait, the problem says: \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" \n    And the example: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n    But note: after H comes C. So we have 12 distinct notes. However, the note B and H are both present. \n    Actually, the list is: \n        C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    This is 12 notes. But wait, the standard chromatic scale has 12 notes. However, the problem lists 12 notes but two of them are named differently: B and H?\n    Let me check the example: the chord \"C# B F\" is minor. In standard music, the note B is the same as H (B-flat? no, actually in some countries B is used for B and H for B-flat?).\n\n    But the problem states: \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and ...\". \n\n    According to the problem, the notes are repeated cyclically. The example ordering: \n        Input: 'C# B F' -> ordered as 'B C# F'\n\n    How do we map?\n        Let's assign numbers:\n\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 10? or 11?\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"after H goes C again\", so the next note after H is C. So the entire circle is 12 notes.\n\n    However, the example input includes 'A B H'. We must be consistent.\n\n    After reading the problem again: the example says the chord \"C# B F\" is minor because when ordered as \"B C# F\": \n        B to C#: 3 semitones, then C# to F: 4 semitones.\n\n    Now, if we consider the mapping:\n        Let B = 10, then what is H? The problem lists 12 distinct notes. The order is: \n        C(0), C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4), F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), and then H must be 11? \n        But wait, the problem says: \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again\". \n\n    Actually, the problem lists the notes as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    This list has 12 elements. So the last note is H, and then it cycles back to C. Therefore, the note H should be the 11th note (if we start counting from 0 to 11). \n\n    Alternatively, we can think of the list as:\n        [0: 'C', 1: 'C#', 2: 'D', 3: 'D#', 4: 'E', 5: 'F', 6: 'F#', 7: 'G', 8: 'G#', 9: 'A', 10: 'B', 11: 'H']\n\n    But wait, the example input includes 'A B H'. Let's map:\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11\n\n    Then the distances would be calculated modulo 12.\n\n    However, the example chord \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5)\n\n    We need to check all permutations (since the chord is unordered). \n\n    Steps for the algorithm:\n    - Map each note to a number (0-11) based on the above list.\n    - Generate all permutations of the three notes (there are 6).\n    - For each permutation (x, y, z):\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12   -> but we need the smallest positive distance, but note: the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we might have to consider circularity? \n        Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", which is (0 - 4) mod 12 -> but 0-4 is negative, so we do (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8.\n\n    However, the definition in the problem is: \n        For major: we require two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (so total 7). \n        But note: the chord is unordered, so we can arrange the notes in increasing order (but considering the circularity, we have to take the smallest circle? Actually, the problem does not specify direction, but they say \"along the musical scale\", meaning we consider the forward direction until the next repetition.\n\n    Clarification: the distance from a lower note to a higher note is measured by going upward. But if we go from E to C, that's going up from E to F, F to F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C -> that's 8 semitones.\n\n    However, in our mapping, we have the notes as numbers. The distance from note a to note b is (b - a) mod 12, but if negative we add 12. Then the distance is (b - a) % 12, but if negative we adjust. Actually, we can compute:\n        dist(a, b) = (b - a) % 12\n        But if (b - a) is negative, we can do: (b - a + 12) % 12, but note: modulo operation in Python for negative: \n        Alternatively, we can use: (b - a) % 12, but then if (b < a) then (b - a) is negative, and (b - a + 12) % 12 is the same as (b - a) % 12? Not exactly: \n        Example: E (4) to C (0): (0-4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (in Python, because -4 % 12 gives 8). So we can use modulo.\n\n    So for a permutation (x, y, z) we can check:\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        Then the entire span from x to z is (z - x) % 12, but we don't need that for the condition.\n\n    Conditions for major: \n        There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that d1 == 4 and d2 == 3.\n\n    Conditions for minor:\n        There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that d1 == 3 and d2 == 4.\n\n    However, note: the chord has three distinct notes? The problem says \"an unordered set\", so we assume distinct? \n\n    But wait, the example: \"C E G\" -> distinct. The problem says \"no less than three\", but for triads exactly three. And the examples are distinct.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. Create a dictionary for the mapping:\n        note_to_int = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,   # but the problem only uses C# and not Db? The input will only contain the given names: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3, 'Eb': 3,   # but again, the input doesn't include Eb? Only the given names. So we stick to the given names: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6, 'Gb': 6,   # but the input only uses F# and not Gb? The problem says the input contains the given notation.\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8, 'Ab': 8,   # same here\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n    But wait, the problem says the input notes are in the above-given notation. The above-given notation is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    So we don't need to handle Db, etc. So we can just map the given ones.\n\n    However, note: the example input: 'C# B F' -> so we have to map B and F. Also, the example input 'A B H' has H.\n\n    Let me write the mapping for the 12 notes as per the problem:\n\n        note_to_int = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1,\n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n    2. Read the input string and split to get the three notes.\n    3. Map each note to its integer value.\n    4. Generate all permutations of these three integers.\n    5. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n        Check if (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3 -> then this is a major triad.\n        Or if (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4 -> then this is a minor triad.\n\n    6. If we find at least one major, then output \"major\".\n       If we find at least one minor, then output \"minor\".\n       Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n    But note: the problem says \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", meaning there won't be a chord that is both.\n\n    However, let me test with a known major and minor.\n\n    Example: Major: ['C','E','G'] -> [0,4,7]\n        Permutation: (0,4,7): \n            (4-0)%12 = 4, (7-4)%12 = 3 -> major.\n\n    Example: Minor: ['C#','B','F'] -> [1,10,5] -> but wait, we have to consider the circularity. The example orders as \"B C# F\", which is [10,1,5]. \n        Then: (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3, and (5-1)%12=4 -> so minor.\n\n    But wait, how do we generate the permutation [10,1,5]? The original set is [1,10,5]. We have to consider every permutation.\n\n    Important: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, so we consider every ordering.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest. In the example, the ordering \"B C# F\" is considered. \n        But note: the note B (10) is followed by C# (1) which is 11 semitones later? Actually, we are taking the modulo 12, so the distance from B to C# is (1-10+12)%12=3, which is correct.\n\n    But wait, in the circle, the note C# (1) is actually the next note after B (10) because 10 (B) -> 11 (H) -> 0 (C) -> 1 (C#). But the direct distance from B to C# is 3 semitones (B to C# is one sharp, so two half steps? Actually, from B to C is 1, and then C to C# is 1, so total 2? \n\n    Let me recount the semitones from B to C#:\n        B -> C (1 semitone) -> C# (another semitone) -> so 2 semitones? \n\n    But wait, the problem's example says: \"between B and C# will be 3 semitones\". \n\n    Let me check the note sequence:\n\n    The full chromatic scale (with our numbering):\n\n    0: C\n    1: C#\n    2: D\n    3: D#\n    4: E\n    5: F\n    6: F#\n    7: G\n    8: G#\n    9: A\n    10: B\n    11: H\n\n    Now, from B (10) to H (11) is 1 semitone, then from H (11) to C (0) is 1 semitone (because 0 is the next, but note: 11 to 0 is 1 step? Actually, the distance from 10 to 11 is 1, and from 11 to 0 is 1, so from 10 to 0 is 2? \n\n    Alternatively, the problem defines the distance from E to C as 8 semitones. From E (4) to C (0): \n        Steps: E->F:1, F->F#:2, F#->G:3, G->G#:4, G#->A:5, A->B:6, B->H:7, H->C:8. So yes, 8.\n\n    Now, from B (10) to C (0): \n        Steps: B->H:1, H->C:2 -> so 2 semitones? But wait, the example says 3 semitones.\n\n    What's the issue? \n\n    The example says: \"if we order the notes as 'B C# F'\", then between B and C# is 3 semitones.\n\n    Let's count from B to C#:\n\n        B (10) -> then the next note is H (11) -> then the next is C (0) -> then C# (1). \n        But wait, the example counts from B to C# as 3 semitones. \n\n    Actually, the example says: the chord is given as \"C# B F\", and they order it as \"B C# F\". \n\n    In the circle, the note B is 10, then the next note is C#? That is not adjacent. \n\n    Let me list the notes from B (10) in the circle:\n\n        B (10) -> then next is H (11) -> then next is C (0) -> then C# (1) -> then D (2) -> ... \n\n    So the distance from B to C# is: \n        B (10) to H (11): 1 semitone\n        H (11) to C (0): 1 semitone (because 0 is the next after 11, and 0-11 is 1 mod12)\n        C (0) to C# (1): 1 semitone\n        Total: 3 semitones.\n\n    So the distance from B to C# is 3. Similarly, from C# (1) to F (5): \n        C# (1) to D (2): 1\n        D (2) to D# (3): 1\n        D# (3) to E (4): 1\n        E (4) to F (5): 1 -> total 4.\n\n    So the example is correct.\n\n    Therefore, the mapping is correct.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    Steps:\n    - Map the input notes to integers.\n    - Generate all 6 permutations.\n    - For each permutation (a, b, c):\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3: return \"major\"\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4: return \"minor\"\n\n    But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. However, the condition for major requires two specific consecutive intervals. But the entire chord must form a major/minor triad. \n\n    However, we are checking all orders. But note: the chord has three notes, and we are only checking the consecutive intervals. \n\n    But wait: the condition for major is that the three notes form a pattern of 4 and 3, which gives a total of 7. This is independent of the absolute position. \n\n    However, we must consider that the circle is modulo 12. The condition does not require the notes to be in the order of increasing numbers. \n\n    But note: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n    We are generating all permutations, so we are checking every possible ordering.\n\n    However, there is a catch: the chord might be considered in a different octave. But the problem considers the circle of 12, so we are doing modulo 12.\n\n    Example: [0,4,7] is major. \n        Permutations: \n          (0,4,7): 4 and 3 -> major found.\n\n    Example: [1,10,5] (which is C#, B, F) -> we have to consider the permutation (10,1,5): \n        (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3, (5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n    But wait, what about other permutations? \n        (0,1,5) is not the same as (10,1,5). The mapping is fixed. \n\n    However, the note B is 10, and C# is 1. In the circle, 10 and 1 are separated by 3 (as above). \n\n    But note: the input is given as three distinct notes, so we don't have duplicates.\n\n    Let me code accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. So we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily.\n\n    One more example: the input \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11]\n\n    Check for major: \n        We need a permutation (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12==4 and (c-b)%12==3.\n        Let's try (9,10,11): \n            (10-9)=1 -> not 4\n            (11-10)=1 -> not 3\n        (9,11,10): \n            (11-9)=2, (10-11)= -1 %12=11 -> no.\n        (10,9,11): (9-10)%12=-1%12=11, then (11-9)=2 -> no.\n        (10,11,9): (11-10)=1, (9-11)=-2%12=10 -> no.\n        (11,9,10): (9-11)= -2%12=10, (10-9)=1 -> no.\n        (11,10,9): (10-11)= -1%12=11, (9-10)= -1%12=11 -> no.\n\n    So \"A B H\" is strange.\n\n    Code:\n\n    Steps:\n    - Build the mapping dictionary.\n    - Read the input, split, and map to integers.\n    - Generate all permutations of the three integers.\n    - Check each permutation for major and minor.\n\n    However, note: we can break early if we find one.\n\n    But note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we can break once we find either a major or a minor.\n\n    But wait, could a chord be both major and minor? The problem says no, so we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n    However, we must check all permutations because we don't know which one will satisfy the condition. But we can break if we find one.\n\n    Alternatively, we can check for major first and then minor, and if we find one, we output immediately.\n\n    But note: the problem says the chord is either major, minor, or strange. So if we find a major, we output \"major\" and exit. Similarly for minor.\n\n    However, we must check all permutations until we find one of the conditions.\n\n    Let me code accordingly.\n\n    But note: we have to consider that the same chord might be represented in different octaves, but our modulo 12 mapping takes care of that.\n\n    Code:\n\n    import itertools\n\n    note_to_int = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n\n    s = input().strip()\n    notes = s.split()\n\n    # Map the notes to integers\n    try:\n        nums = [note_to_int[note] for note in notes]\n    except KeyError:\n        # According to the problem, the input is from the given set, but just in case.\n        # But the problem says the input is space-separated notes in the given notation.\n        # So we assume no KeyError.\n        print(\"strange\")\n        exit(0)\n\n    # Generate all permutations of nums\n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(nums))\n\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n\n    for p in perms:\n        a, b, c = p\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n    However, wait: the example \"C E G\" is [0,4,7] and we found major. But what if we have a chord that can be interpreted in two ways? The problem says it's unambiguous.\n\n    But note: the condition for major is 4 and 3, and minor is 3 and 4. These are distinct. \n\n    However, let me test with a diminished chord or something else? \n\n    Example: [0,3,7] -> \n        Check: \n          (3-0)=3, (7-3)=4 -> minor condition? But wait, the condition for minor is 3 and 4, so that would be minor? \n          But [0,3,7] is not a minor triad. The minor triad must have the root, then 3, then 7 (if we consider the root as 0) is not standard.\n\n    Actually, the standard minor triad is root, then 3 (minor third) and then 7 (perfect fifth). But wait, the minor third from root is 3 semitones, and then from the third to the fifth is 4 semitones? \n\n    In standard music theory, the minor triad is built as:\n        Root: 0\n        Third: 3 (minor third: 3 semitones)\n        Fifth: 7 (perfect fifth: 7 semitones from root)\n\n    But wait, the condition in our code for minor is that the consecutive intervals are 3 and 4. \n\n    In the minor triad, the entire chord is {0,3,7}. We can order it as (0,3,7): \n        (3-0)%12=3, (7-3)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n    But wait, the example chord \"C E G\" is major, and \"C Eb G\" would be minor. However, the problem does not have Eb. But the example input \"C# B F\" is minor.\n\n    Another example: \"C Eb G\": \n        C=0, Eb=3, G=7 -> [0,3,7] -> minor.\n\n    But wait, the problem example \"C# B F\" is minor. Our code would work.\n\n    However, what if we have a chord that is both? \n        Condition for major: 4 and 3\n        Condition for minor: 3 and 4\n\n        They are different. So a chord cannot be both.\n\n    Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n    But wait: the example \"C E G\" is major, but also the same notes in a different order? \n\n    Let me test the code with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: Input \"C E G\"\n        notes: ['C','E','G'] -> [0,4,7]\n        Permutations: \n            (0,4,7): d1=(4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major -> found_major=True.\n\n    Example 2: Input \"C# B F\"\n        notes: ['C#','B','F'] -> [1,10,5]\n        We must find a permutation that gives (d1=3, d2=4). \n        We found (10,1,5): d1=(1-10)%12= (1-10+12)=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n    Example 3: Input \"A B H\"\n        [9,10,11] -> no permutation satisfies the conditions.\n\n    So the output: ['major','minor','strange'] as expected.\n\n    However, note: the example input is given as a single line with three space separated notes.\n\n    But wait, the example input is given as:\n        Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n    But our program reads one line. So we are good.\n\n    But note: the input might have different spacing? The problem says \"space separated\", so we split by space.\n\n    However, what if the input has extra spaces? The strip() and split() should handle that.\n\n    Let me run the code with the examples.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \"C E G\"\n        Output: \"major\"\n\n    Example 2: \n        Input: \"C# B F\"\n        Output: \"minor\"\n\n    Example 3:\n        Input: \"A B H\"\n        Output: \"strange\"\n\n    It matches.\n\n    However, wait: the example input \"C# B F\" is given as a string with three tokens: ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\n    But note: the mapping for '#' and 'B' and 'H' is defined.\n\n    One more edge: what if the input has a note that is not defined? The problem says the input is from the given set, but we use a dictionary and if not found, we output \"strange\". \n\n    But the problem says the input is from the given set, so we don't expect KeyError. However, we included a try-except to handle it, but then we print \"strange\" and exit. \n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        nums = []\n        for note in notes:\n            if note in note_to_int:\n                nums.append(note_to_int[note])\n            else:\n                nums.append(None)   # and then if any is None, we mark as invalid.\n\n    But the problem says the input is from the given set, so we don't need to worry. \n\n    However, let me change the code to be safe: if any note is not in the dictionary, then we output \"strange\".\n\n    But wait, what if one note is invalid and the others are valid? Then the chord is invalid and we output \"strange\".\n\n    Alternatively, we can break the problem: the chord must consist of three distinct notes from the set. If any note is missing, then it's not a valid chord and we output \"strange\".\n\n    We can do:\n\n        if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n            # But wait, if we have duplicate notes? The problem says set, so distinct. \n            # But if there's a duplicate, then the chord is invalid. However, the input has three space separated notes, but if two are the same, then the set size is less than 3.\n\n        However, the problem says \"unordered set\", so duplicates are not allowed. \n\n    But the problem does not explicitly say the three notes are distinct. It says \"exactly three notes\", and a set by definition has distinct elements. \n\n    However, the example inputs are distinct.\n\n    But the problem says: \"the teacher has given to him\", and the input is three space separated notes. \n\n    We'll assume the input has three distinct notes? \n\n    Actually, the problem says \"exactly three notes\", so duplicates would break the set. \n\n    But the problem does not specify if the teacher gives three distinct notes. \n\n    However, the example: \"C E G\" are distinct.\n\n    Since the problem says \"an unordered set\", I think we can assume distinct. \n\n    But if there are duplicates, then the chord has less than three distinct notes, so it's not a triad. \n\n    Therefore, we can check: if the set of the mapped integers has size 3, then proceed. Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n    But wait, what if two notes are the same? Then we have two same and one different. Then the condition for major/minor requires three distinct notes. \n\n    Example: two Cs and one E: [0,0,4]. Then the permutations would have two zeros. Then the distances: (0-0)=0, (4-0)=4 -> doesn't match.\n\n    So we can simply check: if the set of the three notes (by their integer representation) has size 3.\n\n    Steps:\n        if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n            print(\"strange\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    But wait, what if the input has three identical notes? Then set size is 1.\n\n    However, the problem says \"exactly three notes\", so three identical notes is not a set (because sets don't have duplicates) but the input has three same. \n\n    According to the problem, the chord is an unordered set, so duplicates are not allowed. \n\n    So we can do:\n\n        if len(set(notes)) != 3:   # but wait, what if two Cs and one E? Then set(notes) would have two elements: {'C','E'} -> size 2, which is not 3.\n\n    But we are mapping to integers. Alternatively, we can check the set of the original notes? \n\n    Actually, the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So the input must have three distinct note names? \n\n    However, note: two different note names can map to the same integer? No, because we defined the mapping as a bijection.\n\n    So the set of integers is the same as the set of note names.\n\n    But wait, the note names are distinct in the mapping. \n\n    So if the input has two identical note names, then the set of integers will have less than 3.\n\n    Example: \"C C E\" -> set(['C','C','E']) -> set size 2, so we output \"strange\".\n\n    But what if the input has two identical notes and one different? Then the chord is not a triad.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        if len(set(notes)) != 3:\n            print(\"strange\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    However, the problem does not explicitly say the input has distinct notes, but the definition of chord (set) implies distinct.\n\n    But the problem says \"exactly three notes\", so we assume distinct.\n\n    Alternatively, we can check the set of the mapped integers. \n\n    Let me change the code to:\n\n        if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n            print(\"strange\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    But wait, what if two different note names map to the same integer? Our mapping is bijective, so that won't happen.\n\n    Therefore, we can do either.\n\n    However, the problem says the input is from the given set, so we assume distinct note names.\n\n    But to be safe, we can check the set of the original note strings? \n\n    Actually, the problem says the input is three space separated notes. They are distinct by the set definition.\n\n    But the problem does not specify, so let's stick to the integer set.\n\n    Alternatively, we can note that if the set of integers has size less than 3, then the chord is invalid.\n\n    However, the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So if we have duplicates, then the set has less than three.\n\n    So I'll add:\n\n        if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n            print(\"strange\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    But wait, what if the input is \"C# C#\", \"D\", \"E\"? Then the set of integers: [1,2,4] -> size 3. But wait, the note names: two C# -> so the set of note names would be {'C#','D','E'} -> size 3, but the set of integers is {1,2,4} -> size 3. \n\n    Actually, the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. The input \"C# C# D\" would be invalid because the set would have two C#. \n\n    But wait, the input is three space separated notes. If the input has two identical note names, then we have two same notes. \n\n    In our mapping, two identical note names map to the same integer. So the set of integers would have size 2.\n\n    Therefore, we can check the set of integers.\n\n    However, the problem does not say the input has distinct note names, but the chord is defined as a set. \n\n    But the problem says \"three space-separated notes\", so we are given three tokens. \n\n    So the input \"C# C# D\" is three tokens. The chord is {C#, D} (two distinct notes) and that is not a three-note chord.\n\n    Therefore, we must check that the set of the three input note names (or the set of their integer representations) has size 3.\n\n    But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So the input must be three distinct note names.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n            print(\"strange\")\n            exit(0)\n\n    However, the problem does not specify that the input has distinct note names, but the definition of the chord requires distinct notes.\n\n    But wait, the example inputs are distinct.\n\n    We'll assume that the input may have duplicates, and then we output \"strange\" because the chord must have three distinct notes.\n\n    Alternatively, we can check the input tokens for duplicates.\n\n    But the problem says the chord is an unordered set, so duplicates are not allowed.\n\n    Let me update the code.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry about ambiguous cases beyond major/minor.\n\n    But having duplicates is not ambiguous: it's not a triad.\n\n    So we'll check that the three notes are distinct.\n\n    But note: the example input \"C E G\" has distinct notes.\n\n    Final code:\n\n        import itertools\n\n        note_to_int = { ... }\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        notes = s.split()\n\n        # If the input has less than 3 tokens, then we cannot form a chord? But the problem says three space separated notes.\n        if len(notes) != 3:\n            print(\"strange\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        try:\n            nums = [note_to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Integers**: Each musical note is mapped to an integer (0 to 11) representing its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, etc.). This allows us to compute the intervals between notes using simple arithmetic.\n2. **Checking Permutations**: For each permutation of the three input notes, we calculate the intervals between consecutive notes. A major chord requires intervals of 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor chord requires intervals of 3 and 4 semitones.\n3. **Validation**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor chord, we immediately return the result. If no permutation meets either criterion, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_int = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    notes = s.split()\n    \n    if len(notes) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        nums = [note_to_int[note] for note in notes]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(nums))\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for p in perms:\n        a, b, c = p\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The dictionary `note_to_int` maps each note to its corresponding integer value, facilitating interval calculations.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual notes. If the input does not contain exactly three notes, the chord is immediately deemed \"strange\".\n3. **Validation Checks**: The code checks if all three notes are distinct (using a set) and handles any invalid notes by printing \"strange\".\n4. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, the code calculates the intervals between consecutive notes. If any permutation matches the interval patterns of a major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord, the result is printed accordingly.\n5. **Result Determination**: If no valid chord configuration is found after checking all permutations, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes to determine their chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
