For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. We need to determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number in a 12-note circle. The notes are: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'] (note: H is the same as B? Actually, wait: the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And the circle: ... C, then after H comes C again.\n\n But note: the example input includes \"A B H\", and the example output is 'strange'. Also, the example says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (if going from E up to C, which is actually two octaves? but wait, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". However, they also say that the notes are cyclic and we can wrap around.\n\n However, the problem states: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\"\n\n So we can assign numbers to the notes. Let's create a list of the 12 notes in order:\n\n notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n Wait, wait! There's a catch: the example input has \"C# B F\", and it's considered minor. Also, the example says the note set is cyclic. But note: the example ordering for \"C# B F\" is \"B C# F\": \n   B -> C#: 3 semitones? \n   Let's map:\n     B is at index 10, C# is at index 1 (because after H which is index 11, the next is C at index 0, then C# at index 1). \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"after H goes C again\", so the circle is:\n\n  0: C\n  1: C#\n  2: D\n  3: D#\n  4: E\n  5: F\n  6: F#\n  7: G\n  8: G#\n  9: A\n  10: B\n  11: H   [Wait, the problem says 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 distinct notes. Then note that the example says \"after H goes C\", meaning that the next note after H (index 11) is C (index 0). So the note list must be:\n\n  0: C\n  1: C#\n  2: D\n  3: D#\n  4: E\n  5: F\n  6: F#\n  7: G\n  8: G#\n  9: A\n  10: B\n  11: H\n\n However, the example input \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's break down:\n\n  Input: ['C#', 'B', 'F']\n\n  We have to check if we can order them such that either:\n    Option 1: (for major) 4 semitones then 3 semitones.\n    Option 2: (for minor) 3 semitones then 4 semitones.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"unordered set\", so we can arrange the three notes arbitrarily. We need to consider all cyclic orders and also the possibility of wrapping.\n\n  However, because the circle is 12, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute the distances between the three notes, but we have to account for the circular nature.\n\n  Approach:\n\n  Step 1: Map the input notes to their indices.\n\n  Example: \"C# B F\"\n      C# -> 1\n      B -> 10\n      F -> 5\n\n  Now, we have three numbers: [1, 5, 10]. We need to arrange these in a circle and check for a consecutive pattern of 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\n  But note: the chord is defined by three distinct notes. We have to consider the distances between the notes in the circle.\n\n  How to compute the distance between two notes in a circular way?\n\n  The distance from note i to note j (in the direction of increasing index) is (j - i) % 12. But wait, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. \n\n  Let's map E and C:\n      E is index 4, C is index 0. The direct distance from E to C without wrapping would be negative, but we can go forward: from E to F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C: that's 8 steps (from 4 to 0: 4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->0: 8 steps).\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute the clockwise distance from i to j as (j - i) % 12, but if negative we adjust. Actually, the clockwise distance from i to j is (j - i) % 12, but if j < i, then (j - i) % 12 = (j-i+12) % 12. However, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8, which is (0-4) mod 12? But 0-4 is negative, so (0-4+12) %12 = 8. That matches.\n\n  So, the distance from note i to note j (in the forward direction) is (j - i) % 12, but if negative we add 12 and then mod 12.\n\n  However, note: the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest. But in a chord, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. So we are looking for an ordering of the three notes (in a circular manner) such that the distances between consecutive notes (in the chosen order) are 4 and 3 (with the total being 7) for major, or 3 and 4 for minor.\n\n  But wait, the chord is defined by three notes. The entire set must form a sequence of three notes with the given intervals.\n\n  However, the definition does not require the three notes to be consecutive in the circle without gaps? Actually, the chord is defined by three notes, and the condition is that when ordered appropriately (in the circle) the distances are 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor). But note: the entire span from X to Z is 7 semitones (because 4+3=7). This means that the three notes must form a contiguous segment of 7 semitones (which is 7/12 of an octave). \n\n  But wait, let me clarify: the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to pick any starting point and then the next two notes in the circle. However, we don't require the notes to be consecutive in the circle without skipping, but the condition is on the consecutive distances.\n\n  Actually, the condition is: \n    Major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        dist(X, Y) = 4 semitones\n        dist(Y, Z) = 3 semitones\n\n    Minor: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n        dist(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n        dist(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n  Note: the ordering must be along the circle in increasing tone (so the notes must appear in that order when moving forward in the circle).\n\n  But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So we are not allowed to go backwards? \n\n  However, the example \"C# B F\" is reordered as \"B C# F\". Let's check:\n\n      B (index10) to C# (index1): \n          Forward from B to C#: Since the circle goes B->H->C->C#, we have to go from index10 to index1: \n          The distance is (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 + 12 - 10) %12 = 3 %12 = 3 -> 3 semitones.\n\n      Then from C# (index1) to F (index5): (5-1)=4 semitones.\n\n  So that gives 3 and 4 -> minor.\n\n  So we are considering the forward (clockwise) distance.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Map the input notes to their indices (0-11).\n  2. Generate all permutations of the three notes (each permutation is a candidate ordering).\n  3. For a given ordering (a, b, c), check:\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12   [but if negative, adjust by adding 12 and then mod? Actually, we can use modulo arithmetic: (b - a) % 12 might give a negative? In Python, negative modulo gives positive? Actually, no: (b - a) % 12 might be negative if b<a? Let me fix: we want the forward distance. We can do: \n            d_forward = (b - a) % 12   # This doesn't work if b < a because (b-a) is negative, then %12 gives a result in [0,11] but we want the smallest nonnegative. However, the forward distance from a to b should be the same as (b - a) mod 12, but if b < a, then we wrap around: (b - a) % 12 is negative? Actually, in Python, negative modulo is handled by adding multiples of 12 until positive.\n\n        But note: we are only concerned with the absolute forward distance (without backward). The definition says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone\" and the distance is from the lowest to the uppest. However, in our circle, we have defined the notes in increasing order. But when we have a set of three notes, we can arrange them in the circle arbitrarily.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the chord is unordered. But the condition requires an ordering. We are allowed to choose any starting point and then move in the forward direction.\n\n  But wait: the example \"C E G\": \n      Notes: C, E, G -> indices: 0, 4, 7.\n      Ordering: C, E, G: \n          d1 = (4-0) %12 = 4 -> 4 semitones.\n          d2 = (7-4) %12 = 3 -> 3 semitones. -> major.\n\n      Also, we can try other orderings?\n      Ordering: E, G, C: \n          d1 = (7-4)%12 = 3\n          d2 = (0-7)%12 = (0-7+12)%12 = 5 -> not 4, so fails for minor.\n\n      Ordering: G, C, E: \n          d1 = (0-7)%12 = 5\n          d2 = (4-0)%12 = 4 -> then we have 5 and 4, which is neither 3 and 4 nor 4 and 3.\n\n      But note: the condition is that the entire set must be arranged so that the consecutive distances (in the chosen forward direction) are the required ones. However, the chord is defined by three notes and the condition must hold for the entire set.\n\n  Important: The problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\".\n\n  So we are allowed to choose any cyclic ordering (any starting point) and then the next two in the forward direction.\n\n  But note: the circle has 12 notes, so the entire set of three notes must lie within a span of 7 semitones (because 4+3=7) for the chord to be major or minor? \n\n  Actually, the condition is that the three notes must form two intervals of 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) when arranged in the forward direction. However, note that the entire set of three notes might not necessarily be consecutive in the circle without gaps? \n\n  Let me think: the definition says \"an unordered set\", and the condition is about the distances between consecutive notes in the forward direction. So we are effectively looking for three distinct notes that form an arithmetic progression (with steps 4 and 3) in the circle.\n\n  But note: the circle is cyclic. We have to check all three possible starting points and the two directions? Actually, the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest, so we are always moving forward (increasing tone). \n\n  However, we have three notes and we can start at any one. So we have three candidates for the first note, and then the next two must follow in the forward direction.\n\n  But wait: the example \"C# B F\": \n        Ordering: B, C#, F: \n            B (10) -> C# (1): (1-10+12) %12 = 3 -> 3 semitones.\n            C# (1) -> F (5): (5-1) %12 = 4 -> 4 semitones -> minor.\n\n        But what if we start at C#: \n            C# (1) -> F (5): 4 semitones.\n            F (5) -> B (10): (10-5)=5 -> 5 semitones. -> not 3.\n\n        What if we start at F?\n            F (5) -> B (10): 5 semitones.\n            B (10) -> C# (1): (1-10+12)=3 -> 3 semitones. -> then we have 5 and 3, which is not 4 and 3 nor 3 and 4.\n\n        So only one ordering works.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n  Let the three indices be a, b, c.\n\n  We consider the three circular arrangements (each starting point):\n\n      Option 1: [a, b, c]\n          d1 = (b - a) % 12\n          d2 = (c - b) % 12   [then the total from a to c is (c-a)%12 = (d1+d2)%12, but we don't need that]\n\n      But wait, we must ensure that the entire set is traversed in the forward direction without wrapping too much? Actually, the condition is just about consecutive distances.\n\n  However, note: the forward direction must be the same for the entire chord. But the chord is defined by three notes. The condition does not require that the entire chord is contained in a single octave? Actually, the example \"C E G\" is contained in one octave (from C to G is 7 semitones, which is less than 12). But what if the chord spans more than 12? Actually, the circle is 12, so the maximum distance between two notes is 6 (if we take the shorter arc). However, the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest (so the long way around is not considered). \n\n  But note: the example says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (which is the long way). However, the condition for the chord requires two consecutive distances: 4 and 3. The example \"C E G\" uses the short way (from C to E is 4, E to G is 3, and then from G back to C would be 5, but we don't need that). \n\n  So the condition is: we are only considering the forward direction, and the entire set must be arranged so that the two consecutive intervals (from the first to second, and second to third) are the specified ones.\n\n  However, note: the chord is defined by three distinct notes, and the set must form a contiguous segment in the forward direction (without skipping any note in between for the consecutive pairs). But wait, the condition doesn't require that the entire segment from the first to the third is exactly 7 semitones? Actually, the two intervals add up to 7. So the entire segment from the first to the third is 7 semitones. \n\n  Therefore, the three notes must lie in a segment of 7 semitones (i.e., 8 notes including the endpoints, but we are taking three specific ones). \n\n  But note: the circle has 12 notes. The segment of 7 semitones (which is 8 notes) is fixed. \n\n  However, we can also consider the possibility that the chord wraps around the circle. For example, what if the three notes are [10, 0, 1]? \n      This is the example above. The segment from 10 to 1 is 3, and from 1 to 5 is 4. \n\n  How do we handle wrapping? Our modulo operation naturally handles that.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n  Let the three notes be mapped to indices: i, j, k.\n\n  We'll generate all six permutations? Actually, we only need three starting points and then the two possible directions? But note: the condition requires the forward direction (the increasing tone). \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the starting note. So we can start at any of the three. Then we have two possibilities for the next two notes: the next note in the forward direction and then the following one.\n\n  But wait: the circle is fixed. We have three distinct notes. We can arrange them in 3! = 6 ways. However, the circle is cyclic so some arrangements are equivalent? \n\n  Actually, the condition is that the three notes must be arranged in a linear sequence (not circular) of two intervals. But the definition does not require the entire circle, so we can break the circle at the starting point.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      For each permutation (x, y, z) of the three notes (each permutation being an ordered triple), compute:\n\n          d1 = (y - x) % 12\n          d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n          Then check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) for major or (3,4) for minor.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are only allowed to go forward (the circle is fixed and we don't go backward). However, in our modulo, we are computing the forward distance (the minimal forward distance? Actually, no: the modulo operation we are using gives the forward distance from x to y, even if it wraps around. But wait, the example from E to C: \n          E (index4) to C (index0): (0-4) %12 = (0-4+12)%12 = 8. So that is correct.\n\n      However, we must note: the condition requires that the entire set of three notes forms a consecutive sequence of two intervals (so the entire set must be contained in an interval of 7 semitones). But wait, if we have a chord that wraps around the circle, then the forward distance from the last note to the first note is not considered. The condition only considers two consecutive intervals (from first to second and second to third). \n\n      Example: [10, 0, 1] (which is B, C, C#) -> \n          Ordering: [10,0,1]: \n              d1 = (0-10+12) %12 = 2 -> not 3 or 4.\n          Ordering: [10,1,0]: \n              d1 = (1-10+12)%12=3, d2=(0-1)%12= (0-1+12)%12=11 -> fails.\n          Ordering: [0,10,1]:\n              d1 = (10-0)%12=10, d2=(1-10+12)%12=3 -> fails.\n          Ordering: [0,1,10]:\n              d1=(1-0)%12=1, d2=(10-1)%12=9 -> fails.\n          Ordering: [1,0,10]:\n              d1=(0-1+12)%12=11, d2=(10-0)%12=10 -> fails.\n          Ordering: [1,10,0]:\n              d1=(10-1)%12=9, d2=(0-10+12)%12=2 -> fails.\n\n      But wait, the example input was \"C# B F\", which is [1,10,5]. We already saw that [10,1,5] (i.e., starting at B, then C#, then F) works.\n\n      How did we get that? We started at B (10), then C# (1) and then F (5). \n\n      So we must consider all six permutations.\n\n  However, we can also note: the condition requires that the two intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). The entire span from the first to the third must be (d1+d2) %12? Actually, the entire span from the first to the third is (d1+d2) if we don't wrap, but if we wrap, then the entire span from the first to the third is (d1+d2) %12? Not exactly: the entire span from the first to the third is (z-x) %12, and we know that (z-x) %12 = (d1+d2) %12.\n\n  But the condition does not require the entire span from the first to the third to be 7. It requires the consecutive intervals to be 4 and 3 (so 7). However, if the chord wraps around, then the entire span from the first to the third might be 10 (for example) but the condition only looks at the two consecutive intervals.\n\n  Actually, the condition is defined by the consecutive distances, so we don't care about the entire span from the first to the third beyond the two intervals.\n\n  Therefore, we can check all six permutations.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      1. Map the input string to three indices (0-11) using the list: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n      2. Generate all permutations of these three indices (there are 6).\n      3. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n            But wait: the modulo operation in Python for negative: \n                (y-x) %12: if y>=x, then (y-x)%12 is y-x, else (y-x+12)%12.\n\n            However, we want the forward distance. The forward distance from x to y is the smallest nonnegative number of steps to go from x to y in the forward direction. And that is indeed (y-x) %12, but if y-x is negative, then we add 12 until positive and then mod 12.\n\n            Example: x=10, y=1: (1-10) %12 = (-9)%12 = 3 (since -9 + 12 = 3). So that's correct.\n\n      4. Check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) or (3,4). \n\n      5. If we find at least one permutation that satisfies (4,3) then print \"major\".\n         If we find at least one permutation that satisfies (3,4) then print \"minor\".\n\n      6. If we found both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\" So we don't have to worry about that.\n\n      7. Otherwise, print \"strange\".\n\n  However, wait: what if the same chord can be arranged in multiple ways? For example, could there be two different orderings that satisfy the condition for the same type? According to the problem, no ambiguity.\n\n  But note: the condition is for the entire set to be arranged so that the consecutive distances are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). We are checking all orderings.\n\n  Example: \"C E G\" (0,4,7): \n      Permutation (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 -> major.\n      Other permutations: \n          (0,7,4): d1= (7-0)=7, d2=(4-7+12)=9 -> no.\n          (4,0,7): d1=(0-4+12)=8, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n          (4,7,0): d1=3, d2=(0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n          (7,0,4): d1=(0-7+12)=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n          (7,4,0): d1=(4-7+12)=9, d2=(0-4+12)=8 -> no.\n\n      Only one ordering for major.\n\n  Another example: minor chord \"C# B F\" (1,10,5): \n      We already saw the ordering (10,1,5): \n          d1 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3\n          d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> minor.\n\n      Are there any other orderings for this chord that yield minor?\n          Let's check all permutations:\n\n          (1,10,5): d1=(10-1)=9, d2=(5-10+12)=7 -> no.\n          (1,5,10): d1=4, d2=5 -> no.\n          (10,5,1): d1=(5-10+12)=7, d2=(1-5+12)=8 -> no.\n          (10,1,5): found one.\n          (5,1,10): d1=(1-5+12)=8, d2=(10-1)=9 -> no.\n          (5,10,1): d1=(10-5)=5, d2=(1-10+12)=3 -> no.\n\n      Only one.\n\n  But wait: what if the chord is symmetric? According to the problem, there are no chords that are both major and minor.\n\n  However, let me test a known minor chord and see if by chance it can also be arranged as a major? \n\n  Example: minor chord E, G, B? \n      E (4), G (7), B (10)\n      Check for major: we need an ordering (x,y,z) such that (x,y,z) has consecutive distances 4 and 3.\n      One candidate: E, G, B: \n          d1 = (7-4)=3 -> not 4.\n      Another candidate: E, B, G: \n          d1 = (10-4)=6, d2=(7-10+12)=9 -> no.\n      Another candidate: G, B, E: \n          d1 = (10-7)=3, d2=(4-10+12)=6 -> no.\n      Another candidate: G, E, B: \n          d1 = (4-7+12)=9, d2=(10-4)=6 -> no.\n      Another candidate: B, E, G: \n          d1 = (4-10+12)=6, d2=(7-4)=3 -> no.\n      Another candidate: B, G, E: \n          d1 = (7-10+12)=9, d2=(4-7+12)=9 -> no.\n\n      Now, check for minor: \n          We need an ordering with consecutive distances 3 and 4.\n          E, G, B: 3 and 3 (from E to G is 3, from G to B is 3) -> no.\n          E, B, G: 6 and 5 -> no.\n          G, B, E: 3 and 6 -> no.\n          G, E, B: 9 and 3 -> no.\n          B, E, G: 6 and 3 -> no.\n          B, G, E: 9 and 9 -> no.\n\n      So E, G, B is not recognized as either? \n\n      But wait, E, G, B is a minor chord? Actually, the minor chord is built by root, minor third (3 semitones) and then a fifth (7 semitones from root). The fifth from E is 7 semitones: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->A#->B -> wait, that's 7 steps from E to B? Actually, E to B is 7 semitones (E-F:1, F-F#:2, F#-G:3, G-G#:4, G#-A:5, A-A#:6, A#-B:7). But wait, our mapping: \n          E is 4, B is 10 -> (10-4)=6, but that's the direct step without wrapping? \n\n      Actually, the circle: \n          E (4) to B (10): 10-4=6 -> 6 semitones? \n          But the minor chord requires the third to be 3 semitones above the root? Then the fifth is 7 semitones above the root. \n\n      Let me map the notes correctly:\n\n          Root: E (index4)\n          Minor third: E+3 semitones: E->F->F#->G -> so G is 7 semitones above E? Actually, wait:\n\n          E -> F (1), F->F#(2), F#->G(3) -> so from E to G is 3 semitones? \n\n          Actually, the note after E is F (index5), then F# (index6), then G (index7). So E to G is 7-4=3? No, wait: index difference: 7-4=3 -> that's 3 semitones. \n\n          Then the fifth: from E to B: \n          E (4) to B (10): 10-4=6 -> 6 semitones? But the fifth should be 7 semitones (because a perfect fifth is 7 semitones). \n\n          Correction: the perfect fifth is 7 semitones. From E: \n            E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, C (which is 7 semitones above E). But wait, the note B is the seventh note above E? \n\n          Actually, the notes:\n\n          E (4), F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10) -> so from E to B is 6 steps (semitones) because each index step is one semitone.\n\n          But wait, the entire octave from E to E (next octave) is 12 semitones. The fifth is 7 semitones. So from E, 7 semitones: \n            E (0), F(1), F#(2), G(3), G#(4), A(5), A#(6), B(7) -> wait, that would be B is the seventh semitone above E? \n\n          Actually, the note names: \n            E -> F (1st), F# (2nd), G (3rd), G# (4th), A (5th), A# (6th), B (7th) -> so B is the seventh note above E, but the note names don't match the index assignment.\n\n          Our index assignment:\n\n          0: C\n          1: C#\n          2: D\n          3: D#\n          4: E\n          5: F\n          6: F#\n          7: G\n          8: G#\n          9: A\n          10: B\n          11: H\n\n          So from E (4) to B (10) is 6 semitones. But the fifth should be 7 semitones. \n\n          Wait, the standard minor chord is built as: root, minor third (3 semitones), and then a fifth (7 semitones). \n\n          From E: \n            root: E (4)\n            minor third: E + 3 semitones -> index 4+3=7 -> G (which is correct)\n            fifth: E + 7 semitones -> index 4+7=11 -> H (which is index11). \n\n          But wait, the example chord \"E G B\" is actually the chord with E, G, and B. \n\n          The note B is at index10, and H is at index11. \n\n          So the chord \"E G B\" is not the standard minor chord? \n\n          Actually, the standard minor chord is E, G, B (with B being the natural note) and that is indeed a minor chord. But according to our index, E to B is 6 semitones, but the fifth should be 7. \n\n          Let me recalc the distance from E to B in the circle:\n\n          The circle: \n            E (4) -> F(5) -> F#(6) -> G(7) -> G#(8) -> A(9) -> B(10) -> then next is H (11) and then C (0). \n\n          The distance from E to B is 10-4=6, but the fifth is 7 semitones. \n\n          However, the fifth of E is B? \n\n          Actually, in music theory, the fifth of E is B (naturally). But wait, the fifth of E is the note that is 7 semitones above E. \n\n          E -> F (1), F->F#(2), F#->G(3), G->G#(4), G#->A(5), A->A#(6), A#->B(7). So yes, B is the 7th semitone above E. \n\n          But in our list, the note after A is B (index10) and then H (index11) is the next. \n\n          This implies that our list of 12 notes is missing the sharp/flat representations? \n\n          Actually, the problem states the 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n          This is unusual because typically we have B and H as distinct (B is the minor seventh and H is the diminished octave? or something else). \n\n          Wait, the problem says: \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" \n\n          And then: \"after H goes C again\".\n\n          So the note after H (index11) is C (index0). \n\n          Then the note after B (index10) is H (index11). \n\n          So the circle is: ... A, B, H, C ...\n\n          Then the distance from E (4) to B (10) is 6 semitones, but the standard fifth is 7. \n\n          This indicates that the note B is not the same as the note B in the standard Western music? \n\n          Actually, in some systems, B and H are used interchangeably. But in standard music, B is the same as B, and H is sometimes called B double-flat (bb). \n\n          The problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", and the list is fixed.\n\n          So the note after E (4) is F (5), then F# (6), then G (7), then G# (8), then A (9), then B (10) -> that's 6 steps from E to B, which is 6 semitones. Then the next is H (11) which is a semitone above B.\n\n          Therefore, the standard fifth (7 semitones) from E is H (index11). \n\n          So the chord \"E G B\" (notes E, G, B) is not the standard minor chord? \n\n          Actually, the standard minor chord is E, G, B (using the natural minor). But in our system, the note B is the sixth semitone above E, so the chord E, G, B is:\n\n          E to G: 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to a unique index (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six possible permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. The forward distance between two notes is computed using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Classifying the Chord**: The chord is classified as:\n   - **Major** if any permutation has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor** if any permutation has intervals of 3 and 4 semitones.\n   - **Strange** if neither condition is met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    input_str = input().split()\n    \n    indices = []\n    for note in input_str:\n        idx = notes_list.index(note)\n        indices.append(idx)\n        \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_list` array maps each note to its respective index (e.g., 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc.). The input notes are converted into their corresponding indices.\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all six possible orderings of the three input notes are generated.\n3. **Interval Calculation**: For each permutation, the forward distances between consecutive notes are calculated. The modulo operation ensures correct distance calculation even when wrapping around the circular scale.\n4. **Chord Classification**: The code checks if any permutation meets the major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord conditions. If only one condition is met, the chord is classified accordingly; otherwise, it is labeled \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutation generation and modulo arithmetic for accurate interval calculation.",
