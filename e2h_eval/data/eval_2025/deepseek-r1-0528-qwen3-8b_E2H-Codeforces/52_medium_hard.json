Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a burned candle.\n   - We can use 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n Steps:\n   We start with 'a' candles. We burn them all (each gives 1 hour) and then we have 'a' burned candles.\n   Then, we can convert some burned candles into new ones: specifically, we can make floor(a / b) new candles from the burned ones, and we are left with a % b burned candles.\n\n However, note that the new candles we made can also be burned and then they too will become burned candles. So we can continue the process until we don't have enough burned candles (less than b) to make a new candle.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 2\" leads to 7 hours.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n   Start with 4 candles.\n   Burn them: 4 hours, and now we have 4 burned candles.\n   Convert 4 burned candles into 2 new candles (since 4//2 = 2) and we have 0 leftover burned candles from this conversion? Actually, we use up 4 burned candles to make 2 new ones, so we get 2 new candles and we have 0 burned left from the previous set.\n\n   Now burn these 2 new candles: 2 more hours (total 6). Then we have 2 burned candles.\n   Now, we cannot make a new candle because 2 < 2 (if b=2, then we need at least 2 to make one). So we stop.\n\n   But wait, the example says 7 hours. What's the catch?\n\n   Actually, in the example, after burning the initial 4 candles, we have 4 burned. Then we use 2 pairs (each pair makes one candle) so we get 2 candles. Then we burn those 2 candles and then we have 2 burned again. Then we use the 2 burned to make 1 candle (because 2//2=1), and then burn that candle (1 hour) and then we have 1 burned which is not enough to make another candle. So total hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n   Therefore, we must account for the fact that the burned candles from the newly made candles can be used again.\n\n   We can model it as:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   burned_candles = 0\n\n   However, an efficient way is to simulate:\n\n   Step 1: We burn all the candles we have (current_candles) -> adding current_candles to total_hours and then we get current_candles burned candles.\n\n   Then, we can convert the burned candles into new candles: \n        new_candles = burned_candles // b\n        remaining_burned = burned_candles % b\n\n   But note: the burned candles we have are exactly the number of candles we just burned. Then we use some of them to make new candles. However, after making new candles, we burn them and they become burned again.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   total = a   (hours from the initial candles)\n   leftover = a   (these are the burned candles from the first round)\n\n   Then, while leftover >= b:\n        new_candles = leftover // b\n        total += new_candles   (because we burn these new_candles for an hour each)\n        leftover = leftover % b + new_candles   (the leftover from the division plus the new burned candles from burning the new ones)\n\n   But wait, let's test with a=4, b=2:\n\n        Step 0: total=4, leftover=4\n        Since 4>=2: \n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2, total becomes 6\n            leftover = 4%2 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2\n        Then 2>=2: \n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1, total becomes 7\n            leftover = 2%2 + 1 = 0+1 = 1\n        Then 1<2 -> stop.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: initially Vasily has a candles. He lights them all and then uses the burned ones. Then he gets new candles and lights them, etc.\n\n   We can code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the input might be large? The constraints say a and b are between 1 and 1000. So the simulation loop should run at most around 1000/b which is at least 1 and at most 1000. Since 1000 is small, we can use a while loop.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Read a and b.\n\n   total = 0\n   leftover = 0\n\n   However, we start with a candles. We haven't burned any yet. So we can consider:\n\n   Step 1: We have a new candles (the initial ones). We burn them: so we add a hours and then we have a burned candles (leftover).\n\n   Then, we can use the leftover burned candles to make more candles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can combine:\n\n   total = 0\n   leftover = 0\n   current = a   # current candles we have to burn\n\n   But wait, we have to account for the fact that we can use the burned candles from the initial ones and then from the newly made ones.\n\n   Actually, we can think of the entire process as:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candle_count = a\n   burned_count = 0\n\n   However, a simpler way is to use the following:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current >= 1:\n        total_hours += current   # burn all current candles\n        # Now, these burned candles are current (each candle gives one burned candle)\n        # Then, we can convert these burned candles into new candles: current // b, and we have current % b burned candles left over (that we didn't use)\n        # Then, we also get new burned candles from the new candles we just made: which is the same as the number of new candles we made (each new candle when burned will give one burned candle).\n        # But wait, we don't burn the new candles until the next iteration. However, the problem is that we can only use the burned candles from the current batch to make the next batch, and then we burn the next batch and so on.\n\n        # Actually, the process is: \n        #   After burning the current candles, we have 'current' burned candles.\n        #   We use as many as possible (in multiples of b) to create new candles. The leftover burned candles are saved for the next round.\n        #   Then, the new candles we created are added to the current count for the next burning.\n\n        # But note: the above while condition: we break when current becomes 0? Actually, we break when we don't have any candles to burn.\n\n        # However, there's a nuance: we can have leftover burned candles that we didn't convert. We don't burn them separately, but they are carried over.\n\n        # Let me restructure:\n\n        # We start with a candles (current). We burn them -> total_hours += current, then we have 'current' burned candles.\n        # Then, we form new candles from the burned ones: new_candles = current // b, and leftover_burned = current % b.\n        # Then, we set current = new_candles (for the next round) and we keep the leftover_burned to add later?\n\n        # Actually, we can simulate without having two variables by combining the leftovers.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # total_hours = 0\n        # leftover = 0\n        # while True:\n        #   current_round_candles = leftover + a_remaining ?   No, because we start with a.\n\n        # Let me use:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = 0\n        #   while leftover >= b or a > 0? \n\n        # Actually, we can think of the process as:\n\n        #   total += current_candles   (burning the current_candles)\n        #   Then, we get current_candles burned, so we can make new_candles = (current_candles + leftover_from_previous_round) // b?\n        #   But wait, the initial step: we start with a candles. Then we burn them and get a burned, then we use those to make a//b and leave a % b.\n\n        #   Then we have new_candles (which are the ones we made) and we can burn them in the next round, and then we get new burned candles (which are the same as the number of new_candles) and we also have the leftover from the previous round.\n\n        #   However, note that the leftover from the previous round is already accounted for. So we can combine:\n\n        #   total_hours = 0\n        #   current = a   # current candles available (to burn)\n        #   while current > 0:\n        #       total_hours += current\n        #       # Now, we get current burned candles (from burning current candles)\n        #       # How many new candles can we make? (current burned candles) // b, and we'll have (current burned candles) % b left.\n        #       # Then, the new candles become the current for the next iteration (if we don't have any leftover from before) but note: we might have leftover from previous rounds? Actually, no, because we are processing sequentially.\n\n        #   But wait, the above while loop would not account for the fact that the leftover from the burned candles of the current round is carried over to the next.\n\n        #   We can do:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   current = a\n        #   while current > 0:\n        #       total += current\n        #       # Now, we have current burned candles (from burning current candles)\n        #       # Then, we can convert these burned candles into new candles: \n        #       new_candles = current // b\n        #       remainder = current % b\n        #       current = new_candles   # because we use the burned candles to make new_candles, and then we have the remainder (if any) that we can carry over? \n\n        #   But wait, we are not accounting for the remainder. The remainder is the burned candles that were not used to make a new candle. We should keep that.\n\n        #   Let me adjust:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   current = a   # the candles we have to burn in the current round\n        #   leftover = 0  # the leftover burned candles from previous rounds? Actually, no. We start with no leftover.\n\n        #   Then, we burn the current candles (so total += current) and then we get current burned candles (which is the same as the current we just burned). Then we use these burned candles (along with any leftover?) to make new candles.\n\n        #   Actually, we need to accumulate the burned candles from each round. So:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = 0\n        #   while True:\n        #       current_round_candles = leftover   # because leftover is the burned candles from previous rounds that we didn't convert\n        #       if current_round_candles == 0 and a==0: break? Not exactly.\n\n        #   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = a   # initially we have a candles to burn, then we burn them and get a burned candles, then we use them to make new ones.\n\n        #   Then, while leftover >= b:\n        #       new_candles = leftover // b\n        #       total += new_candles   # because we burn these new_candles (each for one hour) but wait, we haven't burned them yet in this round? Actually, we are counting the hours from burning the initial and then the new ones.\n\n        #   This doesn't match.\n\n        #   Let me try the method that worked for the example:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   current = a\n        #   while current >= 1:\n        #       total += current\n        #       # Now, we have current burned candles (from burning current candles)\n        #       # We use these burned candles to make new ones, and we are left with (current % b) burned candles that we cannot use (or rather, we use floor(current / b) to make new candles, and the remainder is leftover for the next round.\n        #       # But note: the new candles we made will be burned in the next round, so we don't add them to total until we burn them. However, we are going to burn them in the next iteration.\n\n        #       # But wait, the next iteration we don't have the new candles unless we account for them.\n\n        #   We can do:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   current = a\n        #   while current > 0:\n        #       total += current\n        #       # Now, we have current burned candles (from this round)\n        #       # Then, we can make new_candles = current // b, and we have remainder = current % b\n        #       # Then, we set current = new_candles + remainder   ??? \n\n        #   Let's test with a=4, b=2:\n\n        #   Round1: current=4\n        #       total=4\n        #       new_candles = 4//2 = 2, remainder=0\n        #       Then current = 2 + 0 = 2\n        #   Round2: current=2\n        #       total=6\n        #       new_candles=2//2=1, remainder=0\n        #       Then current=1+0=1\n        #   Round3: current=1\n        #       total=7\n        #       new_candles=1//2=0, remainder=1\n        #       Then current=0+1=1 -> infinite loop.\n\n        #   But wait, after Round2, we have 1 candle from the conversion, and we burn it in Round3. Then we get 1 burned candle, which we cannot convert (since 1<2). Then we break.\n\n        #   However, the above while loop condition is current>0, so we break when current becomes 0. But in Round3 we set current=1 (from remainder) and then we burn it (so we add 1) and then we compute new_candles=0 and remainder=1, then set current=0+1=1 again.\n\n        #   We are stuck in an infinite loop because after burning the last candle we get a leftover that we don't burn again.\n\n        #   Correction: we don't burn the leftover separately. The leftover is the burned candles that we cannot use to make a new candle, and they are not burned again. So we should not consider them as current candles for burning. \n\n        #   Actually, the process is:\n\n        #   We start with a candles. We burn them: that's a hours. Then we have a burned candles.\n        #   Then, we use the burned candles to make new ones. Then we have (a // b) new candles and (a % b) leftover burned candles (which we cannot use until we have more).\n\n        #   Then, we can burn the new candles (each gives 1 hour) and then we get (a//b) burned candles from that burning, and we also have the leftover (a % b). Then we combine: (a//b) + (a % b) burned candles, and then we can make floor((a//b + a % b)/b) new candles, and so on.\n\n        #   But note, we are burning the new candles and then they become burned. And the leftover from the first round is still there.\n\n        #   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = 0\n        #   current_batch = a\n        #   while True:\n        #       # Burn the current_batch (if any) and add to total\n        #       total += current_batch\n        #       # Now, we have current_batch burned candles from this batch, and we also have leftover from previous batches\n        #       total_burned = current_batch + leftover\n        #       new_batch = total_burned // b\n        #       leftover = total_burned % b\n        #       current_batch = new_batch\n        #       if current_batch == 0 and leftover == 0:\n        #           break\n\n        #   But wait, we can break when current_batch becomes 0 (since then we have no new candles to burn) and leftover might be non-zero but less than b so we cannot form a new candle.\n\n        #   Actually, we can break when current_batch is 0 and leftover is less than b (so no new candle can be made). However, we can break when current_batch==0 and leftover==0? Actually, even if current_batch is 0 and leftover>=b, we can still make a new candle. So we cannot break only on current_batch==0.\n\n        #   Let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n        #   Initial: current_batch=4, leftover=0\n        #   total=4\n        #   total_burned=4+0=4\n        #   new_batch=4//2=2, leftover=0\n        #   current_batch=2\n\n        #   Then: total=4+2=6\n        #   total_burned=2+0=2\n        #   new_batch=2//2=1, leftover=0\n        #   current_batch=1\n\n        #   Then: total=6+1=7\n        #   total_burned=1+0=1\n        #   new_batch=1//2=0, leftover=1\n        #   current_batch=0 -> then we break? But we have leftover=1 which is not enough to make a candle. So we break.\n\n        #   This gives 7.\n\n        #   Now, second sample: a=6, b=3\n\n        #   total=0, leftover=0, current_batch=6\n        #   First round: total=6, total_burned=6, new_batch=6//3=2, leftover=0\n        #   Second round: total=8, total_burned=2, new_batch=2//3=0, leftover=2 -> then break.\n\n        #   So output 8, which matches.\n\n        #   However, note that in the second round, we have 2 burned candles (from the 2 candles we burned) and no leftover from before. Then we can't make a new candle. So we break.\n\n        #   But what if we have leftover from the first round and then in the second round we get more burned candles? \n\n        #   Example: a=5, b=3\n        #   First round: \n        #       current_batch=5, total=5, total_burned=5, new_batch=5//3=1, leftover=2\n        #   Second round:\n        #       current_batch=1, total=6, total_burned=1+2=3, new_batch=3//3=1, leftover=0\n        #   Third round:\n        #       current_batch=1, total=7, total_burned=1, new_batch=0, leftover=1 -> break.\n\n        #   Total hours=7.\n\n        #   But let's verify:\n        #       Start with 5 candles: burn 5 -> 5 hours, then we have 5 burned. Convert 5 burned: 5//3=1 new candle, and 2 burned left.\n        #       Then burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour -> total 6, and then we have 1 (from this new candle) + 2 (leftover) = 3 burned. Then we make 1 more candle from the 3, burn it: 1 hour -> total 7, and then we have 1 burned (from this last candle) which is not enough.\n\n        #   So the answer is 7.\n\n        #   However, note that the above method accumulates the burned candles from the current batch and the leftover from the previous rounds.\n\n        #   But wait, the above method does:\n\n        #       total += current_batch\n        #       total_burned = current_batch + leftover\n        #       new_batch = total_burned // b\n        #       leftover = total_burned % b\n        #       current_batch = new_batch\n\n        #   Then we break when current_batch becomes 0? Actually, we break when we don't have any current_batch and the leftover is not enough to form a new candle? But note, the condition for breaking is that we cannot form a new candle. However, we break when current_batch becomes 0 and then the next round we would have to use leftover (which is stored) to form new_batch. But our loop condition is while True, and we break only at the end of the iteration if we don't have a next batch? Actually, we break when we cannot form a new candle? We don't break explicitly until the last step.\n\n        #   Actually, the above code doesn't break until the next round would not produce a current_batch. But we are updating current_batch to new_batch, and then we go to the next iteration. The next iteration uses current_batch (which is 0) and then we do:\n\n        #       total += 0   (so no change)\n        #       total_burned = 0 + leftover   (if leftover is 1, then total_burned=1)\n        #       new_batch = 1 // b (if b>=2 then 0) -> so next current_batch=0.\n\n        #   Then we are stuck in an infinite loop because we keep doing nothing (adding 0) and then the same leftover.\n\n        #   Therefore, we need to break when current_batch becomes 0 and the leftover is insufficient (i.e., less than b) to form a new candle. But note, we update current_batch from new_batch, and then we use leftover from the previous step. \n\n        #   Alternatively, we can break when new_batch becomes 0 and leftover < b.\n\n        #   However, the above method does not require breaking in the middle of the loop because we set current_batch to new_batch and then the next iteration uses current_batch. We break only when we have no more candles to burn (current_batch becomes 0) and then we break? But wait, we break when we finish the iteration and then check if we can continue? \n\n        #   Actually, the problem is that after the last iteration, we don't want to do an extra iteration that adds nothing.\n\n        #   We can break when current_batch becomes 0 and leftover < b. But how do we know that? \n\n        #   Alternatively, we can break when current_batch is 0 and leftover < b, but we are updating current_batch from new_batch. \n\n        #   Another idea: we break the loop when we cannot form any new candles (i.e., total_burned < b). But note, we break after the current_batch is set to 0 and then we don't want to continue.\n\n        #   Actually, we can break at the beginning of the loop if current_batch==0 and leftover < b. But we don't know the leftover at the beginning of the loop.\n\n        #   Alternatively, we can break after the computation of new_batch and leftover, and then set current_batch to new_batch. Then, if current_batch==0 and leftover < b, we break. But note, we have to update total and leftover first.\n\n        #   Let me restructure:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = 0\n        #   current_batch = a\n        #   while current_batch > 0 or leftover >= b:   # This condition is not sufficient because if current_batch==0 and leftover>=b, we can still make a candle.\n\n        #   Actually, we can break only when both current_batch==0 and leftover < b.\n\n        #   But we don't know the leftover until we compute it. So:\n\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = 0\n        #   current_batch = a\n        #   while True:\n        #       total += current_batch\n        #       total_burned = current_batch + leftover\n        #       new_batch = total_burned // b\n        #       leftover = total_burned % b\n        #       current_batch = new_batch\n        #       if current_batch == 0 and leftover < b:\n        #           break\n\n        #   Then, for a=4, b=2:\n\n        #   Iteration1:\n        #       current_batch=4, leftover=0\n        #       total=4\n        #       total_burned=4, new_batch=2, leftover=0\n        #       Condition: 2>0 -> don't break, so continue.\n        #   Iteration2:\n        #       current_batch=2, leftover=0\n        #       total=6\n        #       total_burned=2, new_batch=1, leftover=0\n        #       Condition: 1>0 -> don't break.\n        #   Iteration3:\n        #       current_batch=1, leftover=0\n        #       total=7\n        #       total_burned=1, new_batch=0, leftover=1\n        #       Condition: 0==0 and 1<2 -> break.\n\n        #   This works.\n\n        #   But wait, what if we have leftover from previous rounds and current_batch==0? For example, a=3, b=2:\n\n        #   First round: \n        #       current_batch=3, total=3\n        #       total_burned=3, new_batch=3//2=1, leftover=1\n        #       Then current_batch=1, and condition: 1>0 -> continue.\n        #   Second round:\n        #       current_batch=1, total=4\n        #       total_burned=1+1=2, new_batch=2//2=1, leftover=0\n        #       Condition: 1>0 -> continue.\n        #   Third round:\n        #       current_batch=1, total=5\n        #       total_burned=1+0=1, new_batch=0, leftover=1\n        #       Condition: 0==0 and 1<2 -> break.\n\n        #   Expected: \n        #       Start with 3: burn 3 -> 3 hours, then we have 3 burned -> make 1 new candle (using 2 burned) and leave 1 burned.\n        #       Then burn the 1 new candle -> 1 hour, total 4, then we have 1 (from the new candle) + 1 (leftover) = 2 burned -> make 1 new candle, burn it: 1 hour, total 5, then we have 1 burned (from the last candle) -> cannot make new candle.\n\n        #   So 5 hours. The above code gives 5.\n\n        #   Another example: a=10, b=5\n        #       First round: 10 -> total=10, total_burned=10, new_batch=2, leftover=0 -> then current_batch=2.\n        #       Second round: 2 -> total=12, total_burned=2, new_batch=0, leftover=2 -> break. So 12 hours.\n\n        #   But let's check: \n        #       10 candles: 10 hours, then 10 burned -> 2 new candles (using 10/5=2). Then burn 2: 2 hours -> total 12, then 2 burned -> cannot make a new candle (needs 5). So 12 is correct.\n\n        #   However, wait: after burning the 2 new candles, we have 2 burned candles. Then we can't make a new one. So 10+2=12.\n\n        #   The above algorithm seems correct.\n\n        #   But note: the condition for breaking is: current_batch==0 and leftover < b.\n\n        #   However, what if we have current_batch==0 and leftover>=b? Then we continue. That is correct because we can still make more candles.\n\n        #   Example: a=3, b=5 -> \n        #       First round: current_batch=3, total=3, total_burned=3, new_batch=0, leftover=3 -> then condition: 0==0 and 3<5 -> break. So total=3.\n        #       Correct: we start with 3, burn them -> 3 hours, then we have 3 burned -> cannot make a candle.\n\n        #   One more: a=1, b=2 -> total=1, then total_burned=1, new_batch=0, leftover=1 -> break. So 1 hour.\n\n        #   So the code:\n\n        #   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        #   total = 0\n        #   leftover = 0\n        #   current_batch = a\n        #   while True:\n        #       total += current_batch\n        #       total_burned = current_batch + leftover\n        #       new_batch = total_burned // b\n        #       leftover = total_burned % b\n        #       current_batch = new_batch\n        #       if current_batch == 0 and leftover < b:\n        #           break\n\n        #   print(total)\n\n        #   However, note: in the first iteration, we are using the initial 'a' as current_batch and leftover=0.\n\n        #   But wait, what if b is greater than a? Then we don't break in the first iteration? Actually, we do: \n        #       total = a, then total_burned = a, then new_batch = a//b (which is 0 if a < b) and leftover = a % b (which is a). Then condition: current_batch==0 and a < b -> true, so break.\n\n        #   Example: a=2, b=3 -> total=2, then condition: 0==0 and 2<3 -> break. Correct.\n\n        #   This satisfies.\n\n        #   But note: the problem states that b>=2 and a>=1.\n\n        #   However, we can also use a mathematical formula for efficiency, but the constraints are small (max 1000) so the while loop will run at most about log_b(a) times, which is very small.\n\n        #   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        #   There's a slight inefficiency: we are burning the current_batch and then updating, but the current_batch might be 0 and we break. However, the condition at the beginning of the loop is that we break only when current_batch==0 and leftover < b.\n\n        #   But note: the first time, we set current_batch = a, which is at least 1, so we enter the loop.\n\n        #   We'll read the input and then use the above algorithm.\n\n        #   However, we can optimize by not iterating one extra time if we break after the update.\n\n        #   But the above code is clear and efficient for the given constraints.\n\n        #   Let's code accordingly.\n\n        #   But wait, the example input format: the input is a single line containing two integers, a and b.\n\n        #   Example: \"4 2\"\n\n        #   We read with: \n        #       data = input().split()\n        #       a = int(data[0])\n        #       b = int(data[1])\n\n        #   Then apply the algorithm.\n\n        #   However, note: the problem says the input is two integers, so we can do:\n\n        #   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n        #   Then run the while loop.\n\n        #   But note: the condition in the while loop: we break when current_batch==0 and leftover < b.\n\n        #   One more edge: if a==0, then we break immediately. But a>=1 per the problem.\n\n        #   Code:\n\n        a_val, b_val = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        leftover_burned = 0\n        current_batch = a_val\n\n        while True:\n            total_hours += current_batch\n            total_burned = current_batch + leftover_burned\n            new_batch = total_burned // b_val\n            leftover_burned = total_burned % b_val\n            current_batch = new_batch\n\n            if current_batch == 0 and leftover_burned < b_val:\n                break\n\n        print(total_hours)\n\n        # Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        # Example 1: \"4 2\" -> 7\n        # Example 2: \"6 3\" -> 8\n\n        # It should work.\n\n        # However, note: the above while loop condition breaks after we have updated current_batch and leftover_burned. This is correct.\n\n        # But wait, there is a possibility to break earlier: if we have no current_batch and no leftover_burned, then we break. But our condition is leftover_burned < b_val, which is always true if leftover_burned is 0 (since 0 < b_val, and b_val>=2). So we break.\n\n        # However, the condition is: if current_batch==0 and leftover_burned < b_val -> break.\n\n        # This condition is correct.\n\n        # We are done.\n\nHowever, note that there is an alternative solution that uses a while loop without tracking leftover separately, but the above solution is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, there's a known simpler solution for this problem:\n\n    hours = a\n    while a >= b:\n        hours += a // b\n        a = a // b + a % b\n\n    Then print(hours)\n\nBut wait, let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n    hours=4\n    while 4>=2: \n        hours += 4//2 = 2 -> hours=6\n        a = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0 = 2\n    Then 2>=2: \n        hours += 2//2 = 1 -> hours=7\n        a = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1+0=1\n    Then 1<2 -> break.\n\n    Output 7.\n\n    Now, a=6, b=3:\n        hours=6\n        while 6>=3:\n            hours += 6//3=2 -> 8\n            a = 6//3 + 6%3 = 2+0=2\n        Then 2<3 -> break.\n\n    Output 8.\n\n    This is the same result.\n\n    Why is this working?\n\n    Explanation: \n        In the first step, we use the initial a (4) to burn and get 4 hours. Then we use the 4 burned candles to make 4//b = 2 new candles. Then we set a to the new state: the new candles (2) plus the leftover burned (0) -> 2.\n        Then we burn the 2 new candles: 2 hours, so total 6. Then we use the 2 burned candles to make 2//b=1 new candle, and then set a to 1 (from the new candle) plus the leftover 0 -> 1.\n        Then we burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour, total 7, and then we have 1 burned candle (and no other burned) so we cannot make more.\n\n    The difference is that in this method, we are updating 'a' to be the number of candles we have for the next round (which is the new candles we made and the leftover burned from the previous round). But note: the burned candles from the current round are not separate because we use them to make the next batch.\n\n    However, this method does not account for the fact that the leftover burned candles from the previous round are combined with the current burned candles (from burning the current batch) to form the next batch. But wait, in the above code, we are not accumulating the leftover from the previous round. \n\n    Actually, the code above does:\n\n        hours = a\n        while a >= b:\n            additional = a // b   # the new candles we can make from the current a (which is the burned candles from the previous round and the current batch we are about to burn? Actually, no)\n\n    Let me clarify:\n\n    The variable 'a' is being reused. Initially, a is the initial number of candles. Then, in the first iteration, we use a to burn and then we use a to make new candles. Then we set a to the new state (which is the new candles plus the leftover from the division). Then we burn the new state (as the next a) and so on.\n\n    But wait, in the first iteration, we haven't burned the initial a? Actually, the initial a is used as the starting value for the while condition and then we burn it (implicitly by the next iterations). \n\n    Actually, the code above is a common solution for this problem. But note: the first assignment is:\n\n        hours = a\n\n    Then, the while loop condition is based on a (the current number of candles we have). Then, we use a to make new candles: a//b, and then update a to be the new candles plus the leftover (a % b). Then the next iteration we burn the updated a (which represents the candles we have for the next hour) and then we use that to make new candles.\n\n    However, the initial a is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using a given number of initial candles and the ability to create new candles from burned ones. The key insight is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle, which can be combined with other burned candles to create new ones. The process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input values, which are the initial number of candles (a) and the number of burned candles needed to create a new one (b).\n2. **Simulate the Burning Process**: \n   - **Initial Burning**: The initial number of candles (a) is burned, contributing 'a' hours to the total.\n   - **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning the initial candles, the number of new candles that can be made is calculated by dividing the total burned candles (initial candles plus any leftover from previous cycles) by 'b'. The remainder from this division represents the leftover burned candles that cannot be used to form a new candle.\n   - **Update State**: The new candles created become the current batch for the next iteration, and the process repeats until there are not enough burned candles (leftover plus new candles) to form even one more candle.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the current batch of candles is zero and the leftover burned candles are insufficient to form a new candle (i.e., less than 'b').\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_val, b_val = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    leftover_burned = 0\n    current_batch = a_val\n\n    while True:\n        total_hours += current_batch\n        total_burned = current_batch + leftover_burned\n        new_batch = total_burned // b_val\n        leftover_burned = total_burned % b_val\n        current_batch = new_batch\n        \n        if current_batch == 0 and leftover_burned < b_val:\n            break\n            \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading two integers, 'a_val' (initial candles) and 'b_val' (burned candles needed per new candle).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `total_hours` (to accumulate the total burning time), `leftover_burned` (burned candles not used to form new ones), and `current_batch` (candles to be burned in the current iteration) are initialized.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues indefinitely until the termination condition is met. In each iteration:\n   - **Burning Current Batch**: The current batch of candles is burned, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n   - **Calculating New Candles**: The total burned candles (current batch plus leftovers) are divided by 'b_val' to determine how many new candles can be made. The remainder represents the leftover burned candles.\n   - **Update for Next Iteration**: The `current_batch` is set to the number of new candles, and `leftover_burned` is updated to the remainder.\n4. **Termination Check**: If no new candles can be made (`current_batch` is zero) and there are not enough leftover burned candles to form a new one (`leftover_burned` is less than 'b_val'), the loop exits.\n5. **Output**: The total accumulated hours (`total_hours`) is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources until no further candles can be made.",
