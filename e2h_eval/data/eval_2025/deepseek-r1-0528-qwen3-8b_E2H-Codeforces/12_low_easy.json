The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) from 1 to n, and we start at house 1, we can traverse clockwise.\n\n The key is that we must complete tasks in the given order. However, note that the ring is circular and we can wrap around.\n\n Observation: \n We start at house 1. Then for each consecutive task, we need to move from the previous task location to the next task location.\n\n But note: the movement is only clockwise. Therefore, when going from a current house 'x' to the next task house 'y', we can consider:\n Option 1: Go directly if y >= x, then distance = y - x.\n Option 2: If y < x, then we have two ways: \n   One way is to go clockwise until we reach y, which would be (n - x + y). \n   But note: since we are in a circle, we can also break the journey as: first go from x to 1 (if necessary) and then from 1 to y? Actually, the ring is circular and we can only move clockwise.\n\n However, note: because the ring is one-way and clockwise, when we are at house x and want to go to house y (which is less than x), we must go from x to n and then from 1 to y? Actually, the ring has houses 1,2,...,n and then back to 1. So the direct clockwise path from x to y (when y < x) is to go from x to x+1, x+2, ... until n, then 1, then 2... until y. The total steps would be (n - x + y).\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire circle as having two segments: \n   Segment 1: from x to n (if any) and then from 1 to y (if any). This is (n - x) + y.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to break the journey arbitrarily. But the problem is that we must do the tasks in order.\n\n Steps:\n Let's denote our current position as `cur`. Initially, cur = 1.\n\n Then for each task location `a_i` (in order), we calculate the distance from `cur` to `a_i`:\n\n   if a_i >= cur:\n        distance += (a_i - cur)\n   else:\n        distance += (n - cur + a_i)\n\n Then update `cur` to `a_i`.\n\n But wait: is that always optimal? Because we can wrap multiple times? However, note that we are only moving clockwise and the ring is fixed. The above formula gives the minimal steps for one segment.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6.\n\n Let's simulate with the above method:\n\n   Start at 1.\n\n   First task: 3\n        since 3>=1: distance += (3-1)=2. Now current=3.\n\n   Second task: 2\n        since 2<3: distance += (4-3+2) = 1+2 = 3. Total distance=5, but expected is 6.\n\n   Third task: 3\n        from 2 to 3: 3>=2 -> distance += (3-2)=1. Total=6.\n\n   So the simulation matches the example.\n\n However, let me check the second example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n   Start at 1.\n\n   First task: 2\n        distance += (2-1)=1. Current=2.\n\n   Second task: 3\n        distance += (3-2)=1. Current=3.\n\n   Third task: 3: no movement. Total=2.\n\n   Which matches.\n\n But wait, why did the first example give 6? Let me break down the moves:\n\n   Start at 1 -> 2: 1 step (total=1)\n   Then from 2 to 3: 1 step (total=2)\n   Then from 3 to 4: 1 step (total=3)\n   Then from 4 to 1: 1 step (total=4) [because the next task is at 2, so we need to go from 3 to 2? But wait, we are at 3 and the next task is 2. Then we go 3->4 (step5) and 4->1 (step6) and then 1->2 (step7)? \n\n Wait, that doesn't match. Actually, the example says the sequence is: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. That's 6 steps.\n\n But according to our breakdown, we did:\n   1->2: 1 step (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit each task location in the given order, moving only clockwise. The challenge is to calculate the shortest path between consecutive task locations, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 (the initial position).\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task location in sequence:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, move directly to it by adding the difference between the task location and the current position to the total time.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, move to the end of the ringroad (house `n`) first, then proceed to the task location. The distance in this case is calculated as `(n - current_position) + task_location`.\n3. **Update Current Position**: After processing each task, update the current position to the task location for the next iteration.\n4. **Output Total Time**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement by breaking down each segment into straightforward arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current) + a\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location, the code checks if it is ahead of the current position (in the clockwise direction). If so, it adds the direct distance to the total time. If the task is behind, it calculates the distance by wrapping around the ring (from current position to the end of the ring and then to the task location), updating the total time accordingly.\n- **Updating Position**: After processing each task, the current position is updated to the task's location to ensure the next movement is based on the correct starting point.\n- **Output**: Finally, the accumulated total time is printed, representing the minimal time required to complete all tasks in order.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal travel time by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.",
