A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Each toast requires:\n    - nl milliliters of drink per toast (so total for a toast is nl)\n    - 1 slice of lime (each lime gives d slices, so total limes used per toast is 1/d? Actually, each toast uses one slice, and we have c limes each cut into d slices -> total slices = c * d)\n    - np grams of salt per toast\n\n 2. However, note that the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n 3. We are to make as many toasts as possible, and each friend must drink the same amount.\n\n 4. The constraints are:\n    - Total drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Total lime slices available: c * d.\n    - Total salt available: p grams.\n\n 5. But note: the toasts are shared by all friends. The requirement is per friend per toast.\n\n 6. Let t be the number of toasts each friend makes. Then the total number of toasts is n * t.\n\n    Conditions:\n    - Drink: total drink needed = n * t * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n    - Lime: total lime slices needed = n * t * 1 <= c * d   => t <= (c * d) / (n)   [because each toast uses one slice, so n*t toasts use n*t slices]\n    - Salt: total salt needed = n * t * np <= p           => t <= p / (n * np)\n\n 7. Therefore, the maximum t (number of toasts per friend) is the minimum of the three values:\n\n    t_max = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )   ??? \n\n But wait: note that the drink condition: \n        n * t * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n Similarly, lime: \n        n * t <= c * d        => t <= (c*d) / n\n\n Salt:\n        n * t * np <= p      => t <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, note: the numbers are integers and we are to output an integer. We cannot have a fraction of a toast.\n\n But the problem says: \"Print a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\"\n\n Since we are dealing with integer division, we should take the floor of the minimum value? \n\n However, note: the example: \n    Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n    Here, n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n    Drink: total_ml = 4*5 = 20. Each toast requires 3 ml, and for 3 friends: 3 * t * 3 = 9*t ml. So t <= 20/9 -> about 2.22 -> so maximum t from drink is 2 (since we can't have 2.22 toasts).\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)   -> 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n\n    But wait: actually, the condition for drink is that the total drink must be at least n * t * nl. We are using integer division? But note: the example does:\n\n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (this 6 is the total toasts if we ignore friends) but then we have to divide by the number of friends? \n\n    Actually, let me re-read the example explanation:\n\n        Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts.\n\n        Then, because there are 3 friends, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n    So they are calculating:\n\n        total_drink_milliliters = 20 -> toasts from drink: 20 / 3 (ml per toast) = 6.66... -> but they take floor? Actually, the example says 6 (if we do integer division) but 20/3 is 6.666... and then they take 6? \n\n    However, note: the example does not say they",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can partake equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on three constraints: the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves determining how many toasts can be made by each resource independently and then taking the minimum of these values. This ensures that no resource is exceeded while allowing all friends to have the same number of toasts.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm computes the maximum possible toasts from each resource (drink, lime slices, salt) and then finds the smallest value among them. This value is derived by dividing the total available resource by the requirement per toast multiplied by the number of friends.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, resulting in constant time complexity O(1), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = data\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    toasts_by_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(toasts_by_drink, toasts_by_lime, toasts_by_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, and requirements per toast.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Drink**: Total available drink is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle. The number of toasts supported by the drink is found by dividing the total drink by the product of the number of friends and the drink requirement per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total available lime slices is the product of the number of limes and slices per lime. The number of toasts supported by lime slices is the total slices divided by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total available salt is given directly. The number of toasts supported by salt is the total salt divided by the product of the number of friends and the salt requirement per toast.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three calculated toasts determines the answer, ensuring all resources are sufficient for the chosen number of toasts per friend.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed as an integer, representing the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.",
