They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge (u, v) has two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n Conditions for an edge (a, b) [where a and b are the numbers of mushrooms on the two lawns]:\n   Let g = gcd(a, b) and l = lcm(a, b). Then we know that:\n        g * l = a * b   (this is a fundamental property)\n\n Also, note that:\n        g must divide both a and b.\n        l must be divisible by g.\n\n Moreover, we know that for two numbers a and b, we can write:\n        a = g * x, and b = g * y, where gcd(x, y) = 1.\n        Then, the LCM would be g * x * y.\n\n So, from the edge (g, l), we have:\n        a * b = g * l   (because g * l = a * b)\n        and also, since a and b are multiples of g, and their LCM is l, then we must have:\n        l = g * x * y, so x * y = l // g.\n\n But note: if the edge gives (g, l), then we must have that g divides l (otherwise, no solution for that edge) and also that l//g is the product of two coprime integers x and y.\n\n However, we don't know which edge to assign which value. The entire graph must be consistent.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For each edge, we can compute the product P = g * l. Then, the two numbers (a, b) must satisfy a*b = P.\n    Also, note that g must divide a and b. Therefore, we can set:\n        a = g * x, b = g * y, with x*y = l//g and gcd(x,y)=1.\n\n    But note: it is also necessary that g divides both a and b, and the LCM condition (which is automatically satisfied if we set the numbers as above).\n\n 2. However, the problem is that we have multiple edges and the same lawn might appear in several edges. We need to assign a number to each lawn such that for every edge (u, v) with given (g, l), the conditions hold.\n\n 3. Observing the constraints (n, m up to 10^6? Actually, the input says n, m and then m lines, but the constraints on GCD and LCM are up to 10^6, and n, m are not specified beyond the fact that they are nonnegative integers, but we can assume typical competitive programming constraints, e.g., n, m <= 10^5 or similar). We must design an efficient algorithm.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can think of the following:\n\n Let the number at node i be A[i]. Then for an edge (u, v) with given (g, l):\n        g = gcd(A[u], A[v])\n        l = lcm(A[u], A[v])\n\n And note: \n        A[u] * A[v] = g * l.\n\n Also, we know that A[u] and A[v] must be multiples of g, and the LCM is l. Moreover, if we factorize g and l, we can get the prime factors.\n\n However, a direct factorization for each edge (with g and l up to 10^6) might be too heavy if we do it for each edge, especially since there could be many edges.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can consider building a system of equations for the exponents of primes, but the problem does not specify the primes and the numbers are up to 10^6, so we might consider using union-find or graph coloring? \n\n Another idea:\n\n Since for each edge we know the product (g*l) and the gcd (g), we can also recover the LCM from the gcd and the product: actually, we are given both, but note: if we are given (g, l) then we know the product is g*l. However, we are also constrained by the fact that the gcd is g.\n\n We can try to assign to each node a candidate value. But note: the entire graph must be consistent.\n\n Steps:\n\n  a) For each edge (u, v, g, l):\n        Check if g * l is a perfect square? Not necessarily. But we know that the product of two numbers is g*l, and they are both multiples of g. Moreover, we know that the LCM must be divisible by g.\n\n        Condition: g must divide l (since g divides both a and b, then the LCM (which is the least common multiple) must be divisible by g). So if g does not divide l, then output \"NO\".\n\n        Then, we can set the two numbers as (g * x, g * y) such that x*y = l//g and gcd(x,y)=1.\n\n  However, the same node must be assigned the same value in all edges incident to it.\n\n  We can try to use a graph coloring or constraint propagation? But note: the numbers are determined by the product and the gcd.\n\n  Let's define:\n\n        For an edge (u, v, g, l): \n            Let k = l // g. Then we require that the two numbers (a, b) are of the form (g*x, g*y) with x*y = k and gcd(x,y)=1.\n\n        But note: the same node u might be connected to multiple edges. So the value A[u] must be a multiple of the gcd for each edge it is in.\n\n  How about:\n\n        Step 1: For each edge, check that g divides l. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n        Step 2: Compute the product P = g*l. Then, the two numbers a and b must multiply to P and their gcd must be g.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also note that the two numbers must be divisors of P. But there are too many divisors.\n\n  Insight:\n\n        Let d = gcd(a,b) = g. Then we can write a = g * a', b = g * b', and then gcd(a', b')=1 and lcm(a,b)=g * a' * b' = l. So a'*b' = l//g = k.\n\n        Now, we can factorize k and then look for pairs (x,y) such that x*y=k and gcd(x,y)=1. There might be multiple such pairs, but note: the assignment must be consistent across the graph.\n\n  But wait: the entire graph must have one number per node. We can try to assign to each node the product of the gcds from the edges? Or perhaps we can use the following:\n\n        Let A[u] be the product of the gcds of all edges incident to u? Not exactly.\n\n  Another idea: Consider that the value at node u must be divisible by the gcd from every edge incident to u. Moreover, for an edge (u, v) with gcd g, then the value at u must be divisible by g and similarly for v.\n\n        Then, let base[u] = the least common multiple (LCM) of all the g's from edges incident to u? Actually, no, because the same edge gcd must divide the two nodes, but the base should be the gcd from that edge, and we are taking LCM? Actually, the node must be divisible by each gcd of its edges, so we can set:\n\n        base[u] = LCM_{e incident to u} (g_e)\n\n        Then, the value A[u] must be a multiple of base[u]. However, we also have the product condition from each edge.\n\n  But note: the product condition for an edge (u, v): A[u] * A[v] = g * l.\n\n  However, we don't know the exact value, but we know that A[u] must be a multiple of base[u] and similarly for A[v]. Then, we can set A[u] = base[u] * x_u, and similarly A[v] = base[v] * x_v.\n\n        Then, the product condition becomes: base[u] * base[v] * x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n        Also, the gcd condition: gcd(A[u], A[v]) = g.\n\n        But note: base[u] is divisible by g (because g is one of the gcds of edges incident to u, so base[u] is a multiple of g). Similarly, base[v] is divisible by g.\n\n        Then, we can write:\n\n            gcd(base[u]*x_u, base[v]*x_v) = g.\n\n        However, base[u] and base[v] are multiples of g, so we can factor out g:\n\n            Let base[u] = g * b_u', base[v] = g * b_v'.\n\n        Then, A[u] = g * (b_u' * x_u), A[v] = g * (b_v' * x_v).\n\n        Then, the gcd becomes g * gcd(b_u' * x_u, b_v' * x_v).\n\n        We require that this equals g, so gcd(b_u' * x_u, b_v' * x_v) = 1.\n\n        Also, the product condition: base[u] * base[v] * x_u * x_v = g * l  => (g * b_u') * (g * b_v') * x_u * x_v = g * l  => g * b_u' * b_v' * x_u * x_v = l.\n\n        Then, we can set: b_u' * b_v' * x_u * x_v = l // g.\n\n        But note: base[u] is the LCM of all g's for edges incident to u. This seems complicated.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try to assign the value for each node by considering the edges. Since the product condition is global, we might use a different idea.\n\n  Observation:\n\n        From the edge (u, v) with (g, l): \n            We know that the product A[u] * A[v] = g * l.\n\n        We can build a graph where each node has a list of products (g*l) and also the gcd constraint. However, we need to assign one number per node.\n\n  Another known fact:\n\n        In such problems, the entire graph must be bipartite? Actually, no. But note: the product condition and the gcd condition might force the graph to be bipartite? Not necessarily.\n\n  Known similar problem: assigning numbers to edges such that the gcd condition holds? \n\n  However, note: the problem is very hard.\n\n  Let me consider a simpler idea:\n\n        We can fix one node arbitrarily. But then we have to propagate the values.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Precompute for each edge (g, l) the required product and the condition that the numbers are multiples of g.\n\n          2. Build a graph with n nodes and m edges.\n\n          3. For each node, we want to record the set of constraints (the gcds from edges) and the product condition.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          Let F(u) be the value at node u.\n\n          For an edge (u, v, g, l): \n                F(u) * F(v) = g * l, and gcd(F(u), F(v)) = g.\n\n          Then, we can write F(u) = g * a, F(v) = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = (g*l)//(g*g) = l//g.\n\n          Then, the value at u must be divisible by g, and similarly for v.\n\n          Now, if we fix a root node (say node 0) and set F(0) = some value, then we can propagate along edges.\n\n        But how?\n\n          For an edge (0, v) with (g0, l0): \n                F(0) * F(v) = g0 * l0, and gcd(F(0), F(v)) = g0.\n\n          Then, F(v) = (g0 * l0) / F(0). But note: F(0) must divide g0*l0.\n\n          Also, the gcd condition: gcd(F(0), (g0*l0)/F(0)) = g0.\n\n          This gives conditions on F(0). \n\n        However, we don't know F(0). But we can set F(0) to be the product of the gcds from the edges that start at 0? Not exactly.\n\n  After reading the example inputs:\n\n      Example 1: \"1 0\" -> YES, [1]\n      Example 2: \"2 1\\n1 2 1 3\" -> YES, [1, 3]\n\n        For edge (1,2) with g=1, l=3: \n            Then numbers must be 1 and 3 (since 1*3=3, and gcd(1,3)=1). So one node gets 1, the other 3.\n\n        Example 3: \"3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10\" -> YES, [5, 1, 2]\n\n        Edges:\n            Edge1: between 3 and 2: (g=1, l=2) -> product=2, so the numbers are 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1) but note: the nodes are labeled 1,2,3. \n            Edge2: between 3 and 1: (g=1, l=10) -> product=10, so the numbers are 1 and 10, 2 and 5, etc.\n\n        But the output is [5,1,2]. Let's check:\n\n            Node1: 5? Actually, the output is \"5 1 2\", meaning:\n                Node1: 5, Node2: 1, Node3: 2.\n\n            Then, edge1: between Node3 (which is 2) and Node2 (which is 1): \n                gcd(2,1)=1, lcm(2,1)=2 -> matches (1,2) for the first edge.\n\n            Edge2: between Node3 (2) and Node1 (5):\n                gcd(2,5)=1, lcm(2,5)=10 -> matches (1,10) for the second edge.\n\n        So the assignment is: [5,1,2] for nodes [1,2,3].\n\n        How to come up with that?\n\n        We see that the value at node3 is 2, which is common in both edges.\n\n        Constraints:\n\n            For node1: must be divisible by the gcd from edges incident to it. Here, node1 has only one edge (edge2) with gcd=1 -> no constraint (any divisor of 10 that is multiple of 1). But the product condition: 2 * 5 = 10.\n\n            For node2: has two edges: \n                edge1: gcd=1, product=2 -> so the numbers must be 1 and 2. Since node2 is 1, then the other node (node3) must be 2.\n                edge2: gcd=1, product=10 -> then the numbers must multiply to 10. Since node2 is 1, then node1 must be 10. But wait, we also have node1 being 5 from the first edge? \n\n        So we have two edges incident to node2: one requires that the pair (node2, node3) is (1,2) and the other requires (node2, node1) is (1,10). \n\n        Then, from node2 being 1, we get node3=2 and node1=10. But then the edge between node1 and node3: \n            product = 10*2 = 20, but the given product for edge1 (if we consider the first edge) was 2 (from g=1, l=2: product=2). However, the first edge is between node3 and node2, which we already set to 2 and 1 (product=2). But the second edge is between node3 and node1: product=2*10=20, but the given product for the second edge is 10 (from g=1, l=10: product=10). \n\n        Wait, the input for the second edge is: \"3 1 1 10\", meaning the edge connects node3 and node1, and the gcd is 1, lcm is 10, so product=10. But if node1=10 and node3=2, then the product is 20, which is not 10.\n\n        Let me re-check the example input:\n\n            Input: \"3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10\"\n\n            The two edges:\n                First edge: between lawns 3 and 2 -> (gcd=1, lcm=2) -> product=2.\n                Second edge: between lawns 3 and 1 -> (gcd=1, lcm=10) -> product=10.\n\n            The assignment: [5,1,2] for lawns 1,2,3.\n\n            So: \n                Edge1: between lawn3 (which is node index 2, value=2) and lawn2 (which is node index 1, value=1): product=2*1=2 -> matches.\n                Edge2: between lawn3 (2) and lawn1 (5): product=2*5=10 -> matches.\n\n            So the assignment is correct.\n\n        How did we get node1=5? \n\n            From the edge between node1 and node3: product=10, and node3=2, so node1=10/2=5.\n\n            Then, from the edge between node2 and node3: product=2, and node3=2, so node2=2/2=1.\n\n        But then the edge between node1 and node2: we didn't have one. The graph has two edges: (3,2) and (3,1). So the graph is a star with center node3.\n\n        Algorithm for a connected component:\n\n          We can do:\n\n          - For each connected component, we can choose a root node (say node0) and set its value arbitrarily? But note: the product condition must hold.\n\n          However, we have multiple edges. We can use BFS/DFS and assign values step by step.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let A[0] = x (we don't know x, but we can express others in terms of x)\n\n            Then, for an edge (0, v) with (g, l): \n                We have: A[0] * A[v] = g * l, and gcd(A[0], A[v]) = g.\n\n                Then, A[v] = (g * l) / A[0]\n\n                But we must ensure that gcd(A[0], (g*l)//A[0]) == g.\n\n            However, we don't know x. But note: the entire graph must be consistent.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set:\n\n                Let base[u] = the product of the gcds from all edges incident to u? No.\n\n            Another idea: set the value for the root arbitrarily to a candidate value that satisfies all constraints from the edges. But the candidate must be a divisor of the product of the edges? \n\n            Alternatively, we can set the value for the root as the least common multiple (LCM) of the gcds of all edges incident to the root? But wait, the root might have multiple edges. Then, the value must be divisible by each gcd from an edge. \n\n            Let base[u] = LCM_{e incident to u} (g_e)\n\n            Then, we set A[u] = base[u] * x, and for an edge (u, v) with gcd=g and product=P, we have:\n\n                base[u] * base[v] * x_u * x_v = P   (actually, base[u] * base[v] * x_u * x_v = g * l, but note: base[u] is divisible by g, base[v] is divisible by g, so we can factor g)\n\n            However, we can also note:\n\n                A[u] must be divisible by base[u] (which is the LCM of the gcds from edges). Then, the value for the root is set to base[root] * x, and then the adjacent nodes are set to (g*l) / (base[root]*x). \n\n            But then, we must ensure that the gcd condition holds: gcd(A[root], A[v]) = g.\n\n            And also, the same node might be reached by two different paths, so we must check consistency.\n\n        Given the complexity, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Preprocessing for each edge (g, l):\n                Check that g divides l. If not, output \"NO\".\n                Let P = g * l.\n\n          Step 2: Build a graph.\n\n          Step 3: For each node, compute the LCM of all the g's from the edges incident to it. (This is the minimal requirement for divisibility.)\n\n          Step 4: Choose a root node (say 0). Then, set A[0] = base[0] (i.e., the LCM of the gcds from edges incident to 0). But wait, is that the minimal? \n\n          However, consider: if we set A[0] = base[0], then for an edge (0, v) with gcd=g and product=P, we have:\n\n                A[0] * A[v] = P  => A[v] = P / base[0]\n\n                But we must check that base[0] divides P. Also, we must check that the gcd(A[0], A[v]) = g.\n\n          Example: Example 2: two nodes, one edge: (g=1, l=3) -> P=3. base[0] = LCM of {1} for node0 (assuming node0 is one of them) -> 1. Then A[0]=1, then A[1]=3. Then gcd(1,3)=1 -> matches.\n\n          Example 3: \n                Nodes: 0: node1, 1: node2, 2: node3.\n\n                Edges: \n                    Edge0: (3,2) -> (g=1, l=2) -> P0=2. \n                    Edge1: (3,1) -> (g=1, l=10) -> P1=10.\n\n                We have two edges: (0,2) and (0,1) if we label node1 as 0, node2 as 1, node3 as 2.\n\n                Then, base[0] (node1) = LCM of {g from edges incident to node1}. The edges incident to node1 are [edge1] (with g=1). So base[0]=1.\n\n                Then, set A[0]=1.\n\n                Then, for edge1: (node1, node3) -> edge1: (g=1, l=10) -> A[2] = 10 / 1 = 10.\n\n                Then, for edge0: (node1, node2) -> edge0: (g=1, l=2) -> A[1] = 2 / 1 = 2.\n\n                Then the assignment: [1,2,10] for nodes [1,2,3]. \n\n                But the expected answer was [5,1,2] (for nodes [1,2,3]). \n\n                Why the difference? \n\n                Our assignment: \n                    node1: 1, node2: 2, node3: 10.\n\n                Check edges:\n                    Edge0: between node1 (1) and node2 (2): gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> matches (1,2).\n                    Edge1: between node1 (1) and node3 (10): gcd(1,10)=1, lcm(1,10)=10 -> matches (1,10).\n\n                But wait, the example output was [5,1,2] and our assignment is [1,2,10]. \n\n                Both are valid. The problem says \"any one\".\n\n                However, the example input specifies the edges as:\n                    \"3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10\"\n\n                Note: the first edge is between node3 and node2, and the second edge is between node3 and node1.\n\n                In our labeling, we assumed node1 is the first node, node2 is the second, node3 is the third.\n\n                The example output [5,1,2] is for the three lawns (nodes) in order: lawn1, lawn2, lawn3.\n\n                So in our labeling, we have:\n                    node1 (index0) -> 1\n                    node2 (index1) -> 2\n                    node3 (index2) -> 10\n\n                But the example output is for lawn1, lawn2, lawn3: [5,1,2] meaning:\n                    lawn1: 5, lawn2: 1, lawn3: 2.\n\n                This corresponds to a different labeling? \n\n                The input says:\n                    First edge: \"3 2 1 2\" -> connects lawn3 and lawn2, with gcd=1, lcm=2.\n                    Second edge: \"3 1 1 10\" -> connects lawn3 and lawn1, with gcd=1, lcm=10.\n\n                In the example output, the three lawns are numbered 1,2,3. The output says:\n                    lawn1:5, lawn2:1, lawn3:2.\n\n                Then, the first edge (lawn3, lawn2): (2,1) -> gcd=1, lcm=2 -> matches.\n                The second edge (lawn3, lawn1): (2,5) -> gcd=1, lcm=10 -> matches.\n\n                So the assignment is valid.\n\n                How did we get a different assignment? \n\n                Actually, the problem does not specify which node is which. The input gives the lawns by labels (like 1-indexed). But we are reading the graph and building an internal representation.\n\n                The algorithm I described sets the root (node0) to 1 and then propagates. But the example output uses a different root (lawn3) as the center.\n\n                Since the graph is undirected, we can choose any root. The key is that the entire graph must be consistent.\n\n                However, our method of setting the root's value to base[root] (the LCM of the gcds of its edges) and then propagating by dividing the product by the root's value will work.\n\n                But note: the example input has two edges, and the root (node0) is one of the nodes. We must be cautious: the graph might not be connected? The problem doesn't say the graph is connected.\n\n                Steps for a connected component:\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                    Let base[u] = LCM_{e incident to u} (g_e)\n\n                    Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l): we have the product P = g*l.\n\n                    We require that base[u] divides P and base[v] divides P.\n\n                    Then, we can set A[u] = base[u] * x, A[v] = base[v] * y, and we must have base[u]*base[v]*x*y = P, and also the gcd condition: gcd(A[u],A[v])=g.\n\n                    But note: the base[u] is divisible by g (since g is one of the gcds, and base[u] is the LCM of the gcds, so g divides base[u]). Similarly for base[v].\n\n                    Then, we can write:\n\n                        base[u] = g * k1, base[v] = g * k2, for some integers k1,k2.\n\n                    Then, the equation becomes:\n\n                        g*k1 * g*k2 * x * y = g*l   => g * k1 * k2 * x * y = l.\n\n                    And the gcd condition:\n\n                        gcd(g*k1*x, g*k2*y) = g * gcd(k1*x, k2*y) = g   => gcd(k1*x, k2*y)=1.\n\n                    We also know that the product of x and y must be l/(g*k1*k2). But note: the product of the two numbers is P = g*l, and we have:\n\n                        A[u] * A[v] = (g*k1*x) * (g*k2*y) = g^2 * k1*k2*x*y = g*l.\n\n                    So, g * k1*k2*x*y = l.\n\n                    Therefore, x*y = l/(g*k1*k2).\n\n                    Now, note: k1 = base[u] // g, and k2 = base[v] // g.\n\n                    Then, we have:\n\n                        x = (some divisor of l/(g*k1*k2)) and y = (the complement divisor) such that gcd(k1*x, k2*y)=1.\n\n                    But wait, we don't know x and y individually. However, we are going to assign the root arbitrarily to base[root] (so x=1 for the root) and then set the neighbors accordingly.\n\n                However, the above shows that the entire assignment is multiplicative by a factor. We can set the root's value to base[root] (so x=1) and then for an edge (root, v) we set:\n\n                    A[v] = P / base[root] = (g*l) / base[root]\n\n                    Then, we must check that base[v] divides (g*l) (which we already ensured) and that the gcd condition holds.\n\n                But wait, the gcd condition: gcd(base[root], A[v]) = g.\n\n                    base[root] = LCM of the gcds for edges incident to root (including the edge (root,v)) so base[root] is divisible by g.\n\n                    Then, we require gcd(base[root], (g*l)//base[root]) = g.\n\n                Example 3 (with root=node1, which is lawn1):\n\n                    base[root] = base[0] = 1 (from the edge (0,2) with g=1, and edge (0,1) is not present? Actually, in the example, the root (node0) is connected to two edges: (0,1) and (0,2) [if we label node0 as the first node, i.e., lawn1, then the edges are (0,2) and (0,1) but wait: the input edges are:\n\n                    Input edges: \n                        \"3 2 1 2\" -> connects lawn3 and lawn2 -> so in our 0-indexed: lawn1=index0, lawn2=index1, lawn3=index2.\n                        Then, the first edge: (2,1) -> (index2, index1)\n                        The second edge: (2,0) -> (index2, index0)\n\n                    So if we take root = node0 (lawn1), then the edges incident to root are only the second edge: (0,2) with g=1, l=10. Then base[0] = 1.\n\n                    Then, A[0] = 1.\n\n                    Then, for edge (0,2): A[2] = (1*10) / 1 = 10.\n\n                    Then, for the other edge (1,2): we have node1 (index1) is not connected to the root? Then we need to assign node1 separately.\n\n                    But wait, node1 is connected to node2 (edge0). Then we have to assign node1 from the edge (1,2). We can do:\n\n                    For edge (1,2): g=1, l=2, product=2.\n                    Then, A[1] = 2 / A[2] = 2/10 -> not an integer.\n\n                So we cannot assign independently for each edge.\n\n                We must traverse the graph and assign consistently.\n\n                Revised plan:\n\n                  We will do a BFS/DFS and for each edge, we set the neighbor's value as (P) / (current node's value). Then, we must check that the current node's value is divisible by the base (the LCM of gcds) and that the neighbor's value is an integer and divisible by the base of the neighbor (and the gcd condition).\n\n                Steps for BFS:\n\n                  Let's maintain an array A[0..n-1] for the assignment.\n\n                  We'll also maintain base[u] for each node u (the LCM of the gcds of edges incident to u).\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    1. Precompute base[u] for every node u.\n\n                    2. Start from an arbitrary node (say 0) and set A[0] = base[0]. (We are multiplying by 1, so x=1 for the root.)\n\n                    3. Then, for each edge (u, v) from the root, set A[v] = (g * l) / A[u] (which is (g * l) / base[u]). \n\n                    4. Check that A[v] is an integer and that base[v] divides A[v] (but note, base[v] is the LCM of the gcds from edges incident to v, and we haven't considered the entire graph, so we might have to adjust).\n\n                    5. Then, for the next edges from v, use A[v] to set the next nodes.\n\n                    6. Also, check the gcd condition: gcd(A[u], A[v]) == g.\n\n                    7. Additionally, we must check that the product condition holds: A[u] * A[v] == g * l.\n\n                Example 3 with root=lawn1 (node0):\n\n                  base[0] = LCM of {g from edges incident to 0} -> edges: only edge (0,2) with g=1 -> base[0]=1.\n                  Set A[0]=1.\n\n                  Edge (0,2): g=1, l=10, product=10. Then A[2] = 10 / 1 = 10.\n\n                  Check: \n                    Product: 1*10 = 10 -> matches.\n                    GCD: gcd(1,10)=1 -> matches.\n\n                  Now, from node2 (index2), we have two edges: (2,0) and (2,1). We already did (2,0). Now, edge (2,1): g=1, l=2, product=2.\n\n                  Then, A[1] = 2 / A[2] = 2/10 -> 0.2 -> not integer.\n\n                So we cannot assign node1.\n\n                Why? Because the edge (2,1) is not incident to the root, so we are using node2's value (10) to set node1. But the product condition for edge (2,1) is 2, so node1 must be 2/10, which is not an integer.\n\n                What went wrong?\n\n                The issue is that the entire graph must be consistent. The value at node2 is set by the root, but the edge (2,1) has a fixed product and gcd. The product for the edge (2,1) is 2, so the two numbers must be divisors of 2 (and their gcd is 1). The possibilities are (1,2) or (2,1). \n\n                But our assignment for node2 is 10, which is not 1 or 2. Therefore, the assignment from the root to node2 is forcing node2 to be 10, which breaks the edge (2,1).\n\n                So we must ensure that when we assign a node, it must satisfy all edges incident to it.\n\n                However, we are traversing the graph and assigning one edge at a time. The problem is that the same node may be reached by multiple paths.\n\n                We need to do:\n\n                  For each node, once we assign a value, we must check all the edges incident to it.\n\n                But we don't know the entire graph structure. We are doing BFS and we assign a node from one parent and then later from another parent we get a different value.\n\n                This suggests that we need to use a system that allows multiple constraints.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n                  We know that the value at node u must be a multiple of base[u]. Then, we can set:\n\n                      A[u] = base[u] * x[u]\n\n                  Then, for an edge (u, v) with (g, l): \n                      base[u] * x[u] * base[v] * x[v] = g * l, and gcd(base[u]*x[u], base[v]*x[v]) = g.\n\n                  Then, we have:\n\n                      base[u] * base[v] * x[u] * x[v] = g * l.\n\n                  And, since base[u] and base[v] are multiples of g, we can write:\n\n                      base[u] = g * a, base[v] = g * b, so the equation becomes:\n\n                      g^2 * a * b * x[u] * x[v] = g * l   => g * a * b * x[u] * x[v] = l.\n\n                  Also, the gcd condition:\n\n                      gcd(g*a*x[u], g*b*x[v]) = g * gcd(a*x[u], b*x[v]) = g   => gcd(a*x[u], b*x[v]) = 1.\n\n                  Now, note that a and b are fixed (from base[u] and base[v]). \n\n                Then, we can solve for x[u] and x[v] in the equation: a * b * x[u] * x[v] = l // g.\n\n                But we have multiple edges, so the x[u] must be the same for all edges incident to u.\n\n                This is a system of equations for the x[u]. However, the product condition and the gcd condition might be too complex.\n\n                Given the difficulty,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (node) in a forest map based on given roads (edges) that provide the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. The solution involves verifying consistency across all edges and assigning values to nodes such that all conditions are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires assigning integer values to each node such that for every edge connecting two nodes, the GCD and LCM of their values match the given values. The key insight is that for any edge with given GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the product of the two node values must be `g * l`, and both values must be multiples of `g`.\n\n2. **Graph Processing**: \n   - **Base Calculation**: For each node, compute the base value as the least common multiple (LCM) of all GCDs from edges incident to it. This base value ensures that the node's value will be divisible by all relevant GCDs.\n   - **Validation**: For each edge, check if the product of the base values of the connected nodes equals the product `g * l`. If not, the arrangement is impossible.\n   - **Consistency Check**: During BFS traversal, verify that the assigned values for nodes satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions for all edges. If any condition fails during traversal, the solution is invalid.\n\n3. **BFS Traversal**: Start from an arbitrary node, assign its base value, and propagate values to adjacent nodes using the product condition.
