Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n The border (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is a x b (with a>=3 and b>=3, because we have borders), then the border consists of:\n     top row: a cells\n     bottom row: a cells\n     left and right columns, but without the corners (already counted) so (b-2) for left and (b-2) for right, for the middle rows.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   total cells in the border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2a+2b]\n\n But wait, actually: \n   The border of a rectangle (without any inner parts) has: \n      top: a, bottom: a, left: (b-2) and right: (b-2) -> total = a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2a + 2(b-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the ring has a width of 1 cell. So for the i-th ring, we are considering the border of an inner rectangle that is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\n But there's a catch: what if the inner rectangle becomes too small? According to the input constraint, k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read w, h, k.\n 2. For the i-th ring (from 1 to k), we need to compute the number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size:\n        a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    However, note that the ring must be valid: the rectangle must have at least 3x3 (so that the border is non-empty) because we subtract 4*(i-1) and then take the border (which requires the rectangle to be at least 3x3). The constraint on k ensures that.\n\n 3. The number of cells for the i-th ring is: 2 * (a_i + b_i) - 4.\n\n But wait: let's test with the example \"3 3 1\":\n        w=3, h=3, k=1\n        i=1: a_1 = 3, b_1 = 3.\n        Cells = 2*(3+3) - 4 = 2*6 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n Example \"7 9 1\":\n        w=7, h=9, i=1: a_1=7, b_1=9.\n        Cells = 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Example \"7 9 2\":\n        First ring: i=1 -> 28\n        Second ring: i=2 -> a_2 = 7 - 4*1 = 3, b_2 = 9 - 4*1 = 5.\n        Cells for second ring = 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, we can simply iterate from i=1 to i=k and sum up the border sizes.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the rings are consecutive until k, but exactly k rings.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read the input line and split into w, h, k as integers.\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate by adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, starting from the outermost edge of the plate. The first ring follows the edge of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells inward, and so on. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into a grid of `w` rows and `h` columns. The task involves calculating the number of cells covered by each of the `k` rings. Each ring is the border of a rectangle that is progressively smaller than the original plate. The dimensions of the rectangle for the i-th ring are `(w - 4*(i-1))` by `(h - 4*(i-1))`. \n2. **Key Insight**: The number of cells in the border (ring) of a rectangle of size `a x b` is given by the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle, apply the border cell formula, and sum these values to get the total number of cells to be gilded.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        width = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        height = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if width <= 0 or height <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (width + height) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`, representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings, respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the current inner rectangle by reducing the original dimensions by `4*(i-1)` cells (since each subsequent ring moves 2 cells inward on each side).\n   - If the calculated dimensions become non-positive, break the loop as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the formula `2*(width + height) - 4`.\n   - Accumulate the cell count for all rings.\n3. **Output Result**: Print the total number of cells to be gilded after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by breaking early if dimensions become invalid. The solution handles all edge cases within the given constraints.",
