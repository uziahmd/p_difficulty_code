Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given R and B (each between 1 and 10) and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n\n Conditions:\n - We need a perfect matching (each base to one rebel and vice versa).\n - The straight paths (from base to assigned spaceship) must not intersect (except at endpoints).\n\n Important: no three points are collinear and no two points coincide.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can consider a bipartite matching problem with an additional geometric condition.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have a bipartite graph: Rebels on one side, Bases on the other.\n    Initially, we can connect every rebel to every base (without considering the non-intersection condition) because the condition is about the entire set of edges (matching) being non-intersecting.\n\n However, note: the condition is that any two paths (edges) do not intersect. This is similar to drawing a set of non-crossing edges from the set of bases to the set of rebels.\n\n Observation: In fact, the problem requires that the entire set of edges (the matching) does not have any crossing. This is analogous to a planar embedding of a bipartite matching without crossings.\n\n But note: the matching is a set of edges from the base set (B points) to the rebel set (R points). We have R rebels and B bases, so if R != B, then there's no perfect matching. Actually, the problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning that we require |R| = |B|? \n\n Wait, the input says: first line contains two integers R and B (each at least 1). Then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n\n And the problem says: \"the assignment is a perfect matching\", meaning that we must assign every base to exactly one rebel and every rebel to exactly one base. Therefore, we must have R == B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n So step 0: if R != B, output 'No'.\n\n 2. Now, if R == B, we need to check if there exists a perfect matching such that the edges (from base to rebel) do not cross.\n\n How to check for non-crossing?\n\n Note: The edges are straight lines. Two edges (a->r1) and (b->r2) cross if the four points (a, r1, b, r2) are in convex position and arranged such that the segments [a, r1] and [b, r2] are diagonals of the quadrilateral.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n We know that the entire set of edges must form a non-crossing matching. This is similar to a planar matching.\n\n Idea: \n\n We can fix an order for the rebels and an order for the bases. But note: the matching is a bijection. We can try to assign the rebels and bases in a canonical order (say, by their x-coordinate) and then check if the matching, when drawn, is non-crossing.\n\n However, note: the problem does not fix the order of the rebels or the bases. We are free to assign any rebel to any base.\n\n Another idea: use a recursive backtracking (since R, B <= 10, maximum 10! which is about 3.6e6, which might be acceptable in Python if done carefully). But we have to check for non-intersection for the entire set of edges as we assign.\n\n However, we can also use a known fact: non-crossing bipartite matching is related to the concept of \"canonical ordering\" or \"monotone matching\". \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following observation: if we consider all the points (rebels and bases) together, and sort them by x-coordinate (and then by y-coordinate if needed), then we can use dynamic programming or greedy methods? \n\n But note: the matching must be between two distinct sets. \n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Sort all the points (rebels and bases) by x-coordinate (if same x, then by y). Then, we can try to match the leftmost point (which must be either a rebel or base) to the next available point of the opposite type that maintains non-crossing.\n\n However, the problem: the matching must be non-crossing. There is a known algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching: \n\n One way: \n   - Consider all the rebels and bases as a set of points. \n   - Sort the rebels and bases separately by x (or by some coordinate) and then use a matching that goes from left to right.\n\n But note: the non-crossing condition for bipartite matching (with two sets) is equivalent to the matching being non-crossing when the two sets are interleaved appropriately.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can use the following theorem: \n\n In a set of points in general position (no three collinear), a non-crossing matching exists between two sets if and only if there exists a non-crossing perfect matching.\n\n However, we are constrained to matching only between the two sets.\n\n We can try to use the following method:\n\n 1. Check if there is a perfect matching (ignoring the non-crossing condition) using bipartite matching (max flow or DFS). But note: we have only 10 points, so we can use recursion.\n\n However, the non-crossing condition is the main constraint.\n\n Another idea: \n\n We can fix the order of the rebels and the bases arbitrarily. Then, we require that the matching is non-crossing. One known way to check for non-crossing is to use the following:\n\n For two edges (a, r1) and (b, r2) (where a and b are bases, r1 and r2 are rebels) to not cross, the points must satisfy: \n   The orientations of the four points must be such that they are in alternating order.\n\n Specifically, consider four points: A (base), B (base), R1 (rebel), R2 (rebel). The edges (A-R1) and (B-R2) cross if the two bases and the two rebels are interleaved in the plane.\n\n Standard way to check for two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) crossing is:\n\n   def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        # returns True if segments ab and cd intersect, else False.\n\n But note: we are drawing from base to rebel, and we have multiple edges. However, the entire set of edges must be non-crossing. This is more than just pairwise non-intersection.\n\n Actually, the condition for a set of edges to be non-crossing is that they form a planar graph. But we can use the following:\n\n We can use a greedy method: sort all the bases and rebels by x-coordinate (and then by y, say increasing). Then, we assign the leftmost base to the leftmost rebel that is available and such that the edge does not cross any previously drawn edge? \n\n But wait, how to ensure non-crossing? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   - Sort all points (bases and rebels) by x, and if same x, by y (increasing). Then, we traverse from left to right. When we encounter a base, we match it to the next available rebel (in the sorted order) that hasn't been taken, but we must ensure that the edge doesn't cross any existing edge.\n\n However, note: the matching must be perfect. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known fact:\n\n In a set of red and blue points (here bases and rebels), a non-crossing perfect matching exists if and only if the two sets are interleaved appropriately. \n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire set of points to be matched arbitrarily, only between the two sets.\n\n Another idea: \n\n Use a recursive backtracking that tries to assign each base to a rebel, and at each step, checks that the new edge does not cross any already drawn edge.\n\n Steps for backtracking:\n\n   Let R = list of rebels (coordinates)\n   Let B = list of bases (coordinates)\n\n   We have to assign each base to a unique rebel.\n\n   We can sort the bases and rebels by x (or by some key) to reduce the state space? Or we can try to assign in increasing x order.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Sort the bases by x (and then by y) and the rebels by x (and then by y). Then, for the i-th base (from smallest x to largest x), we try to assign it to a rebel that has not been used, and such that the segment from this base to the rebel does not cross any previously drawn segment.\n\n   However, the non-crossing condition is global. But note: if we assign in increasing x order, then we can use the following:\n\n     Condition for non-crossing: When we draw an edge from base_i (at position i) to a rebel_j, then the edge must not cross any edge that we have already drawn (for bases with smaller x). \n\n     Also, note: the rebels are fixed and we haven't sorted the rebels by x? We should sort both bases and rebels by x. Then, we can use the fact that the bases are from left to right, and the rebels are from left to right. Then, the edge from base_i to rebel_j must lie entirely to the right of the previous edges? \n\n     Actually, we can use the following rule: \n\n        When we assign the k-th base (from left to right) to a rebel, then the rebels that are to the left of the current base's x-coordinate must have been already assigned to bases to the left, and similarly, the rebels that are to the right must be assigned to bases to the right.\n\n        But wait, we are assigning in increasing x order of bases, so we are going from left to right. Then, the rebels that are to the left of the current base's x-coordinate must have been already assigned (because we have only bases to the left) and the rebels to the right are not yet assigned.\n\n        However, the rebels are fixed and we are assigning arbitrarily. \n\n     We can do:\n\n        Sort the bases by x (and if same x, by y) and the rebels by x (and if same x, by y). Then, we assign the leftmost base to one of the rebels that are not yet used. But then, we must ensure that the edge does not cross any previously drawn edge.\n\n        How to check crossing with the existing edges?\n\n        The existing edges are from bases with smaller x to some rebels (which might be to the left or right of the current base's x). However, note: the rebels that are to the left of the current base's x must have been assigned to bases that are to the left (so they are already connected). The rebels that are to the right are not yet assigned.\n\n        Now, consider: the edge from the current base to a rebel must not cross any edge from a base to the left.\n\n        Let the current base be at (x0, y0) and the chosen rebel at (x1, y1). The existing edges are from bases (with x < x0) to rebels (anywhere). \n\n        How to check for crossing with an existing edge (from base (x2,y2) to rebel (x3,y3))?\n\n        We can check if the two segments (current base to chosen rebel) and (existing base to existing rebel) intersect.\n\n        However, we must check for all existing edges.\n\n        But note: the condition for non-crossing is that the entire set of edges is non-crossing. We are building the edges one by one, so we must ensure that the new edge does not cross any of the already drawn edges.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: If R != B, output 'No'\n          Step 2: Read the points.\n\n          Step 3: Sort the bases by x (if same x, by y) and the rebels by x (if same x, by y).\n\n          Step 4: Use backtracking (DFS) that assigns bases (in increasing x order) to rebels, maintaining an array `assignment` for rebels (which base is assigned to which rebel, or None if not assigned) and a list of edges drawn.\n\n          However, we can optimize the non-crossing check by noting that the edges from bases to the left are already drawn, and the edges we are about to draw for the current base must not cross any of those.\n\n          But the number of bases is at most 10, so we can check the new edge against all existing edges.\n\n        We define a helper function:\n\n          def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # Check if segments (a, b) and (c, d) intersect, where each point is (x,y)\n            # Using the standard orientation method.\n\n          However, note: the problem says that no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about degenerate cases.\n\n        Steps for segment intersection:\n\n          We can use the cross product method:\n\n          Let A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2), C = (x3, y3), D = (x4, y4)\n\n          Compute:\n            o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n            o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n            o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n            o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n          The segments AB and CD intersect if:\n            (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4) and (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n          But wait: actually, we need to check if the two segments cross (not including touching at endpoints). The problem says: \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect\", and note that the endpoints are the bases and rebels, and the edges are from base to rebel. The endpoints are distinct. However, two edges share an endpoint? Actually, no: each base is assigned to one rebel and each rebel to one base, so two edges share an endpoint only if they are incident to the same base or the same rebel. But we are drawing one edge at a time and the existing edges are from bases (already assigned) to rebels (already assigned). The current edge is from a new base to a new rebel (not used before). So the endpoints of the current edge are distinct from the existing edges.\n\n          Therefore, we only need to check that the current edge does not cross any existing edge.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We'll maintain:\n            bases_sorted = sorted(bases, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n            rebels_sorted = sorted(rebels, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n\n          Then, we do:\n\n            def backtrack(index):   # index: the current base we are assigning (the index-th base in bases_sorted, from 0 to n-1)\n                if index == n:\n                    return True\n\n                x0, y0 = bases_sorted[index]\n                for j in range(n):   # n = R = B\n                    if not used_rebel[j]:\n                        x1, y1 = rebels_sorted[j]\n                        # Check if the edge from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1) crosses any edge already drawn (from base_sorted[0:index] to their assigned rebels)\n\n                        # But note: we are assigning bases in increasing x order, and the rebels are sorted by x. However, we are trying a particular rebel j.\n\n                        # How to check crossing with existing edges?\n                        # We have a list of edges: each edge is (base_point, rebel_point) for bases from 0 to index-1.\n\n                        # However, we don't store the edges, we only store the assignment. But we can reconstruct the edges for bases 0 to index-1.\n\n                        # Alternatively, we can store the assignment for bases 0 to index-1 and then check the current candidate edge against all those edges.\n\n                        # But note: we are trying to avoid storing too much. We can check the candidate edge against each edge from base k (k from 0 to index-1) to its assigned rebel.\n\n                        # However, we can also use the following: we have the list of assigned rebels for bases 0 to index-1.\n\n                        # But note: we are iterating by base index, and we are assigning base index to rebel j. The existing edges are from base indices 0 to index-1 to their assigned rebels.\n\n                        # We can precompute the edges for the bases that have been assigned.\n\n                        # However, we are in the middle of backtracking, so we have to check the candidate edge against all the edges we have so far.\n\n                        # But wait, we are going to assign base index to rebel j, and we are checking that the edge (base_sorted[index], rebels_sorted[j]) does not cross any edge from base_sorted[k] to the rebel that was assigned to base_sorted[k] (for k from 0 to index-1).\n\n                        # We can do:\n\n                        used_rebel[j] = True\n                        valid = True\n                        for k in range(index):   # for each base from 0 to index-1\n                            # The edge for base k is from base_sorted[k] to the rebel that was assigned to base k (which we stored in an array, say `assignment` or we can pass the assignment from the parent call)\n\n                        # Actually, we should maintain an array `assign` for rebels: which base is assigned to which rebel? Or we can maintain an array `used_rebel` and the assignment of base k to a rebel.\n\n                        # Alternatively, we can store the edges as we go.\n\n                However, we need to know the edges for the bases that have been assigned. We can store:\n\n                  assignment[i] = j   # meaning that the i-th base (in sorted order) is assigned to the j-th rebel.\n\n                Then, we can check the candidate edge for base index (from base_sorted[index] to rebels_sorted[j]) against all edges for bases 0 to index-1: each edge is (base_sorted[k], rebels_sorted[assignment[k]])\n\n                But note: the rebels are sorted by x, but the assignment is arbitrary. The rebels_sorted is sorted by x, but the assignment[k] is the index of the rebel in the rebels_sorted list.\n\n                However, we must note: the rebels_sorted is fixed, so the j-th rebel is rebels_sorted[j].\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  We'll maintain:\n                    used_rebel = [False] * n   # n = R = B\n                    # But we are also assigning bases in sorted order. We need to know the assignment for bases 0 to index-1.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    Let `match_base` = [-1] * n   # for each base (index from 0 to n-1) stores the rebel index (in the original rebels_sorted list) that it is assigned to.\n\n                  But wait, we are iterating by base index (from 0 to n-1) and we are trying rebels. We can use:\n\n                    Let `used_rebel` be a boolean list of length n (number of rebels) indicating which rebels are taken.\n\n                  Then, for base index, we try each rebel j that is not used, and then check the edge (base_sorted[index], rebels_sorted[j]) against all edges from base k (k from 0 to index-1) to rebels_sorted[assigned_rebel[k]] (where assigned_rebel[k] is the rebel index for base k).\n\n                  But we don't have assigned_rebel stored for k from 0 to index-1. We can store an array `assign` that is built as we go.\n\n                We can design the backtracking as:\n\n                  def backtrack(index, assign, used_rebel):\n                    if index == n:\n                        return True\n\n                    x0, y0 = bases_sorted[index]\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if not used_rebel[j]:\n                            x1, y1 = rebels_sorted[j]\n                            # Check that the segment (x0,y0) to (x1,y1) does not cross any segment from base k (k < index) to their assigned rebel (which is rebels_sorted[assign[k]])\n\n                            # But wait, we are storing `assign` as the list of rebel indices (in the sorted rebels) for each base from 0 to index-1.\n\n                            # However, we don't have `assign` for base index, we are building it.\n\n                    How do we store the assignment for the bases? We can use an array `assign_base` of length n (for bases) that stores the rebel index (in the sorted rebels) for each base.\n\n                Alternatively, we can avoid storing `assign_base` and use recursion that passes the assignment for bases 0 to index-1. But that would be inefficient.\n\n                Instead, let's restructure:\n\n                  We have two lists: \n                    bases_sorted: sorted by x, then y.\n                    rebels_sorted: sorted by x, then y.\n\n                  We want to assign base i (in increasing x order) to a rebel.\n\n                  We maintain:\n                    used_rebel: list of booleans for the rebels (by their index in rebels_sorted)\n                    And we don't need to store the entire assignment, but we do need to check the non-crossing condition.\n\n                  However, the non-crossing condition requires knowing the edges for bases 0 to index-1.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  We'll keep an array `assign_base` of length n, initially None for each base.\n\n                  Then, we do:\n\n                    if index == n: \n                       return True\n\n                    for j in range(n):\n                      if not used_rebel[j]:\n                         # Check edge (bases_sorted[index], rebels_sorted[j]) against all edges from base k (k from 0 to index-1) to rebels_sorted[assign_base[k]]\n\n                         # But we haven't set assign_base for index, so we set temporarily: \n                         # We can simulate: set assign_base[index] = j, mark used_rebel[j]=True, and then check.\n\n                         # Check non-crossing: \n                         flag = True\n                         for k in range(index):\n                             # The edge for base k: (bases_sorted[k], rebels_sorted[assign_base[k]])\n                             # Check if (bases_sorted[index], rebels_sorted[j]) intersects (bases_sorted[k], rebels_sorted[assign_base[k]])\n                             if segments_intersect(bases_sorted[index], rebels_sorted[j], bases_sorted[k], rebels_sorted[assign_base[k]]):\n                                 flag = False\n                                 break\n\n                         if flag:\n                             # Then, we proceed by assigning base index to rebel j.\n                             assign_base[index] = j\n                             used_rebel[j] = True\n\n                             # Then, recursively call backtrack(index+1, assign_base, used_rebel)\n\n                             if backtrack(index+1, assign_base, used_rebel):\n                                 return True\n\n                             # Otherwise, backtrack: unset used_rebel[j] and set assign_base[index] to None (or leave it, but we are going to try next j)\n\n                             used_rebel[j] = False\n\n                    return False\n\n                Then, if backtrack(0, assign_base, used_rebel) is True, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\n          However, note: the sorting of rebels and bases by x might help in reducing the search space? But we are still trying all possibilities.\n\n          But the worst-case is n! which for n=10 is 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in Python if we optimize the segment_intersect function (which is O(1)) and we break early.\n\n          But note: the segment_intersect function must be efficient.\n\n        Let's code the helper function for segment_intersect.\n\n        Steps for segments_intersect(p, q, r, s):\n\n          We represent a segment by two points: (p, q) and (r, s)\n\n          We can use the cross product method.\n\n          Define:\n\n            def orientation(a, b, c):\n                # Returns:\n                #   positive if c is to the left of ab\n                #   negative if c is to the right of ab\n                #   0 if collinear (but our points are in general position, so we assume non-zero)\n                ax = a[0]; ay = a[1]\n                bx = b[0]; by = b[1]\n                cx = c[0]; cy = c[1]\n                return (bx - ax)*(cy - ay) - (by - ay)*(cx - ax)\n\n          Then, two segments (p,q) and (r,s) intersect if:\n\n            o1 = orientation(p, q, r)\n            o2 = orientation(p, q, s)\n            o3 = orientation(r, s, p)\n            o4 = orientation(r, s, q)\n\n          Then, the segments intersect if:\n            (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n          However, note: we must also consider the possibility that one endpoint lies on the other segment? But the problem states: no three points are collinear and no two points coincide. Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoints lying on the segment.\n\n          But note: our segments are from base to rebel, and the bases and rebels are distinct. Also, the entire set of points is distinct. So the endpoints of one segment are not the endpoints of the other? Actually, they are distinct sets. So the endpoints of the two segments are four distinct points.\n\n          Therefore, we can use:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n                return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n          However, wait: the standard method for checking segment intersection uses the orientation to see if the points are on opposite sides. But note: the above condition is necessary and sufficient for two open segments (that do not include the endpoints) to intersect. However, our segments are closed? But since the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, we don't have to worry about the endpoints.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\", meaning that the edges should not cross. The edges are drawn as straight lines and should not share any interior point. Our condition (using open segments) is correct.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the segments_intersect function above does not consider the case when the two segments meet at an endpoint. But in our matching, the edges are from bases to rebels, and the endpoints are distinct. However, we are checking edges that are from different bases and different rebels. Therefore, the endpoints are distinct, so we don't have to worry about endpoint sharing (because each base and each rebel is used exactly once). \n\n        But wait: the edges are from bases to rebels, and we are checking an edge from base_i to rebel_j against an edge from base_k to rebel_l (with i != k, j != l). The four endpoints are distinct. Therefore, the segments cannot share an endpoint. So the above function is safe.\n\n        However, note: the above function might return True for segments that only touch at an endpoint? Actually, no: because if an endpoint lies on the other segment, then the orientation condition might be zero. But our condition (o1 * o2 < 0) requires that the signs are opposite, so if one of o1 or o2 is zero then the product is 0, so the condition fails. Similarly for o3 and o4.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        But wait: the standard method for segment intersection (including endpoints) is:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n                # The segments intersect if the points c and d lie on opposite sides of ab, and a and b lie on opposite sides of cd.\n                # But note: if one of the endpoints is colinear, then the condition is not strict. However, we assume general position.\n\n                return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n        This is the standard method for checking if two segments intersect (including the possibility of endpoints) but excluding degenerate cases (like overlapping). However, we have distinct points and no three collinear, so we are good.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: we can use the same function.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"do not intersect\", so even if they meet at an endpoint, that would be considered an intersection? Actually, no: the endpoints are the bases and rebels, and the edges are from base to rebel. The edges are distinct and the endpoints are distinct. Therefore, the edges can only share endpoints if the same base or rebel is used twice, which is not allowed. So we are safe.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 0: if R != B: print('No') and exit.\n\n          Step 1: Read R, B and the points.\n\n          Step 2: Sort bases and rebels by x then y.\n\n          Step 3: Initialize:\n            n = R = B\n            bases_sorted = sorted(bases, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n            rebels_sorted = sorted(rebels, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n\n            used_rebel = [False] * n\n            assign_base = [-1] * n   # assign_base[i] = index of rebel (in rebels_sorted) assigned to base_sorted[i]\n\n          Step 4: Write a recursive function that tries to assign base i (from 0 to n-1) to a rebel j (from 0 to n-1) that is not used, and then checks that the segment from base_sorted[i] to rebels_sorted[j] does not intersect any segment from base_sorted[k] (k from 0 to i-1) to rebels_sorted[assign_base[k]].\n\n          Step 5: If we can assign all, then print 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\n        However, note: we are sorting both bases and rebels by the same key (x then y). Is that valid for the non-crossing condition?\n\n        Actually, the non-crossing condition is independent of the coordinate system. But by sorting, we are forcing the assignment to be in increasing x order for both. This is a common technique for non-crossing matching.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the order of the bases and rebels. We are free to assign arbitrarily. Sorting by x and then y is just to reduce the search space and to be able to check non-crossing by comparing with already drawn edges.\n\n        However, what if the optimal matching is not in increasing x order for both? \n\n        Actually, the condition for non-crossing matching is that there exists a non-crossing matching. We are trying all possibilities, so the sorting only helps in ordering the assignment. But note: the non-crossing condition is independent of the labeling. However, we are fixing the order of the bases (by x) and the order of the rebels (by x). Then, we are only checking assignments that are consistent with this order. \n\n        But wait: the problem does not require that the matching is in increasing x order. However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. \n\n        However, note: we are only generating assignments in which the base with the smallest x is assigned first, then the next, etc. But the non-crossing condition is global. \n\n        But observe: if we have two edges that cross, then swapping the two rebels assigned to the two bases (with increasing x) would yield a non-crossing matching? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, the non-crossing condition is independent of the order of the bases and rebels. But by sorting, we are ensuring that we try all permutations (because we are iterating over all rebels for each base). \n\n        Example: \n          Bases: [A, B] (with A.x < B.x) and Rebels: [X, Y] (with X.x < Y.x)\n\n          We try:\n            Option1: A->X, B->Y\n            Option2: A->Y, B->X\n\n          Then, we check the non-crossing condition for each.\n\n        Therefore, we are covering all possible matchings.\n\n        But note: the sorting of rebels by x is fixed. What if the matching requires a rebel with a large x to be assigned to a base with small x? Then we are trying it (because we iterate j from 0 to n-1). \n\n        However, the condition for non-crossing might depend on the relative positions. \n\n        But note: the non-crossing condition is defined by the geometric positions, so we are checking correctly.\n\n        Let's test with the example:\n\n          Input: \n            ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2']\n\n          But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n            \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n\n          Actually, the example input has 3 rebels and 3 bases.\n\n          The rebels are: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n          The bases are: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\n          Then, we sort the bases: \n            (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) -> by x: -2, 0, 2\n\n          Then, sort the rebels: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\n          Then, we try to assign:\n\n            Base0: (-2,1) to each rebel.\n\n            Let's try rebel0: (0,0)\n                Edge: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n\n            Then, Base1: (0,3) to the remaining rebels: (2,0) and (3,1)\n\n            Then, Base2: (2,2) to the last rebel.\n\n          But wait, the example output is 'Yes'. \n\n          However, we must check if there is a matching that satisfies the non-crossing condition.\n\n          One possible matching: \n            Base (-2,1) -> (0,0)   [edge from (-2,1) to (0,0)]\n            Base (0,3) -> (2,0)    [edge from (0,3) to (2,0)]\n            Base (2,2) -> (3,1)    [edge from (2,2) to (3,1)]\n\n          Now, check if these edges cross:\n\n            Edge1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n            Edge2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n            Edge3: (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n          Check Edge1 and Edge2:\n\n            (-2,1) to (0,0) and (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n            Plotting: \n              Edge1: from (-2,1) to (0,0): goes down right.\n              Edge2: from (0,3) to (2,0): goes down right.\n\n            Do they cross? \n\n            We can compute the intersection:\n\n            Let's use the orientation method:\n\n            For Edge1: points A=(-2,1), B=(0,0)\n            For Edge2: points C=(0,3), D=(2,0)\n\n            o1 = orientation(A,B,C) = orientation((-2,1),(0,0),(0,3))\n                = (0 - (-2))*(3-1) - (0-1)*(0-(-2)) \n                = (2)*(2) - (-1)*(2) = 4 + 2 = 6 > 0\n\n            o2 = orientation(A,B,D) = orientation((-2,1),(0,0),(2,0))\n                = (0 - (-2))*(0-1) - (0-1)*(2-(-2))\n                = (2)*(-1) - (-1)*(4) = -2 + 4 = 2 > 0\n\n            Since o1 and o2 are both positive, they are on the same side -> no crossing.\n\n            Now, Edge1 and Edge3: (-2,1)-(0,0) and (2,2)-(3,1)\n\n            o1 = orientation(A,B,E) where E=(2,2)\n                = (0 - (-2))*(2-1) - (0-1)*(2-(-2))\n                = (2)*(1) - (-1)*(4) = 2 + 4 = 6 >0\n            o2 = orientation(A,B,F) where F=(3,1)\n                = (0 - (-2))*(1-1) - (0-1)*(3-(-2))\n                = (2)*(0) - (-1)*(5) = 0 + 5 = 5 >0\n\n            No crossing.\n\n            Edge2 and Edge3: (0,3)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(3,1)\n\n            Check if (0,3)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(3,1) cross:\n\n            For Edge2: C=(0,3), D=(2,0); Edge3: E=(2,2), F=(3,1)\n\n            o3 = orientation(C,D,E) = orientation((0,3),(2,0),(2,2))\n                = (2-0)*(2-3) - (0-3)*(2-0) \n                = (2)*(-1) - (-3)*(2) = -2 + 6 = 4 >0\n            o4 = orientation(C,D,F) = orientation((0,3),(2,0),(3,1))\n                = (2-0)*(1-3) - (0-3)*(3-0)\n                = (2)*(-2) - (-3)*(3) = -4 + 9 = 5 >0\n\n            Same side -> no crossing.\n\n          So the matching is non-crossing.\n\n          But note: our backtracking might not necessarily find this matching first? Actually, we are iterating j from 0 to n-1, so we try rebels in increasing x order. \n\n          In our example, the rebels",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and a set of bases such that the straight-line paths connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible perfect matchings while ensuring the geometric condition of non-intersecting paths is met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between Rebels and bases where the connecting lines (edges) do not intersect. Given the constraints (R and B ≤ 10), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Key Insight**: Sort both the bases and Rebels by their x-coordinates (and y-coordinates as a tiebreaker). This allows us to process bases in order and check for non-intersecting edges efficiently.\n3. **Backtracking with Pruning**: For each base, try assigning it to every available Rebel. For each assignment, check if the connecting edge intersects any previously drawn edges. If no intersections are found, proceed recursively. If all bases are assigned without any intersections, return \"Yes\"; otherwise, backtrack and try other assignments.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: Use the cross product method to determine if two line segments intersect. This involves checking the orientation of points relative to each other to ensure no crossing paths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    R = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    rebels = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(R):\n        x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(B):\n        x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    n = R\n    bases_sorted = sorted(bases, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n    rebels_sorted = sorted(rebels, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n    \n    def orientation(a, b, c):\n        ax, ay = a\n        bx, by = b\n        cx, cy = c\n        return (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n    \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n        return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n    \n    used_rebel = [False] * n\n    assign_base = [-1] * n\n    \n    def backtrack(index):\n        if index == n:\n            return True\n            \n        x0, y0 = bases_sorted[index]\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not used_rebel[j]:\n                x1, y1 = rebels_sorted[j]\n                used_rebel[j] = True\n                valid = True\n                for k in range(index):\n                    x2, y2 = bases_sorted[k]\n                    x3, y3 = rebels_sorted[assign_base[k]]\n                    if segments_intersect((x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if valid:\n                    assign_base[index] = j\n                    if backtrack(index + 1):\n                        return True\n                used_rebel[j] = False\n        return False\n        \n    if backtrack(0):\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into integers representing the number of Rebels (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Initial Check**: If the number of Rebels does not equal the number of bases, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Sorting**: Both bases and Rebels are sorted by their x-coordinates (and y-coordinates if x-coordinates are equal) to facilitate processing in a structured manner.\n4. **Orientation and Intersection Checks**: The `orientation` function calculates the relative position of one point with respect to a line segment. The `segments_intersect` function checks if two line segments intersect using the cross product method.\n5. **Backtracking**: The `backtrack` function attempts to assign each base to an available Rebel, ensuring no intersecting paths. If a valid assignment is found for all bases, it returns \"Yes\"; otherwise, it returns \"No\".\n6. **Output**: The result is printed based on the backtracking outcome.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible perfect matchings while leveraging sorting and geometric properties to prune invalid paths early, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.",
