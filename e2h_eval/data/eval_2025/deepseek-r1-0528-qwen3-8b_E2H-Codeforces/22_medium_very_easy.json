After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each containing a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns (each row is a string of m characters).\n\n For each subject (column), we want to know the maximum mark and which students achieved that maximum.\n\n However, note: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., has the highest mark in that subject, and note: if multiple students have the same highest mark, then they are all considered best in that subject? Actually, the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if multiple have the same highest, then none has a higher one, so all with the max mark are best in that subject.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the best must be unique. So if two students have the same highest mark, then both are best in that subject.\n\n Then, for each student, we need to check if there is at least one subject where his mark is equal to the maximum mark of that subject.\n\n Approach:\n - First, for each column j, find the maximum mark (as integer) and also note that we don't need to store which students are best per subject explicitly, but we can use the following:\n\n We can create a list for each subject (column) of the maximum value.\n\n Then, for each student i, we look at each subject j. If the student's mark in subject j equals the maximum mark for subject j, then this student is best in subject j. If at least one such subject exists, then the student is successful.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each subject the maximum and then for each student, for each subject, check if his grade is the max.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Parse the input.\n 2. Let `grid` be a list of strings, each string is a row (student's marks).\n 3. Let `max_marks` be a list of length m (for each subject) that stores the maximum mark (as integer) for that subject.\n\n    We can compute:\n        max_marks[j] = max( int(grid[i][j]) for i in range(n) )\n\n 4. Then, for each student i, we check for any subject j such that:\n        grid[i][j] == str(max_marks[j])\n\n    However, note: the marks are given as characters, and we computed max_marks as integers. We can compare by converting the grid[i][j] to int or compare as characters? But note: the marks are from '1' to '9'. The character '9' is greater than '1', but when we converted to int, we can also do without converting the grid's char.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute the maximum for each subject by taking the maximum of the characters (since '9' is greater than '1' lexicographically). But note: the marks are single digits, so the lex order is the same as numeric.\n\n    But let's stick to integers for clarity.\n\n 5. But note: the input may have leading zeros? No, the marks are from 1 to 9. So no zeros.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n    Option 1: \n        max_marks[j] = max( int(x) for x in (grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) )\n\n    Option 2 (using characters, since the string comparison for single-digit numbers is the same as integer comparison):\n        max_marks[j] = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\n    Then we compare the character from the student's row with the max_marks[j] (which is a character). This would work because the characters '1' to '9' are in increasing order.\n\n Example: \n        Subject j: ['2','3','2'] -> max is '3'\n        Then for a student with '3' in that subject, it matches.\n\n 6. We can do either. Since the grid is small (n, m <= 100), we can use integers.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Read first line to get n, m.\n\n    Then read the next n lines.\n\n    Let data = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n        data.append(s)\n\n    Then, for j in range(m):\n        col_max[j] = max(int(data[i][j]) for i in range(n))\n\n    Then, for each student i, we check for any j in range(m):\n        if int(data[i][j]) == col_max[j]:   # but wait, we stored col_max[j] as integer, and data[i][j] is a char, so convert to int.\n\n    Alternatively, we can avoid converting the entire grid to integers by using the character version.\n\n    Since the grid is small, we can do:\n\n        max_chars = [max(data[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n    Then for student i and subject j:\n        if data[i][j] == max_chars[j]:\n\n    This avoids converting the whole grid to integers, but we are doing the same amount of comparisons.\n\n    Let me choose the character version because it avoids type conversion and might be slightly faster (but negligible for n,m<=100).\n\n 7. Count the number of students that have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum in that subject.\n\n Example: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Steps:\n            n=3, m=3\n            data = ['223','232','112']\n\n            For j=0: max_chars[0] = max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n            For j=1: max_chars[1] = max('2','3','1') -> '3'\n            For j=2: max_chars[2] = max('3','2','2') -> '3'\n\n            Now, check each student:\n\n            Student0: '223'\n                j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful, break inner loop for this student.\n            Student1: '232'\n                j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n            Student2: '112'\n                j0: '1' != '2'\n                j1: '1' != '3'\n                j2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n            So output 2.\n\n 8. Code accordingly.\n\n Let's code:\n\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    data = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        data.append(input().strip())\n\n    # If the input was given as a single string like in the example: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'] then we might have to adjust?\n    # But the problem says: the first line contains two integers, then n lines.\n\n    # Compute max_chars for each column\n    max_chars = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [data[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_chars.append(max(col))\n\n    # Now, for each student, check if there's at least one subject j where data[i][j] == max_chars[j]\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if data[i][j] == max_chars[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count += 1\n\n    print(count)\n\nHowever, note the example input format: sometimes the input is provided as a string that includes the newline and spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \n    Input: \n        The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\nSo we read the first line, then the next n lines.\n\nBut the example input is given as a list of strings, but that's just for the example. In our program, we read from stdin.\n\nLet's test with the provided example.\n\nExample 1:\n    Input: \n        \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n    After split: \n        n=3, m=3\n        data = ['223','232','112']\n\nExample 2:\n    Input: \n        \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n    Then data = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n    Let's compute max_chars for each column:\n\n        Column0: ['9','1','1'] -> '9'\n        Column1: ['1','1','1'] -> '1'\n        Column2: ['7','8','1'] -> '8'\n        Column3: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n        Column4: ['8','8','1'] -> '8'\n\n    Now, check each student:\n\n        Student0: \"91728\"\n            j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student1: \"11828\"\n            j0: '1' != '9'\n            j1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student2: \"11111\"\n            j0: '1' != '9'\n            j1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n    Output: 3.\n\nThis matches.\n\nEdge case: n=1, m=1. Then the student must be successful because he is the only one and hence best in the only subject.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=0. Then no subjects. Then the student is not successful. But note: the problem says \"there exists a subject he is the best at\". If there are no subjects, then no. So output 0.\n\nBut the constraints say n, m>=1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\nSimilarly, n=0? The constraints say n>=1.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks across m subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student in the group. This involves iterating through each column (subject) of the gradebook and identifying the maximum value.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark matches the highest mark for that subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data_input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data_input:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data_input[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data_input[i].strip())\n        \n    max_chars = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_chars.append(max(col))\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_chars[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into individual lines. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines represent each student's marks as strings.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark (as a character) using Python's built-in `max` function.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks each subject to see if their mark matches the highest mark for that subject. If a match is found, the student is marked as successful, and the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary checks.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects and counts those who excel in at least one subject, leveraging simple loops and comparisons for clarity and correctness.",
