He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The string is built in three steps:\n    - Step 1: A has a string of one or more 'a's.\n    - Step 2: B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's to the end.\n    - Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's (equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' OR both) to the end.\n\n Important constraints:\n   - The entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, note that C appends 'c' only if the condition holds, but the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string\". However, note that when C appends, the string already has the original 'a's and 'b's from A and B, and then we add the 'c's. So the count of 'a' and 'b' in the string at the time of C appending is the same as the entire string without the appended 'c's? Actually, no: because the problem says:\n\n    - A gives a string of 'a's (so initial string has some number of 'a').\n    - Then B appends some 'b's. So after B, we have: [some 'a's][some 'b's] (at least one each).\n    - Then C appends 'c's, and the number of 'c's is equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' in the entire string at the time of his appending? Actually, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\" — meaning the entire string (after A and B) or the current state?\n\n But note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" and \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n Since the string at that point (before C appends) has all the 'a's and 'b's, then the counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed. Then the total string becomes: [original a's and b's] + [c's]. And the condition is that the number of c's (which is what C appends) must be either the total number of 'a' (from the entire string without the c's? actually the entire string without the c's is the part from A and B, so the 'a's are the same as in the beginning, and the 'b's are the same as added by B) OR the total number of 'b' (same as above).\n\n However, note that the entire string (after C) will have:\n   total_a = (number of 'a' in the first part)\n   total_b = (number of 'b' in the second part)\n   total_c = (number of 'c' appended)\n\n Condition for C: total_c must be either total_a or total_b.\n\n Also, the structure of the string must be:\n   All the 'a's must come first (from A), then all the 'b's (from B), then all the 'c's (from C). \n\n But wait: what if there are no 'b's? The problem says that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one). So there must be at least one 'b'. Similarly, A must have at least one 'a'. And C appends at least one 'c'? Actually, the condition doesn't explicitly say C appends at least one, but the problem states: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends\" — it could be zero? Let me read again: \"he appends some number of letters 'c'\", and \"some number\" typically means at least one. But also the condition says \"equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'\", and if the number of 'a' or 'b' is zero, then zero is allowed? However, the problem states that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because A and B ensured that). So the counts for 'a' and 'b' are at least 1. Therefore, the number of 'c' must be at least 1 (if we consider that the condition requires an equality to a positive number). But note: the condition does not require that the appended 'c' count is positive? Actually, the problem says \"appends some number\", which in programming problems usually implies at least one. However, let's check the example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The key insight is that the string must adhere to a strict structure: all 'a's must come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's appended must either match the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string (excluding the 'c's themselves).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must consist of zero or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then zero or more 'c's. Any deviation from this structure (like 'a' appearing after 'b' or 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate 'c' Count**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, it's still valid as per the problem statement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string has the correct structure: a's (possibly none), then b's (at least one), then c's (possibly none)\n    n = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    # Traverse until we find a character different from 'a'\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Now, we should have only 'b's next until the end of 'b's\n    j = i\n    while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    # Then, the rest should be 'c's\n    k = j\n    while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n        k += 1\n        \n    # If we didn't traverse the entire string, there's an invalid character\n    if k != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check that there is at least one 'b' (since B appends at least one 'b')\n    if i == n or j - i == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Count the number of each character\n    count_a = i\n    count_b = j - i\n    count_c = k - j\n    \n    # The condition for C: count_c must be either count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code first checks if the string follows the sequence 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's. It does this by traversing the string until it encounters a non-'a' character, then ensuring the subsequent characters are 'b's, and finally verifying the remaining characters are 'c's.\n2. **Validation of 'b's Presence**: The code ensures there is at least one 'b' in the string, as required by the problem statement.\n3. **Count Validation**: The counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are determined. The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's for the string to be valid. The result is printed based on this condition.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical conditions required by the problem, ensuring correctness for all possible valid and invalid inputs.",
