They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has 2^n teams. The playoff proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n). In the i-th phase (0-indexed? note: the string s index 0 corresponds to the first phase which has 2^(n-1) games) we have:\n   - If s[i] is '0', then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If s[i] is '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n We are to determine all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) for which there exists a permutation p (which is just an ordering of the numbers 1 to 2^n) such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n How the tournament works:\n   There are n phases. In phase 1 (the first round) there are 2^(n-1) games, each game being between consecutive teams: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), ... \n   Then, the next phase (if needed) uses the winners from the previous phase to form new matches: the winner of the first two games (i.e., the winner of the first game and the winner of the second game) play each other, and so on.\n\n Observation:\n   The structure of the tournament is fixed (like a bracket). However, we can assign the initial ordering arbitrarily (because the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily). But note: the problem says that p is a permutation of [1, 2^n]. So we can arrange the teams arbitrarily at the beginning.\n\n However, the results of each game depend on the phase's rule (given by s). We cannot change the rules.\n\n We are allowed to assign the team numbers arbitrarily to the initial positions (which are fixed by the bracket structure). Then, as the tournament progresses, the outcomes are determined by the rules.\n\n The goal: find all x (team numbers) that can win the tournament under some assignment.\n\n Alternate view: we can choose any labeling of the 2^n teams (with distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n) to the fixed bracket positions. Then, simulate the tournament according to the rules (each phase i: if s[i]=='0', then in every match in that phase the lower number wins; if '1', then the higher number wins).\n\n But note: the problem does not require us to simulate the entire tournament for every x (because 2^n can be up to 2^18 = 262144, and we have to check for all x from 1 to 2^n). We need a smarter way.\n\n Insight:\n\n Let the tournament bracket have rounds (phases) from round 0 (first round) to round n-1 (final). Actually, the problem describes:\n   Phase 1: 2^(n-1) games -> round 0 (if we consider the final as round n-1, then the first round is round 0, and the next round is round 1, etc.)\n\n But note: the description says \"if only one team remains, the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins\". So the first phase (with 2^(n-1) games) is the first round, and the last phase (with 1 game) is the final.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can think of the tournament as having n rounds (or n-1 eliminations per team, but actually the total games are 2^n-1). The key is that the outcome of each match in a round depends on the rule and the two teams' skills.\n\n However, note that the entire bracket is fixed. The structure is: \n   Round 0 (first phase): matches are between consecutive teams: (1,2), (3,4), ... (2^(n-1)-1, 2^(n-1)), etc.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the teams are split into pairs: team 1 vs team 2, team 3 vs team 4, ...\", so the initial bracket is fixed by the natural order. However, we can assign the team numbers arbitrarily to these initial positions.\n\n Therefore, we can assign the 2^n distinct numbers arbitrarily to the leaves of the bracket (the initial 2^n teams). Then, the tournament proceeds from the leaves upward.\n\n The catch: the outcome of each match is determined by the rule of the current phase (round) and the two numbers in that match.\n\n We want to know: for a particular team x, is there an assignment of the 2^n numbers to the bracket leaves such that x wins the tournament?\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote the bracket as a complete binary tree of height n (so 2^n leaves). Each node in the tree represents a match. The matches in the same round (same level) are independent and use the same rule (given by the corresponding character in s).\n\n The rule for round i (where i=0 is the first round) is s_i. The rounds go from round 0 (first round) to round n-1 (last round, the final). Note: the problem states the string s of length n, and the i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the phase with 2^(n-i) games. \n\n Actually, note: \n   In the first phase (i=0): 2^(n-1) games -> that's round 0 (first round).\n   Then the next phase (i=1): 2^(n-2) games -> round 1.\n\n So the rule for round k (k from 0 to n-1) is s[k].\n\n Now, what conditions must hold for a team x to win?\n\n We can think recursively: \n   To win the tournament, x must win all rounds. In each round, x must be present and must beat the opponent in that round.\n\n But note: the assignment is arbitrary. However, the bracket structure (the fixed pairing) implies that in the first round, x is matched with one specific leaf (the next one). Then, in the second round, it is matched with one of the winners of the first two rounds (which are two specific leaves from the first two rounds).\n\n However, we can assign the entire set of numbers arbitrarily. So we can decide which numbers are placed in the leaves. The condition for x to win is:\n\n   For each round k (from 0 to n-1), the path from x to the root must have, at each node (match), the rule s[k] must be satisfied when comparing x with the opponent that is assigned to that match.\n\n But note: the opponents in the subsequent rounds are determined by the assignments. However, we can choose the entire permutation arbitrarily.\n\n Conditions:\n\n   In round 0 (first round): x must be assigned to a leaf. Then, the opponent is the next leaf (adjacent). The rule s[0] determines which of the two wins.\n\n   Since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose the opponent arbitrarily from the remaining 2^n-1 numbers.\n\n   However, we must also ensure that x survives all rounds.\n\n   Consider: \n      In round 0: \n          If s[0] is '0' (lower-skilled wins), then we need the opponent to have a higher skill (number) than x? \n          But note: the problem states the team with the lower skill wins. And the team's skill is the number. So if s[0]=='0', then we require that the opponent has a higher number (so that x, being lower, wins). Conversely, if s[0]=='1', then the higher wins, so we require the opponent to have a lower number.\n\n   However, wait: the rule says \"in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\" (for '0') or \"higher\" (for '1'). Therefore, for x to win the match in round 0, we require:\n\n        if s[0]=='0': then the opponent must be greater than x.\n        if s[0]=='1': then the opponent must be less than x.\n\n   But note: we are free to assign the rest arbitrarily. However, we must also consider that the same assignment must work for the entire tournament.\n\n   The problem: we must assign all the numbers. The opponents in later rounds are determined by the assignments and the outcomes.\n\n   Let F(x) be the condition that x can win the tournament.\n\n   Another idea: consider the entire set of numbers and the bracket. The tournament is deterministic once the assignment is fixed. We can think of the bracket as requiring that at each round, x must face opponents that are consistent with the rule and the assignment.\n\n   However, we can also consider that the bracket has a fixed structure (the leaves are arranged in order, and the matches are fixed). But we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n   This means: we can choose the entire set of numbers arbitrarily. Then, the condition for x to win is that there exists an assignment such that:\n\n        In round 0: x beats its first opponent (as defined by the rule s[0]).\n        In round 1: x beats the winner of the two adjacent opponents (the two that were in the same part of the bracket as x) but note: the two adjacent opponents are now two teams that have already been determined by the first round. However, we can assign arbitrarily so we can control the entire set.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: what are the necessary conditions on x?\n\n   We can consider the following:\n\n        Let the tournament have n rounds. The bracket has 2^n leaves. The path of x goes through n rounds.\n\n        In round k (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), x must face an opponent that is the winner of a sub-bracket of size 2^(n-k-1) (since after k rounds, we have 2^n / 2^k = 2^(n-k) teams remaining, and then we have one more round to reduce to 2^(n-k-1) winners? Actually, no: after k rounds, we have 2^n / 2^k = 2^(n-k) teams. Then the next round (k+1) will have 2^(n-k-1) games, so 2^(n-k-1) winners. But the structure is fixed.\n\n   Actually, the entire tournament is a complete binary tree. The leaves are numbered from 0 to 2^n-1 (if we consider 0-indexed) and the matches are fixed.\n\n   However, we can assign the team numbers arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the strongest team (highest number) to the leaves that are necessary for x to win.\n\n   What constraints does x have to satisfy?\n\n        In round k, the opponent that x faces must be such that:\n\n          - The opponent is the winner of the sub-bracket that is adjacent to x (at the same level) in the bracket.\n\n          - The rule for round k is s[k].\n\n        But note: the entire bracket is fixed. The two halves of the bracket are independent until they meet in the final.\n\n        Let the bracket be split as follows:\n\n            Round 0: the entire bracket is split into 2^(n-1) games. The bracket is naturally divided into adjacent pairs.\n\n            Round 1: the winners of the first two adjacent pairs form a game, and so on.\n\n        Actually, the bracket is fixed: the matches are predetermined by the initial seeding (but we can seed arbitrarily). However, the structure (which leaves feed into which parent) is fixed.\n\n        We can think of the bracket as having two halves: the left half and the right half. Then, the condition for x to win is that in each round, the set of teams that x must beat (or that block x from winning) must be chosen appropriately.\n\n        Specifically, to win the tournament, x must:\n\n          - In the first round, beat its immediate opponent (which we can choose arbitrarily from the remaining numbers, but note: we have to assign all numbers, so we must choose an opponent that satisfies the condition for round0 and then also set up the rest of the bracket so that x can continue to win).\n\n        However, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n          1. The set of teams that x must defeat (directly or indirectly) to become champion.\n\n          2. The condition that in each round, the rule must be compatible with the relative ordering of x and the teams it faces.\n\n        Consider the minimal requirements:\n\n          - In the first round, x must beat one opponent (say a0). Then, in the second round, x must beat the winner of the first two rounds (which includes a0 and the next opponent, say a1). But note: the two initial opponents (a0 and a1) are adjacent in the bracket. However, we can choose the entire assignment.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider that the tournament requires x to be the only undefeated team. The opponents that x faces in each round must be from the set of numbers that we assign to the bracket.\n\n        The key observation: the entire tournament is a single elimination bracket. The set of teams that x must defeat (including indirect defeats) is all the teams in the opposite half of the bracket until the final? Actually, no: x must defeat one team per round, and the opponents in the subsequent rounds are the winners of the other matches.\n\n        Actually, the total number of teams that x must eliminate is 2^n - 1. But note: we can arrange the bracket arbitrarily. However, the bracket structure (the fixed matching) imposes that the set of teams that x meets in the tournament is determined by the assignment.\n\n        But note: the bracket structure is fixed. The initial matches are fixed: the first match is between the first and second, third and fourth, etc. However, we can assign the numbers arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the numbers so that x is placed at any leaf and the rest arbitrarily.\n\n        The challenge: we must assign the entire set of numbers (from 1 to 2^n) to the leaves.\n\n        Conditions for x to win:\n\n          In round k (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the opponent that x faces must be chosen from the set of numbers that are currently in the same subtree (the one that feeds into x's match at that round). However, we can choose the entire permutation.\n\n        Let us define:\n\n          Let the bracket have 2^n leaves. We can assign the numbers arbitrarily. The tournament progresses from the leaves to the root.\n\n        The necessary condition for x to win:\n\n          In each round k (0 <= k < n), the set of numbers that x must defeat (directly or indirectly) is constrained by the rule.\n\n        However, note: the rule applies to every match in that round. Therefore, for x to win a round, the rule must be such that x is the winner of that match. Moreover, the opponents in the subsequent rounds are the winners of their own subtrees.\n\n        We can think greedily:\n\n          We can assign the numbers so that in each match that x participates in, the rule is satisfied. But we must also make sure that the entire set of numbers is used and that the opponents in the previous rounds (that x must face) are available and satisfy the rules.\n\n        How about we consider the following:\n\n          Let the tournament be broken down into rounds. In round k, x is in a group of 2^(n-k) teams (because there are 2^(n-k) teams remaining). The match that x plays is against the winner of the adjacent group (which is the other half of the current group). \n\n          The condition for round k:\n\n            - If s[k] is '0' (lower wins), then in the entire tournament bracket, at round k, x must be the smallest number in its entire group (the group of 2^(n-k)) because then it will win all the matches in that round (and the subsequent rounds) until the final? Not exactly.\n\n          Actually, the rule applies per match. So in round k, the match is between two teams. But the two teams might have come from two different groups (each group being a set of 2^(n-k-1) teams). The rule for round k is applied independently to each match.\n\n          However, note the structure: the entire bracket is fixed. The two teams that x faces in round k are the winners of two adjacent matches from the previous round. But we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Alternate Insight (known from similar problems, e.g., CodeForces problems with fixed bracket and arbitrary assignment):\n\n          The tournament is a complete binary tree. The champion must be the team that can \"defeat\" all others according to the rules. The rules are either always the same (all rounds are '0') or mixed.\n\n          We can consider the following:\n\n            Let A be the set of teams that x must lose to (if the rule is '0' in a round, then x must be below the opponent; if '1', then above). But note: the bracket structure: the opponents are predetermined by the bracket.\n\n          However, we can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the opponents arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct numbers). The constraint is that the entire set must be used.\n\n        Another known approach: consider the entire bracket as a set of matches. The condition for x to win is that for every other team y, there must exist a path (from the leaf of x to the root) such that at each round k along the path, the rule s[k] must allow x to defeat the necessary opponents that include y (if y is in the same half as x at that round, then they meet at some point; if not, then they don't meet until later?).\n\n        Actually, the bracket structure is fixed: the matches are predetermined. The two halves of the bracket at the first round are fixed. Then, the two halves of the bracket at the second round are fixed, etc.\n\n        We can think of the bracket as having two halves: left and right. Then, the condition for x to win is:\n\n          - In the first round, x must be in a position where the immediate opponent is chosen to satisfy the rule for round0.\n\n          - Then, in the second round, the opponent is the winner of the left half (if x is on the left) and the right half (if x is on the right) but note: the bracket is fixed. Actually, the bracket is fixed: the first two rounds (two games) are grouped to form the next. So if we fix x at a leaf, then the entire set of leaves is fixed, and the outcomes are determined by the rules and the numbers.\n\n        However, we can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the numbers so that x is the best (or worst) in the entire bracket, depending on the rules.\n\n        Let us assume that we want x to be the champion. Then, in each round, the rule must be such that x is the one that wins the match.\n\n        Consider the entire set of numbers. The minimal requirement is that in the first round, x must have an opponent that is:\n\n          - Greater than x (if s[0]=='0')\n          - Less than x (if s[0]=='1')\n\n        Then, in the second round, the opponent is the winner of two matches (which involves two teams). But note: we can choose the entire assignment. Therefore, we can choose the opponents arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and from 1 to 2^n excluding x).\n\n        However, the condition for the second round is:\n\n          - If s[1]=='0', then in the second round, x must be the smallest among the three teams (x and the two that formed the opponent)? Actually, no: in the second round, the two teams that form the opponent of x are the winners of two adjacent first-round matches. But we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the second round is that the two teams that x must defeat (indirectly) in the second round are the winners of the two adjacent first-round matches. But note: the two adjacent first-round matches are two teams (each from a first-round win). We can assign the two adjacent first-round matches arbitrarily (from the remaining numbers). So the condition for the second round is:\n\n          - The rule s[1] must be satisfied for the match between x and the combined winner of the two adjacent first-round matches.\n\n        But wait: the two adjacent first-round matches are independent. However, the rule for the second round is applied only to the match that x plays. So we can choose the two adjacent first-round matches arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and not x). Then, the winner of the two adjacent first-round matches is determined by the rule for round0 (if s[0] is the same for both matches, then the winner of each is determined by s[0]). Then, the second-round match is between x and that winner.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for the second round is:\n\n          - If s[1]=='0', then x must be less than the winner of the two adjacent first-round matches.\n          - If s[1]=='1', then x must be greater than the winner.\n\n        But note: the winner of the two adjacent first-round matches is the maximum (if s[0]=='1') or the minimum (if s[0]=='0') of the two teams in those matches.\n\n        However, we can choose the two teams arbitrarily (from the remaining numbers). So we can choose two numbers that will produce a winner that is either as large as possible or as small as possible, depending on s[0]. But we have to satisfy the condition for the second round.\n\n        This leads to a recursive condition:\n\n          Let L_k be the set of teams that x must defeat (directly or indirectly) in the k-th round. Actually, the entire set of teams that x must defeat is all the other teams. But the condition is that at each round, the rule must allow x to be the winner of that match.\n\n        However, we can break down the bracket:\n\n          The tournament is divided into two halves (each of size 2^(n-1)). The champion must win all matches. The condition for x to win the tournament is that:\n\n            - In the first round, the immediate opponent is chosen to satisfy s[0].\n            - Then, in the next rounds, the opponents (which are the winners of the adjacent groups) must be chosen to satisfy the subsequent rules.\n\n        But note: the entire set of numbers is fixed (from 1 to 2^n). We can choose which numbers go to which part of the bracket.\n\n        We can consider the following:\n\n          Let R be the set of rounds (from 0 to n-1). For each round k, we have a rule r_k = s[k].\n\n          Condition for round k:\n\n            The value x must be able to \"compete\" with the set of numbers that are in the same half of the bracket (at the k-th round) and the other half. However, the bracket is fixed: the matches are fixed.\n\n        Actually, we can assign the entire set arbitrarily. Therefore, the condition for x to win is:\n\n          There exists an assignment of the 2^n numbers to the leaves such that:\n\n            For round 0: the two numbers in the first match (if x is in that match) must satisfy: \n                if r_0 == '0', then x < opponent, and if '1', then x > opponent.\n\n            For round 1: the two adjacent matches (which form the next level) must be assigned numbers such that the winner of each is determined by r_0 (if r_0 is the same for both, then we know the two winners) and then the match between x and the winner of the adjacent two must satisfy r_1.\n\n          But note: the two adjacent matches (for the second round) are fixed by the bracket. However, we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        We can generalize:\n\n          The tournament can be seen as having a fixed bracket (a complete binary tree). The champion must be the only number that, for every match along its path, the rule at that round allows x to win.\n\n        However, we can choose the entire assignment. Therefore, we can choose the numbers for the entire bracket arbitrarily.\n\n        What is the necessary and sufficient condition?\n\n          Consider that x must be the unique number that, for each round k, is the minimum (if r_k=='0') or the maximum (if r_k=='1') in the entire set of 2^(n-k) numbers (the ones that are in the same part of the bracket as x at round k) ?\n\n        Why? Because in round k, x is in a group of 2^(n-k) teams (the entire remaining set is 2^(n-k) teams). Then, the bracket within that group is fixed. The rule r_k determines the winner of each match in that round. But note: the entire group must be reduced to one winner (the one that goes to the next round). The winner of the group is determined by the rule applied repeatedly.\n\n        Actually, the winner of a group of 2^m teams (with m rounds) is:\n\n          - If all the rules in the rounds (from round k to the final round) are '0', then the smallest number in the entire group wins.\n          - If all the rules are '1', then the largest number wins.\n          - If there is a mix, then the outcome is determined by the rules in order.\n\n        But note: the rules are fixed per round (and the rounds are from the current round k to the final). However, the bracket structure is fixed (the same as a standard single elimination). \n\n        Actually, the winner of a group of 2^m teams (with m rounds) is not necessarily the min or max of the group. It depends on the rules.\n\n        Example: \n          Group: {1,2,3} (so m=1 round, then two rounds? Actually, for a group of 4, we have two rounds: round k and then the next round).\n\n        But note: our tournament has a fixed bracket. The matches are predetermined. However, we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Insight from known tournament problems: \n\n          In a single elimination tournament with a fixed bracket and arbitrary assignment, the condition for a particular number x to win is that:\n\n            For each round k (from 0 to n-1), x must be the only number in the set of numbers that are in the same half (the half that feeds into the same parent) that satisfies a certain property.\n\n        Actually, we can think of the tournament as requiring that at each round, the set of numbers that x must defeat is increasing (if the rule is '1') or decreasing (if the rule is '0').\n\n        However, here is a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces problem \"The Tournament\"):\n\n          The tournament bracket can be represented by a binary tree. The champion must be the team that is the overall minimum (if all rounds are '0') or overall maximum (if all rounds are '1'). But if the rounds are mixed, then the condition is more complex.\n\n        But note: the rules are fixed per round and the bracket is fixed (the same for all). The assignment is arbitrary.\n\n        We can consider the following:\n\n          The tournament is played in rounds. In round k, the rule is r_k. Then, the winner of the entire tournament is the number that, for each round, is the winner of the match at that round.\n\n        How do we compute the winner for a given assignment? \n\n          We can simulate the bracket. But we have 2^n teams, and n<=18, so 2^18 is about 262144, which is too many to simulate for each x.\n\n        We need a better idea.\n\n        Let us consider the following:\n\n          We can consider the entire tournament as a set of 2^n numbers. The champion is the number that, in the first round, beats its opponent (according to rule0), then in the next round, beats the winner of the adjacent two (according to rule1), and so on.\n\n          The key is: the assignment is arbitrary, so we can choose the entire set arbitrarily. Therefore, the condition for x to be the champion is that:\n\n            There exists a way to assign the remaining 2^n-1 numbers to the bracket such that:\n\n              - In the first round, the two numbers in the same match as x satisfy the rule0.\n              - In the second round, the two numbers that are in the adjacent matches (so that they become the opponent for x) must be chosen so that they win their first round (so they must satisfy the rule0 for their first round) and then the rule1 must be satisfied for the second round.\n\n          We can think of the tournament as having two halves. The champion must win all rounds. The minimal requirement is that x must be the overall minimum (if the rules are all '0') or the overall maximum (if the rules are all '1'). But if the rules are mixed, then x must be the minimum in the rounds with rule '0' and the maximum in the rounds with rule '1'? \n\n        Actually, we can consider that the entire tournament is a sequence of eliminations. The set of numbers that x must beat (directly or indirectly) is all the other numbers. However, the condition is that at each round, the rule must be such that x is the winner.\n\n        We can define:\n\n          Let A be the set of numbers that x must be greater than (if the rule is '1') and less than (if the rule is '0').\n\n        But note: the bracket structure: the matches are fixed. The set of numbers that x must defeat is not arbitrary. They are the ones that are assigned to the positions that are in the path and the adjacent paths.\n\n        After thinking, here is a solution:\n\n          We can use dynamic programming or greedy assignment to determine the range of numbers that can be the champion.\n\n          However, note: we are asked for all x that can be the champion.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n          The tournament is a complete binary tree. The champion is the number that, in the first round, is the winner of its match (so it must be the min or max of its two numbers). Then, in the next round, it must be the winner of its two children (which are the winners of two matches). \n\n          We can consider that the entire tournament requires x to be the \"survivor\" of the rules. \n\n          Specifically, let us define:\n\n            Let the rounds be indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n            Let the condition for round k be:\n\n              - If s[k]=='0', then x must be the smallest number in the entire set of numbers that are in the same subtree (the one that contains x and has depth n-k-1) at round k.\n              - If s[k]=='1', then x must be the largest number in that subtree.\n\n          But wait, the entire tournament is the whole set. However, at round k, the subtree has 2^(n-k) numbers (the entire set initially, then reducing). Actually, no: at round k, x is in a group of 2^(n-k) numbers (the entire set of numbers that are still in the tournament at that round). But we can choose the entire assignment arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, the assignment is done at the beginning. We assign numbers to all leaves. Then, the tournament proceeds.\n\n          The condition for x to win the tournament is that:\n\n            There exists an assignment of the 2^n numbers such that for each round k (0<=k<n), x is the winner of its match in round k.\n\n          And the winner of a match in round k is determined by:\n\n            if s[k]=='0': the smaller number wins.\n            if s[k]=='1': the larger number wins.\n\n          Moreover, the match in round k is between two numbers that are the winners of two matches in round k-1 (except the first round). \n\n          We can assign the numbers arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the numbers for the entire bracket arbitrarily. \n\n          How many numbers must be greater than x (for the '0' rules) and how many must be less than x (for the '1' rules)?\n\n          Specifically, consider the rounds:\n\n            In round 0: x must be either the smallest or the largest in its immediate match (two numbers). \n\n            In round 1: x must be either the smallest or the largest in a set of four numbers (its match and the adjacent match).\n\n          More generally, at round k, x must be either the smallest or the largest in a set of 2^(n-k) numbers (the entire set of numbers that are in the same half of the bracket at round k). But note: the bracket is fixed, but the assignment is arbitrary. \n\n          Actually, the set of numbers that x must be compared to in round k is the set of 2^(n-k) numbers that are in the same branch (the entire subtree) that contains x at round k. \n\n          However, the entire tournament uses all 2^n numbers. Therefore, the set of numbers that x must be compared to in round k is exactly the set of 2^(n-k) numbers that are in the same half (the half that contains x) at round k.\n\n          But note: the assignment is arbitrary, so we can choose the entire set of numbers arbitrarily. Therefore, the condition for x to win the tournament is:\n\n            There exists an assignment of the 2^n numbers such that:\n\n              For each round k (0<=k<n), in the set S_k of 2^(n-k) numbers that are in the same half as x at round k, x is the unique number that satisfies:\n\n                  if s[k]=='0', then x is the minimum of S_k.\n                  if s[k]=='1', then x is the maximum of S_k.\n\n          However, note: the set S_k for round k is fixed by the bracket (it's the entire subtree that contains x). But wait, the assignment is arbitrary, so we can choose which numbers go into which part of the bracket.\n\n          Therefore, we can choose the set S_k arbitrarily as long as the sets S_0, S_1, ..., S_{n-1} are nested (S_0 contains x and one other number, S_1 contains S_0 and the next adjacent set, etc.).\n\n          Actually, the sets S_k are not arbitrary: they are the sets of numbers that are in the same part of the bracket as x at round k. The bracket is fixed, so the structure of the sets is fixed: S_0 has 2^(n-0)=2^n? No, wait: at round k, there are 2^(n-k) teams remaining. But the set S_k is the set of teams that are still in the tournament and are in the same half as x at round k? Actually, no: at round k, the entire tournament has 2^(n-k) teams. The set S_k is the set of teams that are in the subtree that contains x at round k, which has 2^(n-k) teams? Actually, the entire tournament at round k has 2^(n-k) teams. But the set S_k (the set of teams that are in the same half as x at round k) has 2^(n-k) / 2 = 2^(n-k-1) teams? \n\n          Let me clarify:\n\n            At round 0: the entire set has 2^n teams. The bracket is split into 2^(n-1) games. The set S_0 for x is the two teams (x and one other) that are in the same match.\n\n            At round 1: the entire set has 2^(n-1) teams. The set S_1 for x is the four teams (x and the three others that are in the same part of the bracket as x) that will feed into the same parent node.\n\n          Therefore, at round k, the set S_k has 2^(n-k) teams? Actually, no: the entire tournament at round k has 2^(n-k) teams. And the set S_k (the set of teams that are in the same half as x at round k) has 2^(n-k) / 2 = 2^(n-k-1) teams? \n\n          Actually, no: the entire tournament at round k has 2^(n-k) teams. The bracket is still a complete binary tree. The set S_k is the set of teams that are in the same branch as x (the branch that will eventually lead to x being the champion). But note: the tournament is single elimination. At round k, x has already eliminated k teams. The set of teams that x has faced is k+1 (including itself). But the set of teams that are still in the tournament and are in the same branch as x is the entire set of teams that started in the same half as x at round0 and haven't been eliminated? \n\n          Actually, the bracket is fixed: the two teams that are adjacent to x in the first round are fixed by the bracket. Then, the next round's match for x is between x and the winner of the two adjacent teams. The set of teams that x faces in round k is the 2^k teams that are in the same initial block of size 2^k+1? \n\n          Let me reindex: \n\n            Round0: the entire set is 2^n teams. The match for x is with one other team. So the set for round0 is {x, a0}.\n\n            Round1: the set for x is {x, a0, a1, a2} (because the winner of the match between a0 and the other team (say b0) becomes the opponent for x). But wait, the bracket: the two adjacent matches to x are two matches. The two winners of those two matches are the two teams that x will face in the second round? Actually, no: the second round match is between x and the winner of the two adjacent matches. But the two adjacent matches are two separate matches. So the set of teams that are in the same part as x at round1 is {x, a0, b0, b1} (if the two adjacent matches are (a0 vs b0) and (b1 vs c0) then no, wait the bracket is fixed: the matches are fixed.\n\n          Actually, the bracket is fixed: the matches are predetermined. The first round: \n            Match0: team0 vs team1\n            Match1: team2 vs team3\n            Match2: team4 vs team5\n            ...\n\n          Then, the second round: \n            Match0: winner of Match0 vs winner of Match1\n            Match2: winner",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) that can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament involves \\( 2^n \\) teams, and each phase's outcome depends on whether the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins, as specified by the string \\( s \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured in phases (rounds), each reducing the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase depends on the corresponding character in the string \\( s \\). If the character is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins. The goal is to find all possible team numbers \\( x \\) that can emerge as the champion under some permutation of team skills.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must satisfy specific conditions in each phase based on the rules. Specifically, for each phase \\( i \\):\n   - If \\( s[i] = '0' \\), \\( x \\) must be the smallest number in its current group of \\( 2^{n-i} \\) teams.\n   - If \\( s[i] = '1' \\), \\( x \\) must be the largest number in its current group.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking for each team \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\) whether it can meet these conditions in all phases. This is done by:\n   - **Binary Search Tree (BST) Construction**: For each \\( x \\), construct a BST where each node represents a comparison in a phase. The BST structure helps in efficiently determining the necessary comparisons.\n   - **Validation**: For each \\( x \\), validate if it can be the root of the BST built from the phases' rules, ensuring it meets the conditions (being the minimum or maximum in each subtree) as required by the rules.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each of the \\( 2^n \\) teams, and for each team, processes up to \\( n \\) phases. Each phase operation is \\( O(n) \\) due to BST construction and traversal, leading to an overall complexity of \\( O(n \\cdot 2^n) \\), which is feasible since \\( n \\leq 18 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    \n    def can_win(x):\n        if x == 1:\n            return True\n        if x == total_teams:\n            return True\n        \n        tree = {}\n        \n        def build_tree(phase, min_val, max_val, left_bound, right_bound):\n            if phase == n:\n                return None\n                \n            key = 1 << (n -
