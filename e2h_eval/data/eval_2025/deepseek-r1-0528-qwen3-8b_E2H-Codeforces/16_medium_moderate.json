Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation here is that the roads are lines and they divide the plane into regions. The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a nonzero boundary, which in this case means crossing a road (i.e., going from one side of a road to the other). However, note that we can cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: when moving from one block to another, you cross exactly one road (if the common border is a segment of one road). But wait, what if two roads cross at a point and we are at an intersection? Then we might be able to cross multiple roads at the same time? However, note the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\nBut note: the problem also says that your home and university are not on any road.\n\nHowever, there's a catch: the entire set of roads divides the plane. The minimal steps required is actually the number of roads that separate the home from the university, but with a twist: sometimes you can cross multiple roads at an intersection and then effectively skip some steps? Actually, no: the problem states that each step is crossing one road (because you move from one block to an adjacent one by crossing one road). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the minimum number of roads that must be crossed to go from the home to the university.\n\nBut wait: consider that if two roads are crossed at the same time (at an intersection) then we might think that we could cross two roads in one step? However, the problem says: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\" — meaning that the two blocks must share a border that is a segment of one road (so one road). Therefore, even if two roads meet at a point, you cannot cross both at the same time because the common border between two blocks is a segment of one road.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: count the number of roads for which the home and the university lie on opposite sides. However, wait: if a road separates the home and the university, then we must cross it. But if a road does not separate them (i.e., both on the same side), then we don't need to cross it. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home from the university.\n\nBut let me check with the example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nThese are the lines: x=0 (vertical line) and y=0 (horizontal line). \n\nHome (1,1): above and right of the origin.\nUniversity (-1,-1): below and left of the origin.\n\nNow, for the vertical line x=0: \n  At home: 1>0 -> positive side.\n  At university: -1<0 -> negative side. So they are separated.\n\nFor the horizontal line y=0:\n  At home: 1>0 -> positive side.\n  At university: -1<0 -> negative side. So they are separated.\n\nThen the answer would be 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \n1 1\n-1 -1\n3\n1 0 0   -> x = 0\n0 1 0   -> y = 0\n1 1 -3  -> x+y-3=0\n\nWe already have the first two. Now the third: x+y-3=0. \n  Home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0.\n  University (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 <0.\nSo the third road does not separate them.\n\nThus, the minimal steps is the count of roads that separate home and university, which is 2.\n\nBut wait, is that always true? Consider that we can cross multiple roads at an intersection. However, the problem states that we must cross each separating road at least once, and we can do so independently. But note: if we cross one road, we enter a new block, and then we might be closer to crossing the next. However, the minimal steps is exactly the number of separating roads because each step crosses one road.\n\nBut wait: what if two roads are parallel? Then we cannot cross them at the same time, but we still have to cross each one separately. So the count of separating roads is the minimal steps.\n\nHowever, consider an alternative: sometimes a single step might allow you to cross more than one road if the common border is a segment of one road? Actually, no: the common border is defined by one road. When two blocks share a common border, it is a segment of one road. Therefore, to get from home to university, you must cross every road that separates them, and you cannot avoid crossing any of these. And since you can only cross one road per step, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nBut wait: what if two roads separate the home and university, but they are the same road? The input guarantees that no two roads are the same.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nFor each road i (with equation a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0):\n  Evaluate the sign at home: s1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n  Evaluate the sign at university: s2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n\nIf s1 * s2 < 0, then the road separates home and university.\n\nThen the answer is the total count of such roads.\n\nBut wait: what if the road passes exactly between without having opposite signs? Actually, we have guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on the road, so s1 and s2 are never zero.\n\nLet me test with the examples:\n\nExample 1: \n  Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n      s1 = 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n      s2 = 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 -> opposite.\n\n  Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n      s1 = 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n      s2 = 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 -> opposite.\n\n  Count=2 -> output 2.\n\nExample 2:\n  Road3: 1*x + 1*y -3 =0\n      s1 = 1+1-3 = -1\n      s2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> same sign, so not separated.\n\n  So only the first two roads are separating -> count=2.\n\nBut wait, what about the following scenario:\n\nSuppose we have two roads that are not separating, but together they form a barrier? Actually, no: the condition is that we only care about individual roads. Because the movement is defined by crossing one road at a time, and the entire path must cross every separating road. And if a road does not separate, then we don't need to cross it.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward.\n\nHowever, note: the signs. We don't really need the product to be negative? We just need to know if they are on opposite sides. But note: the equation defines the line, and the sign depends on the definition. For example, the equation can be written as a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and the sign of the expression tells which side you are on.\n\nBut note: the equation can be multiplied by -1 and the line remains the same. However, if we multiply by -1, then the signs flip. But then two points that were on opposite sides become same side? Actually, no: because if originally s1 and s2 had opposite signs, then after multiplying by -1, s1 becomes -s1 and s2 becomes -s2, so the product is still positive? Let me see: originally s1*s2 <0, then (-s1)*(-s2) = s1*s2, so the product remains negative. So the condition is independent of the sign of the equation.\n\nBut wait: what if we define the equation with different signs? Actually, the condition is: if the two points are on opposite sides, then regardless of the equation's sign, the product will be negative. Because if s1 is positive and s2 is negative, then s1*s2 is negative. If s1 is negative and s2 is positive, then s1*s2 is negative. Only if they are the same sign (both positive or both negative) then the product is positive.\n\nBut note: the equation might have a different representation. However, the condition of being on the same side or opposite side is independent of the representation.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\ncount = 0\nfor each road (a, b, c):\n    f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nBut wait: what if one is zero? The problem states that the home and university are not on the road, so f1 and f2 are never zero. However, we don't know the sign of the equation. But we can use the product: if f1 * f2 < 0 then they are on opposite sides.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\nif f1 * f2 < 0:\n    count += 1\n\nBut note: the numbers can be very large (up to 10^6, and x,y up to 10^6, so the product could be up to 10^18, which is acceptable in Python integers. However, we must be cautious because the signs might be negative and positive.\n\nBut wait: what if one of f1 or f2 is negative and the other positive, then the product is negative. This is correct.\n\nBut there's a caveat: the equation is defined by (a,b,c). The condition for being on the same side is that the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) is the same for both points.\n\nTherefore, we can simply count the roads for which the product is negative.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nHowever, wait: there is a possibility that the equation is defined in such a way that the constant term is negative. But the condition for separation is independent of the equation's scaling (as long as the line is the same). But note: the input gives the equation as a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. The product test is valid.\n\nBut wait: what if the equation is normalized? Actually, we don't need normalization because the sign of the expression changes with the sign of the equation, but the product test remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, the program is:\n\nRead home (x1, y1)\nRead university (x2, y2)\nRead n\nFor i in range(n):\n    Read a, b, c\n    f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nPrint count\n\nBut wait: is that the minimal steps? The example outputs are 2 and 2.\n\nHowever, consider the following: \n\nWhat if the home and university are separated by 0 roads? Then the answer is 0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"the minimum number of steps\", and if they are in the same block, then 0 steps.\n\nBut wait: the example input doesn't cover that. However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\"\n\nBut what if they are in the same block? Then no road separates them, so count=0, then output 0.\n\nLet me test with a simple example: same block.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n0 0\n0 1\n1\n1 0 -1   # x-1=0, so x=1\n\nCheck: \nFor home (0,0): 0-1 = -1\nFor university (0,1): 0-1 = -1 -> same side, so not separated.\n\nAnother road: say two roads that don't separate.\n\nBut what if there are two roads that together form a barrier? Actually, the minimal steps is the number of roads that individually separate the two points.\n\nBut wait: is it possible that two roads are needed to separate two points, but one road alone separates them? Actually, no: if a road separates the two points, then we must cross it. The minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nHowever, wait: the problem statement says that the roads divide the plane. The movement is defined by crossing one road per step. Therefore, we must cross every separating road, and we can only cross one per step.\n\nBut consider: what if two separating roads are crossed in the same step? The problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is a segment of one road. So we can only cross one road per step.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nBut wait, consider the following: \n\nTwo roads that are not separating, but together with other roads form a barrier? Actually, no: the minimal path must cross every road that separates the two points. And each step crosses one road.\n\nBut wait, what if the two points are separated by two roads, but the two roads are arranged in such a way that you can cross both in one step? \n\nActually, no: because the common border must be a segment of one road. You cannot cross two roads at once. Therefore, you must take two steps.\n\nBut wait: what if two roads cross at a point? Then at that point, you are at the intersection, and from that point you can move into a block that is adjacent to both roads? Actually, no: when you are at the intersection, you are not in a block (because the intersection is the crossing of roads and the blocks are the connected regions). The problem states that home and university are not on the road, so they are in some block. The movement is from block to block, and the step requires a common border (which is a segment of one road). Therefore, you cannot jump over two roads at once.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut wait: consider a case where two roads are parallel and separate the two points. Then we have two separating roads, so two steps.\n\nAnother case: two roads that are not parallel and intersect. Then the two separating roads still require two steps.\n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    # Evaluate for home and university\n    f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the sample input format: \n\nFirst line: x1 y1\nSecond line: x2 y2\nThird line: n\nThen n lines, each with three integers.\n\nBut note: the example input is given as a string array, but in the actual input, we read from stdin.\n\nHowever, the example input has two examples. But in the problem, we are to read from stdin.\n\nBut wait, the example input format:\n\nExample 1:\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\nBut note: the second example input is provided as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples.\n\nBut the input is:\n\nFirst line: coordinates of home.\nSecond line: coordinates of university.\nThird line: n.\nThen n lines: the roads.\n\nSo the example input is:\n\n\"1 1\"\n\"-1 -1\"\n\"2\"\n\"0 1 0\"\n\"1 0 0\"\n\nBut the example input is given as a string with spaces and newlines. In our code, we should read:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input().strip())\n\nThen for i in range(n): \n    data = input().split()\n    if not data: \n        continue\n    a, b, c = map(int, data)\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers\".\n\nBut the example input is provided as a list of strings, but we are reading from stdin.\n\nI think the example provided is just to show two test cases. But the code must read from stdin.\n\nLet me run through the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n3\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 -3\n\nOutput: 2\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the third road is \"1 1 -3\", so the equation is x+y-3=0.\n\nBut wait, the example output is 2.\n\nBut wait, the example input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nThis is two separate inputs. The first input produces output '2', the second produces '2'.\n\nBut wait, the example input for the second test case is:\n\n1 1\n-1 -1\n3\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 -3\n\nBut note: the first two roads are x=0 and y=0, and the third is x+y-3=0.\n\nBut wait, why is the output 2 and not 3? Because the third road does not separate the two points (both are negative).\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait: there is an alternative scenario. What if the two points are separated by a road, but the road is defined with negative coefficients? \n\nExample: home (0,0), university (1,1), and one road: -x -y + 1 = 0 (which is the same as x+y-1=0).\n\nThen for home (0,0): -0 -0 +1 = 1 -> positive.\nFor university (1,1): -1-1+1 = -1 -> negative.\n\nSo product is negative, so counted.\n\nNow, what if the equation is defined as 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 (vertical line) but represented as (0,1,0)? Then home (1,1) and university (-1,1): \n  For home: 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n  For university: 1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative.\n\nBut wait, the equation 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 is y=0. But wait, that's the horizontal line. \n\nWait, I think I confused: the equation a*x+b*y+c=0.\n\nFor a vertical line, we need b=0 and a!=0. For example, 1*x + 0*y -1=0 (x=1) is a vertical line.\n\nBut the example I gave for the vertical line was (0,1,0) which is y=0, a horizontal line.\n\nSo the equation (0,1,0) is horizontal.\n\nBut wait, the equation (0,1,0) is 0*x + 1*y + 0 =0 -> y=0.\n\nSo the home (1,1) and university (-1,1) are separated by the horizontal line y=0? Actually, no: because they have the same y-coordinate? They are both above the line y=0? Actually, wait: the equation is y=0. The value for (1,1): 1 (positive) and (-1,1): 1 (positive). So they are on the same side.\n\nWait, wait: no, the equation is 0*x + 1*y + 0 =0. So for (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\nFor (-1,1): 0*(-1) + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n\nSo they are on the same side.\n\nBut if we have a vertical line: equation (1,0,-1) -> x=1.\nHome (0,0): 1*0 +0*0 -1 = -1 -> negative.\nUniversity (2,0): 1*2 +0*0 -1 = 1 -> positive.\n\nThen they are separated.\n\nSo the product test works.\n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input().strip())\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    # Calculate the value at home and university\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps\". And we have reasoned that the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nBut wait: what if the two points are separated by a road, but there is another road that is not separating? Then we have to cross that separating road and then maybe others.\n\nBut the above reasoning holds.\n\nHowever, wait: consider the possibility that the same road might be encountered twice? No, because the roads are distinct.\n\nBut wait: what if the two points are separated by two roads, but the minimal steps is not 2? \n\nConsider: home and university are separated by two roads. But if we cross one road, then we enter a region that is adjacent to the other road, and then we cross the other road. So two steps.\n\nBut is there a possibility of crossing the two roads in a different order and still two steps? Yes.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we can cross one road and then not have to cross the other? No, because both roads separate the two points.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the count of separating roads.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in some problems (like planar graphs) the minimal steps might be related to the arrangement of the roads. However, note: the roads are infinite lines, and the plane is divided arbitrarily. The minimal steps is the minimal number of roads to cross to go from home to university, and that is exactly the number of roads that strictly separate the two points.\n\nThis is a well-known concept: the minimal number of hyperplanes to separate two points is the number of hyperplanes that have the two points on opposite sides.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait: there is a known issue: the product of two very large numbers might cause overflow? However, the numbers are up to 10^6, and the coefficients are up to 10^6. So the maximum absolute value for val1 and val2 is:\n\n|a*x1 + b*y1 + c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c|\n<= 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 10^12 + 10^12 + 10^6 ~ 2e12.\n\nThen the product is up to (2e12)^2 = 4e24, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but the problem says the inputs are integers and the operations are integer arithmetic. However, 4e24 is a very big number and might be slow, but n is only up to 300, so 300 multiplications of numbers up to 4e24 is acceptable? Actually, no: wait, the product is 4e24, which is a 25-digit number. Python can handle that, but the problem constraints say the inputs are up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value of a*x+b*y+c is about 10^12, so the product is up to 10^24, which is a 25-digit number, and we do 300 of these. It is acceptable in terms of correctness, but might be slow? Probably not, because 300 operations is not many.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the coefficients and coordinates are integers. The product might be negative, so we can also check the signs without multiplying the huge numbers? \n\nAlternative: check the signs.\n\nif (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n    count += 1\n\nBut this avoids the multiplication and potential overflow (though in Python there is no overflow for integers, but the multiplication of two large integers might be slower). However, the numbers are 10^12, so 300 of them is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says the inputs are up to 10^6, and the coefficients are up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value of val1 and val2 is:\n\n|a*x1 + b*y1 + c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c| <= 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 1e12 + 1e12 + 1e6 = 2000000000000 + 1000000 = 2000001000000.\n\nSo the absolute value is about 2e12, which is a 13-digit number. Then the product is (2e12)^2 = 4e24, which is a 25-digit number. The sign check method uses two comparisons (each comparison is on a 13-digit number) and is probably faster.\n\nBut the problem constraints are small (n<=300), so either way is acceptable.\n\nHowever, to avoid the multiplication and potential performance issues (even though 300 operations is nothing, but the numbers are big and multiplication of big integers is more expensive) we can use the sign check.\n\nBut note: the signs are independent of the magnitude, so we can do:\n\nif (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n    count += 1\n\nThis is equivalent and avoids the product.\n\nBut wait: what if one is zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are not zero. So we don't have to worry about zero.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nif (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n    count += 1\n\nThis is more efficient and clear.\n\nFinal code:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input().strip())\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, test with the examples.\n\nExample 1: \nRoad1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> y=0.\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive -> False (if we consider <0) -> so False.\nval2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative -> True.\nThen (False != True) -> True -> count++.\n\nRoad2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> x=0.\nval1 = 1*1+0+0=1 -> positive -> False.\nval2 = 1*(-1)+0+0=-1 -> True.\nTrue -> count becomes 2.\n\nExample 2:\nRoad3: a=1, b=1, c=-3\nval1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative -> True.\nval2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> True.\nThen (True != True) -> False.\n\nSo the count is 2.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nLet me run one more test: same block.\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0 -> wait, but the problem says home and university are not on the road, but they could be the same point? Actually, the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", but they can be the same location? \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block.\" \n\nIf home and university are the same, then the minimal steps is 0. But the input says: first line: x1,y1; second line: x2,y2. They could be the same.\n\nBut note: the problem does not explicitly say that home and university are distinct. However, the guarantee is that neither is on the road.\n\nSo if they are the same, then we are already at the university, so 0 steps.\n\nBut then, for each road, we evaluate the same point twice. Then the signs are the same for both points (same point). So the condition (val1<0 != val2<0) is false for every road. So the count is 0.\n\nThat is correct.\n\nAnother test: same point, but different roads: still 0.\n\nTherefore, the code is complete.\n\nBut wait: what if the two points are the same? Then we don't need to cross any road. The condition holds.\n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input().strip())\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nLet me submit this.\n\nBut wait: the problem statement says the roads are defined by a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and we are using the same equation. The sign test is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the equation is linear and the sign determines the side. The equation can be considered as a linear function, and the side is determined by the sign of the function.\n\nOne more thing: the equation might have negative leading coefficients, but that doesn't matter because we are only comparing the signs.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nI'll run the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: Input as described, output 2.\nExample 2: Input as described, output 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem example input is provided as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut in the second example, the third road is \"1 1 -3\", which is x+y-3=0.\n\nAnd we computed that the two points are on the same side (negative), so not counted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, the example output is '2' for both examples.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the answer to the problem.\"\n\nSo we output the count.\n\nI think we are done.\n\nHowever, wait: the problem statement says \"Crazy Town\", and the example outputs are ['2','2'].\n\nBut note: the example input is given as two strings, but we are reading from stdin. The judge will provide the input as described.\n\nTherefore, the code is ready.\n\nBut wait, what if the equation has a negative constant? \n\nExample: home (0,0), university (0,1), and a road: 0*x + 0*y + 1 = 0? Actually, wait: the problem says ai and bi are not both zero. So this is not allowed.\n\nBut the input guarantee: |ai|+|bi|>0.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nI think we are good.\n\nLet me write the final code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (infinite line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university must be crossed exactly once, and since each step allows crossing one road, the minimal number of steps is simply the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many lines (roads) separate two points (home and university) in a plane. Each road is defined by a linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The solution hinges on checking for each road whether the two points lie on opposite sides of the line. If they do, the road must be crossed once; otherwise, it does not affect the path.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, evaluate the sign of the linear equation at both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the line, and the road must be crossed. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both points. If the product of these values is negative (indicating opposite signs), increment the step count. This approach efficiently checks each road in constant time, making the solution optimal for the given constraints.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients of each road's equation.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code evaluates the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these evaluations differ, the road separates the two points, and the step count is incremented.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of separating roads is printed, which directly gives the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home by crossing each road once per step.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations, ensuring optimal performance for the problem constraints.",
