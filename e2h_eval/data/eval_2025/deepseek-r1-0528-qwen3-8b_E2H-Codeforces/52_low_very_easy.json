Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a burned candle.\n   - We can use 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n Steps:\n   We start with 'a' candles. We burn them all (each gives 1 hour) and then we have 'a' burned candles.\n   Then, we can convert some burned candles into new ones: specifically, we can make floor(a / b) new candles from the burned ones, and we are left with a % b burned candles.\n\n However, note that the new candles we made can also be burned and then they too become burned candles.\n\n We can simulate:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover_burned = 0\n\n But note: we can burn all we have, and then use the burned ones to make more.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while candles + burned >= b:   # meaning we can make at least one new candle?\n        Actually, let's reframe: \n\n   However, note: we start by having 'a' candles. We burn them all -> we get 'a' hours and then we have 'a' burned.\n\n   Then, we can convert 'a' burned into floor(a/b) new candles and have a % b burned leftover.\n\n   Then we have (floor(a/b)) new candles to burn, which will give floor(a/b) hours and floor(a/b) burned.\n\n   Then, we combine the leftover burned (a % b) and the new burned (floor(a/b)) to form the next batch.\n\n   But note: the problem is that we might not need to burn all the candles at once? Actually, we can burn one candle per hour, and we are allowed to use the burned ones to make more.\n\n   Actually, we can model it as:\n\n   total = a\n   cycle = 0\n   while total >= b:\n        new_candles = total // b\n        leftover = total % b\n        total = new_candles + leftover   # because we use up the old ones to make new ones, and we have leftover from the previous step?\n        But wait, we haven't accounted for the burning hours.\n\n   Alternatively, we can keep track of the total hours and the remaining candles (both unburned and burned).\n\n   Another approach:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while current > 0:\n        # Burn all current candles: we get 'current' hours and then we have current burned candles (from these) and also the previous burned ones.\n        total_hours += current\n        # Now, we have burned += current\n        # Then, we can make new_candles = burned // b\n        # And then we reset burned to burned % b, but then we set current = new_candles?\n\n        But note: after burning, we have current burned candles from this batch, and we already had some burned from before.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n        # Burn all the candles we have\n        total_hours += candles\n        # Now, we have 'candles' burned candles to add to our total burned pool\n        burned += candles\n        # Now, from the burned pool, we can make more candles: each 'b' burned candles make 1 candle\n        new_candles = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n        candles = new_candles\n\n   Then print(total_hours)\n\n   Let's test with sample \"4 2\": \n        a=4, b=2\n\n        Step 1: candles=4, burned=0\n            Burn 4 -> total_hours=4\n            burned becomes 4\n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2, burned becomes 0, candles becomes 2.\n\n        Step 2: candles=2, burned=0\n            Burn 2 -> total_hours=6\n            burned becomes 2\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1, burned becomes 0, candles becomes 1.\n\n        Step 3: candles=1, burned=0\n            Burn 1 -> total_hours=7\n            burned becomes 1\n            new_candles = 1//2 = 0, so done.\n\n        Output 7 -> matches.\n\n   Another sample: \"6 3\"\n        a=6, b=3\n\n        Step 1: candles=6, burned=0\n            total_hours=6\n            burned=6\n            new_candles=6//3=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be combined to create new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles required to make a new one (`b`).\n2. **Simulate Burning Process**: \n   - Burn all current candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n   - Collect the burned candles from this batch and combine them with any leftover burned candles from previous batches.\n   - Convert the collected burned candles into new candles (each `b` burned candles make one new candle), and update the remaining burned candles.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form even one new candle. At this point, the remaining candles (if any) cannot be converted into new ones, so the loop terminates.\n4. **Output the Result**: The accumulated total hours from the burning process is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    burned = 0\n\n    while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        burned += current_candles\n        current_candles = burned // b\n        burned %= b\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The variables `total_hours`, `current_candles`, and `burned` are initialized to zero. The initial number of candles (`a`) is stored in `current_candles`.\n- **Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are candles to burn (`current_candles > 0`).\n  - **Burning Phase**: Each iteration adds the number of current candles to `total_hours`, simulating their burning for one hour each.\n  - **Recycling Phase**: The burned candles from the current batch are added to the `burned` pool. From this pool, new candles are created (each requiring `b` burned candles). The number of new candles is calculated by integer division (`burned // b`), and the remainder (`burned % b`) becomes the new `burned` count for the next iteration.\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when there are no more candles to burn (`current_candles` becomes zero), and the total accumulated hours (`total_hours`) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources to maximize the total burning time.",
