After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. We'll read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns (each row is a string of length m)\n 3. For each subject (column), we can find the maximum mark (as a character, but we can compare as characters since '1' to '9' are in order).\n    However, note: there might be multiple students having the same highest mark for a subject. But the definition: \n    \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student with a higher mark\" -> so all students with the max mark in that subject are best.\n\n 4. Then, for each student, we want to know if there is at least one subject in which he has the maximum mark (i.e., he is one of the best in that subject).\n\n Approach:\n Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject (column) that stores the maximum mark in that subject.\n\n But note: we cannot just store the maximum per subject and then check for each student in each subject if his mark equals the maximum?\n Actually, we can do:\n\n For each subject j (0-indexed column):\n   max_mark_j = max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n Then, for a student i, we can check for each subject j: if grid[i][j] == max_mark_j, then in subject j he is best.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"successful\" if there exists at least one subject where he is best.\n\n But wait: what if multiple students are best in the same subject? Then they are all considered best in that subject.\n\n So, we can precompute for each subject the set (or list) of indices (students) who achieved the maximum.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Step 1: Read n, m and the grid.\n\n Step 2: For each subject j (column), compute:\n   max_j = max(row[j] for row in grid)\n\n Step 3: For each student i, check if there exists at least one subject j such that grid[i][j] == max_j (for that subject j).\n\n However, note: the grid is given as list of strings.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   Grid:\n     ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   Then, for subject0 (first column): \n        marks = ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n   For subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n   For subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for student0 (index0): \n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> yes\n        subject1: '2' != '3' -> no\n        subject2: '3' == '3' -> yes -> so student0 is successful (at least one)\n\n   But wait, the example output is 2. In the example, student0 is the first student (index0) and student1 is index1, student2 is index2.\n\n   According to the example: \n        student number 1 (which is index0) is the best at subjects 1 and 3 -> but wait, the subjects are numbered from 1? \n        Actually, the example says: \n          \"the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3\"\n        But our subjects are 0-indexed. The example input is 3x3, so three subjects.\n\n        The example input rows are:\n          223 -> student0: [2,2,3]\n          232 -> student1: [2,3,2]\n          112 -> student2: [1,1,2]\n\n        The example says:\n          student1 (which is the second student, index1) is the best at subjects 1 and 2? \n\n        Let me map the example:\n\n        Subject1 (first subject): \n            student0:2, student1:2, student2:1 -> best are student0 and student1 (both with 2)\n        Subject2 (second subject):\n            student0:2, student1:3, student2:1 -> best is student1 (with 3)\n        Subject3 (third subject):\n            student0:3, student1:2, student2:2 -> best is student0 (with 3)\n\n        So student0 is best at subject1 and subject3 -> two subjects.\n        student1 is best at subject2 -> one subject.\n        student2 is not best at any.\n\n        Therefore, successful students are student0 and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read the next n lines, each containing a string of m digits representing the marks of each student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column and keeping track of the maximum value.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If a student has the highest mark in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks_per_subject = [0] * m\n    \n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_char = max(col)\n        max_marks_per_subject[j] = max_char\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks_per_subject[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into individual lines. The first line contains the dimensions of the gradebook (n students and m subjects). Subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark in that subject. This is stored in an array `max_marks_per_subject`.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, the student is marked as successful. The loop breaks early if a student is found to be successful in any subject to optimize performance.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects by leveraging precomputed maximum values for each subject, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is feasible given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
