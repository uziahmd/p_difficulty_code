He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, note that we are asked: for a given m (the required number of trailing zeroes), how many n have Z(n) = m?\n\n Observation:\n   The function Z(n) is non-decreasing. Also, note that sometimes consecutive n's have the same number of trailing zeros (like from 5 to 9, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, etc.)\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n 2. Then, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n    Then, the numbers n for which Z(n) = m are the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n But wait: what if there is no n with Z(n) = m? Then the set is empty.\n\n However, note that the function Z(n) increases only at multiples of 5. So it is possible that there is no n such that Z(n) = m? Actually, the sequence of Z(n) is increasing and jumps by more than one at some points. For example, at n=25, Z(25) = 6, but Z(24)=4 and Z(25)=6, so we skipped 5.\n\n Therefore, we cannot assume that every m is achieved.\n\n So, we must check: if there exists an n such that Z(n)=m, then we output the consecutive n's from L to R-1. Otherwise, output 0.\n\n However, note the example: m=5. The sample input '5' gives output 0. Actually, wait: the example input was ['1', '5'] meaning two test cases? But the problem says \"The only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\n Let me re-read the example: \n   Input: ['1', '5']   -> This seems to be a list of inputs? But the problem says one integer per input.\n\n Actually, the example output for input '1' is:\n      5\n      5 6 7 8 9\n\n And for input '5' is:\n      0\n\n So the example provided two separate inputs: first m=1 and then m=5.\n\n But the problem says: \"The only line of input contains an integer m\"\n\n So we are to read one integer m per run.\n\n How to solve:\n\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. (We can use binary search for this)\n\n Step 2: Check if Z(L) == m? Not exactly: we want to know if there is any n with Z(n)=m.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We know that the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and increases only at multiples of 5.\n\n   We can define:\n        L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n        Then check: if Z(L) == m, then the numbers from L to R-1 (where R is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1) have Z(n)=m.\n\n   But if Z(L) != m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n However, note: the minimal n such that Z(n)>=m might have Z(n) > m. Then we say no solution.\n\n Example: m=5. \n   We know that Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6 -> so the minimal n with Z(n)>=5 is 25, and Z(25)=6 !=5. Therefore, there is no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n But wait, what about n=26? Z(26)=6, n=27:6, n=28:6, n=29:6, n=30:7. So indeed, no n with exactly 5 zeros.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...\n\n   We want to find:\n        L = min {n | f(n) >= m}\n        Then, if f(L) == m, then the answer is the consecutive numbers from L to R-1, where R = min {n | f(n) >= m+1} (if such R exists, else R = infinity?).\n\n   However, note: m can be as large as 100000, and n might be very large. But we can use binary search for L and R.\n\n   But also note: if m is 0, then we are looking for n such that n! has 0 trailing zeros. However, m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Define a function `zeros(n)` that computes f(n) (the trailing zeros in n!).\n     2. Use binary search to find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n     3. Then, if zeros(L) != m, output 0.\n     4. Else, find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n        Then, the numbers n for which zeros(n)=m are from L to R-1.\n\n        How many numbers? k = R - L.\n\n        Output: \n            print(k)\n            print(\" \".join(str(x) for x in range(L, R)))\n\n   However, note: the example m=1:\n\n        We need to find L: smallest n such that zeros(n) >= 1.\n        zeros(5) = 1 -> so L=5.\n\n        Then, zeros(5)==1, so we look for the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=2.\n\n        zeros(10)=2, so R=10.\n\n        Then the numbers are from 5 to 9: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n        Output: \n            5\n            5 6 7 8 9\n\n   But wait: what if m is very large? The binary search must be efficient.\n\n   The value of n for m=100000: \n\n        We know that zeros(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/5 * (1/(1-1/5)) = n/4.\n\n        So n is roughly 4*m. But actually, we can use:\n\n        n >= 5*m (because at least we need to cover m by the base 5). But the exact value can be found by binary search.\n\n   However, the maximum m is 100000, so we can set the high bound for binary search.\n\n   We can set low=0, high=5*m (but note: zeros(n) <= n/4, so n must be at least 4*m, but actually zeros(n) = n/5 + n/25 + ... which is less than n/4. We can set high = 5*m (this is a safe upper bound because zeros(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is greater than m).\n\n   Alternatively, we can set high to something like 5*m (or even 5*m + 5) but note: zeros(5*m) is at least m (exactly when m=1, zeros(5)=1; for m=2, zeros(10)=2, etc.), but sometimes we need more? Actually, zeros(5*m) is not necessarily m. For example, m=2: zeros(10)=2, which is m. But for m=3: zeros(15)=3, zeros(20)=4 -> so for m=3, zeros(15)=3, so L=15. But if we set high=5*3=15, then we get L=15.\n\n   However, consider m=4: \n        zeros(20)= floor(20/5)+floor(20/25)=4+0=4 -> so zeros(20)=4, so L=20.\n\n   But wait, zeros(19)= floor(19/5)+floor(19/25)=3+0=3, zeros(20)=4. So we set high=5*m=20, which is okay.\n\n   However, what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\n   But note: sometimes we need to compute zeros(n) for n up to maybe 5*m, and m can be 100000, so n can be 500000. Then zeros(500000) is about 100000 (actually, zeros(500000) = 100000). So we are good.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the binary search for the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=m:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m   (this is safe because zeros(5*m) >= m)\n\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low+high)//2\n            if zeros(mid) >= m:\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid+1\n\n        Then L = low.\n\n   Similarly for m+1.\n\n   But note: if m is 100000, then zeros(500000)=100000, so for m+1=100001, we need to find the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=100001.\n\n        We know zeros(500000)=100000, so we need to go higher.\n\n        How much higher? The next multiple of 5 after 500000 is 500005, then 500010, etc.\n\n        But note: zeros(n) increases by one at each multiple of 5, then by one again at the next, etc. Actually, the jump can be more than one.\n\n        However, we can set the high bound for the second binary search to, say, 5*(m+1) or even 5*m + 1000000? But we know that zeros(n) increases by at most 1 per 5 steps? Actually, the jump at a multiple of 5^k is floor(n/5^k) - floor((n-1)/5^k) which is 1 for k=1, but for higher powers it can be more? \n\n        Actually, the total jump at n (if n is divisible by a power of 5) is the number of times 5 divides n. But we are just counting the total zeros.\n\n        However, we can set the high bound for the second binary search to 5*(m+1) (which is 500005 for m=100000) and then zeros(500005) = zeros(500000) + (how many factors of 5 in 500001, 500002, 500003, 500004, 500005)? \n\n        Actually, zeros(n) is defined by the entire factorial. We don't need to compute zeros(n) by the entire factorial, we have the formula.\n\n        But we can use the same function zeros(n) for both.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints: m up to 100000. The n we are searching for is around 5*m, so about 500000. The function zeros(n) is O(log_5(n)) which is about 7-8 iterations (since 5^7 is 78125, 5^8 is 390625, 5^9 is 1953125 which is >500000). So we can compute zeros(n) for n=500000 in about 8 steps.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        def zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            div = 5\n            while div <= n:\n                count += n // div\n                div *= 5\n            return count\n\n   Then, we do two binary searches:\n\n        Step 1: Find L for m.\n        Step 2: If zeros(L) != m, output 0.\n        Step 3: Else, find R for m+1.\n        Step 4: Output the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n   But note: what if m+1 is too large and there is no n such that zeros(n)>=m+1? Then R would be set to 5*(m+1) (which is the initial high bound) and then we output the numbers from L to 5*(m+1)-1. However, note that zeros(n) goes to infinity as n increases, so for sufficiently large n, zeros(n) will exceed any m. But our initial high bound for m+1 is 5*(m+1). Is that safe?\n\n        We set high = 5*(m+1) for the second binary search.\n\n        But note: zeros(5*(m+1)) is at least (m+1) (because zeros(5*(m+1)) >= (m+1) [since zeros(5*k) >= k, but wait: zeros(5*k) is the sum_{i>=1} floor(5*k / 5^i) = k + floor(k/5) + floor(k/25)+... which is >= k. So if k=m+1, then zeros(5*(m+1)) >= m+1.\n\n        Therefore, the binary search for m+1 will work.\n\n   However, what if m is 100000? Then zeros(5*100001) is at least 100001, so yes.\n\n   But note: the problem says m>=1 and m<=100000.\n\n   Edge: if m=100000, then we are computing zeros(n) for n up to 500005, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, let's test with m=1 and m=5.\n\n   Example m=1:\n        zeros(5)=1 -> L=5\n        Then, we set m1 = 2, and we need to find the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=2.\n\n        zeros(10)= floor(10/5)+floor(10/25)=2+0=2 -> so R=10.\n\n        Then the numbers are from 5 to 9.\n\n   Example m=5:\n        We want L: smallest n such that zeros(n)>=5.\n        zeros(20)=4, zeros(21)=4, zeros(22)=4, zeros(23)=4, zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6 -> so L=25.\n        Now, zeros(25)=6 !=5 -> output 0.\n\n   Example m=0: (even though m>=1, but for completeness) we skip.\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't need to handle.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Then print these k integers in increasing order.\" and if k==0, then we just print 0 and nothing else.\n\n   Code structure:\n\n        m = int(input().strip())\n\n        # If m==0, then we have to handle separately? But m>=1, so skip.\n\n        def zeros(n):\n            cnt = 0\n            i = 5\n            while i <= n:\n                cnt += n // i\n                i *= 5\n            return cnt\n\n        # Binary search for lower bound for m\n        lo, hi = 0, 5 * m   # Because zeros(5*m) >= m (as explained: zeros(5*m) = m + m//5 + m//25 + ... >= m)\n        while lo < hi:\n            mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n            if zeros(mid) >= m:\n                hi = mid\n            else:\n                lo = mid + 1\n        L = lo\n\n        # Check if Z(L) == m\n        if zeros(L) != m:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Now, we want the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1\n            # Set the high bound for m+1: initially we can set hi2 = 5*(m+1)\n            lo2, hi2 = 0, 5 * (m+1)\n            while lo2 < hi2:\n                mid2 = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n                if zeros(mid2) >= m+1:\n                    hi2 = mid2\n                else:\n                    lo2 = mid2 + 1\n            R = lo2\n\n            # Now, the numbers n with exactly m zeros are from L to R-1.\n            k = R - L\n            print(k)\n            if k > 0:\n                # Format the numbers from L to R-1\n                # Since k can be up to ...? In worst-case, the gap between L and R-1 might be large? But note: the gaps occur only at multiples of 5. The length of the contiguous block is at most 4 (like from 5 to 9, 10 to 14, etc.) but wait: actually, the block can be longer if the next jump is not immediate? \n\n                # However, note: the next jump (from m to m+1) happens at the next multiple of 5? Not exactly: the jump is determined by the highest power of 5 that divides the number. But the gap is at most 4? Actually, no: consider m=0, then from 1 to 4, then 5 jumps to 1. But for m=1, from 5 to 9 (gap of 5 numbers). \n\n                # But wait: the trailing zeros increase at multiples of 5. So from n to n+1, the trailing zeros only change when n+1 is divisible by 5. Actually, no: the trailing zeros are computed by the entire product. The trailing zeros only increase when you multiply by a number that brings a factor of 5 (and the corresponding factor of 2 is always available). \n\n                # The trailing zeros function Z(n) is constant between multiples of 5. Specifically, Z(n) = Z(n-1) unless n is divisible by 5, then Z(n) = Z(n-1) + (number of times 5 divides n). \n\n                # Therefore, the function Z(n) is constant on intervals [5k+1, 5k+5] (for k>=0) except at the boundaries.\n\n                # So the set of n for which Z(n)=m is an interval of consecutive integers of length 5, unless the next jump is more than one? \n\n                # Actually, the length of the interval is 5 - (the step of the last jump). But wait, the jump at n=25: from n=24 (Z=4) to n=25 (Z=6) -> so the numbers 25,26,...,? until the next jump (at 26? no, the next jump is at 30? Actually, no: the jump at 25 is 1 (because 25 contributes two factors of 5) so the jump is 2? Actually, the formula: Z(25)=6, Z(24)= floor(24/5)+floor(24/25)=4+0=4, so the jump from 24 to 25 is 2. Then Z(25)=6, then Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, then Z(30)= floor(30/5)+floor(30/25)=6+1=7 -> so the jump from 29 to 30 is 1.\n\n                # Therefore, the length of the interval for a fixed m is not fixed. But note: the next jump (from m to m+1) happens at the next multiple of 5? Not necessarily: the next jump could be at a number that is a multiple of a higher power of 5.\n\n                # However, the set of n with Z(n)=m is the set of n from L to R-1, where R is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1.\n\n                # The length of the interval is R-L, which is the same as the gap between two consecutive jumps (each jump being the point where Z(n) increases). \n\n                # But note: the problem requires to output the numbers in increasing order. The numbers are consecutive from L to R-1.\n\n                # However, the gap between two consecutive jumps is at most 4? Actually, no: the gap is the distance from L to the next jump (which is R). But note: the next jump (R) is the first n where Z(n) becomes m+1. The numbers from L to R-1 are consecutive.\n\n                # But the gap R-L can be large? Actually, no: because Z(n) increases by at least 1 every 5 numbers. So the gap from L to R is at most 5? Or more? \n\n                # Example: m=4: \n                #   Z(20)=4, then the next jump is at 25 (which gives 6). So R=25, so the numbers are 20,21,22,23,24 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # Example: m=6: \n                #   The smallest n with Z(n)=6 is 25. Then the next jump is at 26? No, Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, ... until 30? Actually, the next jump is at 25 (already done) and then the next jump is at 30 (which adds one zero). So R=30, so the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # Example: m=7: \n                #   The smallest n with Z(n)=7 is 30. Then the next jump is at 35? Actually, Z(30)=7, Z(31)=7, ... until 34, then 35: Z(35)=7 + floor(35/5)+floor(35/25) but wait, we have to compute properly.\n\n                #   Actually, the function Z(n) is additive. We can compute:\n\n                #   Z(30) = 7\n                #   Z(31)=7, Z(32)=7, Z(33)=7, Z(34)=7, Z(35)= floor(35/5)+floor(35/25)+floor(35/125)=7+1+0=8.\n\n                #   So R=35.

They are 10. Then zeros(50)=12. So we missed 11.\n\n                #   Therefore, there is no n with zeros(n)=11.\n\n                # So the gap between two consecutive m values is not always 1. But note: the gaps in the zeros counts are the values of the jumps. The set of zeros counts is {0,1,2,...,max_value} without some numbers.\n\n                # In our algorithm, we are checking for m and then m+1. So if m=10, then we look for zeros(n)=10, and then zeros(n)=11. But 11 is missing, so zeros(L) for m=10 must be 10, and then we try to find zeros(n)>=11, and we get 50 (with zeros=12). Then we output the numbers from L (the smallest n with zeros(n)=10) to 49 (the last n with zeros(n)=10). \n\n                # But wait, how do we get the smallest n for zeros(n)=10?\n                #   We did: L = smallest n such that zeros(n)>=10 -> that n is 45 (because zeros(45)=10, zeros(44)= floor(44/5)+floor(44/25)=8+1=9). So L=45.\n                #   Then we check zeros(45)==10 -> true.\n                #   Then we find the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=11 -> that is 50 (because zeros(46..49)=10, zeros(50)=12). So R=50.\n                #   Then we output 45,46,47,48,49 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # So the gap is always 5? \n\n                # Why? Because the zeros count only changes at multiples of 5. And between two consecutive multiples of 5, the zeros count is constant. The zeros count increases by a certain amount (at least 1) at each multiple of 5. However, the jump can be more than one (like 2 at 25). But note: the jump at 25 was 2 (from 4 to 6) so we skipped 5. \n\n                # But the gap in n is still 5? \n\n                # Actually, the gap in n for a fixed zeros count m is the number of consecutive integers from the start of the block (after the jump that sets the zeros to m) until the next jump (which increases the zeros). The next jump occurs at the next multiple of 5 (unless the current n is already a multiple of a higher power, but the next jump is the next multiple of 5). \n\n                # However, the next jump (in terms of n) is always the next multiple of 5. So the block for a given m (if it exists) is 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n                # But wait: the example m=10: the block is from 45 to 49 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # Therefore, the length of the block is always 5? \n\n                # However, consider m=0: then the block is from 1 to 4 -> 4 numbers. But m>=1.\n\n                # For m>=1, the block is always 5 numbers? \n\n                # But wait: what if the jump at n is more than one, and then the next jump is also at the same n? No, the next jump is the next multiple of 5. \n\n                # However, consider m=6: the block is from 25 to 29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # But wait: what if the next jump (for m+1) is not the next multiple of 5? Actually, the next jump (the next increase in zeros) is the next multiple of 5. \n\n                # However, the jump at a multiple of 5 is the number of factors of 5 in that number. So the jump at 5 is 1, at 10 is 1, at 15 is 1, at 20 is 1, at 25 is 2, at 30 is 1, at 35 is 1, at 40 is 1, at 45 is 1, at 50 is 2, etc.\n\n                # But the zeros count increases by the jump amount at each multiple of 5. Therefore, the zeros count remains constant for 5 consecutive numbers (from 5k+1 to 5k+5) except that the last one (5k+5) is the next multiple and then we add the jump.\n\n                # However, note: the zeros count for n=5k is calculated by including the factor of 5 from k (if k is an integer). Actually, the zeros count for n! is the same as (n-1)! plus the factors of 5 in n.\n\n                # So the zeros count for n=5k is zeros(5k-1) + (number of factors of 5 in 5k). \n\n                # And the zeros count for n=5k+1 to n=5k+4 is the same as zeros(5k) (because they don't add any new factors of 5). \n\n                # Therefore, the zeros count is constant from n=5k to n=5k+4? Actually, from n=5k to n=5k+4, the zeros count increases only at n=5k. Then from n=5k+1 to n=5k+4, the zeros count remains the same as at 5k.\n\n                # So the block for zeros count = zeros(5k) is from n=5k to n=5k+4 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # But wait: what if k is a multiple of 5? Then 5k is a multiple of 25, so the jump at 5k is more than 1. Then zeros(5k) = zeros(5k-1) + (jump at 5k). Then the next block (from 5k+1 to 5k+4) has zeros count = zeros(5k). Then the next jump at 5k+5 is adding the factors of 5 in 5k+5 (which is 1, unless 5k+5 is divisible by 25, etc.).\n\n                # So the block for zeros count = c (a particular value) is 5 consecutive numbers, unless the block is broken by a larger jump? \n\n                # Actually, the zeros count is constant over an interval of 5 consecutive numbers (from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5 minus one). \n\n                # Therefore, if a zeros count m is present, then there are exactly 5 consecutive numbers n that yield m.\n\n                # But wait, the example m=10: \n                #   The block is from 45 to 49 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # However, the example m=1: \n                #   The block is from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # But wait: what if the zeros count jumps by more than one? Then the same zeros count m might appear in two different blocks? \n\n                # Example: m=6: \n                #   The block for zeros count 6 is from 25 to 29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                # And zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, ... zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7.\n\n                # Now, what about zeros(20)=4, zeros(21)=4, zeros(22)=4, zeros(23)=4, zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6. So the zeros count jumps from 4 to 6, skipping 5. But note: the block for zeros count=4 is from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). Then the block for zeros count=6 is from 25 to 29 (5 numbers). There is no block for zeros count=5.\n\n                # Therefore, the block length is always 5 for each m that appears.\n\n                # Then why in our algorithm for m=5 we got 0? Because there is no block for m=5.\n\n                # So the code is correct.\n\n                # But note: the gap between two consecutive zeros counts is the jump size. The set of zeros counts is the set of integers from 0 to infinity, except for the gaps caused by jumps larger than 1.\n\n                # Therefore, the answer for a given m is either 0 (if m is not in the set) or 5 consecutive integers.\n\n                # However, wait: is it always 5? Consider:\n\n                #   The zeros count for n! is the same as the zeros count for (n-1)! unless n is divisible by 5. And when n is divisible by 5, the zeros count increases by the multiplicity of 5 in n.\n\n                #   The multiplicity of 5 in n (for n being a multiple of 5) is at least 1. So the zeros count never stays the same across a multiple of 5? Actually, the zeros count at n (if n is not divisible by 5) is the same as at n-1. And at a multiple of 5, it increases.\n\n                #   Therefore, the zeros count is constant for 4 numbers after a multiple of 5? \n\n                #   Actually, no: from n=5 to n=9: \n                #       n=5: Z(5)=1\n                #       n=6: Z(6)=1\n                #       n=7: Z(7)=1\n                #       n=8: Z(8)=1\n                #       n=9: Z(9)=1\n                #       n=10: Z(10)=2\n\n                #   So the zeros count is constant for 5 numbers (from 5 to 9). \n\n                #   Similarly, from 10 to 14: \n                #       n=10:2, n=11:2, n=12:2, n=13:2, n=14:2, n=15:3.\n\n                #   So the pattern is: the zeros count for a block starting at a multiple of 5 (say 5k) is constant for the next 5 numbers (5k, 5k+1, 5k+2, 5k+3, 5k+4).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is effectively determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term continues until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). If \\( Z(L) \\neq m \\), then there are no solutions. Otherwise, we find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m + 1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The binary search approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values by leveraging the monotonic nature of \\( Z(n) \\). The function \\( zeros(n) \\) computes the trailing zeroes in \\( O(\\log_5 n) \\) time, making the overall complexity \\( O(\\log n) \\) per binary search step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    i = 5\n    while i <= n:\n        cnt += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return cnt\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    lo, hi = 0, 5 * m\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if zeros(mid) >= m:\n            hi = mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n    L = lo\n    \n    if zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        lo2, hi2 = 0, 5 * (m + 1)\n        while lo2 < hi2:\n            mid2 = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n            if zeros(mid2) >= m + 1:\n                hi2 = mid2\n            else:\n                lo2 = mid2 + 1\n        R = lo2\n        \n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, R))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for \\( L \\)**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted \\( L \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\), ensuring we cover all potential candidates efficiently.\n\n3. **Validation Check**: After finding \\( L \\), we check if \\( Z(L) \\) exactly equals \\( m \\). If not, there are no solutions, and we output 0.\n\n4. **Binary Search for \\( R \\)**: If \\( Z(L) = m \\), we perform another binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted \\( R \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m + 1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\), inclusive.\n\n5. **Output**: The number of valid \\( n \\) values is \\( R - L \\). If there are any valid values, they are printed in increasing order; otherwise, 0 is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to provide the correct results.",
