A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. Total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into 'd' slices. So total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. We have p grams of salt.\n\n For each toast, we need:\n   - nl milliliters of the drink (per toast) -> but note: each friend needs nl for a toast? \n     Actually, from the problem: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n However, note that the friends are making toasts and all must drink the same amount. The key is that the entire group's requirement for one toast is:\n   - Drink: nl * n milliliters (because each of the n friends gets nl milliliters for one toast)\n   - Lime: n slices? But wait, the example: \n        Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n        Explanation: They have 4 bottles of 5 ml -> 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml? Actually no.\n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n So for one toast, the entire group requires:\n   - Drink: n * nl milliliters (because each of the n friends gets nl)\n   - Lime: n slices (each friend gets one slice per toast, so n slices per toast)\n   - Salt: n * np grams (each friend gets np grams)\n\n But wait, the example input: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n According to the example: \n   Total drink = 4*5 = 20 ml -> for one toast, the drink needed by the whole group is 3*3 = 9 ml -> so maximum toasts by drink = 20 // 9 = 2 (since 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20)\n   Total lime slices = 10*8 = 80 -> for one toast, we need 3 slices (one per friend) so 80 // 3 = 26 (but wait, 80/3 is not integer, but we take floor division because we can't use fractions of a toast)\n   Total salt = 100 grams -> for one toast, we need 3*1 = 3 grams -> 100 // 3 = 33\n\n Then the minimum of these three is 2 (from drink). Then the number of toasts per friend is 2 (each friend makes 2 toasts? but wait, the example says 2).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast. This means that for one toast, the entire group uses:\n   - Drink: n * nl\n   - Lime: n slices (each friend gets one)\n   - Salt: n * np\n\n But then the total toasts T that the entire group can make is limited by:\n\n   T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)   [for drink]\n   T <= (c * d) / n          [for lime]   because we need n slices per toast (so one toast uses n slices) -> total slices available is c*d, so T <= (c*d) / n\n   T <= p / (n * np)         [for salt]\n\n Then T_max = floor(min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) )) ?\n\n However, note: the example calculation in the problem was:\n\n   drink: 20 / 3 (but wait, they said 20/3 for the drink? Actually, they said: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". \n\n But wait, let's break down the example:\n\n   In the example, they say: \n      \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   Why did they divide by 3? Because the problem states that each friend needs nl=3 milliliters for one toast. But note: the entire group has 3 friends. \n\n   Actually, the example explanation is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\n   The example input:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the maximum number of toasts possible based on the constraints of drink, lime slices, and salt, then divide this by the number of friends to ensure everyone can participate equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of these resources per friend. The solution involves:\n   - **Drink Calculation**: Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters). The maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Calculation**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend). The maximum toasts from lime is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Calculation**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams (since each friend needs `np` grams). The maximum toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factor for the number of toasts is the minimum value among the three calculated values (drink, lime, salt). This minimum value gives the total toasts the entire group can make. Since each friend must make the same number of toasts, we divide this minimum value by the number of friends `n`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations to compute the maximum toasts from each resource and then taking the minimum of these values. The result is derived by integer division to ensure whole numbers of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    toasts_from_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    toasts_from_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    total_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)\n    \n    print(total_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, and the required milliliters and salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Calculating Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiplied by the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Obtained by multiplying the number of limes by slices per lime.\n3. **Toast Calculation**:\n   - **Drink-Limited Toasts**: Divides total drink by the drink required per toast (n friends * nl milliliters).\n   - **Lime-Limited Toasts**: Divides total lime slices by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt-Limited Toasts**: Divides total salt by the salt required per toast (n friends * np grams).\n4. **Result Determination**: The minimum value among the three toast calculations gives the maximum number of toasts the group can make. This value is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
