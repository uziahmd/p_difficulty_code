On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is: We are given an array of 1s and 2s. We can reverse any contiguous interval (or not, if we choose [l, r] and reverse it). Then we want the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the resulting array.\n\nObservation:\nSince the sequence only contains 1s and 2s, the non-decreasing subsequence can be:\n  - All 1s (if there are k ones, then k is a candidate)\n  - All 2s (if there are m twos, then m is a candidate)\n  - A mix: starting with some 1s and then some 2s. The entire sequence might be non-decreasing if we have a block of 1s followed by a block of 2s.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reverse any contiguous interval. This reversal might help in rearranging the 1s and 2s to form a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWhat can we do?\nWe can consider that after reversal, the entire sequence must be such that we have a (possibly empty) block of 1s and then a (possibly empty) block of 2s. But note: the reversal operation doesn't necessarily make the entire sequence non-decreasing, but we are looking for the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nHowever, note the following:\n\nIn a sequence of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., all 1s then all 2s). Otherwise, we can break it down:\n\nActually, the LNDS in a binary sequence (with only 1 and 2) is simply the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. But if there's a 2 followed by a 1, then we cannot use both in an increasing way? Actually, we can skip the 1 that comes after a 2 if we are building a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut wait: the classic non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence (only 1 and 2) can be constructed by taking all the 1s and then as many 2s as possible. However, note that we might have some 2s that come before 1s, but we can skip those 2s that are before 1s because the subsequence must be increasing in index and the values must be non-decreasing.\n\nActually, the LNDS in a binary sequence (with only 1 and 2) is at least the total number of 1s (because we can always take all 1s). Also, we can combine 1s and 2s: if we have a 1 and then a 2, that's fine. But if we have a 2 and then a 1, we can only take one of them (either the 2 or the 1, but note: we can also take multiple 1s and then multiple 2s from different parts).\n\nBut note: the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval arbitrarily. So we can change the order of a contiguous part arbitrarily (from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa). \n\nHow does reversal affect the sequence?\nLet the original sequence be A. After reversing [l, r], the segment becomes reversed. Since the segment is composed of 1s and 2s, reversing a segment of 1s and 2s just reverses the order of 1s and 2s.\n\nWhat is our goal? We want to maximize the length of the LNDS.\n\nNote: The entire sequence may be broken into three parts: [0, l-2] (0-indexed), [l-1, r-1] (the reversed part), and [r, n-1]. \n\nAfter reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. The LNDS in the new sequence is the length of the longest subsequence that is non-decreasing.\n\nBut note: the entire sequence is binary, so the LNDS is at least the count of 1s (because we can take all 1s). Also, we can take all the 1s and then the 2s that appear after the last 1 we took? Actually, we can also take some 2s that are before a 1 if we don't take the 1? No, because 2 is greater than 1. So the rule is: we can take a set of indices that first are 1s and then 2s, and the 1s must appear before the 2s.\n\nSo the entire LNDS is the sum of:\n  - The number of 1s we can use (which must be taken from left to right, and then)\n  - The number of 2s we can use (which must be taken from left to right, but note: we can interleave? Actually, no: the subsequence must be non-decreasing, so once we switch from 1 to 2, we cannot go back to 1).\n\nTherefore, the LNDS is the maximum over all ways to split the sequence into two parts (before a certain point, we take 1s and maybe some 2s? Actually, no: because if we have a 2 then a 1, we cannot use both in the same LNDS. But note: we are allowed to skip elements arbitrarily.\n\nActually, the standard way to compute LNDS in a binary sequence is:\n  Let total_ones = total number of 1s, total_twos = total number of 2s.\n  But we can do better: we can take all the 1s and then as many 2s as we can that are located after the last 1 we took? However, we are allowed to take 1s and 2s in increasing order.\n\nAlternatively, note that the entire sequence can be partitioned into segments of consecutive 1s and consecutive 2s. But wait, we can also have a mix if we reverse some part.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation is limited to one contiguous segment. Therefore, we can think of the overall structure as:\n\nOriginal: [part1][part2][part3]\n\nAfter reversing part2, the whole sequence becomes [part1][reversed(part2)][part3]\n\nWe wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nThe key observation: In the final sequence, the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (all 1s then all 2s). But if we have some 2s and then 1s, then the LNDS is not the entire sequence. However, we can still get a long subsequence by taking all the 1s and then the 2s that are after the last 1 (if we arrange the reversal so that we move 1s to the left and 2s to the right).\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reverse only one contiguous interval. So we can choose which part to reverse.\n\nLet:\n  total_ones = total number of 1s\n  total_twos = total number of 2s\n\nWithout any reversal, the LNDS is at least total_ones (by taking all 1s) and also at least the total_twos (by taking all 2s) but actually we can combine: the LNDS is the maximum of (total_ones + the number of 2s that are after the last 1 we take) but note: we are allowed to take 1s and then 2s arbitrarily (but the 2s must be after the 1s in the sequence).\n\nHowever, we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. How does reversal help?\n\nReversal can fix some inversion between 1s and 2s. Specifically, if we have a segment that has more 1s than 2s, then reversing that segment might put the 1s to the left and 2s to the right, which would allow us to combine 1s and 2s.\n\nBut note: the reversal operation can only reverse a contiguous segment. So we can consider: what is the best reversal we can do?\n\nAnother idea: the entire sequence can be transformed into a sequence of 1s and then 2s (if we reverse appropriately) but note: we can only reverse one contiguous segment. So the rest of the sequence remains in the original order.\n\nLet me break down the sequence into three parts: left, middle, right.\n\nAfter reversal, the middle part is reversed. The left and right remain unchanged.\n\nWe wish to maximize the length of the LNDS, which is the maximum of:\n  - The LNDS in the left part (if we don't take any element from the middle and right)\n  - The LNDS in the reversed middle part\n  - The LNDS in the right part\n  - Combinations (like taking some from left, then some from the reversed middle, then some from the right)\n\nBut note: the entire sequence is connected. We can take a subsequence that goes from the left, then the reversed middle, then the right.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the maximum possible LNDS after one reversal.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nSince the sequence is only 1s and 2s, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if we have all the 1s (from the beginning) and then the 2s (at the end). The reversal operation can fix some misplaced 2s (that are to the left of 1s) by moving them to the right.\n\nBut note: we can only reverse one contiguous interval. Therefore, we can fix at most one \"problematic\" region.\n\nWhat is a problematic region? A region that has 2s that are blocking 1s from forming a longer chain.\n\nWe can think: the ideal sequence is all 1s then all 2s. The reversal operation can help to bring 1s to the front and 2s to the back, but only in one contiguous segment.\n\nActually, we can consider the following:\n\nLet the original sequence be S. We are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. Then the entire sequence becomes:\n\n  S[0:l]   (unchanged)\n  reverse(S[l:r+1])\n  S[r+1:]  (unchanged)\n\nWe wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nSince the sequence is binary, the LNDS is the length of the longest subsequence that is first all 1s and then all 2s (but not necessarily contiguous). But note: we can skip arbitrarily, so we can take all the 1s and then all the 2s that appear after the last 1? However, we can also take a 2 that appears earlier if we haven't taken a 1 after it? Actually, no: because the subsequence must be increasing in index and the value must be non-decreasing. So if we take a 2 at position i and then a 1 at position j (with i<j), that's not allowed. Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n  Option 1: Take all the 1s (in increasing index order) and then as many 2s as possible (that are located at indices greater than the last 1 taken) OR\n  Option 2: Or, we might not take all the 1s? Actually, we can skip some 1s to include more 2s? \n\nWait, let me clarify: the standard way to compute the LNDS for a binary sequence is:\n\n  Let x = the entire sequence. Then the LNDS is the sum of the total number of 1s and the total number of 2s that appear after the last 1? Actually, no: because we can interleave the 1s and 2s arbitrarily as long as the 1s come before the 2s in the subsequence.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to skip arbitrarily. So the LNDS is the length of the longest subsequence that is non-decreasing. In a binary sequence, that means we can take:\n\n  - All the 1s (and we must take them in increasing index order) and then, after the last 1 we took (by index), we can take all the 2s that are available (since 1<=2). But we can also take some 2s that occur before a 1 if we don't take that 1? \n\nWait, no: because if we take a 2 that occurs at an index i and then a 1 at index j>i, then the subsequence would have ...2...1... which is decreasing. So we cannot do that. Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum over k (number of 1s we take) plus the number of 2s that occur at indices greater than the maximum index of the 1s we took.\n\nBut note: we can choose the 1s arbitrarily (as long as their indices are increasing). So the idea is:\n\n  Let I be the set of indices where the element is 1.\n  Let J be the set of indices where the element is 2.\n\nThen, the LNDS is the maximum over all choices of a prefix of I (the 1s) and then the 2s that occur after the last chosen 1.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. So we can change the positions of some 1s and 2s.\n\nHow to solve?\n\nWe can try to consider the effect of reversing one contiguous segment. There are O(n^2) possibilities. But n up to 2000, so O(n^2) is 4e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to compute the LNDS for a given arrangement quickly?\n\nWe can precompute:\n  prefix_ones[i]: number of 1s from start to i (inclusive)\n  suffix_twos[i]: number of 2s from i to the end.\n\nBut note: the reversal changes the entire segment. We need to compute the entire sequence after reversal and then compute the LNDS.\n\nBut wait: the entire sequence is binary, so the LNDS is the total number of 1s (because we can always take all 1s) plus the number of 2s that are located after the last 1 we take? Actually, no: we can take the 1s in any order (but the indices must be increasing) and then the 2s that are after the last 1.\n\nBut note: the 1s we take must be in increasing index order, and the last 1 we take must be at an index less than the first 2 we take (for the 2s part). However, we are allowed to skip 2s that are before the last 1? \n\nActually, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements we can pick such that we never see a 2 then a 1 (in the subsequence, we require non-decreasing, so we cannot have 2 then 1). Therefore, we can break the sequence at a point: from the beginning until some index, we take only 1s, and then from that index onward, we take only 2s.\n\nBut note: we can also skip some 1s and 2s arbitrarily. The optimal strategy is to take all the 1s and then all the 2s that occur after the last 1 (if we take all the 1s, then the last 1 is the one with the largest index). However, we might get a longer subsequence by not taking some 1s that are very late (so that we can take more 2s that are even later). \n\nActually, the standard algorithm for longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence is to use dynamic programming, but note: the sequence is small (n=2000) and we have to consider all reversals (which is O(n^2)). But wait, we cannot iterate over each reversal and then run an O(n^2) DP (which would be 4e6 * 4e6 operations, too slow).\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem:\n\nAfter reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. The LNDS is the length of the longest chain of 1s and then 2s. That is, we can represent the entire sequence as:\n\n  [some 1s and 2s] [then a reversed segment] [then some 1s and 2s]\n\nBut note: the reversal operation can fix a contiguous segment that has a lot of 2s then 1s. Actually, we can consider:\n\n  Without reversal, the LNDS is: \n    Let x = the last occurrence of 1 in the entire sequence? Actually, no.\n\nActually, without reversal, the LNDS is: \n  We can take all the 1s, and then the 2s that appear after the last 1 (by index) that we took. But note: we can choose which 1s to take. We want to take as many 2s as possible. So we should take all the 1s that are as early as possible so that we can take more 2s.\n\nBut wait, the standard way: \n  We can use a greedy approach: traverse the sequence and whenever we see a 1, we mark it. Then, we can take all the 1s and then all the 2s that occur after the last 1 (by index) that we marked. However, we are allowed to skip 1s? \n\nActually, the LNDS in a binary sequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we break at the transition from 1 to 2. But we can also consider: the entire sequence might have multiple runs of 1s and 2s. The LNDS is the sum of the lengths of the runs of 1s and the runs of 2s that are after the last run of 1s? \n\nWait, no: because we can skip parts. For example, in [1,2,1,2]: \n  Without reversal, the LNDS is 2 (if we take the two 1s and the two 2s? Actually, we can take the two 1s and then the two 2s: but the two 1s are at indices0 and index2, and the two 2s are at index1 and index3. So the subsequence would be [1,2] (using the first 1 and the first 2) and then we cannot use the second 1 and the second 2 because the second 1 is at index2 and the second 2 is at index3, so we can have [1,2,1,2] is not non-decreasing because 2>=1 is false. \n\nBut wait, the subsequence does not have to be contiguous. We can take the first 1, then the third 1, then the fourth 2? Then we get [1,1,2] -> that is non-decreasing. So the length is 3.\n\nWait, actually: \n  Original: [1,2,1,2]\n  We can take the first 1 (index0), then the third 1 (index2) is not allowed because 1<=1 is okay, but then the fourth element is 2 (index3) and 1<=2 is okay. So the subsequence [1 (at0), 1(at2), 2(at3)] is non-decreasing. So the length is 3.\n\nBut note: the example input says: \n  Input: 4\\n1 2 1 2 -> Output: 4.\n\nWait, the example output is 4. How do we get 4?\n\nWe can reverse the interval [2,3] (0-indexed [1,2]) to get [1, 1, 2, 2]. Then the entire sequence is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the example output is 4.\n\nSo without reversal, we got 3, but with reversal we got 4.\n\nHow do we compute the LNDS for a given sequence?\n\nIn the sequence [1,2,1,2] without reversal, we can also form a subsequence of length 4? \n  We can take: \n      first element: 1 (index0)\n      second element: 2 (index1) -> 1<=2, so valid\n      third element: 1 (index2) -> 2>=1 -> invalid for the next element? But we can skip the second element? \n      Actually, we can skip the second element and take the third element as 1? Then we have [1,1] (length2) and then the fourth element 2 (index3) gives [1,1,2] (length3). \n      Alternatively, we can take [1,2,2] (skip the third element) -> [1,2,2] (length3).\n      Or [1,2,1,2] is not valid because the third element breaks the non-decreasing.\n\nBut wait, we can take the first 1, then the third 1, then the fourth 2: that is [1,1,2] (length3). Or the first 1, then the fourth 2: [1,2] (length2). Or the second 1 (at index2) and the fourth 2: [1,2] (length2). Or the first 1 and the second 2: [1,2] (length2). \n\nActually, the maximum without reversal is 3.\n\nBut the example output is 4, so we must reverse.\n\nSo the problem is: we can reverse one contiguous segment arbitrarily, and we wish to maximize the LNDS.\n\nHow to compute the LNDS for a given sequence? \n\nIn a binary sequence, the LNDS is the length of the sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can use:\n\n  Let dp[i] = the length of the LNDS ending at i.\n\nBut that is O(n) per reversal, and we have O(n^2) reversals -> O(n^3) which is 8e9 for n=2000, which is too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient way.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nSince the sequence is binary, the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the sequence into two parts: the 1s and the 2s. But note: we can take all the 1s and then all the 2s that appear after the last 1 (by index) we take. However, we are allowed to choose which 1s to take.\n\nActually, the LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists a set of indices p1 < p2 < ... < pk with a[p_i] <= a[p_{i+1}] for all i.\n\nBut note: the only possible values are 1 and 2, so the condition is satisfied if we never have a 2 followed by a 1. Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements we can take such that we never have a 2 followed by a 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to: we can take a set of elements that is composed of some 1s and then some 2s, and the 1s must come before the 2s (in the original sequence order?).\n\nWait, no: because the reversal operation changes the order. But note: the entire sequence is fixed, and we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. However, the reversal operation only reverses one contiguous segment, so the relative order of the elements outside the reversed segment is preserved, and the relative order within the reversed segment is reversed.\n\nBut note: we are going to consider the entire sequence as fixed and then compute the LNDS. \n\nWe can use the following method for a fixed sequence (without worrying about how we got it):\n\n  We want to find the longest subsequence that is non-decreasing. Since the sequence is binary, we can use:\n\n  Let f(sequence) = the length of the longest subsequence that is non-decreasing.\n\n  But note: the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing, but we can use the fact that we can skip arbitrarily.\n\n  Actually, the entire sequence's LNDS is the total number of elements if the sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise, we can break it down.\n\nBut wait, there is a simpler way: \n\n  Consider that the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can use the following greedy:\n\n  We can take all the 1s and then all the 2s that occur after the last 1 (by index) we take. But we are free to choose which 1s to take. To maximize the total, we want to take as many 2s as possible. So we should take all the 1s that are as early as possible, so that we can take more 2s.\n\n  Actually, the standard solution for this specific problem (binary sequence) is known: the LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s that appear after the last 1 (by index) in the chosen set. But we can choose the set arbitrarily (any subset of 1s and then any subset of 2s that are after the last chosen 1).\n\n  However, note: we are not forced to take contiguous elements. We can skip 2s that are before the last 1 we took? Actually, we can take a 2 that is before a 1 if we haven't taken that 1, but then we cannot take that 1 later. \n\n  Actually, the entire sequence can be broken into two parts: the part that is 1s and the part that is 2s, but the catch is that the 2s we take must be after the last 1 we take.\n\n  So the algorithm for a fixed sequence is:\n\n    Let total_ones = total number of 1s\n    Let total_twos = total number of 2s\n\n    But wait, we can also have a situation where we don't take all the 1s? \n\n    Actually, the LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists an increasing sequence of indices i1 < i2 < ... < ik and a[p1] <= a[p2] <= ... <= a[pk].\n\n    In a binary sequence, the only constraint is that we cannot have a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n    Therefore, we can take:\n\n        Option 1: Take all the 1s (in the order they appear) and then all the 2s that appear after the last 1 we took.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to skip some 1s to include more 2s? \n\n        Actually, we can take a 2 that appears before a 1 if we don't take that 1. However, then we cannot take that 1 later. \n\n        Example: [2,1] -> the LNDS is 1 (either take the 2 or the 1). \n\n        Another example: [1,2,1] -> we can take the first 1 and the last 1 and the 2? But wait: [1,2,1] -> if we take the first 1 and then the 2, that's valid (length2). Then we cannot take the last 1 because it comes after the 2. Alternatively, we can take the first 1 and the last 1 (skipping the 2) -> [1,1] (length2). Or we can take the first 1 and the last 1 and then nothing else because the last element is 1 and we already took the last 1? \n\n        Actually, the standard way to compute the LNDS in a binary sequence is:\n\n          Let dp[i] = the length of the LNDS ending at i.\n          Then, dp[i] = 1 + min(a[i], the number of j < i such that a[j] <= a[i] and dp[j] is known)\n\n        But since a[i] is either 1 or 2, we can do:\n\n          If a[i] == 1:\n            dp[i] = 1 + (number of j < i with a[j]==1)   [because 1>=1, so we can append to any 1] \n            but wait, we can also append 1 to a 2? No, because 2>=1 is true, so we can also append 1 to any sequence ending with 2.\n\n          Actually, for a[i]==1:\n            dp[i] = 1 + (max( (max dp[j] for j with a[j]==1 and j<i), (max dp[j] for j with a[j]==2 and j<i) )? )\n\n        That becomes complicated.\n\nBut note: we are only dealing with 1 and 2.\n\n  For a[i] = 1:\n    dp[i] = 1 + (the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with a 1 or a 2 at an index j < i) ?\n\n  Actually, we can extend a 1 or a 2 if the last element is <=1. Since 1<=1 and 1<=2, so we can extend any sequence ending with 1 or 2.\n\n  But wait, no: the last element must be <=1. Since the last element can be 1 or 2, but 2 is not <=1. So we cannot extend a sequence ending with 2.\n\n  Similarly, for a[i]=2:\n    dp[i] = 1 + (the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with a 1 at an index j < i)   [because 1<=2, but 2<=2 is allowed, so we can also extend a sequence ending with 2?]\n\n  Actually, we can extend a sequence ending with 1 or 2 (because 1<=2 and 2<=2). \n\n  So:\n\n    If a[i] == 1:\n        dp[i] = 1 + (the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at any j < i)   [but wait, no: we cannot extend a sequence ending with 2 to a 1?]\n\n  Let me correct:\n\n    Condition: the subsequence must be non-decreasing. So if the last element is 2 and we put a 1, that is decreasing -> not allowed.\n    Therefore, for a[i]==1, we can only extend sequences that end with 1.\n\n    For a[i]==2, we can extend sequences that end with 1 or 2.\n\n  So:\n\n    dp[i] for a[i]==1: \n        dp[i] = 1 + (max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp[j] if exists, else 0)\n\n    But wait, we can also extend a sequence that ends with a 1 at j, but also note: we can start a new sequence at i.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let dp1[i] = the length of the LNDS ending at i if the last element is 1.\n        Let dp2[i] = the length of the LNDS ending at i if the last element is 2.\n\n        Then:\n          if a[i] == 1:\n             dp1[i] = 1 + (max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp1[j] if exists, else 0)   [we can only extend sequences ending with 1]\n             dp2[i] = 1   [cannot extend a sequence ending with 2 to a 1]\n\n          if a[i] == 2:\n             dp2[i] = 1 + max( (max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp1[j] if exists else 0, max_{j < i and a[j]==2} dp2[j] if exists else 0) )\n             dp1[i] = 1   [cannot extend a sequence ending with 1 to a 2? Actually, we can start a new sequence, but we cannot extend a sequence ending with 1 to a 2 because 1<=2 is allowed, so why not?]\n\n        Wait, no: the condition is non-decreasing, so 1<=2 is allowed. Therefore, we can extend a sequence ending with 1 to a 2.\n\n        Correction:\n\n          if a[i] == 1:\n            dp1[i] = 1 + (max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp1[j] if exists else 0)\n            dp2[i] = 1   # because we can start a new sequence or extend from a sequence ending with 2? Actually, no: because 2 cannot be extended to 1 (it would be decreasing). But wait, the definition is: the subsequence must be non-decreasing. When we extend, the last element of the previous part must be <= current. Since the current is 1, we cannot extend a sequence ending with 2 (because 2>1). But we can extend a sequence ending with 1.\n\n          if a[i] == 2:\n            dp1[i] = 1   # cannot extend a sequence ending with 1 to a 2? Actually, we can: 1<=2, so we can extend. But wait, we are defining two states: the state of the last element. So if we have a sequence ending with 1, then we can add a 2. Then the last element becomes 2. But then we would update dp2[i] from dp1[j] and dp2[j]. However, we are allowed to extend a sequence ending with 1 to a 2, so for dp2[i] we consider both dp1 and dp2 for j.\n\n        Actually, we should combine:\n\n          Let dp[i] be the length of the LNDS ending at i.\n\n          Then, regardless of the previous elements, we can always start a new sequence at i.\n\n          Then, if a[i] == 1:\n            dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i} { dp[j] }   [but wait, no: because if the last element of the previous part is 2, we cannot extend to 1. So we must restrict j to those that have a value <=1. Since the only value <=1 is 1, then we can only extend sequences that end with 1.\n\n          Similarly, if a[i] == 2:\n            dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i and a[j] <=2} { dp[j] }   [but since all numbers are 1 or 2, then we can extend any sequence ending with 1 or 2]\n\n        But note: the condition is that the entire subsequence must be non-decreasing, and we are appending a 2, so the last element of the previous part must be <=2, which is always true. So for a[i]==2, we can extend any sequence ending at j (for j<i).\n\n        However, for a[i]==1, we can only extend sequences ending at j with a value <=1, i.e., 1.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n          dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i} { dp[j] for which a[j] <= a[i] }\n\n        And then the answer is the maximum dp[i] for i in range(n).\n\n        But note: we are allowed to take subsequences that are not contiguous, but the above dp considers the entire history. \n\n        This is the standard O(n^2) algorithm for longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n        However, we are going to have to do this for every reversal, and there are O(n^2) reversals, so the total complexity is O(n^4) which is too slow for n=2000.\n\nWe need a different approach.\n\nLet me think combinatorially:\n\n  The entire sequence has n elements. The maximum LNDS we can get is at most n.\n\n  Also, note: the reversal operation is only one contiguous segment. Therefore, the sequence is divided into three parts: left, middle, right.\n\n  We can consider the entire sequence as three parts: L, M, R.\n\n  The reversal affects only M.\n\n  What is the LNDS for the entire sequence after reversal?\n\n  The entire sequence is fixed. We wish to know the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n  But note: the entire sequence is binary. The LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it is less.\n\n  However, we are allowed to choose the reversal. We wish to maximize the LNDS.\n\n  Observation:\n\n  The reversal operation can only change the order of one contiguous segment. Therefore, the best reversal will be one that moves as many 2s as possible to the right and 1s to the left.\n\n  Specifically, we want to minimize the number of inversions (2 followed by 1) in the entire sequence.\n\n  But note: the LNDS is not exactly the entire sequence minus the inversions, but it is related.\n\n  Alternative Insight:\n\n  Since the sequence is binary, the LNDS is the total number of 1s (because we can always take all 1s) plus the number of 2s that appear after the last 1 we take. But we can choose which 1s to take. To maximize the total, we want to take all the 1s and then all the 2s that appear after the last 1 (by index) we take.\n\n  However, we can also choose not to take some 1s that are very late if there are many 2s after them, but then we can take other 1s that are earlier and then even more 2s.\n\n  Actually, the optimal strategy is to take all the 1s and then all the 2s that appear after the last 1 (by index) in the entire sequence. But wait, the reversal changes the positions.\n\n  Let me define:\n\n    Let F(L, M, R) be the sequence after reversing M.\n\n    We wish to compute the LNDS for F.\n\n    The LNDS for F is the length of the longest subsequence that is non-decreasing.\n\n    In a binary sequence, this is the maximum between:\n        Option A: The entire sequence if it is non-decreasing.\n        Option B: Or, the entire sequence is not non-decreasing, but we can compute it as:\n\n          Let x = the last occurrence of a 1 in the entire sequence? Actually, we can use:\n\n          Let T = the entire sequence.\n\n          Let A = the set of indices of 1s",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to determine the optimal interval to reverse, which will maximize the length of the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The LNDS in such a sequence is determined by the number of 1s followed by 2s. The key observation is that reversing a segment can help move 1s to the left and 2s to the right, thereby increasing the LNDS.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal reversal will minimize inversions (instances where a 2 precedes a 1) in the sequence. By reversing a segment that contains many such inversions, we can potentially increase the LNDS.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each possible interval [l, r] in the sequence, reverse the segment and compute the LNDS. However, checking all intervals directly would be computationally expensive (O(n^4) for n=2000). Instead, we use a more efficient method:\n   - Precompute prefix sums of 1s and suffix sums of 2s.\n   - For each possible reversal, calculate the potential increase in LNDS by considering the arrangement of 1s and 2s outside and inside the reversed segment.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently checks all possible segments by leveraging prefix and suffix arrays, reducing the complexity to O(n^2), which is feasible for n=2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    total_ones = sum(1 for x in arr if x == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n\n    prefix_ones = [0]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i-1] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    suffix_twos = [0]*(n+2)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n    best = 0\n    for l in range(n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            ones_left = prefix_ones[l]\n            ones_right = prefix_ones[n] - prefix_ones[r]\n            \n            twos_left = l - ones_left\n            twos_right = (suffix_twos[l] if l < n else 0) - (suffix_twos[r] if r < n else 0)\n            \n            mid_length = r - l\n            if mid_length == 0:\n                ones_mid = 0\n                twos_mid = 0\n            else:\n                ones_mid = prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l]\n                twos_mid = (r - l) - ones_mid\n                \n            candidate = ones_left + ones_mid + ones_right + twos_right + min(twos_mid, ones_mid)\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The `prefix_ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each index, while the `suffix_twos` array stores the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end. These arrays help in quickly determining the number of 1s and 2s in any segment.\n2. **Iterate Over Segments**: For each possible segment [l, r], the code calculates the number of 1s and 2s in the left part (before l), the middle part (segment [l, r]), and the right part (after r).\n3. **Calculate LNDS**: The potential LNDS after reversing the segment is computed by combining the counts of 1s from all parts and the counts of 2s from the right part and the middle part. The minimum of the number of 2s and 1s in the middle part is added to ensure non-decreasing order.\n4. **Result**: The maximum value encountered during the iteration is printed as the result, representing the longest non-decreasing subsequence achievable after any single reversal.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the optimal segment to reverse, leveraging prefix and suffix sums to avoid a brute-force search, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
