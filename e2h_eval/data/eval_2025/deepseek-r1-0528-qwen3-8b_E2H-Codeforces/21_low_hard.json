The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) for chests and one of m integers (b_j) for keys.\n\n Condition: a chest i can be opened by key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) is odd, i.e., \n   (a_i % 2 == 0 and b_j % 2 == 1) OR (a_i % 2 == 1 and b_j % 2 == 0)\n\n Since one key can open at most one chest and vice versa, we are to find the maximum matching between chests and keys that satisfy the condition.\n\n Observation:\n   The condition depends only on the parity (even/odd) of the numbers.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_count = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_count = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   For even chests: we need odd keys. The maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is min(even_count, odd_keys)\n   For odd chests: we need even keys. The maximum matching from odd chests to even keys is min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n However, wait: is that really independent? Actually, yes because the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint and the two sets of chests (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice. However, in our breakdown, we are using odd keys for even chests and even keys for odd chests. There is no overlap in keys used. Similarly, there is no overlap in chests.\n\n Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n   total = min(even_count, odd_keys) + min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n      9 -> odd\n      14 -> even\n      6 -> even\n      2 -> even\n      11 -> odd\n\n      even_count = 3, odd_count = 2\n\n   Keys:\n      8 -> even\n      4 -> even\n      7 -> odd\n      20 -> even\n\n      even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then:\n      matching from even chests to odd keys: min(3, 1) = 1\n      matching from odd chests to even keys: min(2, 3) = 2\n      total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: all even -> even_count=5, odd_count=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd, so even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n\n   Matching even chests to odd keys: min(5,1)=1\n   Matching odd chests to even keys: min(0,0)=0\n   Total = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even_count=1, odd_count=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n   Matching even chests to odd keys: min(1,0)=0\n   Matching odd chests to even keys: min(0,4)=0\n   Total = 0 -> matches.\n\n So the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n and m.\n   Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count the number of even and odd in the chests.\n   Count the number of even and odd in the keys.\n\n   Then compute:\n        ans = min(even_count, odd_keys) + min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n   Print ans.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that n, m can be up to 10^5, but we are only doing simple counting and arithmetic, which is efficient.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to specific parity conditions: an even-numbered chest must be paired with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be paired with an even-numbered key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity conditions. Each chest and key can be used at most once, so the solution involves counting how many chests and keys meet the necessary parity criteria.\n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing chests into even and odd counts and keys into even and odd counts, we can independently compute the maximum possible matches for each category. The total number of openable chests is the sum of the matches from both categories.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum matches for even chests (which require odd keys) as the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum matches for odd chests (which require even keys) as the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n            \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n            \n    matches_even_chest = min(even_chest, odd_key)\n    matches_odd_chest = min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    \n    result = matches_even_chest + matches_odd_chest\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests have even or odd numbers and how many keys have even or odd numbers.\n3. **Matching Calculation**: The maximum number of even-numbered chests that can be opened is the lesser of the count of even chests and odd keys. Similarly, the maximum number of odd-numbered chests that can be opened is the lesser of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Result Output**: The sum of these two maximum matches gives the total number of chests Neko can open, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of openable chests without exceeding the constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
