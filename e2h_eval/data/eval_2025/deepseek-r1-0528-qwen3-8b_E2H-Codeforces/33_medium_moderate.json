You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two lines: the first is a string of digits (the number 'a') and the second is a string of digits (the sequence 's').\n We can replace any digit in 'a' with a digit from 's', but each element in 's' can be used at most once.\n\n The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n Since we want to maximize the number, we should try to replace the leftmost digits first because they have higher place value.\n However, we have a limited set of replacement digits (from 's') and we cannot use any digit more than once.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that we are allowed to use at most min(n, m) replacements, but we don't have to use all.\n\n 2. We need to decide which positions to replace and with which digits from s.\n\n 3. How to approach?\n    - We want to replace as many leftmost digits as possible with as large digits as possible, but note: if we have a digit in s that is larger than the current digit, then replacing that position would increase the number. However, if we have multiple large digits, we should use the largest ones on the leftmost positions.\n\n 4. But note: sometimes we might not want to replace a digit if a larger digit is available for a more significant position? Actually, we should prioritize:\n\n    Idea:\n    - Sort the sequence s in descending order (so we have the largest digits available).\n    - Then, traverse from the most significant digit (leftmost) to the least.\n\n    However, we cannot use a digit from s more than once, and we are allowed to skip.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We can think greedily:\n\n    Let's say we have the original number as a string (or list of characters) and the sequence s.\n\n    We want to assign the best available digit from s to the leftmost position where we can improve the number (if there is an improvement) and then move to the next.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to skip some replacements.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    a. Preprocess: \n        - Convert the input number 'a' into a list of characters (or just keep as string) and the sequence s into a list of characters.\n\n    b. We can sort the list of digits in s in descending order. Then, we'll try to assign the largest available digit to the leftmost digit that we can improve, but we must consider that we might have to save a big digit for a later position if we can't use it now?\n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let's have two things:\n            - The original number (as a string) and the sorted list of s (descending).\n\n        We are going to try to replace the digits from left to right.\n\n        For each position i (from 0 to n-1):\n            - If we still have some replacements available (we have digits left in s) and the current digit in a at position i is less than the largest digit we have in s, then we can replace it.\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple digits in s that are larger than the current one? We want to use the largest one available for the earliest position.\n\n        However, we must also consider that if we use a large digit here, then maybe we cannot get an even better digit for a later position? Actually, no: because we are going from left to right, and the leftmost digits are more significant. So we want to use the best available digit for the first position we can.\n\n        But what if we have two possibilities: \n            Option 1: Use a large digit at the first position, but then we run out of large digits for the next positions.\n            Option 2: Skip the first position and use a slightly smaller digit at the first position so that we save the very large digit for the next positions?\n\n        Example: \n            a = \"19\"\n            s = \"98\"\n\n            Possibilities:\n                Replace the first digit: \n                    If we replace '1' with '9': we get \"99\" -> which is good.\n                    Then we cannot replace the second digit because we used the '9' and only have '8' left, but if we use the '8' on the second digit: \"99\" vs \"98\" -> same as above.\n\n                Now, what if we have:\n                    a = \"19\"\n                    s = \"89\"\n\n            Possibilities:\n                Option 1: Replace first digit with '9': \"99\"\n                Option 2: Replace first digit with '8': \"89\", then use '9' on the second digit: \"89\" -> becomes \"89\" (wait, but if we replace the second digit with '9', then we get \"89\" -> actually the second digit is originally '9', so replacing with '9' doesn't change anything.\n\n            However, note: we can choose which digits to use arbitrarily. We don't have to use the next one.\n\n        Actually, the problem is: we have a multiset of digits in s. We can assign them arbitrarily to any positions (each at most once). And we can choose to not use some.\n\n        Therefore, the optimal strategy is:\n\n            We want to use the largest digits from s to replace the smallest digits in a, but we should start from the left.\n\n            Specifically, we can:\n\n            Step 1: Sort the sequence s in descending order.\n\n            Step 2: We will go from left to right in the number a, and for each digit, we check if there is a digit in s that is greater than it. But we have to use the available largest ones.\n\n            However, we cannot use a digit more than once.\n\n            Alternate plan:\n\n            We can collect all the digits in s and sort them in descending order.\n\n            Then, we try to form a new number by scanning from left to right and replacing the current digit with the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit? But wait, we want to maximize the number.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let available = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\n            Then, we want to assign the available digits to the positions in a such that the overall number is maximized.\n\n            How?\n\n            We can consider:\n\n                We are going to replace some digits. The goal is to have the leftmost digits as large as possible.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                For each position from left to right:\n                    Look at the current digit. We want to replace it if we can, but we must choose the best available digit that is greater than the current digit? \n\n            However, note: we are allowed to use any available digit. But if we use a digit that is only slightly larger than the current one, we might reserve a very large digit for a future position that has a lower current digit? \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"1234\"\n                s = \"5555\"\n\n            We have four 5's. We want to replace the first digit with 5, then the second, then the third, then the fourth? But then we get \"5555\", which is maximum.\n\n            But what if:\n                a = \"1234\"\n                s = \"9 5 5 5\"\n\n            Then we would replace the first digit with 9, then the rest with 5's? That gives \"9555\", which is maximum.\n\n            So the idea is: we want to use the largest available digit for the first position, then the next largest for the next position, etc., but only if the replacement improves the number.\n\n            However, we must note: if we have two digits in s: [9, 8] and the number is \"12\", then:\n                First position: replace '1' with '9' -> \"92\", then we have 8 left. We can replace the second digit: '2' with '8' -> \"98\". This is better than if we had replaced the first digit with 8 and the second with 9? Actually, that would be \"89\" which is worse.\n\n            So we must use the largest digit for the first position, then the next largest for the next, etc.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n            Let a_str = the input number string (without leading zeros, so we don't have to worry about that in the output)\n            Let s_str = the input sequence string\n\n            Step 1: Sort s_str in descending order.\n\n            Step 2: We'll create a list for the result, initially the original digits.\n\n            Step 3: We'll use an index for the sorted s_str (starting at 0) and then for each position from left to right:\n\n                    If the current digit in a_str is less than the current largest available digit (i.e., s_str[index]), then we replace it with s_str[index] and then move index forward (because we use that digit) and then we continue.\n\n                    But wait: what if we don't have to use the largest available digit immediately? Maybe we can use a slightly smaller one now to save the largest for a later position that we can't improve otherwise? \n\n            Example: \n                a_str = \"132\"\n                s_str = \"95\"\n\n            Sorted s_str: ['9','5']\n\n            Position 0: '1' < '9' -> replace to get '9', then we have '5' left. Then for position 1: '3' vs '5' -> we can replace to get '5'. Then position 2: we don't have anything left. Result: \"952\"\n\n            Alternatively, what if we don't replace the first digit with '9'? Then we could replace the first digit with '5' and then use '9' for the second digit? Then we get \"592\", which is less than \"952\".\n\n            So using the largest available digit for the first position is correct.\n\n            However, consider:\n\n                a_str = \"142\"\n                s_str = \"32\"\n\n            Sorted s_str: ['3','2']\n\n            Position 0: '1' < '3' -> replace with '3', then we have '2'. Then position 1: '4' > '2' -> no replacement. Then position 2: '2' < nothing? Actually, we have a '2' but we don't have to use it. So result: \"342\"\n\n            But what if we don't use the '3' at the first position? Then we can use the '3' at the second position: \n                Original: \"142\"\n                Replace second digit (4) with 3? That would make it \"132\", which is worse. Or replace the last digit? Then \"143\", which is worse than \"342\".\n\n            So the greedy approach of replacing from left to right with the largest available digit that is greater than the current one is correct.\n\n            However, wait: what if the largest available digit is not the best one to use? Consider:\n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"333\"\n\n            Then we can replace all three digits with '3', so we get \"333\".\n\n            Another example:\n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"999\"\n\n            Then we get \"999\".\n\n            But what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"199\"\n                s_str = \"2\"\n\n            Then we can only replace one digit. The leftmost is '1', which is less than '2', so we replace the first digit: \"299\", which is the maximum.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to skip. So we don't have to replace every digit. But in this case, we want to replace the first digit because it gives a bigger improvement.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"199\"\n                s_str = \"8\"\n\n            Then we have an 8. We can replace the first digit: \"899\", which is better than leaving the first digit as '1'.\n\n            So the algorithm is:\n\n                Let sorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n                Let result = list(a_str)\n                Let j = 0   # pointer for sorted_s\n\n                For i in range(len(a_str)):\n                    # If we still have digits in sorted_s and the current digit can be improved by the largest available?\n                    if j < len(sorted_s):\n                        # We look at the current digit and the largest available digit.\n                        # But note: we are allowed to use the digit only if it is greater than the current one? Actually, we can use a digit that is equal or greater? \n                        # However, if we use a digit that is equal, then we don't improve the number, but we use a digit. Is that beneficial? \n                        # Consider: if we don't use the digit, we might use it later for a different position? But if we have an equal digit, then replacing now or later gives the same digit in that position. \n                        # However, if we replace now, we free up the possibility to use the remaining digits (which are all <= this one) for the next positions? Actually, we are going to use the digits from largest to smallest.\n\n                        # But note: the goal is to maximize the number. If we have an option to replace a digit with a digit that is greater, we should. But if we have an option to replace with an equal digit, then we don't have to because we can leave the digit and use the digit for a later position? \n\n                        # However, consider: \n                        #   a_str = \"111\"\n                        #   s_str = \"1\"\n                        #   Then replacing one of the '1's with '1' doesn't change the number. But we are allowed to skip. So we don't need to use the replacement.\n\n                        # But wait: what if we have:\n                        #   a_str = \"111\"\n                        #   s_str = \"2\"\n                        #   Then we can replace one of the '1's with '2' to get \"211\", which is better.\n\n                        # Actually, the condition is: we should replace if the available digit is greater than the current one.\n\n                        # However, what if the available digit is greater, but we have multiple digits in s that are the same? Then we can use one of them for the current position and the rest for later.\n\n                        # But note: our sorted_s is sorted in descending order, so duplicates are together.\n\n                        # The key: we are going to use the largest available digit for the current position if it is greater than the current digit, and then move to the next.\n\n                        # However, what if the largest available digit is not greater? Then we skip this position, because we cannot improve it, and save the digits for later.\n\n                        # But wait: what if we have a digit that is equal? Then we don't have to use it because it doesn't improve. However, if we use an equal digit, we might prevent a later replacement that requires that digit? \n\n                        # Example: \n                        #   a_str = \"123\"\n                        #   s_str = \"1\"\n                        #   Then we can use the '1' to replace the last digit? But replacing the last digit with '1' doesn't change the number. Similarly, we can skip.\n\n                        # However, consider:\n\n                        #   a_str = \"123\"\n                        #   s_str = \"3\"\n                        #   Then we can replace the last digit with '3' to get \"123\" (same) or we can replace the first digit? But '1' < '3'? Actually, we can: \"323\", which is better.\n\n                        # So the rule: we should replace the current digit if the largest available digit is greater than the current digit.\n\n                        # But what if the largest available digit is equal? Then we don't have to use it because we can't improve the current digit, and we don't want to waste a digit that might be useful for a later position that is less than that digit? \n\n                        # Example:\n                        #   a_str = \"123\"\n                        #   s_str = \"2\"\n                        #   Then we have a '2'. \n                        #       Position0: '1' < '2' -> we replace, so we get \"223\", which is better than \"123\".\n                        #   But what if we have:\n                        #   a_str = \"223\"\n                        #   s_str = \"2\"\n                        #   Then the first digit is '2', which is not less than the available '2'. So we skip. Then the second digit is '2', skip. Then the third digit is '3' and we don't have anything else. So result is \"223\".\n\n                        #   But if we had used the '2' for the third digit? Then we get \"222\", which is worse.\n\n                        # So the rule: we only replace if the digit in s is strictly greater than the current digit?\n\n            Correction: \n\n            We want to maximize the number. So we should use a replacement if and only if the digit from s is greater than the current digit.\n\n            However, consider:\n\n                a_str = \"199\"\n                s_str = \"9\"\n\n            Then we have a '9'. \n                Position0: '1' < '9' -> replace, so we get \"999\". That's correct.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"199\"\n                s_str = \"8\"\n\n            Then we have an '8'. \n                Position0: '1' < '8' -> replace, so we get \"899\". Correct.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"999\"\n                s_str = \"8\"\n\n            Then we don't replace any digit because 9 >= 8. So we leave it as \"999\". Correct.\n\n            However, wait: what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"199\"\n                s_str = \"2\"\n\n            Then we have a '2'. \n                Position0: '1' < '2' -> replace, so we get \"299\". Correct.\n\n            But what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"199\"\n                s_str = \"0\"\n\n            Then we have a '0'. \n                Position0: '1' > '0' -> we do not replace. Then the result is \"199\". Correct.\n\n            However, consider a case where we have multiple digits and we can only use one:\n\n                a_str = \"1234\"\n                s_str = \"33\"\n\n            We have two '3's.\n\n            We can replace the first digit: '1' -> '3' (then we have one '3' left) -> then the number becomes \"3234\". Then we can replace the second digit: '2' -> '3' -> \"3334\". Then we can replace the third digit: '3' -> '3' (but 3==3, so we don't want to replace because it doesn't help and we might use the last '3' for a later digit? But wait, the fourth digit is '4', and we have no more digits. So we stop.\n\n            However, we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily. So we can choose to use the two '3's on the first two positions.\n\n            But note: we are traversing from left to right and using the largest available digit (which are both '3') for the first two positions.\n\n            How do we handle duplicates?\n\n            We can do:\n\n                We have sorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True) -> ['3','3'].\n\n                i=0: current digit '1' < '3' -> replace, then remove the first '3' (so we use one). Now sorted_s becomes ['3'] (we are just using an index j to traverse, so j increments by one each time we use a digit).\n\n                i=1: current digit '2' < '3' -> replace, then j becomes 2 (end of list). Then we stop.\n\n                Then the number becomes \"3334\".\n\n            But wait, what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"132\"\n                s_str = \"33\"\n\n            Then:\n                i=0: '1'<'3' -> replace, so we get \"332\", and then we have one '3' left.\n                i=1: current digit is '3' and we have a '3' (equal) -> we don't replace because we only replace when strictly greater?\n                i=2: current digit is '2' and we have a '3' -> we replace, so we get \"333\".\n\n            But wait, we are traversing from left to right and we are using the digits in descending order. We have two '3's. We used the first one at the first position, then the second one at the third position.\n\n            However, what if we use the second '3' at the first position and then the first '3' at the third? The result is the same.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                Let s_sorted = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n                j = 0\n                res = list(a_str)\n\n                for i in range(len(a_str)):\n                    # If we still have digits in s_sorted and the current digit can be improved (by a strictly greater digit) then we use the largest available.\n                    # But note: we are going to use the largest available digit for the current position if it is greater than the current digit.\n\n                    # However, we have to consider: if we have multiple digits, we use the largest one (which is at index j) and then j moves forward.\n\n                    # But what if the current digit is already the maximum? Then we skip.\n\n                    # Condition: if j < len(s_sorted) and s_sorted[j] > a_str[i]:\n                    if j < len(s_sorted) and s_sorted[j] > a_str[i]:\n                        res[i] = s_sorted[j]\n                        j += 1   # we use this digit\n\n                    # Otherwise, we leave it and move on.\n\n                Then output ''.join(res)\n\n            Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \n                    a = \"1024\"\n                    s = \"010\"\n\n                Steps:\n                    s_sorted = sorted(\"010\", reverse=True) -> ['1','0','0']\n                    a_str = \"1024\"\n\n                    i=0: current digit '1', compare with '1' -> not greater, so skip.\n                    i=1: current digit '0', compare with '1' -> '1'>'0', so replace: becomes \"1\" (from first) then at index1: replace '0' with '1' -> \"1124\", then j becomes 1 (next digit in s_sorted is '0')\n                    i=2: current digit '2', compare with '0' -> 0<2, so skip.\n                    i=3: current digit '4', compare with '0' -> skip.\n\n                    Output: \"1124\" -> matches.\n\n            Example 2:\n                Input: \n                    a = \"987\"\n                    s = \"1234567\"\n\n                Steps:\n                    s_sorted = sorted(\"1234567\", reverse=True) -> ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1']\n                    a_str = \"987\"\n\n                    i=0: '9' vs '7' -> 7<9 -> skip.\n                    i=1: '8' vs '7' -> 7<8 -> skip.\n                    i=2: '7' vs '7' -> skip.\n\n                    Output: \"987\" -> matches.\n\n            But wait, what if we have:\n\n                Example 3:\n                    a = \"123\"\n                    s = \"456\"\n\n                Expected: We want to replace the first digit with the largest available? \n                    s_sorted = ['6','5','4']\n                    i=0: '1'<'6' -> replace, then we get \"623\", then j=1 (next is '5')\n                    i=1: '2'<'5' -> replace, then we get \"653\", then j=2 (next is '4')\n                    i=2: '3'<'4' -> replace, then we get \"654\"\n\n                Output: \"654\"\n\n            Example 4:\n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"321\"\n\n                s_sorted = ['3','2','1']\n                i0: '1'<'3' -> replace, then we have \"323\", then j=1 (digit '2')\n                i1: '2'=='2' -> skip\n                i2: '3'>'2' -> wait, no, we have j=1 and the next digit is '2', but the current digit is '3' and '2'<3 -> skip.\n\n                Output: \"323\"\n\n            But wait, we have two replacements: we used one replacement for the first digit, and then we have two digits left in s (but we are only using one). The rest of the digits in s are not used.\n\n            However, we are allowed to use not all elements. So that's fine.\n\n            But is \"323\" the maximum? \n                Original: \"123\"\n                We can also consider: \n                    Replace first digit with '3' -> \"323\"\n                    Or replace first digit with '2' -> \"223\" (worse)\n                    Or replace first digit with '1' -> no change (worse)\n\n                So yes, \"323\" is the maximum.\n\n            However, note: we have another possibility: use the '3' for the first digit and then use the '2' for the second digit? But wait, the second digit is '2', and we have a '2' in s, but replacing the second digit with '2' doesn't change the number. Similarly, we could use the '1' for the third digit, but that doesn't help.\n\n            But wait, what if we don't use the '3' for the first digit and use it for the second? \n                Then we would replace the second digit (which is '2') with '3' -> \"133\", which is less than \"323\".\n\n            So the algorithm is correct.\n\n            However, note: we are using the largest available digit for the first position. But what if the largest available digit is not the best for the first position? \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"19\"\n                s = \"8\"\n\n                Then we replace the first digit: '1'->'8' -> \"89\", which is correct.\n\n            But wait, what if we have:\n\n                a = \"19\"\n                s = \"89\"\n\n                Then we have two digits: ['9','8']\n\n                i0: '1'<'9' -> replace, so we get \"99\", and then we have an '8' left. Then i1: '9' vs '8' -> no replacement. So \"99\"\n\n            Example from above: \n                a = \"19\"\n                s = \"98\" -> same as above.\n\n            However, wait: in the example input, one of the examples was:\n\n                Input: \n                    ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n                Our algorithm produced:\n                    \"1124\" and \"987\"\n\n            But note: the example input also includes:\n\n                Example 1: \n                    Input: \"1024\" and \"010\" -> Output: \"1124\"\n\n            One more edge: what if the number has leading zeros after replacement? \n\n            But note: the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, and we are replacing digits. However, if we replace the first digit with '0', then we would have a leading zero.\n\n            But our condition: we only replace if the digit from s is strictly greater than the current digit. \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"200\"\n                s = \"0\"\n\n            Then the first digit is '2', and the digit from s is '0', which is not greater, so we don't replace. Then we don't introduce a leading zero.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a = \"100\"\n                s = \"0\"\n\n            Then the first digit is '1', and we don't replace because '0' is not greater than '1'. Then we leave it as \"100\".\n\n            However, what if:\n\n                a = \"001\"   -> wait, the problem says: the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\n            But note: we are only replacing digits. The original number doesn't have leading zeros, but if we replace the first digit with a non-zero digit, that's fine. If we replace the first digit with a zero, then we introduce a leading zero? \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"100\"\n                s = \"0\"\n\n            We don't replace the first digit because '0' is not greater than '1'. So no problem.\n\n            Another example:\n\n                a = \"000\"   -> but the problem states: the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros. So this input won't occur.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Read the first line as string a_str\n                Read the second line as string s_str\n\n                s_sorted = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n\n                j = 0\n                res = list(a_str)\n\n                for i in range(len(a_str)):\n                    if j < len(s_sorted) and s_sorted[j] > a_str[i]:\n                        res[i] = s_sorted[j]\n                        j += 1\n\n                print(''.join(res))\n\n            However, wait: what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"111\"\n                s_str = \"222\"\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                s_sorted = ['2','2','2'] (actually, sorted in reverse order, so same)\n\n                i0: '1'<'2' -> replace, then j=1, then i1: '1'<'2' -> replace, then j=2, then i2: '1'<'2' -> replace, then j=3.\n\n                Result: \"222\"\n\n            That's correct.\n\n            But consider performance: \n                The length of a_str and s_str can be up to 10^5.\n\n            Sorting s_str: O(m log m) which is acceptable for m=10^5.\n\n            Then we traverse a_str once, which is O(n). \n\n            So total is O(n + m log m) which is acceptable.\n\n            Let's code accordingly.\n\n            However, wait: what if we have a very long s_str? We are sorting the entire s_str, which is up to 10^5, that's acceptable in Python.\n\n            But note: the problem says the digits in s are given without separators. So we read the whole line and split? Actually, no: the second line is given as a string of digits consecutively.\n\n            Example input format:\n\n                Input: \n                    1024\n                    010\n\n            We read:\n\n                a_str = \"1024\"\n                s_str = \"010\"\n\n            Code:\n\n                import sys\n\n                data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n                a_str = data[0].strip()\n                s_str = data[1].strip()\n\n            Then process.\n\n            Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n            But wait: there's a catch.\n\n            In the example input, the second line might have spaces? The problem says: \"The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.\"\n\n            So we can assume no spaces.\n\n            However, to be safe, we use strip().\n\n            Let me run the provided examples.\n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \n                    \"1024\"\n                    \"010\"\n\n                Output: \"1124\"\n\n            Example 2:\n                Input:\n                    \"987\"\n                    \"1234567\"\n\n                Output: \"987\"\n\n            But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n                ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n            Actually, the example input is two separate lines.\n\n            I think the code is ready.\n\n            However, let me test with the example \"123\" and \"321\" again:\n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"321\"\n\n                s_sorted = sorted(\"321\", reverse=True) -> ['3','2','1']\n\n                i0: '1' < '3' -> True, so replace first digit: becomes \"323\", then j=1.\n                i1: '2' < '2'? -> no, so skip.\n                i2: '3' < '1'? -> no.\n\n                Output: \"323\"\n\n            But wait, what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"111\"\n\n                Then s_sorted = ['1','1','1']\n\n                i0: '1' < '1'? -> no, so skip.\n                i1: '2' < '1'? -> no, skip.\n                i2: '3' < '1'? -> no.\n\n                Output: \"123\"\n\n            Correct.\n\n            One more: \n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"4\"\n\n                Output: \"423\"\n\n            But wait, we have only one digit in s. We replace the first digit: '1'<'4' -> yes, so we get \"423\".\n\n            However, what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"0\"\n\n                Then we don't replace any digit -> \"123\"\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"123\"\n                s_str = \"000\"\n\n                Then s_sorted = ['0','0','0'] (reverse sorted, so still zeros)\n\n                Condition: for i0: '1' < '0'? -> False, so skip. Then same for others.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, what if we have:\n\n                a_str = \"000\"\n                But the problem says: the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros. So we don't have to worry.\n\n            But note: the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, but after replacement, we might have leading zeros? \n\n            Example: \n                a_str = \"000\" -> invalid input per problem, so we don't consider.\n\n            But if we get an input that is not having leading zeros originally, then after replacement, we must avoid introducing leading zeros? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: the printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeros.\n\n            In our algorithm, we only replace a digit if the replacement digit is strictly greater. So if the first digit is replaced by a digit that is greater, then we are increasing the number. \n\n            However, what if the first digit is replaced by a digit that is greater than 0? Then it's okay. \n\n            But what if the first digit is replaced by 0? Then we would have a leading zero.\n\n            Example: \n                a_str = \"1\"\n                s_str = \"0\"\n\n            Then we don't replace because 0 is not greater than 1. So we output \"1\", which is correct.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"0\"\n                But the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, so a_str is \"0\" is allowed? Actually, the problem says \"positive integer\", so the number is positive and has no leading zeros. So the smallest number is \"1\", but wait: positive integers don't include 0. So the input a_str will be at least \"1\".\n\n            However, let me re-read: \"The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes.\" and it is a positive integer.\n\n            So we are safe.\n\n            But wait: what if the first digit is replaced by a zero? \n\n            Example: \n                a_str = \"2\"\n                s_str = \"0\"\n\n            We don't replace because 0 is not greater than 2.\n\n            What if:\n\n                a_str = \"1\"\n                s_str = \"0\" -> no replacement.\n\n            What if:\n\n                a_str = \"1\"\n                s_str = \"00\" -> same.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"19\"\n                s_str = \"0\"\n\n            Then we don't replace the first digit because 0<1, so we leave it as \"19\".\n\n            However, what if:\n\n                a_str = \"19\"\n                s_str = \"00\"\n\n            Same.\n\n            But what if:\n\n                a_str = \"09\" -> invalid input, because the problem says no leading zeros. So the input a_str will be given without leading zeros.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                import sys\n\n                def main():\n                    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n                    if not data: \n                        return\n                    a_str = data[0].strip()\n                    s_str = data[1].strip()\n\n                    # If the sequence s is empty, then we output a_str.\n                    s_list = list(s_str)\n                    s_list.sort(reverse=True)\n\n                    # Convert a_str to list of characters\n                    res = list(a_str)\n                    j = 0\n                    # We traverse each digit in a_str from left to right\n                    for i in range(len(a_str)):\n                        # If we have used all the digits in s_list, break.\n                        if j >= len(s_list):\n                            break\n                        # If the current digit can be improved by the largest available digit (strictly greater)\n                        if s_list[j] > a_str[i]:\n                            res[i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit in the sequence at most once. The key insight is that replacing the leftmost possible digits with the largest available digits from the sequence will yield the highest possible number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves transforming the original number into the largest possible number by strategically replacing its digits. Each digit from the sequence can be used only once, and we can choose to skip any replacements if they do not improve the number.\n2. **Intuition**: The leftmost digits have the most significant impact on the number's value. Therefore, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest available digits from the sequence. This greedy approach ensures that each replacement contributes maximally to increasing the number's value.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the sequence of digits in descending order to have the largest digits readily available.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: Traverse the original number from left to right. For each digit, if the largest remaining digit from the sequence is strictly greater than the current digit, replace it and move to the next digit in the sequence. Continue this process until either all digits in the sequence are used or all positions in the number have been processed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the sequence takes O(m log m) time, where m is the length of the sequence. The subsequent traversal of the number takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the number. Thus, the overall complexity is O(m log m + n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    a_str = data[0].strip()\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    s_list = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n    \n    res = list(a_str)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(len(a_str)):\n        if j >= len(s_list):\n            break\n        if s_list[j] > a_str[i]:\n            res[i] = s_list[j]\n            j += 1\n            \n    print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines: the original number and the sequence of digits to be used for replacements.\n2. **Sorting Digits**: The sequence of digits is sorted in descending order to prioritize replacing digits with the largest available values first.\n3. **Greedy Replacement**: The algorithm processes each digit of the original number from left to right. For each digit, it checks if the largest remaining digit from the sequence is greater than the current digit. If so, it replaces the current digit and moves to the next digit in the sequence. This ensures the leftmost digits are maximized first, leading to the highest possible number.\n4. **Output**: The modified number is printed as a string, combining the unchanged digits with the replaced ones.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number's value by leveraging sorting and a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal use of the available replacement digits.",
