Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cancel per card is x.\n\n 5. We can think greedily:\n\n   Let target = -S (the amount we need to add)\n\n   Case 1: If target is 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n   Case 2: Otherwise, we need to cover the absolute value of the target by adding cards, but note that we can use both positive and negative.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to just positive or negative. But observe:\n\n     We can use multiple cards. Each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). But note: the sign matters.\n\n   Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n     We have an initial sum S, and we want to reach 0. So we need to add a set of numbers (each between -x and x) such that their sum is -S.\n\n   The minimal number of cards required is at least ceil(|target| / x), but wait: because we can use both positive and negative? \n\n   However, note: we are constrained by the fact that we cannot exceed x in absolute value per card. But here's the catch:\n\n     We can use any integer in the range. So if we have to add a total of T (which is -S), then the minimal number of cards is:\n\n        k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n     BUT: is that always achievable?\n\n     Consider: We can choose each card arbitrarily from [-x, x]. So we can adjust the signs appropriately.\n\n     However, note: we might need to use a combination of positive and negative. But actually, we can use only one sign if T is positive or negative.\n\n     Example: \n        In the first sample: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1, 1, 2] -> S = (-1+1+2)=2, so target = -2.\n        Then k_min = ceil(2/2) = ceil(1) = 1. And indeed, we can use one card with -2.\n\n        Second sample: n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> S=-4, target=4.\n        Then k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2. And indeed, we need two cards (each 2, because 2*2=4, and 2<=3).\n\n     But wait: what if T is negative? Then we can use negative cards. Same thing.\n\n     However, consider: what if we have to cover a target T that is not divisible by x? We can use multiple cards.\n\n     Example: x=3, target=4. We can use two cards: [2,2] (since 2+2=4) and 2<=3. Or even [3,1] (but 1<=3). But note: we can also use negative cards if the target is negative? Actually, the target is the amount we need to add (which could be negative or positive). We are free to use any signs.\n\n     However, note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So the key is: we are allowed to use any integer, so we can use positive and negative arbitrarily. But the requirement is that the total of the added cards is T (which is -S). We want the minimum number of cards.\n\n     This is equivalent to: what is the minimum k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each |ai| <= x) with a1+a2+...+ak = T.\n\n     How to compute the minimal k?\n\n     Note: the minimal k must be at least ceil(|T|/x) because the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x, so we require k*x >= |T|.\n\n     But is it always achievable by k = ceil(|T|/x)?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value from -x to x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target**: The target is the negative of the current sum (i.e., `-sum`). This is the amount that the additional cards must sum to in order to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of the target divided by x. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards reaching the target. \n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    target = -total_sum\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        k_min = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on any card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers on the found cards is computed. This sum is stored in `total_sum`.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target is set to `-total_sum`, which is the value needed from the additional cards to make the total sum zero.\n4. **Zero Target Check**: If the target is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target, the minimum number of cards required is calculated by taking the absolute value of the target, dividing it by `x`, and rounding up to the nearest integer. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n6. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimum number of additional cards needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
