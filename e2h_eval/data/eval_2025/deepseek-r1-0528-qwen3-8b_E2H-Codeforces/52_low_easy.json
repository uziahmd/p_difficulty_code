Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour.\n   - After burning, we get a burned candle. We can collect these burned candles to form new ones (each new candle requires 'b' burned candles).\n\n Steps:\n   Let hours = 0\n   We start with 'a' candles.\n\n   While we have at least one candle (whether new or made from leftovers) to burn:\n     - Burn all the candles we have (which gives us as many hours as the number of candles we have in this round).\n     - Then, we get as many new candles as the floor division of the total burned candles (from this round) by b.\n\n   However, note that we use the candles we just made in the next rounds.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   total_candles = a\n   total_hours = 0\n\n   But note: when we burn a candle, we get one burned candle per candle. Then we can use some of those burned candles to make more.\n\n   Actually, we can think of it as:\n\n   Step 1: We have 'a' candles. Burn them -> hours += a. Then we have a burned candles.\n\n   Then, we can make new_candles = a // b, and then we have leftover burned candles: a % b.\n\n   Then we set a = new_candles + leftover_burned (because the new_candles haven't been burned yet, but the leftover burned ones are just leftovers)\n\n   However, note: the problem says that when Vasily lights up a new candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. So we can use the same cycle.\n\n   Actually, we can simulate until we don't have enough candles to make a new one (i.e., less than b burned candles).\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Let candles = a\n   Let burned_count = 0\n   Let hours = 0\n\n   But wait, we can also do without tracking burned_count separately if we track the total candles and the fact that each time we burn, we get one burned per candle.\n\n   Alternate approach (commonly used):\n\n   total = a\n   while total >= b:\n        # Burn all 'total' candles: so we get total hours from this burning\n        hours += total\n        # Now, we can make new_candles = total // b\n        # And we have leftover = total % b\n        new_candles = total // b\n        total = new_candles + (total % b)\n\n   Then we add the last set of candles? Actually, no. The above while loop burns all the candles we have until we don't have enough to make a new one.\n\n   However, consider: initially, we have 'a'. We burn them and then we use the burned ones to make new ones. But the new ones will be burned in the next iteration.\n\n   But wait, the above while loop does:\n\n      First iteration: \n          total = a\n          hours += a\n          new_candles = a // b\n          total becomes (a//b) + (a % b)\n\n      Then, we burn the new total in the next iteration.\n\n   However, note that after the first burning, we have burned a candles and then we have a//b new candles and a % b leftover.\n\n   But the new candles are not burned until the next iteration. So the above simulation is correct.\n\n   But wait, what about the leftover burned candles? They are still available and we combine them with the new ones.\n\n   Example: Input \"4 2\"\n\n      a=4, b=2\n\n      Iteration1:\n          total = 4\n          hours = 4\n          new_candles = 4//2 = 2\n          leftover = 0\n          total = 2\n\n      Iteration2:\n          total = 2\n          hours = 4+2 = 6\n          new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n          leftover = 0\n          total = 1\n\n      Then we break because 1 < 2.\n\n      But the example output is 7.\n\n   Why 7?\n\n   In the example, they say:\n        For the first four hours: burn 4 candles -> 4 hours, and then we have 4 burned.\n        Then we make 4//2 = 2 new candles -> burn them for 2 hours -> total 6 hours.\n        Then, after burning the 2, we have 2 burned. Then we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle -> burn that for 1 hour -> total 7 hours.\n\n   So our simulation missed the last candle? \n\n   The issue: in the first iteration, we burn 4 and then we have 4 burned. Then we make ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be combined to create new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to make a new one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial number of candles, `a`.\n2. **Burning Candles**: Each time we burn all available candles, we add their count to the total hours.\n3. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning, the total number of burned candles (which is equal to the number of candles burned) is used to create new candles. Specifically, every `b` burned candles can be converted into one new candle.\n4. **Update Candles**: The new candles created along with any leftover burned candles (if the count is not divisible by `b`) become the available candles for the next iteration.\n5. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of available candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process until no more candles can be produced, ensuring the maximum number of hours is calculated.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    hours = 0\n    current = a\n\n    while current >= b:\n        hours += current\n        new_candles = current // b\n        leftover = current % b\n        current = new_candles + leftover\n\n    print(hours + current)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The program reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are enough candles (`current`) to make at least one new candle (i.e., `current >= b`).\n3. **Burning**: In each iteration, the current number of candles is added to the total hours (`hours += current`).\n4. **Recycling**: The total burned candles (equal to `current`) are divided by `b` to determine how many new candles can be made (`new_candles = current // b`). The remainder (`current % b`) represents leftover burned candles that cannot form a new candle.\n5. **Update**: The available candles for the next iteration are the sum of newly made candles and leftover burned candles (`current = new_candles + leftover`).\n6. **Final Output**: After the loop ends, the remaining candles (`current`) are added to the total hours because they can still be burned even if they cannot be recycled further.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total burning time by leveraging the recycling of burned candles, ensuring optimal use of all available resources.",
