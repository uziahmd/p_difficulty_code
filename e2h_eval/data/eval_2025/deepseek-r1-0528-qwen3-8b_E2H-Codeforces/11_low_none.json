A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. Total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into 'd' slices. So total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. We have p grams of salt.\n\n For each toast, we need:\n   - nl milliliters of drink (per toast)\n   - 1 slice of lime (per toast)\n   - np grams of salt (per toast)\n\n But note: the friends are making toasts and each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n However, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n This means that for one toast by one friend, we require:\n   drink: nl ml\n   lime: 1 slice\n   salt: np grams\n\n Since all friends must drink the same number of toasts, the total number of toasts T that the entire group can make is limited by:\n\n   T * (nl) <= total_drink   (because each toast uses nl ml, and there are T toasts in total)\n   T * (1) <= total_lime_slices  (each toast uses one slice)\n   T * (np) <= total_salt\n\n Then, the total toasts T must be the minimum of these three quantities.\n\n However, note that the problem asks: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n Since there are n friends, the total toasts T must be divided among the friends. But note: the condition is that each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n Actually, let T_total be the total number of toasts the entire group can make. Then each friend makes T_total // n? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"each friend needs ... for a toast\", meaning that for each toast a friend makes, they use nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\n Therefore, if we let t be the number of toasts per friend, then the total number of toasts is n * t.\n\n Conditions become:\n\n   n * t * nl <= k * l\n   n * t * 1  <= c * d\n   n * t * np <= p\n\n So we can compute:\n\n   t1 = floor((k * l) / (n * nl))\n   t2 = floor((c * d) / (n * 1))   [but wait, actually we don't need floor until the end? Actually, we are going to take the minimum of the three without flooring because we cannot exceed the available resources]\n\n However, note: we cannot use more than the available resources. The total drink required for n friends each having t toasts is n * t * nl.\n\n Therefore, the maximum t (toasts per friend) is constrained by:\n\n   t <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   t <= (c * d) / (n * 1)\n   t <= p / (n * np)\n\n But note: the total drink is k*l, and the requirement for drink for the entire group for t toasts per friend is n * t * nl. So we cannot have fractional toasts per friend? \n\n Actually, the problem is about making as many toasts as possible (each friend the same number). We are to find the maximum integer t (nonnegative integer) such that:\n\n   n * t * nl <= k * l\n   n * t <= c * d\n   n * t * np <= p\n\n Then t_max is the minimum value of:\n\n   t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if we were using integer division, but note: we are not necessarily using integer division because we might not use all the drink? Actually, we can only use whole toasts.]\n\n But wait: the problem does not require that we use all the resources. We are to maximize t (the number of toasts per friend) subject to the above inequalities.\n\n However, note: the total drink required is n*t*nl. Since we have k*l, we require n*t*nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl). Similarly for the others.\n\n So the maximum t is the floor of the minimum of:\n\n   (k*l) / (n*nl)\n   (c*d) / (n)\n   p / (n*np)\n\n But note: t must be an integer, and we cannot exceed the available resources. We are to take the floor of the limiting factor? Actually, the constraints are linear and we can only make whole numbers of toasts per friend.\n\n However, consider: the total toasts is n*t. The drink constraint: n*t * nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl). Since",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then determine how many toasts each friend can make without exceeding these limits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources: drink (from bottles), lime slices (from cutting limes), and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves finding the minimum number of toasts that can be made across all three resources when divided by the number of friends. This ensures that all friends can make the same number of toasts without any resource being exhausted.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm computes the maximum possible toasts per friend by considering each resource separately:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each friend needs `nl` milliliters per toast, so the maximum toasts per friend is `(k * l) / (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice, so the maximum toasts per friend is `(c * d) / n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams, so the maximum toasts per friend is `p / (n * np)`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the floor of the minimum value obtained from the above three calculations, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    toast_limit_drink = total_drink / (n * nl)\n    toast_limit_lime = total_lime_slices / (n)\n    toast_limit_salt = p / (n * np)\n    \n    min_toasts = min(toast_limit_drink, toast_limit_lime, toast_limit_salt)\n    result = int(min_toasts)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink required per toast, and salt required per toast.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: The total available drink is computed as `k * l`, and the total lime slices as `c * d`.\n3. **Toast Limit Calculation**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts per friend is calculated by dividing the total resource by the product of the number of friends and the resource required per toast. This gives three potential limits.\n4. **Result Determination**: The smallest of these three limits determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make. The result is printed as an integer, ensuring it is a whole number since fractional toasts are not allowed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
