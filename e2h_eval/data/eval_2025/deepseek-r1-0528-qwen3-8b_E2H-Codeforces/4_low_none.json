The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses A[i % len(A)]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate through each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n 1. We note that the entire game is periodic with period = lcm(len(A), len(B))? \n    However, note that the rounds are independent, but the two sequences cycle independently.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider a \"cycle\" of length L = len(A) * len(B) (the product of the lengths) and then the pattern repeats every L rounds.\n\n But wait: actually, the two cycles are independent, so the state (i mod len(A), j mod len(B)) would repeat every LCM(len(A), len(B)) rounds? Actually, the combined cycle is LCM(len(A), len(B)).\n\n However, note that we have two sequences: \n   Round i: \n        a = A[i % m]   (m = len(A))\n        b = B[i % k]   (k = len(B))\n\n The state for the round i is determined by (i mod m, i mod k). The combined cycle for the two mods is the least common multiple of m and k, provided that we consider the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Actually, the combined cycle for (i mod m, i mod k) is LCM(m,k).\n\n Steps:\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n We can precompute:\n   total_rounds = n\n\n Then, we can break the n rounds into:\n   full_cycles = n // cycle_length   (where cycle_length = LCM(m, k))\n   remainder_rounds = n % cycle_length\n\n Then, we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle (from 0 to cycle_length-1) and then multiply by full_cycles.\n\n But wait: how to compute the losses in one cycle?\n\n Alternatively, we can note that in each round i, we can determine the outcome by comparing A[i%m] and B[i%k].\n\n We can also note that the outcome is determined by the pair (a, b) and there are only 3*3=9 possible pairs.\n\n We can precompute for a given round index i (which gives two indices: i%m and i%k) the outcome.\n\n However, the challenge is that the cycle_length might be very large if we take LCM(m,k) because m,k<=1000, so LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable since n is 2e9 and we have at most 1e6 distinct states? Actually, no, the distinct states (i mod m, i mod k) are exactly LCM(m,k) which is at most 1000*1000 (but actually, LCM(m,k) <= m*k, and m,k<=1000, so maximum 1e6). \n\n However, 1e6 is acceptable for precomputation? Because we are going to iterate over at most 1e6 rounds to count the outcomes in one cycle.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Compute cycle_length = LCM(m, k). We know that LCM(m,k) = m * k / GCD(m,k). So we need to compute GCD.\n\n 2. Precompute an array for one cycle: for i from 0 to cycle_length-1, we have:\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        Then, determine if there's a win/loss/draw.\n\n 3. Count in one cycle:\n        losses_nikephoros = number of rounds where Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus wins)\n        losses_poly = number of rounds where Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros wins)\n\n 4. Then, total losses for Nikephoros = full_cycles * losses_nikephoros + (losses in the first remainder_rounds rounds)\n   Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But note: In a round, if it's a draw, then no one gets a red spot.\n\n How to determine the outcome?\n\n Rules:\n   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n So, if a == b -> draw.\n\n Otherwise:\n   if a == 'R' and b == 'S': Nikephoros wins (because R beats S) -> so Pol",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the results without iterating through each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move in each player's sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. Within one cycle, the outcomes of all possible round combinations repeat.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - For each round within one cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) based on the current moves of both players.\n   - Count the total losses each player incurs in one full cycle.\n   - Multiply these counts by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds (if any).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    cycle_length = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    remainder_rounds = n % cycle_length\n    \n    losses_nike = 0\n    losses_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            losses_poly += 1\n        else:\n            losses_nike += 1\n            \n    total_nike_losses = full_cycles * losses_nike + losses_nike * (remainder_rounds >= cycle_length)\n    total_poly_losses = full_cycles * losses_poly + losses_poly * (remainder_rounds >= cycle_length)\n    \n    total_nike = 0\n    total_poly = 0\n    for i in range(remainder_rounds):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike += 1\n            \n    total_nike_losses += total_nike\n    total_poly_losses += total_poly\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike_losses} {total_poly_losses}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` (Nikephoros) and `B` (Polycarpus).\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The cycle length is computed as the LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` to determine the repeating pattern.\n3. **Full Cycles Handling**: For each full cycle, the losses are counted once and multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n4. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: The remaining rounds after full cycles are processed individually to count additional losses.\n5. **Outcome Determination**: For each round, the outcome is determined by comparing the current moves of both players. If a player loses, their respective loss counter is incremented.\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed after processing all rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, avoiding the need for brute-force iteration through each round.",
