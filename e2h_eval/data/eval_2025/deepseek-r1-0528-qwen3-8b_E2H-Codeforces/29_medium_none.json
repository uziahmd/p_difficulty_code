Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to process a series of string replacements (queries) on an initial string of digits, and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, note that the total length of all 'ti' in queries is at most 10^5, but the initial string s can be up to 10^5, and there can be up to 10^5 queries.\n\n Important: The replacements are done sequentially. But if we try to do each query by scanning the entire string and replacing every occurrence of a digit, the complexity might be too high because the string can become very long (each replacement might expand or contract the string). For example, if we have a digit that is replaced by a long string, and that digit appears many times, the string grows exponentially.\n\n We cannot do naive replacements because the string might become too long.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We need to process the queries in reverse order? Or use dynamic programming/state machine?\n\n Actually, note: the problem says the queries are performed in the given order.\n\n Observation: Each query is of the form \"d -> t\", meaning every occurrence of the digit d is replaced by the string t.\n\n Since the same digit might be replaced multiple times (if later queries define replacements for digits that were introduced by previous ones) and also because the replacement strings might contain digits that will be subject to subsequent queries, we must consider the entire chain of replacements.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the queries are applied in order. So the first query replaces all occurrences of digit d1 by t1, then the second query (if it replaces d2) will replace all occurrences of d2 (which may include parts of t1) and so on.\n\n But here's the catch: the total length of all ti is 10^5, but the intermediate string might become huge. We cannot build the entire string.\n\n We need to compute the final number modulo 1000000007 without constructing the entire string (because the string might be astronomically large).\n\n Let's think about the problem differently:\n\n We want to compute the number represented by the final string, modulo 1000000007.\n\n The number can be built from left to right. But the replacements might interlace.\n\n Idea: Instead of processing the initial string and then applying the queries one by one (which would lead to an explosion in the string length), we can precompute for each digit what its final form is after all the queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in order. So the last query might change a digit that was introduced by an earlier query.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have n queries. We can process them from last to first, and for each digit, we know what transformation it becomes after all the subsequent queries.\n\n But note: the queries are sequential. The transformation for a digit d_i in the i-th query is applied at step i, and then from step i+1 to n, there are more transformations that might act on the replacement string t_i.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   Let f(d) be the final representation of the digit d after all the queries.\n\n   Then, we process the queries backwards, updating for each digit the transformation it undergoes.\n\n However, note: the replacement in a query is applied to every occurrence of the digit at the time of the query. But after the query, that digit is replaced by a string that might contain other digits, which then get transformed by the following queries.\n\n Therefore, we can simulate the effect of the entire sequence of queries by having an array (or dictionary) `mapping` for each digit (from '0' to '9') that gives the string it is expanded to after all the queries.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We start with the initial string s.\n\n   We are going to process the queries from last to first (reverse order). Why? Because the last query is the last transformation applied.\n\n   We'll have a mapping for each digit. Initially, for each digit d, the mapping is just d itself (but note: the queries might override this, and then subsequent queries might change what d becomes).\n\n   However, when processing in reverse, we consider:\n\n     For the last query: say it is \"d->t\". Then, in the final result, the digit d is replaced by t, but wait: actually, the last query is the last chance to change d. But note: the following queries (none, since it's the last) don't change d. So the mapping for d should be set to t, but then we must account for the fact that t might contain digits that are defined by even later queries? No, because we are processing backwards.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n     Let `result_digit[d]` be the string that the digit d expands to after all queries.\n\n     Initially, for each digit d, `result_digit[d] = d`.\n\n     Then, we process the queries from last to first. For each query (d_i -> t_i):\n\n        We are going to update the mapping for d_i: \n\n            `result_digit[d_i] = expand(t_i, result_digit)`\n\n        where `expand(t_i, result_digit)` means: for each character c in t_i, we replace c by `result_digit[c]`. But note: the expansion of t_i is done with the current mappings (which include the transformations from the queries that occur after the current one). However, we are processing backwards, so the current mappings are for the queries that come after the current one.\n\n        Then, the current query says that originally the digit d_i is replaced by t_i, and then t_i is transformed by the subsequent queries. So the final form of d_i is the expansion of t_i using the subsequent mappings.\n\n        But note: the expansion of t_i might be very long, and the total length of all t_i is 10^5, but the expansion might be exponential? However, we cannot store the expanded string because it might be too long.\n\n   Alternate idea: we don't store the expanded string, but we store the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (in terms of digit count) of the expansion for each digit.\n\n   Why length? Because when we are building the number, we need to know the power of 10 for each part.\n\n   Consider: the final number is built by concatenating the expansions of each digit.\n\n   We can represent the expansion of a digit as:\n\n        value[d] = (value_expansion, len_expansion)\n\n   where:\n        value_expansion: the number formed by the expansion of d, modulo 1000000007.\n        len_expansion: the total number of digits in the expansion of d.\n\n   How do we combine?\n\n   Suppose we have two expansions for two consecutive digits (say, we are building the number from left to right). The number is built by:\n\n        new_value = (old_value * (10^len_right) + value_right) mod modulus\n\n   But note: we are processing the entire string as a concatenation of digits, and each digit is expanded to a string.\n\n   We can precompute for each digit the value and length of its expansion.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Start with an array (or dict) for each digit (0-9) with:\n          value[d] = int(d) % mod   [But wait, the expansion might not be just a single digit!]\n          len[d] = 1\n\n        However, initially, we have the identity mapping.\n\n     2. Process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each query (d -> t):\n\n          We need to compute the value and length for the string t using the current mappings (i.e., the mappings that represent the transformations that happen after the current query).\n\n          Then, set:\n              value[d] = computed_value_of_t\n              len[d] = computed_length_of_t\n\n          How to compute the value and length for a string t?\n\n          We traverse the string t from left to right.\n\n          Let L = 0, V = 0.\n\n          For each character c in t:\n              Let l = len[c]   (the length of the expansion of c)\n              Let v = value[c] (the value of the expansion of c)\n\n              Then, we update:\n                  V = (V * (10^l) + v) % mod\n                  L = (L + l) % (mod-1)?  Wait, no: we don't take modulo for exponent base 10? Actually, we cannot store the length as an integer if it gets too big, but note: the maximum length of the expansion might be huge (exponential in the number of queries). However, the problem says the total length of all t_i is 10^5, but the expansion might be repeated and the length can be astronomical.\n\n          But note: the modulus for the exponentiation is 1000000007, but the length is used only for shifting the entire block of digits (i.e., the power of 10). The power of 10 for a block of length L is 10^L mod 1000000007? However, the length L might be huge (like 10^100000) and we cannot compute 10^(10^100000) mod 1000000007 directly.\n\n          We need to use Euler's theorem? But note: the modulus is 1000000007, which is prime. However, Euler's theorem requires that the base (10) and modulus are coprime, which they are (gcd(10,1000000007)=1). But the exponent can be reduced modulo φ(1000000007) = 1000000006.\n\n          However, wait: we are going to use the length to compute the shift: for a block of length L, the multiplier is 10^L mod 1000000007. But if L is huge, we can compute 10^L mod 1000000007 using modular exponentiation with exponent L mod 1000000006 (Euler's theorem) provided that L is nonnegative and we know that 10 and 1000000007 are coprime.\n\n          BUT: we cannot store the length as an integer if it is too big (like 10^100000). However, note that the problem constraints: the total length of all ti is 10^5, and we have at most 10^5 queries, but the expansion might be applied recursively. The length of the expansion for a digit might become very large (exponentially with the number of queries). However, the problem does not require the actual string, only the number mod 1000000007.\n\n          How to handle the length?\n\n          We need to compute the total length (in base 10 digits) of the expansion of a string t. However, the length of the expansion might be astronomical. But note: we are only interested in the shift factor (10^length) mod 1000000007. And the shift factor is periodic modulo 1000000007 (with period 1000000006). So we can store the length modulo 1000000006 (the totient of 1000000007) for the purpose of exponentiation? However, note: the length is the total number of digits, and the shift factor is 10^(total_length). \n\n          But wait: the total_length is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of each character in t. And each expansion's length is itself stored modulo 1000000006? \n\n          However, we must be cautious: the length is used only for computing the exponent in 10^length, and by Euler we have:\n\n            10^k mod 1000000007 = 10^(k mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007   [if k >= 0]\n\n          BUT: this is only valid if k is sufficiently large? Actually, Euler's theorem requires that 10 and 1000000007 are coprime (which they are) and then 10^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n. So for exponents, we can reduce modulo φ(n) (if the exponent is at least φ(n))? Actually, we can reduce the exponent modulo φ(n) for the purpose of modular exponentiation, but only if the base and modulus are coprime. However, note that the exponentiation is over the modulus 1000000007, so we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (since φ(1000000007)=1000000006) for base 10.\n\n          However, the problem: the length (number of digits) might be so huge that we cannot store the exact integer. But we can store the length modulo 1000000006? \n\n          BUT: the length is the total number of digits, and we are going to use it to compute 10^(length) mod 1000000007. So we can store the length as an integer modulo 1000000006 (let's call it `len_mod`). However, note: the length is additive, and we are going to use the property:\n\n            total_length = (sum of the lengths of the expansions of each character)   [but wait, no: the expansion of a character is a string, and the length of that string is stored in `len[c]`, but that `len[c]` itself might be huge and stored modulo 1000000006?]\n\n          Actually, we can store:\n\n            For each digit d, we store:\n                val[d] = the value of the expansion of d mod 1000000007\n                len_exp[d] = the total length of the expansion of d (as an integer) mod 1000000006   (for the purpose of exponentiation)\n\n          However, the length is used in two ways:\n\n            - To compute the next value: we need to shift the current value by the length (so that the next part is appended to the right). The shift is 10^(len_exp) mod 1000000007.\n\n            - And the length is the sum of the lengths of the characters.\n\n          But note: the length is additive, so we can store the length modulo 1000000006 (because 10^(a+b) mod 1000000007 = (10^a * 10^b) mod 1000000007, and we can break the exponent into a and b). However, the length itself is just a count (nonnegative integer) and we are going to use it to compute the exponent. We can store the length modulo 1000000006, but note: the length is the total number of digits, and we are only interested in 10^(length) mod 1000000007. This is equivalent to 10^(length mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that the exponent is at least 0. However, Euler's theorem requires that the exponent is reduced modulo φ(1000000007)=1000000006, but the exponent (the length) is being used as an exponent, so yes.\n\n          BUT: caution: the exponentiation function in modular arithmetic for base 10 and modulus 1000000007: we can reduce the exponent modulo 1000000006 (if the exponent is at least 1000000006, then we can subtract multiples of 1000000006). However, the length we are storing is the actual total number of digits (which is an integer) and we want to compute 10^(length) mod 1000000007. We can do:\n\n            shift = pow(10, length, 1000000007)   # but if length is huge, we cannot compute it directly.\n\n          Alternatively, we can store the length modulo 1000000006 (call it L_mod) and then use:\n\n            shift = pow(10, L_mod, 1000000007)\n\n          But wait: is that correct? Only if the length is congruent to L_mod modulo 1000000006, then 10^(length) ≡ 10^(L_mod) mod 1000000007. And that is true because of Euler's theorem.\n\n          However, we must note: the length we are dealing with is the total number of digits, and we are going to combine the digits from left to right. The value is built by:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each digit d in the final string (from left to right):\n                value = (value * (10^(len[d])) + val[d]) % mod\n\n          But now, we have stored for each digit d:\n            val[d] = the value of the expansion of d (a number mod 1000000007)\n            len[d] = the length of the expansion of d (mod 1000000006)   [for exponentiation]\n\n          Then, when combining two digits (or two expansions), we do:\n\n            value = (value * pow(10, len[d], mod)) % mod\n            value = (value + val[d]) % mod\n\n          However, note: the expansion of a digit d is a string, and the entire string is broken down into digits that are expanded further. But we are storing the entire expansion as a single value and a single length.\n\n          Steps for processing a query (d -> t) in reverse:\n\n            We need to compute the expansion for the string t (using the current mappings for each digit in t). We'll compute:\n\n                total_val = 0\n                total_len = 0   (this will be the length of the entire expansion of t, stored modulo 1000000006)\n\n            Then, for each character c in t:\n\n                Let v = val[c]   (the value of the expansion of c, mod 1000000007)\n                Let l = len[c]   (the length of the expansion of c, mod 1000000006)\n\n                Then, update:\n\n                    total_val = (total_val * pow(10, l, mod)) % mod\n                    total_val = (total_val + v) % mod\n\n                And update total_len:\n\n                    total_len = (total_len + l) % mod_phi   (where mod_phi = 1000000006)\n\n            Then, set:\n                val[d] = total_val\n                len[d] = total_len\n\n          Then, the initial string s is processed by:\n\n            result = 0\n            total_len = 0   (we don't really need the total length of the entire number for modulus, but we do need to compute the value)\n\n            Actually, we can process each digit in the initial string:\n\n                For each digit d in s:\n                    result = (result * pow(10, len[d], mod)) % mod\n                    result = (result + val[d]) % mod\n\n          However, wait: we have stored for each digit d the value and length of its expansion (after all queries). Then, the initial string s is transformed by replacing each digit d with its expansion (which is a string of digits), and then we interpret that entire string as a decimal number.\n\n          But note: the expansion of a digit d is a string, and the entire string is built by concatenating the expansions. Our method for building the number is by processing each digit (from left to right) and for each digit, we multiply the current result by 10^(length of its expansion) and add the value of the expansion.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"12\"\n            Query: \"1->2\", \"2->3\"\n\n          Processing queries in reverse order:\n\n            First, we set for each digit: \n                val[d] = int(d) % mod, for d in '0' to '9'\n                len[d] = 1 % mod_phi\n\n            Then, process the last query first: \"2->3\"\n\n                t = \"3\"\n                total_val = 0\n                for c in \"3\": \n                    v = val['3'] = 3\n                    l = len['3'] = 1\n                    total_val = (0 * 10^1 + 3) = 3\n                    total_len = 1\n                Then set: val['2'] = 3, len['2'] = 1.\n\n            Then, the next query (first one): \"1->2\"\n                t = \"2\"\n                Now, use the updated mappings: for '2', we have val['2']=3, len['2']=1.\n                total_val = 0\n                for c in \"2\":\n                    v = 3, l=1\n                    total_val = 3\n                Then set: val['1'] = 3, len['1'] = 1.\n\n            Then, the initial string \"12\" becomes:\n\n                First digit '1': \n                    result = 0 * (10^1) + 3 = 3\n                Second digit '2':\n                    result = 3 * (10^1) + 3 = 33.\n\n            But the expected result: \n                First query: replace '1' by '2' -> becomes \"22\"\n                Second query: replace '2' by '3' -> becomes \"33\"\n\n            So 33 is correct.\n\n          Another example: \n            Input: \"123123\", then query \"2->00\", then query \"3->\"\n\n          Process queries in reverse:\n\n            Last query: \"3->\" (empty string)\n                t = \"\"\n                Then, total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n                Set: val['3'] = 0, len['3'] = 0.\n\n            Then, the first query: \"2->00\"\n                t = \"00\"\n                For first '0': \n                    val0 = 0, len0 = 1 -> then update: total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0; total_len = 1\n                For second '0':\n                    total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0; total_len = 2.\n                Then set: val['2'] = 0, len['2'] = 2.\n\n            Now, process the initial string \"123123\":\n\n                '1': remains 1 (since no query for '1') -> val['1'] = 1, len['1'] = 1.\n                '2': becomes 00, so we use val['2']=0, len['2']=2.\n                '3': becomes empty, so val['3']=0, len['3']=0.\n                '1': 1, len=1.\n                '2': 0, len=2.\n                '3': 0, len=0.\n\n            Then, build the number:\n\n                Start with 0.\n\n                '1': 0 * (10^1) + 1 = 1\n                '2': 1 * (10^2) + 0 = 100\n                '3': 100 * (10^0) + 0 = 100\n                '1': 100 * (10^1) + 1 = 1001\n                '2': 1001 * (10^2) + 0 = 100100\n                '3': 100100 * (10^0) + 0 = 100100\n\n            But the expected output is 10031003? Actually, wait the example input says:\n\n                Input: \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\", then the next sample is \"123123\\n1\\n3->\", so the first sample output is \"10031003\".\n\n            Let me check: \n                Original: 123123\n                Query \"2->00\": \n                    Replace every '2' by \"00\": \n                        1 2 3 1 2 3 -> 1 00 3 1 00 3 -> 10031003\n\n            So the result is 10031003.\n\n            In our calculation above, we got 100100, which is not matching.\n\n            Why? \n\n            We did not account for the fact that the replacement for '2' is \"00\", which is two zeros. But then, the expansion for '2' is two zeros, so the value should be 0, and the length is 2, so that part is correct.\n\n            However, the initial string is \"123123\", and the expansion for:\n\n                '1': value=1, length=1\n                '2': value=0, length=2\n                '3': remains 3? But wait, we did the reverse processing and the query \"3->\" was applied first? \n\n            Actually, the queries are:\n\n                First: \"2->00\"\n                Second: \"3->\" (empty string)\n\n            But in our reverse processing, we did:\n\n                Step1: process the last query (second one) which is \"3->\", then set val['3']=0, len['3']=0.\n\n                Step2: process the first query (first one) which is \"2->00\", then set val['2']=0, len['2']=2.\n\n            Then, we process the initial string \"123123\" from left to right.\n\n            The initial string has digits: '1','2','3','1','2','3'\n\n            So:\n\n                '1': value=1, len=1 -> result=1\n                '2': value=0, len=2 -> result = (1 * (10^2) + 0) = 100\n                '3': value=0, len=0 -> result = (100 * (10^0) + 0) = 100\n                '1': 100 * 10^1 + 1 = 100*10+1 = 1001\n                '2': 1001 * 10^2 + 0 = 100100\n                '3': 100100 * 10^0 + 0 = 100100\n\n            But the expected is 10031003.\n\n            What went wrong?\n\n            The issue: the expansion for the digit '3' is empty (so we skip it). But the expansion for the digit '2' is \"00\", so after the first query, the string becomes \"1\" + \"00\" + \"3\" (but wait, the second query hasn't been applied yet) and then the second query (applied later) removes the '3'. \n\n            However, we are processing the queries in reverse order, and we set the expansion for '3' to be empty. Then, when processing the initial string, we are effectively applying both queries at once (because we have precomputed the final expansion for every digit).\n\n            But note: the second query (last one) is \"3->\", so after the first query, the string is \"10031003\", and then the second query removes the '3's. So the string becomes \"1001003\" with the '3's removed? Actually, no: the second query removes every '3'. In the string \"10031003\", the '3's are at positions 3 and 6 (0-indexed). Removing them: \n\n                Original after first query: \"10031003\"\n                Then remove the '3's: \n                    Remove the third character (the first '3'): becomes \"1001003\"\n                    Remove the sixth character (the second '3'): becomes \"100100\" (wait, let me index: \n                        0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 3:3 -> remove the '3' at index3 -> then the string is \"100\" (from indices0-2) and then the rest starting at index4: \"1003\" -> but wait, after removing the first '3', the string becomes \"100\" + \"1003\" without the '3'? Actually, removal of a character shifts the indices.\n\n            Actually, we must remove every occurrence of '3'. In \"10031003\", the '3's are at indices 3 and 6 (if we consider the original string). But the string is built by:\n\n                Original: \"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\" -> after first query: \n                    '1'->'1'\n                    '2'->'00'\n                    '3'->'3' (but then the second query will remove it) -> so the second query is applied to the entire string after the first.\n\n            However, the problem says: the queries are applied in the given order.\n\n            In the example, the first query is applied, then the second. So the string after the first query is \"10031003\", and then the second query removes every '3'. \n\n            How many '3's are in \"10031003\"? There are two: at the fourth character (0-indexed index3) and the seventh (index6). Removing these two, we get:\n\n                Original: [0:'1', 1:'0', 2:'0', 3:'3', 4:'1', 5:'0', 6:'0', 7:'3']\n                Remove index3: then the string becomes [0:'1',1:'0',2:'0',3:'1',4:'0',5:'0',6:'3']? Actually, removal of the character at index3: the next character moves to index3. Then we have to remove the next occurrence of '3' at the new index? \n\n            But the problem doesn't specify the order of removal for multiple adjacent or interleaved? Actually, the problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". So the replacement is done simultaneously for all occurrences? Or sequentially?\n\n            From the example: \"123123\" with query \"3->\" becomes \"1212\", so it removes every occurrence of '3' (without affecting the positions of the remaining digits). \n\n            So the removal is done for all occurrences at once.\n\n            Therefore, after the first query, the string is \"10031003\", and then we remove every '3' (without re-indexing during the same query). So the removal of the two '3's leads to:\n\n                Original: \"10031003\" -> remove the '3' at position3: becomes \"1001003\", then remove the '3' at position6 (which was originally at position6, but now the string is \"1001003\", so the last character is '3' at index6? Actually, the removal of one '3' shortens the string by one, so the second '3' is now at a different index.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"replace all digits di\" (meaning every occurrence) in the entire string at once. So we remove both '3's at the same time. Then the string becomes:\n\n                \"10031003\" -> remove the '3's: we have two '3's, so we remove two characters, and the remaining characters are:\n\n                    Positions: \n                      0: '1'\n                      1: '0'\n                      2: '0'\n                      3: (originally '3' removed) so skip, then next is the '1' from the next part? Actually, the string is built as:\n\n                The original string after first query: \n                    Start: '1' -> '1'\n                    Then '2' -> '00'\n                    Then '3' -> '3' (but wait, no: the first query only replaces '2'. The '3' is not touched by the first query. Then the second query replaces every '3' (so both the '3' that was originally there and any '3' that appears in the replacement strings? But the first replacement didn't produce a '3'. \n\n                So the string after the first query is \"1\" + \"00\" + \"3\" + \"1\" + \"00\" + \"3\" = \"10031003\"\n\n                Then the second query: remove every '3'. So we remove the two '3's (at positions 3 and 6). Then the string becomes:\n\n                    \"1\" + \"00\" + \"\" + \"1\" + \"00\" + \"\" = \"100100\"\n\n                That is 100100.\n\n            But the example output is 10031003 for the first sample and 1212 for the second. \n\n            Wait, the example input:\n\n                ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n            Output:\n\n                ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n            So the first sample output is 10031003, but according to the example explanation, the first query alone produces 10031003. Then the second sample is the same initial string and one query: \"3->\", so the output is 1212.\n\n            And the third sample: \"222\", two queries: \n                \"2->0\", then \"0->7\"\n\n            So the first query: \"222\" becomes \"000\"\n            Then the second query: \"000\" becomes \"777\"\n\n            And the fourth sample: \"1000000008\", zero queries -> output 1.\n\n            Now, let me check the example \"123123\" with one query \"2->00\": \n                Expected output: 10031003.\n\n            So our method must output 10031003 for the first sample.\n\n            But in our reverse processing, we did:\n\n                Query1: \"2->00\", Query2: \"3->\"\n\n            Then we set for digit '2': \n                t = \"00\", and we compute the expansion of \"00\" (using the current mappings, which at that point (reverse processing) only the identity mapping) so:\n\n                For \"00\": \n                    For the first '0': val0=0, len0=1 -> total_val=0, total_len=1\n                    For the second '0': total_val=0*10^1+0=0, total_len=2.\n\n                So we set val['2']=0, len['2']=2.\n\n            Then, we set for digit '3': \n                t = \"\", so val['3']=0, len['3']=0.\n\n            Then, we process the initial string \"123123\":\n\n                '1': val=1, len=1 -> result=1\n                '2': val=0, len=2 -> result = (1 * (10^2) + 0) = 100\n                '3': val=0, len=0 -> result = (100 * (10^0) + 0) = 100\n                '1': 100 * 10^1 + 1 = 1001\n                '2': 1001 * 10^2 + 0 = 100100\n                '3': 100100 * 10^0 + 0 = 100100\n\n            But expected is 10031003.\n\n            Why is that?\n\n            The issue is: the expansion for the digit '2' is \"00\", which is two digits. But the expansion for the digit '3' is empty, but note: the initial string has two '",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacements on an initial digit string and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to their exponential growth.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order, we process them in reverse. This allows us to determine the final form of each digit after all transformations by leveraging the subsequent queries' effects.\n2. **Dynamic Mapping for Digits**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the digit's expansion modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The total number of digits in the expansion, modulo 1000000006 (using Euler's theorem for efficient exponentiation).\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each query processed in reverse, compute the value and length of the replacement string by combining the values and lengths of its constituent digits using the current mappings. This involves modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.\n4. **Initial String Processing**: After precomputing the final mappings for all digits, process the initial string by replacing each digit with its mapped value and length, combining these results to form the final number modulo 1000000007.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nmod_phi = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1]\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        if '->' in line:\n            queries.append(line)\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    length_exp = [0] * 10\n    \n    for d in range(10):\n        val[d] = d % mod\n        length_exp[d] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        parts = queries[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        digit_char = parts[0].strip()\n        if digit_char not in '0123456789':\n            continue\n        d = int(digit_char)\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        \n        total_val = 0\n        total_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            c_digit = int(char)\n            v = val[c_digit]\n            l_val = length_exp[c_digit]\n            total_val = (total_val * pow(10, l_val, mod) + v) % mod\n            total_len = (total_len + l_val) % mod_phi\n        \n        val[d] = total_val\n        length_exp[d] = total_len\n    \n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d = int(char)\n        l_val = length_exp[d]\n        v = val[d]\n        result = (result * pow(10, l_val, mod) + v) % mod\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from input. Each query is parsed into a digit and its replacement string.\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: Starting from the last query to the first, each digit's value and length are updated based on its replacement string. The replacement string's value and length are computed by combining the current mappings of its constituent digits.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The value of the replacement string is computed by iteratively applying the current value and length of each digit in the string, using modular exponentiation to handle large numbers efficiently. The length is tracked modulo 1000000006 to leverage Euler's theorem for efficient power calculations.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The initial string is processed digit by digit, using the precomputed mappings to build the final number modulo 1000000007. Each digit's contribution is calculated by shifting the current result left by its expansion length and adding its value, all under modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially massive intermediate strings by focusing on the mathematical properties of modular arithmetic and dynamic updates of digit mappings, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
