They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge (u, v) gives two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n Conditions for an edge (a, b):\n   Let x = gcd, y = lcm.\n   Then, we must have:\n      x * y = a * b   (because gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a*b)\n   Also, we must have x divides both a and b, and y is divisible by x.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check consistency per edge: \n      For each edge (u, v, g, l):\n        - If g * l does not equal u * v (where u and v are the unknown numbers on the nodes), then we cannot assign? But wait, we don't know u and v yet.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to recover the entire assignment uniquely, but any one if exists.\n\n 2. We can think of it as: for each node i, let the number be A_i.\n    Then, for every edge (i, j) with gcd = g, lcm = l, we must have:\n        g | A_i and g | A_j, and \n        A_i * A_j = g * l.\n\n    Moreover, since A_i and A_j must be multiples of g, we can write:\n        A_i = g * a, A_j = g * b, then the equation becomes: g^2 * a * b = g * l  => g * a * b = l.\n\n    So, we can set up a system of equations for each connected component.\n\n 3. But note: the entire graph might not be connected. We must solve for each connected component independently.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's denote by A[i] the number of mushrooms at node i.\n\n For each edge (u, v, g, l):\n   We know that A[u] and A[v] must be multiples of g, and also A[u] * A[v] = g * l.\n\n However, the problem is that the same node may appear in multiple edges and we have to satisfy all conditions.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   Since the product A[u]*A[v] = g*l, and the gcd is g, then we can factorize the numbers.\n\n   But note: the constraints say that g, l can be up to 10^6, and n, m up to ... (the problem says n, m without upper bound, but typically we assume standard competitive programming limits).\n\n   We can do:\n\n     For each connected component, we want to assign A[i] for each node i.\n\n   Idea from known problems (like restoring the original numbers from GCD and LCM on edges):\n\n     We can use the following: \n        For an edge (u, v) with gcd=g and lcm=l, the numbers A[u] and A[v] must be divisors of l, and they must be multiples of g, and their product must be g*l.\n\n     However, we can also use the fact that the gcd of the entire connected component must be consistent.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Check the condition for each edge: \n        Let the edge (u, v, g, l). Then, we must have that g divides l (because g divides A[u] and A[v], so divides A[u]*A[v] = g*l, but more importantly, since g is the gcd, we have that g divides l). \n        Actually, we have: \n            Condition 1: g * l == A[u] * A[v] (which we don't know A[u] and A[v] yet, but we will use the entire system)\n            Condition 2: g divides l? Not necessarily, but note: because g divides A[u] and A[v], then g divides any linear combination. In particular, since A[u] * A[v] = g * l, then g divides l? \n\n        Actually, no: Consider if A[u] = 4, A[v] = 6, then g = 2, l = 12, and 2 divides 12. But what if we have A[u]=4, A[v]=9? Then g=1, l=36. Then 1 divides 36. \n\n        However, consider: if we have two numbers a and b, then the gcd is g and lcm is l. Then we know that a = g * a', b = g * b', and then a' and b' are coprime. Then the product a*b = g^2 * a'*b' = g * l => g * a'*b' = l. So l must be divisible by g.\n\n        Therefore, necessary condition: g divides l.\n\n   Step 2: For each edge, we can also check: if g * l is not an integer? (but they are integers) and also that g",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (vertex) in a forest map based on given roads (edges) that provide the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. The solution involves verifying the consistency of the given GCD and LCM values for each edge and then solving for the mushroom counts using these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Construction**: Read the input to construct a graph where each node represents a lawn and each edge represents a road with associated GCD and LCM values.\n2. **Edge Validation**: For each edge, ensure that the product of the GCD and LCM equals the product of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. Additionally, verify that the GCD divides the LCM, which is a necessary condition for the existence of such mushroom counts.\n3. **Component-wise Processing**: Process each connected component of the graph separately. For each node in a connected component, use the constraints from adjacent edges to determine possible mushroom counts. Specifically, for each edge, the mushroom counts must be multiples of the GCD and their product must equal the product of the GCD and LCM.\n4. **Backtracking Solution**: Use a backtracking approach to assign mushroom counts to nodes within a connected component, ensuring all edge constraints are satisfied. This involves checking all possible divisors of the LCM adjusted by the GCD to find valid assignments.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict,

**Graph Construction**: The input is read and parsed into a graph structure where each node (lawn) is connected to others via edges (roads) with associated GCD and LCM values.\n2. **Edge Validation**: For each edge, the solution checks if the GCD divides the LCM. If not, the arrangement is impossible, and \"NO\" is printed.\n3. **Component Processing**: The graph is divided into connected components. Each component is processed separately to avoid cross-component constraints.\n4. **Backtracking and Assignment**: For each node in a component, the solution uses backtracking to assign mushroom counts. It checks all possible divisors of the LCM adjusted by the GCD to find valid assignments that satisfy all edge constraints.\n5. **Final Check**: After assigning values to all nodes in a component, the solution verifies that all edge constraints (GCD and LCM conditions) are met. If any constraint is violated, \"NO\" is printed; otherwise, \"YES\" is printed along with the assigned mushroom counts for each lawn.",
