    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n The border (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is a x b (with a>=3 and b>=3, because we have borders), then the border consists of:\n     top row: a cells\n     bottom row: a cells\n     left and right columns, but minus the two corners (since they are already counted in the top and bottom) so 2*(b-2) for the middle part.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   total cells in the border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are shared in the two rows and two columns]\n\n But wait, let's break it down:\n   Actually, the border of an a x b grid is:\n     top: a\n     bottom: a\n     left: b-2 (excluding the top and bottom of the same column)\n     right: b-2\n\n   So total = a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that the problem says the first ring is for the entire plate. Then the first ring is for the original w x h.\n\n But wait: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8. Let's compute for the first ring (k=1) on a 3x3:\n   Using the formula: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n Example: \"7 9 1\"\n   w=7, h=9, k=1: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 -4 = 30? But expected output is 28.\n\n Wait! Let me reexamine the example: \"7 9 1\" gives 28.\n\n Why 28? \n\n Alternate way: \n   The ring is the border of the 7x9 grid. But note: the grid is 7x9, so:\n\n   Top and bottom rows: each has 9 cells? But wait, no: the entire outer ring of a 7x9 grid:\n\n   Top: 9 cells, bottom: 9 cells, then the sides: the remaining rows (from row1 to row5) have 7, but we must subtract the two ends that are already counted by top and bottom? Actually, no:\n\n   Actually, the standard way to compute the perimeter of a rectangle (without overlapping) is:\n     top and bottom: 2 * (width) \n     sides: 2 * (height - 2)\n\n   So for 7x9: \n        top and bottom: 2 * 9 = 18\n        sides: 2 * (7-2) = 2*5 = 10\n        total = 18+10 = 28.\n\n   So the formula is: 2*(width + height - 2) doesn't match.\n\n   Let me derive again:\n\n   The border of a grid of size a x b (a rows, b columns) is:\n     top row: b cells\n     bottom row: b cells\n     for the two columns in between: (a-2) rows, and each of these two columns has (a-2) cells? No, actually we don't count the corners twice.\n\n   Alternatively, think of it as the total cells in the border is the same as the outer rectangle.\n\n   But note: the problem says the ring has width 1 cell. So the entire outer layer is the border.\n\n   We can also calculate as: \n        total = (a * b) - ((a-2)*(b-2))\n\n   For 3x3: 3*3 - (1*1) = 9-1 = 8 -> correct.\n\n   For 7x9: 7*9 - (5*7) = 63 - 35 = 28 -> correct.\n\n   So the formula for the i-th ring (with the current rectangle being (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))) is:\n\n        area_i = (w_i * h_i) - ((w_i - 2) * (h_i - 2))\n\n   But note: we cannot use this if the inner rectangle becomes too small? Actually, the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Since we are subtracting 4*(i-1) from both w and h, and then taking the border, we need to make sure that the inner rectangle remains at least 3x3 (otherwise the border would be negative or zero). But the constraints say k is chosen such that we don't go beyond.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simplify the expression:\n\n        area_i = w_i * h_i - (w_i-2)*(h_i-2)\n                = w_i*h_i - [w_i*h_i - 2*w_i - 2*h_i + 4]\n                = 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n   So both formulas are equivalent.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n   Therefore, for the i-th ring (i from 1 to k), the number of cells is:\n\n        w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        cells_i = 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n   But wait: what if the inner rectangle is not big enough? The problem states k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we don't have to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n   Now, the total gilded cells is the sum for i=1 to k of cells_i.\n\n   However, note: the rings are drawn without overlapping? Actually, the problem says the first ring is the outermost, then the next one is 2 cells away, etc. So we are only adding the borders of these nested rectangles.\n\n   But note: the rings do not overlap because the next ring is inside the previous one. And the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, then the second one 2 cells away (so the second ring is entirely within the first).\n\n   Therefore, the total gilded cells is the sum from i=1 to k of (2*(w_i) + 2*(h_i) - 4), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1).\n\n   Example: \"7 9 2\"\n\n   k=2:\n\n   i=1: w1=7, h1=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28\n   i=2: w2=7-4=3, h2=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12\n   Total = 28+12=40 -> which matches the example.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n   Read w, h, k from stdin.\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # But note: if at some i, the inner rectangle becomes too small (like less than 3 in either dimension) then we might get negative? But the constraint on k ensures we stop when the inner rectangle is still valid (at least 3x3? Actually, the condition is floor((min(n,m)+1)/4) so the maximum i is such that w_i >= 3 and h_i >= 3? Not exactly: the inner rectangle for the i-th ring must have positive border, meaning w_i>=3 and h_i>=3.\n\n   However, the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Let's check:\n\n        min(w,h) = m, then k_max = floor((m+1)/4)\n\n        After k_max rings, the inner rectangle will be:\n\n            w_k = w - 4*(k_max-1)\n            h_k = h - 4*(k_max-1)\n\n        And since k_max is the maximum, we are guaranteed that the inner rectangle for the k_max-th ring is at least 3x3? Actually, let's see:\n\n        Condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n        Then for the last ring (k-th ring):\n\n            w_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)-1)\n\n        But note: the minimal value for min(w,h) is 3 (given w,h>=3). \n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, then k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1.\n\n        Then the first ring: w1=3, h1=3 -> valid.\n\n        Another: w=7, h=9: k_max = floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> valid.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, and k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So we can safely compute.\n\n   But wait: what if w and h are different? For example, w=5, h=100. Then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then we only do one ring.\n\n   So code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # i from 0 to k-1, then the ring index is i+1\n            w_i = w - 4*i\n            h_i = h - 4*i\n            # But wait: in the problem, the i-th ring uses 4*(i-1) subtraction. In our loop, i is 0-indexed for the first ring (i=0) then we subtract 0, which is correct for the first ring.\n            # Actually, the problem says the first ring (i=1) subtracts 0, so we should subtract 4*(i) for the (i+1)-th ring? \n\n            Let me clarify: \n                For the first ring (i=1): subtract 4*(1-1)=0 -> correct.\n                For the second ring (i=2): subtract 4*(2-1)=4 -> correct.\n\n            In our loop, if we let i run from 0 to k-1, then for the j-th ring (j = i+1) we subtract 4*(j-1) = 4*i.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            for i in range(k):\n                w_i = w - 4*i\n                h_i = h - 4*i\n                total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n   However, wait: the example for \"7 9 2\": \n        i=0: w_i=7, h_i=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 28\n        i=1: w_i=7-4=3, h_i=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 12, total=40 -> correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. The first ring is the outermost, then the second ring is two cells inwards. The reduction is 4 per ring (since moving inwards by 2 cells in both directions reduces the width and height by 4).\n\n   However, there is a catch: the problem says the rings are drawn from the edge and then 2 cells away, so the reduction is 4*(i) for the i-th ring (if we count from 0). But wait, the first ring (i=0) doesn't reduce? Actually, the first ring uses the entire plate. The second ring is 2 cells away, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            w_i = w - 4*i\n            h_i = h - 4*i\n            # Check: if w_i < 3 or h_i < 3, then the ring wouldn't form a border? But the constraint on k ensures we don't go below 3. However, if k is too large, then we might have negative or zero, but the input k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So we are safe.\n\n            # Calculate the border for the current ring\n            # The border is the entire current rectangle minus the inner rectangle (if any) but we are only taking the outer border of the current rectangle (which is the ring).\n            # Alternatively, we can use the formula: 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n            # But note: what if w_i or h_i is 0 or negative? Then the formula might break. However, the constraint on k ensures that for the last ring, we have w_i>=3 and h_i>=3.\n\n            # However, let's check: if k_max = floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), then for the last ring (i=k-1) we have:\n            #   w_i = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(k_max-1) \n            #   and k_max = floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) => 4*k_max <= min(w,h)+1, so 4*(k_max-1) <= min(w,h)+1 - 4, but not necessarily that w_i>=3.\n\n            # Actually, consider: min(w,h)=5, then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then w_i = w-0, which is at least 3 (given w>=3). Then for k_max=1, we are done.\n\n            # But if min(w,h)=6, then k_max = floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1. Then w_i=w, h_i=h, which are at least 3.\n\n            # If min(w,h)=7, then k_max=floor((7+1)/4)=2. Then for i=1: w_i = w-4, h_i=h-4. Since w>=7, h>=7, then w_i>=3 and h_i>=3.\n\n            # So we are safe.\n\n            total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, what if the reduction makes the rectangle have negative dimensions? The constraint ensures k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   However, let's test with w=3, h=3, k=1: \n        i=0: w_i=3, h_i=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n   Another: w=4, h=4, k_max = floor((4+1)/4)=1. Then i=0: 2*4+2*4-4 = 8+8-4=12.\n\n   But wait: a 4x4 plate: the border is 4*4 - (2*2) = 16-4=12, correct.\n\n   However, note the problem says the plate is at least 3x3. So 4x4 is allowed.\n\n   But what if the inner rectangle becomes 1x1? Then the border formula would be 2*1+2*1-4 = 2+2-4=0, but that's acceptable because we break by k constraint.\n\n   However, note: the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For w=4, h=4: \n        min(w,h)=4 -> floor((4+1)/4)=1, so k=1 is allowed, and we don't subtract 4 for the next ring.\n\n   But if we have w=5, h=5, then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1, so we don't attempt to draw the second ring.\n\n   What if we try to draw a second ring for w=5, h=5? Then the inner rectangle would be 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Then the border of a 1x1 is 1 (if we use the border formula: 2*1+2*1-4=-0? Actually, 2+2-4=0). That is, the border of a 1x1 is 0? But wait, the border of a 1x1 is the entire cell, which is 1 cell. \n\n   However, the problem's definition: \"the i-th ring should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1))\".\n\n   For a 1x1 rectangle, does it have a border? The border is the outer layer. A 1x1 has one cell, so the border is that one cell. But according to our formula: 2*1+2*1-4 = 0, which is incorrect.\n\n   Therefore, we must adjust the formula to account for the fact that the border is only defined for rectangles of at least 3x3? Actually, the problem says the first ring is the edge, and the next one is 2 cells away. The second ring is drawn only if the inner rectangle is at least 3x3? \n\n   But the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For a 5x5, min(w,h)=5, so k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. So we are not allowed to draw the second ring. \n\n   However, the issue is that the problem's constraint on k ensures that we don't go below 3x3 for the inner rectangle. But wait, the constraint is defined as:\n\n        k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1)/4)\n\n   For a 5x5: min(n,m)=5, then floor((5+1)/4)=1. So k=1 is the maximum.\n\n   But what if we have w=5, h=5, and k=1? Then we use the entire 5x5.\n\n   How about w=6, h=6? Then k_max = floor((6+1)/4)=1 (since 7//4=1). But wait, 6//4=1.5, but we take floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1.\n\n   However, we could draw two rings: \n        First ring: 6x6 -> border: 2*6+2*6-4=20\n        Second ring: inner rectangle is 6-4=2, then 2x2. The border of a 2x2: by the problem's definition, is the entire border of the 2x2. But the problem says the ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. For a 2x2, the border is the entire 2x2? Actually, the border of a 2x2 is 4 cells (each side is 2, but then subtract 4? 2*2+2*2-4=8-4=4). But wait, the formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 for 2x2: 4+4-4=4. But is that correct? \n\n   However, the problem says the first ring is the edge, and the second ring is 2 cells away. For a 6x6 plate, the second ring would start at row 1 and column 1 (if we index from 0) and then the inner rectangle is 2x2 (rows 1 to 2, columns 1 to 2). Then the border of that 2x2 is indeed the entire 2x2? But the problem says \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\". \n\n   But note: the problem says the ring has a width of 1 cell. In the first ring, the ring is the outermost 1 cell. In the second ring, we are now considering a 2x2 inner rectangle, and then the border of that 2x2 is the entire 2x2. However, the problem says \"the i-th of these rings should go along the edge of the inner rectangle\", meaning the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. \n\n   But wait, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. The first ring is the outermost, so the second ring is the next one inwards. The second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is 2 cells in from the original edge. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify that the inner rectangle must be at least 3x3. It only specifies k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   But in the example, for 6x6: min(w,h)=6, so k_max = floor((6+1)/4)=1. So we are not allowed to have k=2.\n\n   So the constraint on k prevents us from having a second ring for 6x6.\n\n   Now, what if we have a 7x7? Then k_max = floor((7+1)/4)=2. Then we can have two rings.\n\n   But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" was okay.\n\n   Therefore, the formula holds for the given k (as long as the inner rectangle is non-negative, and the constraint ensures we don't go below the minimum required for a border? Actually, the constraint is defined to prevent the inner rectangle from becoming too small. However, note the border formula works even for 2x2 and 1x1, but the problem restricts k so that we don't get to a point where the inner rectangle is invalid for having a border? \n\n   The problem does not explicitly say the border must be at least 3x3, but the constraint on k is given to ensure we don't have negative dimensions or zero. \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", and the plate is at least 3x3. The constraint on k is defined as floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   Let me check the constraint for a 3x3: \n        k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> correct.\n\n   For a 4x4: \n        k_max = floor((4+1)/4)=1 -> correct.\n\n   For a 5x5: \n        k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1.\n\n   For a 6x6: \n        k_max = floor((6+1)/4)=1.\n\n   For a 7x7: \n        k_max = floor((7+1)/4)=2.\n\n   For a 8x8: \n        k_max = floor((8+1)/4)=floor(9/4)=2.\n\n   For a 9x9: \n        k_max = floor((9+1)/4)=floor(10/4)=2.\n\n   For a 10x10: \n        k_max = floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2.\n\n   For a 11x11: \n        k_max = floor((11+1)/4)=3.\n\n   Now, for the second ring in a 7x7: \n        First ring: 7x7 -> border: 2*7+2*7-4=28\n        Second ring: inner rectangle is 7-4=3, so 3x3 -> border: 2*3+2*3-4=8, total=36.\n\n   But wait, the border of the entire 7x7 is 28, then the border of the 3x3 is 8, so total 36.\n\n   However, note: the second ring is the border of the 3x3 inner rectangle. But the 3x3 inner rectangle is in the center. The first ring covers the outermost layer, the second ring covers the next layer (which is 3x3). \n\n   But wait: the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. In a 7x7, the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is 3x3. The border of a 3x3 is the entire 3x3? Actually, no: the border of a 3x3 is the outer layer of the 3x3, which is 8 cells (as in the first example). \n\n   So the calculation is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the rings are drawn without overlapping? Actually, the rings are drawn as the borders of the inner rectangles, so they don't overlap.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            w_i = w - 4*i\n            h_i = h - 4*i\n            # The border of the rectangle w_i x h_i is 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4, but only if w_i>=3 and h_i>=3? Actually, the problem's k constraint ensures that we don't go below the minimum, but our formula works for any positive w_i and h_i (though the problem doesn't require the ring to be drawn if the inner rectangle is too small, but the constraint on k prevents that).\n\n            # However, if w_i or h_i is less than 2, then the border might be negative? But the constraint ensures that the inner rectangle for the i-th ring is at least 3x3? Not exactly: the constraint is on the original w and h. \n\n            # Actually, the constraint is k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n            # Let m = min(w, h)\n            # Then after i rings, the inner rectangle has size (w-4*i) and (h-4*i). The minimal dimension of the inner rectangle is min(w-4*i, h-4*i) >= m - 4*i.\n\n            # Since i <= k-1 and k <= floor((m+1)/4) => i <= floor((m+1)/4)-1, then 4*i <= 4*(floor((m+1)/4)-1) <= m+1 - 4 (if we use the property of floor) but that doesn't guarantee the inner rectangle is at least 3.\n\n            # However, note: the constraint is defined as the maximum k, so we are guaranteed that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3? \n\n            # Actually, the constraint is k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Then for the k-th ring (i = k-1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n            #   w_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)-1) \n            #   and similarly for h.\n\n            # But note: the minimal dimension of the plate is m = min(w,h). Then the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has minimal dimension: m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*(floor((m+1)/4)-1)\n\n            # Since k is at most floor((m+1)/4), then k-1 is at most floor((m+1)/4)-1, and 4*(k-1) <= 4*(floor((m+1)/4)-1) <= m+1 - 4 (if we consider floor division properties) but let's do:\n\n            #   Let k0 = floor((m+1)/4)\n            #   Then 4*k0 <= m+1 + 3 (since floor(x) * divisor <= x + divisor-1) but we are subtracting 4*(k0-1) from m.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can rely on the fact that the problem input guarantees k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So we don't have to worry about negative or invalid dimensions.\n\n            total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, let's test with the example inputs:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> 8 (correct)\n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> 28 (correct)\n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> 40 (correct)\n\n   But wait, what if the reduction in one dimension is more than the other? \n\n   Example: w=10, h=5. Then k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then only one ring.\n\n        w_i=10, h_i=5 -> 2*10+2*5-4=20+10-4=26.\n\n   But the border of a 10x5 rectangle: \n        top and bottom: 5*2 = 10\n        sides: the left and right columns: 10-2 = 8, so 8*2=16\n        total=10+16=26 -> correct.\n\n   So the formula holds.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. Our formula uses w and h as the number of rows and columns. In the example above, we used 10 rows and 5 columns, which is a 10x5 grid. The border is calculated correctly.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            w_i = w - 4*i\n            h_i = h - 4*i\n            total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait: the problem says the rings are drawn from the edge and then 2 cells away. The reduction is 4 per ring (2 cells from the top and 2 cells from the bottom, or 2 from left and 2 from right). This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement says the i-th ring is defined by the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). In our code, for the first ring (i=0) we use (w-0) x (h-0). Then the second ring (i=1) we use (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n   But wait, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). This is correct.\n\n   However, the problem indexes the rings starting at 1, and we are using i from 0 to k-1. So the i-th iteration (0-indexed) corresponds to the (i+1)-th ring. The reduction is 4*i, which is 4*(i) = 4*(number of rings - 1) for the last ring? Actually, the first ring (i=0) uses 0, the second ring (i=1) uses 4, so yes.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the i-th ring (with i=1) is defined by (w-4*(1-1)) = w. So we are matching.\n\n   One more example: w=10, h=10, k=2.\n\n        First ring: i=0 -> 10x10: 2*10+2*10-4=40-4=36\n        Second ring: i=1 -> 10-4=6, 10-4=6: 2*6+2*6-4=24-4=20\n        Total=56.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the entire gilding: \n        The first ring: 36\n        The second ring: the border of a 6x6: 2*6+2*6-4=20, total 56.\n\n   The entire plate is 10x10=100, then the first ring takes the outer 36, leaving an inner 6x6 (which is 36) but then the second ring takes the border of the 6x6 (which is 20). The total is 56.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the rings are drawn without overlapping. The total gilded cells is the sum of the borders of these nested rectangles.\n\n   We output the total.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # But the problem says there is one line with three integers, so we assume there is at least one.\n            pass\n        else:\n            w = int(data[0])\n            h = int(data[1])\n            k = int(data[2])\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(k):\n                w_i = w - 4*i\n                h_i = h - 4*i\n                total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n            print(total)\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as a list of strings in the example, but the actual input is one line with three integers.\n\n   We can simply do:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            w_i = w - 4*i\n            h_i = h - 4*i\n            total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n        print(total)\n\n   This is the final code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is w x h, and we are subtracting 4*i from both w and h. But what if the plate is not square? As we saw, the formula works for non-square.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   But note: the problem says the first ring is the edge, so the entire outer border. Then the next ring is 2 cells away, so the next border. The reduction is symmetric in both dimensions.\n\n   We output the answer.\n\n   Let me test with the example \"3 3 1\": 8, \"7 9 1\":28, \"7 9 2\":40.\n\n   It passes.\n\n   However, wait: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n   But note: the problem says the input is one line with three integers. So the example input is three separate lines? Or one line?\n\n   The problem says: \"The only line contains three integers\"\n\n   So we read one line.\n\n   Therefore, we can read the entire line and split.\n\n   The example input is provided as a list of strings, but the actual input is one line.\n\n   We'll assume one line.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            w_cur = w - 4 * i\n            h_cur = h - 4 * i\n            # The border of the current rectangle is 2*(w_cur + h_cur) - 4\n            ans += 2 * (w_cur + h_cur) - 4\n        print(ans)\n\n   This is the same.\n\n   Let me run the sample tests.\n\n   Sample 1: 3 3 1 -> i=0: 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> 8.\n   Sample 2: 7 9 1 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 32-4=28 -> 28.\n   Sample 3: 7 9 2 -> \n        i=0: 2*(7+9)-4=28\n        i=1: 2*(3+5)-4=2*8-4=16-4=12; total=40.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   We are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, starting from the outer edge of the plate. The solution involves determining the dimensions of each ring and summing the cells in all rings up to the given number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is a rectangle of size \\( w \\times h \\). The first ring is the outer border of this rectangle. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one. The task is to compute the total number of cells covered by all \\( k \\) rings.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring \\( i \\) (0-indexed), the inner rectangle dimensions are \\( (w - 4i) \\times (h - 4i) \\). The number of cells in the border (ring) of this rectangle is given by \\( 2 \\times (width + height) - 4 \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 0 to \\( k-1 \\), compute the dimensions of the current ring's inner rectangle, and sum the cells in its border.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\( O(k) \\) time, which is efficient since \\( k \\) is constrained to be at most \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\nans = 0\nfor i in range(k):\n    w_cur = w - 4 * i\n    h_cur = h - 4 * i\n    ans += 2 * (w_cur + h_cur) - 4\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: \\( w \\) (width), \\( h \\) (height), and \\( k \\) (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring \\( i \\) (from 0 to \\( k-1 \\)):\n   - **Current Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring are calculated by reducing both width and height by \\( 4i \\) (since each ring moves 2 cells inward in both directions).\n   - **Border Calculation**: The number of cells in the border of the current inner rectangle is \\( 2 \\times (width + height) - 4 \\), accounting for all four sides minus the overlapping corners.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
