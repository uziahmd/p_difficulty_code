Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add a set of cards (each card between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] arbitrarily many times.\n\n 4. We are to find the minimum number of cards (nonnegative integer) such that there exists a sequence of k numbers (each in [-x, x]) that sums to -S.\n\n 5. Note: We can also consider that we might not have to use only positive or negative numbers.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let T = -S (the target sum we need to achieve with the additional cards)\n\n We want the smallest k (number of cards) such that:\n   There exist integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) satisfying:\n        a1 + a2 + ... + ak = T.\n\n Constraints on k:\n   - The maximum absolute value for each card is x, so the maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x, and the minimum (most negative) is -k*x.\n\n Conditions for existence for a given k:\n   (a) |T| <= k*x   (because the total sum cannot exceed k*x in absolute value if we use the extreme values)\n   (b) Additionally, note that the parity condition? Actually, we can use any integers, but note that the set of numbers is symmetric and consecutive.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require distinct numbers, and we have all integers from -x to x. But wait, the problem says \"each card has a single integer\" and \"the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value\", meaning we can choose any integer in the range.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose any integer in [-x, x] arbitrarily. Therefore, we can form any integer value as long as the absolute value is at most k*x and k is at least ceil(|T|/x). However, is that sufficient?\n\n Actually, consider:\n\n With k cards, the possible sums we can form are all integers in the range [-k*x, k*x] with the same parity as k*x? Not exactly.\n\n But note: we have both positive and negative numbers. Actually, we can form every integer in the interval [L, R] (where L = -k*x, R = k*x) if k>=1? \n\n However, let's think:\n\n With one card: we can form every integer in [-x, x]. So yes, we can form every integer in that interval.\n\n With two cards: we can form every integer from -2x to 2x? Actually, we can form every integer in the range [-2x, 2x] because we can use any two integers. For example, to form an odd number when x is even? Actually, no: if x is fixed, then the two integers can be chosen arbitrarily. The set of two integers from [-x,x] will produce all integers from -2x to 2x? \n\n But wait: the set of two integers from [-x,x] can produce any integer between -2x and 2x? \n\n Example: x=1, two cards: \n   We can form: \n     -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 -> actually all integers from -2 to 2.\n\n Example: x=2, two cards: \n   We can form: \n     Minimum: -4, maximum: 4.\n     Can we form 3? \n        Yes: 2+1 = 3, 1+2=3, etc.\n     How about 1? 0+1, but 0 is allowed? Actually, we don't have to use non-zero. But wait, the available numbers are from -2 to 2. So 1 is allowed.\n\n Actually, with two cards we can form every integer from -4 to 4.\n\n In fact, with k cards, we can form every integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] (because we can use the greedy method: we can adjust by 1 by using two consecutive numbers if needed, but note: we have all integers from -x to x). \n\n However, wait: what if we want to form a very large gap? Actually, the set of numbers is contiguous and symmetric. The key is that the step size is 1 (since we have consecutive integers). Therefore, the set of achievable sums is contiguous.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So the set of sums we can form with k cards is exactly the set of integers in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n Why? \n   We can use the following: \n     Base: with k=1, we have [-x, x] which is contiguous.\n\n   Then, by induction: \n     Suppose with k cards we can form every integer in [-k*x, k*x]. Now, for k+1, we can take a sum s from [-k*x, k*x] and add any integer t from [-x, x], so the new sum is s+t, which gives us [-k*x-x, k*x+x] = [-(k+1)*x, (k+1)*x]. And since s runs over every integer in [-k*x, k*x] and t runs over every integer in [-x, x], the set of s+t is the entire interval [-(k+1)*x, (k+1)*x] because the step is 1.\n\n However, wait: the induction step requires that the set of s+t is contiguous. But note that the set of s is contiguous and the set of t is contiguous, and the sets are intervals, then the Minkowski sum of two intervals is contiguous.\n\n Therefore, the condition is: k must be at least ceil(|T| / x) and also the condition (a) above (|T|<=k*x) is necessary and sufficient.\n\n But note: we are to minimize k.\n\n So we can set:\n   k_min = ceil(|T| / x)   if |T|>0, and if T==0 then k_min=0.\n\n However, wait: what if T is 0? Then we don't need any additional cards.\n\n But wait: what if we have negative T? Then we need to form T (which is negative). The same condition: |T|<=k*x, so k >= ceil(|T|/x).\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the additional cards are positive or negative. We can mix.\n\n But note: there is a catch. What if T is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\n However, consider: what if the current sum is not zero? Then T is nonzero.\n\n But wait, the problem says: we can choose any cards (from -x to x) arbitrarily. So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n However, wait: is that always true?\n\n Example: T=1, x=2 -> then k_min = ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1. And indeed, we can use a card with 1 (if x>=1, which it is). \n\n Example: T=3, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. And indeed, we can use two cards: 2+1=3, or 1+2=3.\n\n Example: T=4, x=2 -> k_min=ceil(4/2)=2.\n\n Example: T=5, x=2 -> k_min=ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n However, wait: is there a possibility that we can form T with fewer cards by using negative numbers? \n\n No, because the absolute value condition: the maximum absolute value we can achieve with k cards is k*x, so we must have k*x >= |T|. And since we can form every integer in [-k*x, k*x], then k_min = ceil(|T|/x) is the minimal k.\n\n BUT: wait, what if T is negative? Then we need to form a negative T. The same condition: |T|<=k*x, so k_min = ceil(|T|/x) is still valid.\n\n However, wait: there is another consideration. The problem does not require that the cards we choose are positive or negative, but note: the set of numbers is symmetric and we can use negative and positive arbitrarily.\n\n However, there is a catch: what if the current set of found cards is empty? Then n=0, but the input n>=1 so we don't have to worry.\n\n But wait: the problem says n>=1.\n\n However, let me read the problem again: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x.\" and \"The second line contains n space-separated integers\".\n\n Therefore, our reasoning is: we need k_min = ceil(|T|/x) where T = -S (the current sum S, then T=-S).\n\n But wait: there is a sample input: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> current sum S = (-1+1+2)=2, then T=-2. |T|=2, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> output 1. Matches.\n\n   Another sample: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> current sum S=-4, then T=4. |T|=4, x=3 -> k_min = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> output 2. Matches.\n\n So why the second sample is 2? Because we cannot form 4 with one card (max is 3). \n\n However, wait: what if we use two cards? 3+1=4, which is allowed (since 1 is in [-3,3] and 3 is in [-3,3]). So two cards.\n\n But wait, the sample output is 2.\n\n So the algorithm is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and x.\n   Step 2: Read the list of n integers.\n   Step 3: Compute S = sum(list)\n   Step 4: T = -S   (the target for the additional cards)\n\n   If T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   Else:\n        Let absT = abs(T)\n        Then, we need the smallest integer k such that k*x >= absT.\n\n        k_min = ceil(absT / x)\n\n        However, note: if absT % x == 0, then k_min = absT // x, else k_min = absT // x + 1.\n\n        But wait: ceil(a) for a real number a is the smallest integer >= a.\n\n        We can compute: k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x   [this is integer ceiling division]\n\n        However, wait: what if absT==0? Then we skip because T==0.\n\n        But note: if T is negative, we use absT.\n\n        Example: absT=3, x=2: (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Example: absT=4, x=2: (4+2-1)//2 = (5)//2 = 2 (in integer floor division, but wait: (5)//2 is 2, but we want 2 for 4/2=2, so that works.\n\n        But wait: the formula (absT + x - 1) // x is standard for ceiling division.\n\n        However, note: if absT is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (if x>=1) which is correct.\n\n        But we already handled T==0, so we don't need to handle 0 here.\n\n        But wait: what if T is negative? Then absT is positive.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n\n        However, wait: is this always the minimal k?\n\n        But wait: we assumed that the set of sums for k cards is [-k*x, k*x] (all integers). That means if k*x >= absT, then we can form T. Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= absT, which is k_min = ceil(|T|/x).\n\n        However, wait: what if T is not an integer? But T is an integer because S is the sum of integers, so T=-S is integer.\n\n        So the answer is k_min.\n\n But wait, consider the following: \n\n        Input: n=1, x=3, found card: [1] -> S=1, T=-1, absT=1 -> k_min = ceil(1/3)=1. Correct.\n\n        Input: n=1, x=3, found card: [2] -> S=2, T=-2, absT=2 -> k_min = ceil(2/3)=1. But wait, can we form -2 with one card? The available cards are from -3 to 3, so yes, we can use the card -2. So that's correct.\n\n        Input: n=1, x=3, found card: [3] -> S=3, T=-3, absT=3 -> k_min = ceil(3/3)=1. Correct.\n\n        Input: n=1, x=3, found card: [4] -> wait, but the problem says \"It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value\", so we won't get 4 when x=3.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total = sum(cards)\n            T = -total\n            if T == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                absT = abs(T)\n                # k_min is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= absT\n                # k_min = ceil(absT / x)\n                # Using integer arithmetic: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b, for positive integers a, b.\n                k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n                print(k_min)\n\n However, wait: is that really the minimal k?\n\n Consider: T=1, x=1 -> k_min = (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=0? Then we skip and print 0.\n\n However, wait: what if the current set of cards already sums to 0? Then T=0, so we print 0.\n\n But wait: is there a case where we might need more than k_min cards? \n\n Let me think: we have shown that with k_min cards we can form any integer in the range [-k_min*x, k_min*x]. Since |T| <= k_min*x (by definition of ceiling), then T is in that range, so we can form T.\n\n Therefore, k_min is the answer.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. And we are allowed to use any card arbitrarily. So the above reasoning holds.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and we have established that k_min is the minimum.\n\n However, wait: what if the current set of cards is [1,1,1] and x=1. Then total=3, T=-3. k_min = ceil(3/1)=3. But can we form -3 with 3 cards? Yes: three cards of -1. So that's correct.\n\n But wait: what if the current set of cards is [2,2,2] and x=2. Then total=6, T=-6. k_min = ceil(6/2)=ceil(3)=3. And indeed, three cards of -2.\n\n However, wait: what if the current set of cards is [1,1,1] and x=2. Then total=3, T=-3. Now, with k_min = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. But can we form -3 with two cards? Each card can be from -2 to 2. The minimum sum with two cards is -4, so we can form -3? Yes: for example, -2 and -1.\n\n So the minimal k is 2, which matches.\n\n Therefore, the program is:\n\n   Read n and x.\n   Read the list of n integers.\n   total = sum(list)\n   T = -total\n   if T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        absT = abs(T)\n        k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n However, wait: let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n   n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2]\n   total = -1+1+2 = 2\n   T = -2, absT=2\n   k_min = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (since 3//2 in integer division is 1) -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2]\n   total = -4\n   T = 4, absT=4\n   k_min = (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if the current set of cards is [0]?\n   Then total=0, T=0 -> prints 0. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if the current set of cards is [0,0]?\n   Then total=0, T=0 -> prints 0. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if the current set of cards is [1, -1, 2, -2] (so total=0)? Then T=0 -> 0.\n\n However, consider: what if we have [1,1] and x=2. Then total=2, T=-2. \n   k_min = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. But wait: can we form -2 with one card? Yes, because -2 is in [-2,2]. So that's correct.\n\n But wait: what if we have [1,1,1,1] and x=3. Then total=4, T=-4. \n   k_min = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. \n   With two cards, the minimum we can get is -6, so we can form -4? \n        We need two numbers that sum to -4. The minimum two negative numbers: -3 and -3 gives -6, but we can do -3 and -1 -> -4. So yes.\n\n Therefore, the code should be:\n\n However, wait: I just realized that the above formula (absT + x - 1) // x is the ceiling of absT/x.\n\n But note: if absT is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (for x>=1). So if T=0, we could avoid the if by:\n\n   k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n\n   and then if T==0, we would get 0, but wait: if T=0, then absT=0, then k_min=0. So we don't need the if.\n\n   But wait: what if T is negative? Then absT is positive, so same.\n\n   So we can simply do:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        T = -total\n        absT = abs(T)\n        k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n   But wait: what if T is negative? Then absT is positive. And we are forming a negative T? Actually, the formula uses absolute value, so it doesn't matter.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for forming T is that |T| <= k*x. But note: if T is negative, then we need to form a negative number, but the set of sums is symmetric, so the condition is the same.\n\n   But wait: the formula (absT+x-1)//x is the same for positive and negative T.\n\n   Therefore, we can remove the if.\n\n   Let me test with T=0: \n        absT=0, k_min = (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (for x>=1). Correct.\n\n   So the code simplifies.\n\n However, wait: what if T is negative and absT is not divisible by x? Example: T=-5, x=3 -> absT=5, then k_min = (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3 is 2 in integer division). But wait, is that correct?\n\n        We need to form -5. The maximum absolute value we can get with k=2 is 6 (but we can form any integer from -6 to 6). So we can form -5. So k_min=2 is correct.\n\n   But wait: the minimal k is the smallest k such that k*x >= absT. For absT=5 and x=3, k_min= ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        # We want to form t, and the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs(t)\n        # But note: if t is 0, then k=0.\n        # We can use: k_min = ceil(|t|/x) = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x   [if abs(t)>0, but if abs(t)==0 then also 0]\n\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        if abs_t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Ceiling division for positive integers: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            print(k_min)\n\n   But wait, we can combine without the if:\n\n        k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x   if abs_t != 0, and if abs_t==0 then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1). So we can write without the if.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the numbers on the found cards are integers and n>=1, but the total can be zero.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n But wait: let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n   Example 2: n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs_t=4 -> (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n   Example 3: n=0? But n>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n   Example 4: n=1, x=1, arr=[0] -> s=0, t=0, abs_t=0 -> (0+1-1)//1=0//1=0 -> prints 0. Correct.\n\n   Example 5: n=1, x=1, arr=[1] -> s=1, t=-1, abs_t=1 -> (1+1-1)//1=1//1=1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n   Example 6: n=1, x=1, arr=[-1] -> s=-1, t=1, abs_t=1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n   Example 7: n=2, x=1, arr=[1,1] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> (2+1-1)//1=2//1=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n   Example 8: n=2, x=2, arr=[1,1] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> (2+2-1)//2=3//2=1 (in Python, 3//2 is 1) -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n   Example 9: n=3, x=3, arr=[1,1,1] -> s=3, t=-3, abs_t=3 -> (3+3-1)//3=5//3=1 (since 5//3 is 1 in integer division). But wait: ceil(3/3)=ceil(1)=1. Correct.\n\n   Example 10: n=3, x=3, arr=[2,2,2] -> s=6, t=-6, abs_t=6 -> (6+3-1)//3=8//3=2 (since 8//3=2 in integer division). But wait, ceil(6/3)=ceil(2)=2. Correct.\n\n   Example 11: n=3, x=3, arr=[3,3,3] -> s=9, t=-9, abs_t=9 -> (9+3-1)//3=11//3=3 (since 11//3=3). But wait: ceil(9/3)=3. Correct.\n\n   Example 12: n=3, x=3, arr=[1,2,3] -> s=6, t=-6, same as above.\n\n   Example 13: n=3, x=3, arr=[1,2,4] -> wait, but the input guarantee: numbers do not exceed x in absolute value. So if x=3, we won't get 4.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        # Since the ceiling division for positive integers is (abs_t + x - 1) // x, and when abs_t is 0 we get 0, we can use:\n        k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n However, wait: what if abs_t is not divisible by x? We are using integer floor division for ceiling by adding (x-1). This is standard.\n\n But wait: what if abs_t is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if x=0? The problem states x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Therefore, we can submit this code.\n\n However, wait: there is a known issue with negative numbers? But we use absolute value, so no.\n\n But wait: what if T is negative and we use absolute value? Then we are forming the absolute value, but the set of sums is symmetric, so we can form negative T as well.\n\n One more corner: what if T is negative and very large? Our calculation uses absolute value, so it's safe.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the found cards are n integers (n>=1) and x>=1, and the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n However, wait: I just thought of a different perspective.\n\n   We can also consider that we can use negative and positive cards arbitrarily. But note: the minimal k is determined by the absolute value requirement.\n\n   But wait, what if we are required to use only the available moves (from -x to x) and we can use any combination, then the minimal k is the minimal integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   And that is exactly what we computed.\n\n But wait: what if T is positive? Then we need to form a positive T. The same condition: |T|<=k*x, so k_min = ceil(|T|/x) is the minimal k.\n\n So the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n But wait: wait a minute, let me check the sample input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" again: \n        n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> k_min=(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1 -> correct.\n\n But wait: in the example, the answer is 1.\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative solution that considers the possibility that we might need to adjust the existing set? \n\n But note: the problem does not say we can change the existing set. We can only add cards.\n\n So the reasoning is correct.\n\n However, wait: I recall that in some problems, sometimes the minimal k is not just based on the absolute value because of the parity? \n\n But in this problem, the set of numbers is symmetric and we have all integers from -x to x, so we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. There is no parity restriction.\n\n Therefore, the answer is k_min = ceil(|T|/x).\n\n But wait: wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n Let me think: what if we have to form a very large T? \n\n   Example: T=5, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(5/2)=3. With three cards, the maximum positive sum is 6, so we can form 5? \n        We can use 2, 2, 1 -> 5. So yes.\n\n   Example: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. With two cards, maximum is 6, so we can form 5? \n        We can use 3 and 2 -> 5. So yes.\n\n   Example: T=5, x=1 -> ceil(5/1)=5. With five cards, we can use five ones.\n\n   Example: T=5, x=4 -> ceil(5/4)=2. With two cards, maximum 8, and we can form 5: 4+1=5, so yes.\n\n   Example: T=5, x=0 -> but x>=1, so no.\n\n   Example: T=0, x=any -> 0.\n\n   Example: T=1, x=1000 -> ceil(1/1000)=1.\n\n   Example: T=1000, x=1 -> ceil(1000/1)=1000.\n\n   Example: T=1000, x=2 -> ceil(1000/2)=500.\n\n   Example: T=1001, x=2 -> ceil(1001/2)=501.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n   There is a known issue: the formula (abs_t + x - 1) // x is the ceiling division only for positive integers. But abs_t is nonnegative and x is positive, so it's okay.\n\n   However, wait: what if x is 0? The problem says x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Therefore, the final code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n But wait, I just saw: the example \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" is provided and the expected output is 2. Our code outputs 2.\n\n However, wait: wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n   What if T is negative? Example: T=-3, x=2 -> then abs_t=3, k_min=(3+2-1)//2=4//2=2. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if T=-1, x=2? Then k_min=(1+2-1)//2=2//2=1. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if T=-4, x=3? Then abs_t=4, k_min=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2. Correct.\n\n   And we can form -4 with two cards: for example, -3 and -1.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n   I just found a flaw.\n\n   What if T is negative and we are trying to form a negative number? The condition is that the absolute value of T must be <= k*x. But note: the cards we choose can be negative, so the sum of k cards can be negative.\n\n   The set of sums we can form with k cards is [-k*x, k*x]. So the condition is |T| <= k*x, and we are taking the minimal k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait, wait a minute: the problem says that the numbers on the found cards are given, and we are to add the minimum number of cards (from the infinite set) to make the total sum zero.\n\n   We have computed k_min = ceil(|T|/x) where T is the negative of the current sum.\n\n   This is the minimal k.\n\n   So we output k_min.\n\n However, wait: wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n   I see the problem: the problem says the initial set of cards had *each* integer from -x to x. But note: the found cards are n of them. The problem does not say that the found cards are distinct or anything. And we are allowed to choose any card from -x to x arbitrarily.\n\n   Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n   Let me run the code on the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> outputs 1. Correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> outputs 2. Correct.\n\n   But wait, the problem example input format was given as:\n\n        ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n   So we are reading from stdin.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        # But the first line has two integers, the second line has n integers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n        n = int(data[0])\n        x = int(data[1])\n        arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n   However, the problem says the first line has two integers and the second line has n integers. So we can also do:\n\n        line1 = input().split()\n        n = int(line1[0])\n        x = int(line1[1])\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   Since the second line has exactly n integers.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The second line contains n space-separated integers\"\n\n   So we can safely do:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k_min)\n\n But wait: wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n   There is one more issue: what if the current set of cards already has a sum that is zero? Then t=0, and we print 0. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the current set of cards has a sum that is not zero, but we can achieve the target with fewer cards by using a combination that is not just the minimal absolute value? \n\n   Example: T=3, x=2 -> k_min=ceil(3/2)=2. Correct.\n\n   But wait: is there a possibility that we can achieve T=3 with one card? No, because the maximum card is 2, so one card can only give 2 at most. Therefore, two cards is minimal.\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his found cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the numbers on the additional cards must be exactly the negation of the current sum of the found cards. The minimal number of cards required to achieve this sum depends on the absolute value of the target sum (T) and the maximum absolute value (x) allowed on any card.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards (k) needed is the smallest integer such that k*x is at least the absolute value of T. This is derived from the fact that with k cards, each having a maximum absolute value of x, the maximum absolute sum achievable is k*x. Hence, k must satisfy k*x ≥ |T|.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum (T) by x. This gives the minimal number of cards required. The ceiling operation ensures we round up any fractional part resulting from the division.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves reading the input values, computing the sum of the found cards, and performing a simple arithmetic operation (division and ceiling). The time complexity is O(n) due to the sum calculation, where n is the number of found cards. The space complexity is O(n) to store the input values, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    t = -s\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k_min = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k_min)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value (x) of any card. The subsequent values are the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers on the found cards is computed. The target sum (t) is the negation of this sum, which needs to be achieved by adding new cards.\n3. **Absolute Value Handling**: The absolute value of the target sum (abs_t) is used to ensure the solution works for both positive and negative target sums.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards (k_min) is calculated using integer arithmetic to compute the ceiling of abs_t divided by x. This ensures that even if the division isn't exact, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n5. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance for the given constraints.",
