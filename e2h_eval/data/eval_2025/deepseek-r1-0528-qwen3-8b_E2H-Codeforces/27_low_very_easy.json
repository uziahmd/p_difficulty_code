On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is: We are given an array of 1s and 2s. We can reverse any contiguous interval (or not, if we choose [l, r] and reverse it). Then we want the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the resulting array.\n\nObservation:\nSince the sequence only contains 1s and 2s, the non-decreasing subsequence can be:\n  - All 1s (if there are k ones, then k is a candidate)\n  - All 2s (if there are m twos, then m is a candidate)\n  - Or a combination: some ones and then some twos (so the entire sequence might have a run of ones and then twos)\n\nBut note: after reversing a contiguous interval, we are allowed to change the order of a contiguous part. However, note that the reversal operation might merge ones and twos from left and right.\n\nLet's denote:\n  total_ones = total number of 1s in the entire array.\n  total_twos = n - total_ones.\n\nIn the best scenario, we would like to have as many consecutive ones at the beginning as possible and then as many consecutive twos as possible.\n\nWhat does reversing an interval do?\nWe can think about the entire array as being built by three parts:\n  Part A: The prefix (from start to l-1) remains unchanged.\n  Part B: The segment [l, r] is reversed.\n  Part C: The suffix (from r+1 to end) remains unchanged.\n\nHowever, note: the reversal operation might turn some ones into being adjacent to the next part (if the reversed segment has ones at the beginning and the next part (suffix) starts with ones, then they become adjacent and form a longer run).\n\nBut note: the reversal operation doesn't necessarily have to fix the entire array. We are free to choose any contiguous interval.\n\nAlternatively, note that the entire array is made of 1s and 2s. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. In fact, in a binary sequence, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (all 1s then all 2s). Otherwise, it is the maximum between the longest non-decreasing subsequence that uses both 1s and 2s (which would be the total number of 1s and 2s if the entire sequence is arranged in non-decreasing order) or just a run of ones or twos.\n\nActually, the entire sequence can be rearranged arbitrarily? No, we are only allowed one reversal. But note: one reversal can change the order of a contiguous part. However, we cannot rearrange arbitrary elements.\n\nBut note: the problem is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing one contiguous interval.\n\nImportant: The LNDS in the entire sequence (if we consider the entire array) is what we are trying to maximize. However, the entire array might not be non-decreasing, but we can try to make as much of the array as possible non-decreasing.\n\nWhat is the best we can achieve?\nWe can think: the ideal arrangement is having all the 1s first and then all the 2s. Then the entire sequence is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is n.\n\nBut we are only allowed one reversal. So we can only change the order of one contiguous segment. Therefore, we cannot necessarily get the entire sequence to be sorted. However, we can try to fix the \"out-of-order\" parts.\n\nBut note: the array is composed only of 1s and 2s. The only \"problem\" is when we have a 2 followed by a 1 (because then we break the non-decreasing order). So the goal is to minimize the number of 2s that appear before the 1s, or to arrange the array so that all the 1s come first and then the 2s.\n\nHow can one reversal help?\nWe can reverse an interval that contains some 1s and 2s. The reversal will change the order of these 1s and 2s.\n\nHowever, note that the reversal might also affect the boundaries (the parts that are not reversed). Specifically, the reversal might bring 1s to the front (if the reversed segment has 1s at the beginning) and push 2s to the end (if the reversed segment has 2s at the end). Also, the reversal might fix a block of 2s that are in the middle and then 1s that come later.\n\nBut note: we can also reverse an empty interval (i.e., do nothing) so the original array is always an option.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: by reversing one contiguous interval (possibly empty), what is the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to find the optimal interval to reverse, which will help in maximizing the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence can be the entire sequence if all 1s precede all 2s. Otherwise, it could be a combination of 1s followed by 2s, or just a run of 1s or 2s.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution is achieved when the sequence has as many 1s as possible at the beginning followed by all 2s. Reversing a specific interval can help in rearranging parts of the sequence to bring more 1s to the front and 2s to the back.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Total Ones and Twos**: Calculate the total number of 1s and 2s in the sequence.\n   - **Prefix and Suffix Handling**: Identify the longest prefix of 1s and the longest suffix of 2s. The goal is to maximize the combined length of these segments.\n   - **Middle Segment Consideration**: For the middle segment between the prefix and suffix, determine how reversing it can merge more 1s from the right into the left and vice versa for 2s.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently checks all possible intervals by leveraging prefix and suffix arrays, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for num in arr if num == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i - 1] + (1 if arr[i - 1] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i + 1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    best = max(total_ones, total_twos)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] != 1:\n            break\n        ones_from_right = prefix_ones[i]\n        twos_from_left = suffix_twos[i + 1]\n        candidate = ones_from_right + twos_from_left\n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] != 2:\n            break\n        twos_from_left = prefix_ones[i] == 0\n        ones_from_right = n - (suffix_twos[i + 1])\n        candidate = i + 1 + (n - i - 1)\n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Counting 1s and 2s**: It calculates the total number of 1s and 2s in the sequence.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: \n   - `prefix_ones` stores the cumulative count of 1s from the start up to each position.\n   - `suffix_twos` stores the cumulative count of 2s from each position to the end.\n4. **Initial Best Guess**: The initial best value is the maximum of the total 1s or 2s, representing the scenario where the sequence is entirely 1s or entirely 2s.\n5. **Prefix Processing**: The loop checks the longest prefix of 1s. For each position, it calculates the number of 1s to the right that can be merged into the prefix by reversing an interval, updating the best value if a better candidate is found.\n6. **Suffix Processing**: Similarly, the loop checks the longest suffix of 2s. It calculates how many 2s can be brought to the front by reversing an interval, again updating the best value if beneficial.\n7. **Output**: The maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after the optimal reversal is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking key segments of the sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of the problem.",
