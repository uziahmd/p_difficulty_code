Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row, the middle element is 's' but the diagonal requires 'x'. Also, the non-diagonal elements should be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read n.\n  2. Read the grid.\n\n  Let's define:\n    - The main diagonal: from top-left to bottom-right: [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n    - The anti-diagonal: [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n  Condition 1: All characters in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same. \n        Actually, they don't necessarily have to be the same between diagonals? But the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". \n        So the entire main diagonal must be one letter, say 'A', and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, which might be 'B'? \n\n  However, reading the problem statement: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" — meaning each diagonal is uniform, but the two diagonals can be different letters?\n\n  But wait, the example: \n        Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        This is \"YES\".\n\n        In this example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> but wait, not the same! Actually, no: the main diagonal must be the same. However, in the example:\n\n        Row0: w s w\n        Row1: s w s\n        Row2: w s w\n\n        Main diagonal: [w, w, w] -> okay, same letter 'w'\n        Anti-diagonal: [w, w, w] -> same letter 'w'\n\n        But wait, the example has the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, in the example the main diagonal is [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> yes, same.\n        Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> same.\n\n        Now, the non-diagonal elements: \n            [0][1] = 's', [1][0]='s', [1][2]='s', [2][1]='s'\n        They are all 's' and different from 'w'.\n\n        So condition 2: non-diagonal elements must be the same letter and that letter must be different from the diagonal letter.\n\n        However, what if the two diagonals have different letters? Let's consider:\n\n        Example: \n            n=3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        This would have main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] and anti-diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same, but then non-diagonal: \n            [0][1] = 'a', [1][0]='a', [1][2]='b', [2][1]='a' -> not all same.\n\n        Now, what if we have:\n            n=3\n            bbb\n            bcb\n            bbb\n\n        Then main diagonal: ['b','c','b'] -> not uniform (must be same letter). So fails.\n\n        But wait, the problem states: \"on both diagonals ... all letters are the same\". So each diagonal must be uniform. However, the two diagonals can have different letters?\n\n        Let me check the problem statement: it doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same letter, just that each diagonal is uniform.\n\n        However, then the non-diagonal part must be the same letter and that letter must be different from the diagonal letters.\n\n        Example with two different diagonals:\n\n            n=3\n            aba\n            bbb\n            acb\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','b'] -> not uniform -> NO.\n\n        Another example with two different diagonals:\n\n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xyy\n            xxx\n\n        Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> not uniform -> NO.\n\n        So actually, the two diagonals must be uniform, but they could be two different letters? \n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"all other",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same as each other and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first line contains an odd integer `n`, which is the size of the grid. The next `n` lines contain the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: All elements at positions `(i, i)` for `0 ≤ i < n` must be the same.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: All elements at positions `(i, n-1-i)` for `0 ≤ i < n` must be the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: All elements not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n4. **Validation**: Ensure that the diagonal elements are uniform across both diagonals and that the non-diagonal elements form a single distinct letter different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(list(input().strip()))\n    \n    diag1 = []\n    diag2 = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n        diag2.append(grid[i][n-1-i])\n    \n    if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    center_letter = diag1[0]\n    diag_letters = {center_letter}\n    \n    non_diag_letters = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n            \n    if len(non_diag_letters) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_letter = next(iter(non_diag_letters))\n    if non_diag_letter == center_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code extracts elements from both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). It checks if all elements in each diagonal are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code collects all elements not on either diagonal into a set to ensure they are all the same. It also checks that this common non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, the code prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming the letter \"X\" by leveraging set operations to check uniformity and distinctness of elements. The solution handles edge cases such as grids where diagonals are uniform but non-diagonals are not, or vice versa, ensuring correctness.",
