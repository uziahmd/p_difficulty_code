The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of n integers (a_i) and a list of m integers (b_j).\n Condition: The j-th key can open the i-th chest if and only if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1.\n\n Note: \n   (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1  <=> (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n\n So, we can categorize the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_chests = number of chests with a_i even\n        odd_chests = number of chests with a_i odd\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with b_j even\n        odd_keys = number of keys with b_j odd\n\n Then, an even chest can be opened only by an odd key, and an odd chest can be opened only by an even key.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to matching:\n\n   - The even_chests can be matched with odd_keys.\n   - The odd_chests can be matched with even_keys.\n\n However, note that one key can open at most one chest, and one chest at most once.\n\n So, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of two independent bipartite matchings:\n\n   Matching 1: min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n   Matching 2: min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait: is it really independent? Actually, yes, because the keys used for even_chests must be odd, and for odd_chests must be even. There's no overlap.\n\n However, let me verify with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n      Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n      Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n          9: odd, 14:even, 6:even, 2:even, 11:odd\n          odd_chests = 2, even_chests = 3\n\n      Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n          8: even, 4: even, 7: odd, 20: even\n          even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1\n\n      Then:\n          Matching for even_chests (3) with odd_keys (1): min(3,1) = 1\n          Matching for odd_chests (2) with even_keys (3): min(2,3) = 2\n          Total = 1+2 = 3 -> which matches the sample output.\n\n Example 2: \n      Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n      Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n      Keys: [5] -> odd -> even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n\n      Then: min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0 -> total=1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3:\n      Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n      Chests: [10] -> even -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=0\n      Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n      Then: min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0 -> total=0 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the parities and then compute:\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But note: what if we have both even and odd keys and chests? The condition is independent so the above holds.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the next line as chests.\n   Read the next line as keys.\n\n   Count even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Then, result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n However, note: the problem says that one key can be used at most once and one chest at most once. The above matching is constrained by the minimum between the two sides.\n\n Since the keys and chests are independent in terms of parity, we cannot use the same key twice, and we cannot use the same chest twice, and the two sets of matches (for even_chests and odd_chests) don't share keys or chests.\n\n Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to checking the parity (even or odd) of both the chest and the key. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys such that the sum of their numbers is odd. This condition is satisfied if one is even and the other is odd. \n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing the chests and keys into even and odd groups, we can independently match even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The maximum number of matches possible for each category is the minimum of the count of chests and keys in their respective opposing categories.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and keys. The result is then computed as the sum of the minimum matches possible for each category (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    odd_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chests += 1\n            \n    even_keys = 0\n    odd_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n        else:\n            odd_keys += 1\n            \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: The chests and keys are categorized based on whether their numbers are even or odd. This is done by checking the remainder when divided by 2.\n3. **Counting Categories**: The counts of even and odd chests and keys are stored in variables (`even_chests`, `odd_chests`, `even_keys`, `odd_keys`).\n4. **Calculating Maximum Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by summing the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures we do not exceed the available keys or chests in either category.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chest-key pairs, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
