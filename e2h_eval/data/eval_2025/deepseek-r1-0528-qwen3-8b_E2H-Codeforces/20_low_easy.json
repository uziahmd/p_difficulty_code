For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n, k, f (with n from 1 to 15, and k, f up to 200000)\n\n The problem: We have to assign to every binary string s of length from 1 to n an integer c_s (from 0 to k).\n Then, the condition for a multiset M of binary strings of length exactly n to be beautiful is:\n   For every binary string t (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in M that have t as a prefix is at most c_t.\n\n What is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset? Let F be that maximum.\n\n Now, we are to count the number of ways to choose the c_s (for every s of length 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size F is exactly f.\n\n Observation:\n\n How do we think about building a beautiful multiset?\n\n Consider the following: Each string in the multiset must be of length exactly n. However, note that the condition is defined for every prefix (every string of length from 1 to n). \n\n But note: The condition for a string s (which is a prefix) is that the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s.\n\n Also note: The entire multiset can contain multiple copies of the same string (since it's a multiset). \n\n However, note that the condition for a string s of length i (i < n) is more restrictive than for longer prefixes? Actually, if a string s (say \"0\") is a prefix of many long strings, then the condition for s must hold. But note that if we have two different strings that both start with \"0\", then each one contributes to the count for \"0\". \n\n Moreover, the condition for the full-length string (length n) is the least restrictive because they don't impose conditions on shorter ones (but they are constrained by their own prefix conditions).\n\n How to maximize the multiset?\n\n We can consider building a trie (prefix tree) of all binary strings of length from 1 to n. The condition for a node (string s) is that the total number of strings in the multiset that pass through this node (i.e., have s as prefix) is at most c_s.\n\n Note: The multiset consists only of strings of length n. So, for a node s (which has length i), the condition is that the sum of the counts of the strings in the multiset that have s as prefix (i.e., s followed by any (n-i) bits) is at most c_s.\n\n But note: the multiset is built by choosing some strings (each of length n). Each string corresponds to a path of length n.\n\n Another observation: The entire multiset is constrained by the conditions at every node. The maximum size of the multiset is limited by the minimum value of c_s over all the nodes? Not exactly.\n\n However, note that the condition for a node s (of length i) is that the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\n And note: The multiset is built from strings of length n. The condition for a node s (with length i) is that the sum of the counts of the leaves (the full strings) that are in the subtree rooted at s is <= c_s.\n\n But note: The same string (full string) is counted in all the nodes that are its prefixes.\n\n Therefore, the entire multiset is constrained by the conditions along the prefixes.\n\n How to compute the maximum possible size F?\n\n We can use dynamic programming or greedy on the trie? Alternatively, note that the problem is symmetric and the trie is complete (each node has two children, unless we stop at depth n).\n\n However, there is a known way: The maximum multiset is built by having for each node s, we can assign at most c_s to the entire subtree. But note: the same string (leaf) is counted in all the nodes above it.\n\n Actually, the maximum multiset can be built by considering the constraints from the root to the leaves. The root constraint is the most restrictive because the root condition must allow all the strings we put. Then, the next level splits the count.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire multiset as being built by independent choices for each leaf? Not exactly.\n\n There is a known combinatorial structure: the multiset is built by putting x copies of each full string. Then, for a node s, the condition is that the sum_{x: string in the subtree} x <= c_s.\n\n Then, the maximum multiset is the maximum set of nonnegative integers {x_w} (for each full string w) such that for every node s, the sum of x_w over w in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n This is the definition of a system of inequalities. The maximum total size is the sum of x_w",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The solution involves understanding the constraints and leveraging combinatorial mathematics to count the valid assignments efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the most restrictive prefix condition in the trie structure of all binary strings up to length \\( n \\). Each node in the trie represents a binary string, and the condition for a node \\( s \\) is that the sum of counts of all strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix must not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The maximum multiset size \\( F \\) is constrained by the minimum value among all \\( c_s \\) values along the path from the root to any leaf in the trie. However, the problem requires counting the number of assignments of \\( c_s \\) values such that \\( F = f \\).\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total number of valid assignments where \\( F \\leq f \\).\n   - Subtracting the number of assignments where \\( F \\leq f-1 \\) from the former to get the count where \\( F = f \\).\n   - Using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, as the result can be very large (modulo 998244353).\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach uses dynamic programming to compute the combinations efficiently, leveraging precomputed factorials and modular inverses for quick calculation of binomial coefficients.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n_val = int(data[0])\n    k_val = int(data[1])\n    f_val = int(data[2])\n    \n    max_depth = n_val\n    \n    if max_depth == 0:\n        print(1 if f_val == 0 else 0)\n        return\n        \n    total_nodes = (1 << (max_depth + 1)) - 1\n    num_leaves = 1 << max_depth\n    \n    def comb(n, r):\n        if r < 0 or r > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[r] % MOD * inv_fact[n - r] % MOD\n\n    max_f = (1 << max_depth) * k_val\n    if f_val > max_f:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    fact = [1] * (k_val + 1)\n    for i in range(1, k_val + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD\n        \n    inv_fact = [1] * (k_val + 1)\n    inv_fact[k_val] = pow(fact[k_val], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(k_val, 0, -1):\n        inv_fact[i - 1] = inv_fact[i] * i % MOD\n        \n    def nCr(n, r):\n        if r < 0 or r > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[r] % MOD * inv_fact[n - r] % MOD\n        \n    def ways_for_F(F_max):\n        if F_max <= 0:\n            return 1\n            \n        if F_max >= (1 << max_depth) * k_val:\n            return 1\n            \n        res = 0\n        for depth in range(0, max_depth + 1):\n            ways_here = nCr((1 << (max_depth - depth)), max_depth - depth)\n            count_here = nCr(F_max, (1 << (max_depth - depth)))\n            if count_here == 0:\n                continue\n            if depth == max_depth:\n                term = ways_here * pow(2, (1 << max_depth) - 1, MOD) % MOD\n            else:\n                term = ways_here * (1 << (depth + 1)) % MOD\n            res = (res + term * count_here) % MOD\n        return res % MOD\n        \n    total_ways_f = ways_for_F(f_val)\n    total_ways_f_minus = ways_for_F(f_val - 1)\n    ans = (total_ways_f - total_ways_f_minus) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and \\( f \\), which define the problem parameters.\n2. **Initial Checks**: The code checks for edge cases where \\( n \\) is 0 or when \\( f \\) exceeds the maximum possible multiset size.\n3. **Factorial Precomputation**: Factorials and their modular inverses are precomputed up to \\( k \\) to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients later.\n4. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The function `ways_for_F` calculates the number of valid assignments for a given maximum multiset size \\( F \\) using combinatorial mathematics. It iterates over each possible depth in the trie, computes the valid combinations at each depth, and aggregates the results.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by subtracting the count of assignments for \\( F = f-1 \\) from those for \\( F = f \\), ensuring the result is modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and leverages combinatorial mathematics to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
