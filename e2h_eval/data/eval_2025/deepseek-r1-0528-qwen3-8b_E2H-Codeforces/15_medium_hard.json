They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.\n The tournament has 2^n teams. The playoff proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n). In the i-th phase (0-indexed? note: the string s index 0 corresponds to the first phase which has 2^(n-1) games) we have:\n   - If s[i] is '0', then in the matches of that phase the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If s[i] is '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n We are to determine all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to itself) for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Observation:\n The tournament structure is fixed: it's a single elimination bracket. The matches are predetermined by the bracket (the bracket is fixed: the first match is between team1 and team2, then the next two winners play, etc.)\n\n However, the outcomes of the matches (whether higher or lower wins) are determined by the string s.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can think of the tournament as having n rounds (phases). In each round, the remaining teams are grouped into pairs (each match). The winner of a match moves on.\n\n The key: the outcome of the entire tournament for a particular team x depends on the outcomes of the matches in each phase and the arrangement of the teams (i.e., the permutation p).\n\n Since the permutation p is arbitrary (but must be a bijection), we can assign the numbers 1 to 2^n arbitrarily to the teams.\n\n However, note: the bracket is fixed. The bracket defines the order of the teams at the beginning. But wait: the problem does not specify the initial seeding beyond the fact that the first phase matches are (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), ... (2^(n-1)-1 vs 2^(n-1)).\n\n But note: the problem says \"the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on\". So initially, the teams are numbered 1 to 2^n (in increasing order) and arranged in the bracket accordingly.\n\n However, the catch: we are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily (any permutation). So we can assign the skill values to the team numbers arbitrarily.\n\n Let the bracket be fixed: the initial bracket is:\n\n Round 1: \n   Match 1: Team1 vs Team2\n   Match 2: Team3 vs Team4\n   ...\n\n Round 2: \n   Then we have 2^(n-1) teams. The next set of matches: the winner of match1 and match2 (teams 1,2,3,4) are arranged so that the winner of match1 (between team1 and team2) plays the winner of match2 (between team3 and team4) in the next round? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   \"In the second phase, 2^(n-2) games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4', then the winner of the game '5 vs 6' plays against the winner of the game '7 vs 8', and so on.\"\n\n So the bracket is a complete binary tree with the leaves being the initial teams in order.\n\n Therefore, the bracket structure is fixed. The outcome of the tournament for a particular team x depends on:\n\n   1. The assignment of the skill values to the teams (the permutation p).\n   2. The results of each phase (given by s).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily. So we can decide which team number (which leaf) gets which skill.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Alternative approach: Instead of trying to assign the entire permutation, we can consider the necessary conditions for a particular team x to win.\n\n Note: The tournament is deterministic once the bracket and the outcomes (given by s) are fixed and the skills are assigned. But we can choose the assignment (the permutation) arbitrarily.\n\n Conditions for x to win:\n\n   - In the first round (phase 0, the first character of s): \n        * If s[0] == '0': then in each match, the lower skill wins. So for x to advance from its first match, it must be that x is the smaller number in the pair it is in (unless it is the last one? Actually, the bracket has fixed positions. But note: we can assign the skill arbitrarily to any team. However, the bracket positions are fixed: the initial bracket has team1 and team2 in the first match, team3 and team4 in the second, etc.\n\n   But wait: the problem does not say that we can reassign the team numbers arbitrarily at the beginning. It says \"the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2\", meaning that the initial ordering is fixed by the team numbers (which are labeled from 1 to 2^n). However, the permutation p assigns skills arbitrarily. So we are free to assign any skill value to any team number.\n\n   Therefore, the condition for x to win must hold for some assignment of the numbers 1 to 2^n to the teams (with the bracket structure fixed by the team numbers 1 to 2^n in order).\n\n   How to check for a fixed x?\n\n   We can think of the bracket as a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves (the initial teams). Each node in the bracket represents a match.\n\n   The journey of team x (which is initially at the leaf corresponding to the position of x in the sorted list? Actually, note: the bracket uses the initial team numbers in increasing order. But we assign the skill arbitrarily. However, the bracket is defined by the initial team numbers: so the bracket has:\n\n        Leaf0: team1\n        Leaf1: team2\n        Leaf2: team3\n        Leaf3: team4\n        ...\n\n   Now, if we assign the skill value x to one of these teams, then we have to consider the entire path of the bracket.\n\n   However, we can choose which team (leaf) gets the skill x. But note: the bracket is fixed, so the relative positions of the teams are fixed. Therefore, the condition for x to win depends on the bracket and the outcomes.\n\n   Another idea: since the assignment of skills is arbitrary, we can set the skill for the team that ends up being the champion to x, and then assign the other skills appropriately. But note: we must assign distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\n   Conditions:\n\n   Let's denote the bracket as a binary tree. The champion must win all the matches. In each match, the winner is determined by the outcome (given by s) and the two skills in that match.\n\n   We can try to simulate the tournament backwards (from the final match to the initial) and see what constraints are imposed on the skill values.\n\n   However, note that the problem asks for all x (from 1 to 2^n) that are winning.\n\n   Since n<=18, the total number of teams is 2^18 = 262144, which is too many to iterate over each x and then try to assign the entire permutation.\n\n   We need a smarter way.\n\n   Observing the structure:\n\n   The tournament has n rounds. The champion must be present in every round. In each round, the champion must win the match.\n\n   In the first round, the champion is in one of the matches. The outcome of that match depends on s[0]. Similarly, in the next rounds.\n\n   We can consider the entire bracket as a set of 2^n leaves and the champion must defeat all the other teams in the matches along the path.\n\n   But note: the outcome of the matches is determined by the string s and the relative ordering of the skills.\n\n   Let the bracket be represented as a binary tree with the champion at the root. Each node in the bracket has two children (the two teams that played in the match at that node) and the winner is the parent.\n\n   The key: the outcome of a match (at a phase i) is determined by s[i-1] (if we index s from 0 to n-1, and the first phase is the first character).\n\n   For a match at a phase i (which is the (n-i)-th round? Actually, the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then 2^(n-2), etc.):\n\n        Let the two skills in the match be a and b (with a < b).\n        If the outcome is '0' (lower wins), then the winner is the one with the lower skill, i.e., a wins if a < b.\n        If the outcome is '1' (higher wins), then the winner is the one with the higher skill, i.e., b wins.\n\n   However, note: the same outcome applies to every match in that phase.\n\n   Now, consider the champion (with skill x) must win all the matches. Along the path from the champion to the root, there are n matches (because there are n rounds). In each of these matches, the opponent that the champion faces in that round must be determined by the outcome of the entire subtree.\n\n   However, we are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily (except the champion is fixed to x). Therefore, we can assign the other teams' skills arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and from 1 to 2^n excluding x).\n\n   What are the constraints for x to be able to win?\n\n   Let the champion be assigned to a particular leaf (we can choose which leaf, because we can assign the skill x to any team). But note: the bracket structure is fixed by the team numbers. However, we can assign the skill x to any leaf. Therefore, we can choose the leaf (the initial team) that will become the champion.\n\n   But wait: the bracket is fixed by the initial team numbers (the leaf positions are fixed). However, we can assign the skill x to any of the 2^n teams (leaves). Then the rest of the assignment must be done so that in every match the champion wins.\n\n   Conditions for a fixed leaf (say we assign the champion to the leaf at position k, which is the (k+1)-th team) and we know the bracket structure:\n\n        The champion must win in the first round. In the first round, the champion is in a match with another team (say with skill y). Then:\n\n            If s[0] == '0': then the champion must be the lower one -> so x < y.\n            If s[0] == '1': then the champion must be the higher one -> so x > y.\n\n        Then, in the next round, the champion must win the match with the winner of the adjacent match (which is a team that we can control by assigning the skills arbitrarily, but note: the entire bracket must be consistent).\n\n   However, we can assign the other skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set the necessary conditions on the opponents.\n\n   The problem reduces to: for a fixed x, can we assign the remaining 2^n-1 numbers (from 1 to 2^n excluding x) to the other teams such that:\n\n        In the first round: the champion's first opponent is set so that the champion wins (according to s[0]).\n        Then, in the next rounds, the champion must be able to beat the winner of the adjacent match, and so on.\n\n   But note: the bracket is fixed, so the set of teams that the champion must face (directly or indirectly) is fixed. Moreover, the outcomes of the matches are fixed by s.\n\n   We can think of the entire tournament as requiring that the champion must be able to beat a set of opponents that are built from the bracket.\n\n   However, the bracket is a full binary tree. The champion must defeat:\n\n        In round 1: one opponent (the one in the same first-round match)\n        In round 2: the winner of the adjacent first-round match (so two teams are eliminated to get to that opponent)\n        In round 3: the winner of the two adjacent second-round matches (so four teams eliminated) and so on.\n\n   Actually, in round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the champion must defeat one team that is the overall winner of a group of 2^i teams (including the champion's own 2^i group? Actually, no: the champion's own group of 2^i teams is the one the champion comes from, and the opponent in the round i comes from a group of 2^i teams that were eliminated to get to that spot).\n\n   But note: the bracket is fixed. The champion's entire path is fixed (by the leaf we assign to). However, we can choose the leaf arbitrarily.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   Since we can assign the skills arbitrarily, the only thing that matters is the relative order of the skills. And the outcome of the tournament is completely determined by the relative order of the skills and the string s.\n\n   We can imagine that the tournament is a sequence of n rounds, and the champion must be the only team that survives. The condition for x to be the champion is that for every match the champion participates in, the outcome (as per s) must be favorable, and the champion must have the appropriate relative skill compared to the opponents in that match.\n\n   However, note: the opponents in the later rounds are not fixed until we assign the skills. But we can assign the skills arbitrarily. So we can set the skills of the teams that are supposed to be beaten by the champion to be just barely above or below as required, and the ones that are not in the champion's path can be set arbitrarily (but distinct).\n\n   Therefore, the condition for x to be the champion is that we can assign the entire set of skills (a permutation) such that:\n\n        For each round i (from 0 to n-1) and for each match that the champion plays in round i, the outcome (given by s[i]) is such that the champion wins.\n\n   And note: the champion must be present in all rounds.\n\n   Now, what are the constraints on the set of opponents the champion must defeat?\n\n   In the first round: the champion must defeat one team. Condition: \n        If s[0]=='0', then the champion must be the smallest in the pair (so the other team must be greater than x).\n        If s[0]=='1', then the champion must be the largest in the pair (so the other team must be less than x).\n\n   In the second round: the champion must defeat the winner of the adjacent first-round match. The adjacent first-round match has two teams. The outcome of that match is determined by s[0] (for the first phase). Then, the outcome of the second-round match is determined by s[1].\n\n   However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set the skills of the teams that the champion does not need to face (until they do) to be very high or very low as needed, as long as they don't interfere.\n\n   But note: the champion must defeat a set of teams that are the winners of their respective subtrees. The condition for the champion to win a match in round i is that the champion must be the winner according to the outcome of that round (s[i]) and the skill of the opponent.\n\n   However, the opponent in round i is the winner of a subtree of size 2^(n-i-1) (since we have n rounds, and the champion starts in a bracket of size 2^n, and in round i (0-indexed) the match is between two groups of size 2^(n-i-1) each). Actually, let's count:\n\n        Round 0 (first round): the champion is in a group of 2 teams (so the opponent is one team). Then the next round: the champion's group becomes 4 teams (because we are now at the second round, which has 2^(n-1) teams, so the champion must have won the first round and then the second round requires defeating the winner of a group of 2 teams from the adjacent part, so the entire bracket for the champion's side is 4 teams). \n\n   Actually, the entire tournament is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves. The champion must win n rounds.\n\n   In round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the champion must defeat one team that comes from a subtree of size 2^(n-i) (wait, no: the bracket structure is fixed. The champion's first round match is against one team. Then the second round match is against the winner of a two-team match, so the champion must have defeated one team in the first round and then the opponent in the second round has defeated one team (so the champion has defeated two teams directly and one indirectly). \n\n   Actually, the champion must defeat a total of 2^n - 1 teams. But the condition is more about the relative strengths at the time of each match.\n\n   However, note: we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, the only constraints are:\n\n        In the first round: the direct opponent must be such that the outcome holds.\n\n        Then, the opponent in the second round is the winner of the adjacent first-round match. That winner must be someone who was the best (or worst) in their two-team match (depending on s[0]). But we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can set the two teams in that adjacent match arbitrarily. However, the condition for the second-round match is:\n\n            If s[1]=='0', then the champion must be the lower one than the second-round opponent.\n            If s[1]=='1', then the champion must be the higher one.\n\n        But note: the second-round opponent is the winner of two teams. We can assign the two teams arbitrarily (as long as we use distinct numbers and we have already used x). So we can set the two teams in that adjacent match to be two numbers that are either both less than x (if s[1]=='0') or both greater than x (if s[1]=='1')? Actually, no: the outcome of the first round (adjacent match) is determined by s[0]. So if s[0]=='0', then the lower of the two adjacent teams wins. Then for the second-round match (s[1]=='0' or '1'), we require that the champion (x) is the lower or the higher than the winner of that adjacent match.\n\n        But we can control the assignment of the two adjacent teams. So we can set the two adjacent teams to be:\n\n            If s[0]=='0' (so the lower wins the adjacent match): then the winner of the adjacent match is the minimum of the two adjacent teams.\n\n            Then, for the second-round match: \n                if s[1]=='0', then x must be < winner_adjacent (so x must be less than the minimum of the two adjacent teams).\n                if s[1]=='1', then x must be > winner_adjacent (so x must be greater than the minimum of the two adjacent teams).\n\n        However, we also have the first round: the champion's direct opponent must satisfy:\n\n            if s[0]=='0', then x < direct_opponent (from the first round).\n            if s[0]=='1', then x > direct_opponent.\n\n        And we have to assign the entire set of 2^n numbers.\n\n   This seems complicated.\n\n   Another approach: we can consider the entire tournament as a requirement that the champion must be able to beat a set of opponents that are built from the bracket. The minimal requirement is that the champion must be able to beat the \"critical\" teams that are the ones that would naturally win the bracket if the outcomes were all '1' (for example). But the outcomes are mixed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n        Let the bracket be represented as a binary tree. The champion must be the only one that survives. The tournament can be seen as a set of conditions on the skill of the champion relative to the other teams.\n\n        Specifically, the champion must be:\n\n            - In the first round: either the smallest or the largest in its immediate pair (depending on s[0]).\n            - In the second round: relative to the winner of the adjacent match (which is determined by the first round outcome of that adjacent match).\n\n        But note: we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so the only teams that matter are the ones that are forced to be above or below x.\n\n        The critical observation: the champion must be able to be the maximum or minimum in certain groups, depending on the outcomes.\n\n   We can define the tournament bracket as a set of nodes (matches). Each match has two inputs and one output (the winner). The output of a match is determined by the inputs and the outcome (s[i] for that match's round).\n\n   However, note: the rounds are fixed. The entire tournament is divided into n rounds (each round halves the number of teams). The rounds are independent in the sense that the outcome of a round is determined by the outcome string s.\n\n   We can think of the tournament as requiring that the champion must be the unique number that satisfies:\n\n        For each match along the path, the champion must be the winner, and the winner is determined by the outcome of that round (and the two skills in the match).\n\n   But note: the entire set of 2^n teams is partitioned into the bracket. The champion must be the only one that can win when the outcomes are as given.\n\n   How to determine the set of teams that can be the champion?\n\n   We can use a recursive (or iterative) method that builds the set of possible \"winners\" for each subtree.\n\n   Consider: we have the bracket (a complete binary tree of height n). We can traverse from the leaves to the root.\n\n   Each node (match) has two children (the two teams/brackets that feed into it). The outcome of the match at this node is given by the phase (round) index i (which corresponds to the s[i] character, but note: the rounds are in order from the first round (largest subtree) to the last round (final)).\n\n   However, note: the string s is given for each phase (from the first phase to the n-th phase). The first phase (with 2^(n-1) games) is the first character.\n\n   In the bracket, the root is the final match (phase n-1? actually, the final match is the n-th phase? Let me read: the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then 2^(n-2), ..., until 2^0=1 game in the last phase. So the string s has length n, and the i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the phase with 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n   The root is the last phase (i = n-1). The leaves are the first phase (i=0).\n\n   Now, we can do a dynamic programming (or DFS) on the bracket:\n\n        Let the entire bracket have 2^n teams (leaves). We want to compute the set of skill values that can win the entire tournament.\n\n   However, the state space is too large (2^n is up to 262144, and we have n=18, so 2^18 leaves).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a state that represents a match (node) and the set of skill values that can win from that node to the root, given the outcomes from the current node to the root.\n\n   But note: the outcomes are fixed by s, and the assignment of the entire set is arbitrary (so we can assign the skills arbitrarily to the leaves). However, the set of skills we have is fixed (the numbers 1 to 2^n). \n\n   Another idea: we can consider the necessary conditions for x to be the champion.\n\n   Conditions:\n\n        Let T(x) be true if x can win the tournament.\n\n        Then, we can consider the entire bracket and the requirement that x must win all matches.\n\n        The bracket can be broken down into two halves (left and right) for each node. The champion must come from one of the two halves, and must defeat the winner of the other half at the root.\n\n        However, the root match is the last match (phase n-1) and the outcome is given by s[n-1] (the last character). Then, the condition for the root match is:\n\n            If s[n-1]=='0', then the champion must be the lower of the two winners of the two halves.\n            If s[n-1]=='1', then the champion must be the higher.\n\n        Then, recursively, for each half, the winner must be the one that wins that half.\n\n        Therefore, we can define:\n\n            Let F(l, r, k) be the set of skill values that can win the subtree from the segment [l, r] (which has 2^k leaves) given the outcomes for the rounds corresponding to the k rounds (from the k-th phase to the last, but note: the phases are fixed and the bracket is fixed). However, the outcomes for the rounds are fixed by the string s, and the rounds are assigned from the first phase (largest) to the last.\n\n        But wait, the bracket is fixed and the outcomes are fixed for each phase (round). The phase index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the round that has 2^(n-i-1) games, and that round is the (i)-th character in s.\n\n        In our DP, we need to know the outcomes for the rounds that occur in the current subtree.\n\n        Actually, the entire tournament has n rounds. The root is round n-1 (last round). The two children of the root correspond to two subtrees of size 2^(n-1) (each). The root round uses the last character of s (index n-1). Then, the two children are the winners of two halves, and the condition for the root is determined by s[n-1].\n\n        Then, the left subtree (with 2^(n-1) teams) must produce a winner that, together with the right subtree winner, must be such that the root outcome (s[n-1]) chooses the champion.\n\n        However, we are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can independently assign the skills to the left and right subtrees.\n\n        The condition for the root match:\n\n            If s[n-1]=='0': then the champion must be the minimum between the winner of the left and the winner of the right.\n            If s[n-1]=='1': then the champion must be the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, for the entire tournament, x must be:\n\n            Case 1: x is the winner of the left subtree and is the minimum between the two winners (if s[n-1]=='0').\n            Case 2: x is the winner of the left subtree and is the maximum (if s[n-1]=='1').\n\n            Or, if x is the winner of the right subtree, then similarly.\n\n        But note: we can choose which subtree (left or right) to put x in.\n\n        Therefore, we can break the problem into:\n\n            Step 1: For a given x, we can assign it to any leaf. Then, the entire set of leaves is fixed.\n\n            Step 2: The tournament progresses. In each match, the winner is determined by the outcome (s[i]) and the two skills.\n\n        We need to check if there exists an assignment of the remaining 2^n-1 numbers (distinct and from 1 to 2^n) such that x wins.\n\n   How to check without iterating over all permutations?\n\n   We can use a greedy assignment:\n\n        We know that the champion must win all its matches. Along the path, we have n matches. In each match, we know the required relation (either < or >) for the opponent.\n\n        Moreover, the opponents are the winners of their own subtrees. For each subtree, the winner must be the one that satisfies the outcomes in that subtree.\n\n        We can precompute for each node (match) the set of skill values that can win that subtree, given the outcomes for the rounds in that subtree.\n\n        But note: the entire set of skills is fixed (numbers 1 to 2^n). We are going to assign the skills arbitrarily.\n\n        However, the condition for a node (subtree) is:\n\n            Let the subtree have m = 2^k teams (leaves). The root of the subtree (at a particular round) has an outcome c (from s). Then, the winner of the subtree must be:\n\n                - If c is '0': the smallest skill value among the winners of the two child subtrees? Not exactly: the outcome at the root of the subtree is for the match between the two child winners. So the winner is the minimum if c=='0', or the maximum if c=='1'.\n\n            But note: the child subtrees themselves are also determined by the outcomes.\n\n        However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, the set of winners for the entire tournament is constrained by the following:\n\n            At the leaf level (m=1, no match): the skill value is fixed (it's the number we assign to that leaf).\n\n            For a node with two children (each a subtree) and outcome c:\n\n                The winner of the node must be the minimum (if c=='0') or the maximum (if c=='1') of the winners of the two children.\n\n            But note: the winners of the children are not fixed numbers, but sets of possible numbers. However, we have the entire set {1,...,2^n} to assign arbitrarily.\n\n        This is similar to a tournament selection with fixed outcomes.\n\n   Another idea: we can consider the minimal and maximal possible values that can be the winner of the entire tournament.\n\n        Let L = 1, R = 2^n.\n\n        In the entire tournament, the champion must be the minimum (if all outcomes are '0') or the maximum (if all outcomes are '1').\n\n        But with mixed outcomes, the champion must be somewhere in between.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n            Let f(s) be the set of all numbers x that can be the champion.\n\n            We can consider the tournament as a series of comparisons. In the first round, the champion must be either the smallest or largest in its first match. Then in the second round, the champion must be the smallest or largest in a set of 4 teams (its first match and the adjacent match) and so on.\n\n        But note: the entire tournament requires that the champion must be able to be the winner of n comparisons, and each comparison is either \"must be the smallest in a set\" or \"must be the largest in a set\".\n\n        Actually, the bracket can be broken down into n levels. At level i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the champion must be the winner of a set of 2^i teams (the ones in its half of the bracket at that level) and the comparison at level i is determined by s[i].\n\n        However, the comparisons are not independent: the set of 2^i teams at level i includes the champion and the other teams that are still in the tournament at that round.\n\n        We can define:\n\n            Let A_i be the set of skill values that can be the winner of the entire tournament after the first i rounds (i.e., the champion must have survived the first i rounds).\n\n            Initially, A_0 is the entire set {1,2,...,2^n} (because we haven't started).\n\n            Then, in round 0 (first round): the champion must be in one of the 2^(n-1) matches. The condition for a skill value x to survive the first round is:\n\n                There exists an opponent y such that:\n                    if s[0]=='0', then x < y.\n                    if s[0]=='1', then x > y.\n\n                And note: we can assign the entire set arbitrarily. However, we must also consider that the other matches are happening simultaneously. But we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can put x in any match and then assign the opponents arbitrarily.\n\n            But wait: the bracket is fixed. The champion's leaf is fixed (we can choose which leaf, but the leaf determines the match). However, we can choose the leaf arbitrarily. Therefore, the condition for x to survive the first round is simply:\n\n                if s[0]=='0': then we can assign an opponent y > x (and there are plenty of numbers greater than x, since the total numbers are 1 to 2^n and x is at most 2^n, so there are 2^n - x numbers greater than x, and we only need one).\n                if s[0]=='1': then we can assign an opponent y < x.\n\n            However, we must also ensure that the other matches do not force x to be eliminated (but they don't involve x). So the only constraint for the first round is that we can assign an opponent for x.\n\n            Then, for the second round: the champion must be able to win the match against the winner of the adjacent match. The adjacent match has two teams (which we can assign arbitrarily, but distinct and not using x). The outcome of the adjacent match is determined by s[0] (the first phase). Then, the second round outcome is determined by s[1].\n\n            Condition for the second round:\n\n                Let the winner of the adjacent match be w (which is either the minimum or the maximum of the two teams in the adjacent match, depending on s[0]).\n\n                Then, in the second round, we require:\n\n                    if s[1]=='0': then x < w.\n                    if s[1]=='1': then x > w.\n\n            But note: we can assign the two teams in the adjacent match arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and not x). Therefore, we can choose w to be any number (except x) that satisfies:\n\n                if s[0]=='0': then w is the minimum of the two adjacent teams. Then, we can choose the two adjacent teams arbitrarily (from the remaining numbers). So we can set w to be any number that is not x and that can be the minimum of two numbers (meaning we can choose a number greater than w as the other adjacent team).\n\n                if s[0]=='1': then w is the maximum, so we can choose the two adjacent teams arbitrarily (and set w to be any number that is not x and that can be the maximum).\n\n            Then, the condition for the second round is:\n\n                if s[1]=='0': then x < w, and we can choose w to be any number greater than x (as long as we have numbers available) OR we can choose w to be the minimum of two numbers that are both greater than x? Actually, we can choose the two adjacent teams arbitrarily from the remaining numbers (excluding x). \n\n            But note: the entire set of numbers is fixed. We have to use all numbers.\n\n            This becomes complex.\n\n   After careful thought, here is a solution:\n\n        We can determine the set of numbers that can be the champion by simulating the tournament from the leaves to the root, but we do it for the entire set of numbers. However, note that the assignment is arbitrary so the only constraint is the relative comparisons.\n\n        Consider the tournament as a set of n comparisons that the champion must pass. Each comparison is either:\n\n            Comparison type 0 (s[i]=='0'): the champion must be the minimum in its half (of size 2^(n-i-1) teams) at that round.\n            Comparison type 1 (s[i]=='1'): the champion must be the maximum in its half.\n\n        But note: the champion must be the minimum/maximum in increasingly larger sets (from 2 teams to 2^n teams). \n\n        Actually, the champion must be the minimum/maximum in the entire set of 2^n teams if the outcome string is all zeros or all ones. Otherwise, it must be the minimum/maximum in some intermediate sets.\n\n        However, the champion must be the minimum in the first round, then the minimum of the two minima (if the second round is type 0) or the maximum of the two minima (if the second round is type 1)? \n\n        Let's break down:\n\n            Round 0: the champion must be the minimum (if s[0]=='0') or the maximum (if s[0]=='1') in its first-round match (a set of 2 teams).\n\n            Round 1: the champion must be the minimum (if s[1]=='0') or the maximum (if s[1]=='1') in its quarter (a set of 4 teams). But note: the quarter consists of the champion's first-round match and the adjacent first-round match. The champion has already been compared to one team (its first opponent). The adjacent match produces a winner. Then, the champion must be compared to that winner.\n\n            However, the condition for the quarter is not just the champion and the winner of the adjacent match, but the entire set of 4 teams. The condition for the second round is based on the two winners (champion and the adjacent winner) and the outcome s[1]. But the outcome s[1] applies to the match between these two winners.\n\n        We can define for each round i (0-indexed) the champion must be the minimum or maximum in the set of 2^(i+1) teams that form its half at that round.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n            Let S_i be the set of 2^(i+1) teams that the champion must be compared to in round i (plus itself). Then, the champion must be the minimum (if s[i]=='0') or the maximum (if s[i]=='1') in S_i.\n\n        Why? Because the tournament bracket at round i groups the remaining teams into groups of 2^(n-i) (actually, the set S_i is the entire half of the bracket that the champion is in at round i). And the champion must win the entire half and then face the other half at the next round (or the root).\n\n        But note: the rounds are from the first (largest set) to the final (smallest set). \n\n        Actually, at round i (0-indexed), the champion is in a set of size 2^(n-i) teams. However, we can also think of the tournament as requiring that the champion must be the minimum or maximum in increasingly larger sets (from 2 to 2^n). \n\n        However, the rounds are structured as:\n\n            Round 0: set size 2 (the champion and one other)\n            Round 1:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) that can win a playoff tournament given a specific outcome string \\( s \\). The tournament consists of \\( n \\) rounds where each round's outcome is determined by a character in \\( s \\) (either '0' or '1'). The solution involves analyzing the tournament structure and the constraints imposed by the outcome string to identify all feasible champions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament starts with \\( 2^n \\) teams arranged in a fixed bracket. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each round is determined by the corresponding character in \\( s \\): '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins. The goal is to find all integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skills (a bijection from teams to skill values) where team \\( x \\) wins the tournament.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must be the minimum or maximum in certain subsets of teams at each round, depending on the outcome string. Specifically:\n   - In rounds where \\( s[i] = '0' \\), \\( x \\) must be the smallest in its subset.\n   - In rounds where \\( s[i] = '1' \\), \\( x \\) must be the largest in its subset.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a dynamic approach to track the valid range of values \\( x \\) can take at each round. Starting from the entire range [1, \\( 2^n \\)], we iteratively refine this range based on the outcome of each round. For each round, we adjust the lower and upper bounds of \\( x \\) to ensure it meets the required condition (being the min or max) in its subset.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\( n \\) rounds once, adjusting the bounds for \\( x \\) in constant time per round. Thus, the overall complexity is \\( O(n) \\), which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 18 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    \n    low = 1\n    high = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char == '0':\n            high = (1 << (n - i - 1)) + high // 2\n        else:\n            low = (1 << (n - i - 1)) + 1\n            \n    res = list(range(low, high + 1))\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values \\( n \\) (number of rounds) and \\( s \\) (outcome string). It calculates the total number of teams as \\( 2^n \\).\n\n2. **Bounds Adjustment**: For each round, the code adjusts the lower and upper bounds of possible values for \\( x \\):\n   - If the outcome is '0', \\( x \\) must be the smallest in its subset, so the upper bound is reduced.\n   - If the outcome is '1', \\( x \\) must be the largest in its subset, so the lower bound is increased.\n\n3. **Result Generation**: After processing all rounds, the valid range for \\( x \\) is from `low` to `high`, inclusive. The code prints all integers in this range in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values for \\( x \\) by leveraging the constraints imposed by each round's outcome, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
