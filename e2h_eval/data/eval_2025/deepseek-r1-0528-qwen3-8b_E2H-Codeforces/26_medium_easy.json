    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x,y,z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, note that we have fixed ordering: \n   x <= y <= z.\n\nIn a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the only condition we need to check is: x + y > z.\n\nBut note: our sides are constrained by ranges: x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D]. \n\nWe can try to count the total number of triples (x,y,z) in these ranges and then subtract those that do not form a triangle? However, note that the range for y is from B to C, and note that the condition for a triangle is x+y>z.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate over z (from C to D) and for each z, determine the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B, min(C, z)] (because y must be at least B and at most C, but also note that for a fixed z, we require y<=z? Actually, wait: the condition does not require y<=z? But note the problem: the sides are x, y, z and we are told that the triangle must satisfy the usual triangle inequality. However, the problem does not state an ordering of the sides beyond the given constraints. But note: the problem says \"non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z\" and the constraints: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\nSo we have x<=y<=z. Therefore, the triangle condition reduces to x+y>z (since x<=y<=z implies that x+z>y and y+z>x automatically).\n\nSo for fixed z (which is the largest side), we need x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B, min(C, z)]? Actually, note: the constraints say y is at most C and at least B. But if z < C, then y can go up to z? No, because the constraint on y is [B, C] and also we have the condition that y<=z? Actually, no: the constraint is independent: we have y from [B, C] and z from [C, D]. But note: the condition for the triangle requires x+y>z, and since x<=y<=z, we must have y>=B and y<=C, and z>=C. So for a fixed z (which is at least C), the y must be at least B and at most min(C, z). But wait: since z>=C and y<=C, then y is from B to C. However, we also require that y<=z, but since z>=C and y<=C, then y<=C<=z, so y<=z is automatically satisfied.\n\nTherefore, for a fixed z (from C to D), the condition is: \n   x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B, C].\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the sides are in the order x<=y<=z beyond the given constraints. The constraints say: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So indeed, the sides are ordered: x<=y<=z.\n\nNow, how to count the pairs (x,y) for a fixed z?\n\nWe need to count the number of pairs (x,y) such that:\n   x in [A,B], y in [B, C], and x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the entire set of pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) minus the pairs that do NOT satisfy x+y>z, i.e., x+y<=z.\n\nHowever, we cannot iterate z from C to D and for each z iterate over y from B to C and then over x from A to B because the ranges can be up to 500000 and the product of two loops would be O(n^2) which is too slow.\n\nWe need an efficient way.\n\nLet's fix y first. For a fixed y, what x are required? We require x >= max(A, z - y + 1) and x <= B. But note: we also require that x is at least A and at most B.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the number of x for a given y and z:\n\n   For fixed y and z, the condition is x > z - y.\n\nBut note: x must be at least A and at most B.\n\nSo for fixed y and z, the condition on x is: x >= max(A, floor(z-y)+1) and x <= B.\n\nThen the count for (y,z) is: \n   L = max(A, z-y+1)\n   R = B\n   If L <= R, then the count is (R - L + 1), else 0.\n\nBut then we would have to iterate over y from B to C and for each y iterate over z from C to D. This would be O((C-B+1)*(D-C+1)) which in worst-case is about (500000)^2, which is 250e9, too many.\n\nWe need to reverse the order: for each z, we want to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the constraints on x and y are independent. We can use two pointers or precomputation.\n\nAnother idea: for each z, we want to count the pairs (x,y) in [A,B] x [B,C] such that x+y>z.\n\nThis is equivalent to counting the pairs (x,y) with x+y>z.\n\nWe can also think: total pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). Then subtract the pairs with x+y<=z.\n\nBut how to count the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z quickly?\n\nLet F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y<=z.\n\nThen the answer for a fixed z is: (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F(z)\n\nThen the total number of triangles is: sum_{z=C}^{D} [ (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F(z) ]\n\nBut note: we cannot compute F(z) for each z independently without an efficient method.\n\nHow to compute F(z) = count of (x,y) with x+y<=z, x in [A,B], y in [B,C]?\n\nWe can fix y and then x must be in [A, min(B, z-y)].\n\nBut then we can also use a two-pointer method or precompute an array for all possible sums.\n\nNote: the minimum sum is A+B (since x>=A, y>=B) and the maximum sum is B+C (since x<=B, y<=C). Also, z runs from C to D (at least C, and C>=B>=A, so minimum z is C, and the minimum sum we care about is A+B, which might be less than C? Actually, note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z. And we are counting the non-triangle pairs (for the purpose of subtraction) as x+y<=z, but note that for the triangle we require x+y>z. However, when we subtract, we are only concerned with the pairs that fail the triangle condition.\n\nBut note: the condition for being a non-degenerate triangle is x+y>z. So if we count the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z, we can use:\n\n   Count = 0\n   for x from A to B:\n        for y from B to C:\n            if x+y>z: Count++\n\nBut we cannot iterate over x and y for each z.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can precompute an array F for all s (from A+B to B+C) such that F[s] = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y = s.\n\nThen F(z) = sum_{s=A+B}^{min(z, B+C)} F[s]\n\nBut note: we are not interested in the exact s, but we can use prefix sums.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute an array `freq` for the sums from A+B to B+C (the minimum sum and maximum sum) such that:\n   For s from A+B to B+C:\n        F[s] = (number of x in [A,B] such that x <= s - B and x>=A) * (number of y in [B,C] such that y <= s - A and y>=B) ?\n\nWait, actually, for a fixed s, we require:\n   x+y = s, with A<=x<=B and B<=y<=C.\n\nThen x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also y = s-x must be in [B, C]. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   x_min = max(A, s-C)\n   x_max = min(B, s-B)\n   Then if x_min <= x_max, then the number of x is (x_max - x_min + 1) and each x gives one y (which is s-x). But note: we must also check that y=s-x is in [B, C]. However, by the definition of x_min and x_max, we have:\n        x_min = max(A, s-C) -> then y = s - x_min <= s - A (but we don't know) and also x_min ensures that y>=B? Let me check:\n\nActually, we can break the condition for y: \n   Since y = s - x, and we require B<=y<=C.\n   => s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\nBut also we require A<=x<=B.\n\nSo the x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also we require that s-B >= x >= s-C, and note that s-B might be less than A, etc.\n\nBut note: we are building the frequency array for s from A+B to B+C. The total number of pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). \n\nBut then we want to compute for each z (from C to D) the cumulative sum of F[s] for s from A+B to min(z, B+C) (because for s>z, we don't count, but note: we are counting x+y<=z, so s from A+B to z).\n\nBut note: the maximum s we consider is min(z, B+C). However, if z < A+B, then F(z)=0. But note: z>=C, and A<=B<=C, so A+B <= B+C, but A+B might be less than C? Actually, A<=B<=C, so A+B <= 2*C, but we don't know the relation between A+B and C. However, note that the smallest z is C, and we require x+y<=C. Since x>=A, y>=B, then x+y>=A+B. So if A+B > C, then there are no pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=C. But note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we are counting the bad pairs (x+y<=z) for subtraction.\n\nBut note: the problem states that the sides are from the given ranges, so we must consider that z starts at C (so the smallest z is C). Then the condition for the bad pairs (x+y<=z) for the smallest z=C is: x+y<=C.\n\nBut if A+B <= C, then there might be some pairs. Otherwise, if A+B > C, then for every z (starting from C) we have no bad pairs? Actually, no: if A+B > C, then for z=C, we have no bad pairs because the smallest x+y is A+B which is >C. Then for z from C+1 to D, we still have no bad pairs because the smallest x+y is A+B which is greater than D (if A+B>D) or at least greater than the current z (if A+B>z). But wait, if A+B > D, then for all z from C to D, the condition x+y<=z is never satisfied. Similarly, if A+B <= D, then for z from A+B-1 to D, the bad pairs exist.\n\nBut note: we are iterating z from C to D, and we need to compute F(z) for each z.\n\nBut the direct computation of F(z) by iterating s from A+B to min(z, B+C) and then using the precomputed frequency array would be O(n) per z, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative: we can precompute the entire frequency array for s from A+B to B+C, and then build a prefix sum array for s from 0 to (B+C) (we can set zeros for s below A+B and above B+C).\n\nThen for each z (from C to D), we let M = min(z, B+C) and then F(z) = prefix[M] - prefix[A+B-1] (if we define prefix[i] = sum_{s=0}^{i} F[s]). But note: we defined F[s] for s from A+B to B+C, and we set F[s]=0 for s outside that range.\n\nBut then the total count for a fixed z is: (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F(z) [where F(z) is the cumulative frequency from A+B to min(z, B+C)].\n\nThen the answer is: sum_{z=C}^{D} [ (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F(z) ]\n\nBut note: we are counting the same set of pairs (x,y) for each z, and we are counting for each z the pairs (x,y) that form a triangle with the given z. However, note that the same pair (x,y) can form a triangle with multiple z (as long as z < x+y). But wait, the problem counts each triple (x,y,z) separately. So we must consider each z independently.\n\nBut note: the condition is that x,y,z are chosen independently from their respective intervals. So the entire set of triples is the Cartesian product. We are grouping by z.\n\nBut the above formula for F(z) counts the pairs (x,y) that are bad for the given z. Then for each z, the number of good pairs (x,y) is (total pairs) - F(z). Then the total number of triangles is the sum over z from C to D of (total pairs - F(z)).\n\nBut note: the total pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) and is independent of z.\n\nSo:\n\n   total_pairs = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)\n\n   Then for each z from C to D:\n        bad = F(z)   [which is the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z]\n        good = total_pairs - bad\n        and then add good to the answer.\n\nBut wait: is that correct? Because for a fixed z, the condition is x+y>z, and we are counting the pairs (x,y) that satisfy that. Then for each z, the number of triangles with that particular z is good.\n\nBut note: the triple (x,y,z) is uniquely determined by x,y,z. So we are indeed counting each triple exactly once.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the entire set of triples is independent. \n\nBut the issue is: the value of z goes from C to D, and for each z we count the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z. Then the total is the sum over z from C to D.\n\nBut note: the same pair (x,y) may be used in multiple z (as long as z < x+y). However, the problem does not require that the triple is counted only once per distinct (x,y) set, but by the independent choices of x,y,z.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z exist, such that A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D\"\n\nSo we are counting the triples (x,y,z) satisfying the conditions.\n\nAnd the condition for the triple is: \n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and x+y>z.\n\nSo yes, we are counting each triple.\n\nBut the above method: for each z, we count the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z. Then the total is the sum over z from C to D.\n\nBut note: we must be careful with the range of z. The problem says z from C to D.\n\nNow, how to compute F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z, x in [A,B], y in [B,C]?\n\nWe can use a two-pointer or a mathematical formula.\n\nActually, we can compute F(z) by:\n\n   Let T = min(z, B+C)   [since the maximum x+y is B+C, so if z>=B+C, then all pairs are bad? Actually no: we are counting the bad pairs (x+y<=z). If z>=B+C, then all pairs are included. Otherwise, only the pairs with x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: we can also use:\n\n   F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} [number of y in [B, C] such that y <= min(C, z-x) ]\n\nBut that leads to O(n) per z.\n\nWe need to precompute the entire distribution of x+y.\n\nWe can use a difference array for the sums.\n\nSteps for the frequency array:\n\n   Let S_min = A+B, S_max = B+C.\n\n   We'll create an array `freq` of length (S_max+1) (index from 0 to S_max) and then use a two-dimensional loop? That would be O(S_max) which is 500000, but the inner loop would be (B-A+1) which is up to 500000, so total operations 250e9, which is too slow.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a two-pointer or a mathematical formula for the cumulative distribution.\n\nBut note: we can compute the cumulative distribution without iterating over every s.\n\nWe can fix x and then the y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)].\n\nBut again, we want to avoid iterating over x for each z.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that the pairs (x,y) form a rectangle in the grid. The condition x+y<=z is a half-plane. We can use the following:\n\n   Let g(x) = the maximum y for a fixed x is C, but we require y<=min(C, z-x). So for fixed x, the number of y is:\n        y_min = B\n        y_max = min(C, z-x)\n\n        Then if y_min <= y_max, then the count for x is (y_max - y_min + 1), else 0.\n\nThen F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1)   [if min(C, z-x) >= B]\n\nBut we can break it:\n\n   Condition: we require that z-x >= B, i.e., x <= z-B, and also x>=A.\n\n   Then the pairs (x,y) are counted by:\n\n        Let x_min = A, x_max = min(B, z-B)   [because if x>z-B then even the smallest y (B) would make x+y > z]\n\n        Then for x in [x_min, x_max]:\n            The condition on y: y from B to min(C, z-x). Since x<=z-B, then z-x>=B, so the lower bound for y is B and the upper bound is min(C, z-x).\n\n        So for x in [A, min(B, z-B)]:\n            count_x = min(C, z-x) - B + 1\n\n        But note: if min(C, z-x) < B, then we get negative, but we already have x<=z-B so that min(C, z-x) >= B? Not necessarily: if C < z-x, then we use C, but if C>=z-x then we use z-x. But since z-x>=B (by the condition x<=z-B), then we have min(C, z-x) >= B? Actually, no: if C < B, but we know B<=C, so that's safe. So the expression is safe.\n\nBut then we can write:\n\n   F(z) = sum_{x = A}^{min(B, z-B)} [ min(C, z-x) - B + 1 ]\n\nBut note: we must also consider that if z-x > C, then we use C, so:\n\n   For a fixed x, if z-x >= C, then the count is C - B + 1.\n   Otherwise, the count is (z-x) - B + 1.\n\nSo we can split the x range:\n\n   Condition 1: x <= z - C   => then min(C, z-x) = C, so the count is (C - B + 1).\n   Condition 2: x > z - C and x <= z - B   => then min(C, z-x) = z-x, so the count is (z-x - B + 1).\n\nBut note: we are only considering x from A to min(B, z-B).\n\nLet x0 = min(B, z-B)   [the maximum x we consider]\n\nThen we split the x from A to x0:\n\n   Let x1 = min(x0, z-C)   [if z-C >= A, then from A to min(B, z-C) we use condition1, and from min(B, z-C)+1 to x0 we use condition2?]\n\nActually, we need to find the breakpoint: the x such that z-x >= C  <=> x <= z-C.\n\nSo:\n\n   Part1: x from A to min(B, z-C)   [if z-C >= A, otherwise no part1]\n        count1 = (number of x in [A, min(B, z-C)]) * (C - B + 1)\n\n   Part2: x from max(A, min(B, z-C)+1) to min(B, z-B) [if min(B, z-C)+1 <= min(B, z-B)]\n        For each x in this range, the count is (z-x - B + 1)\n\nBut note: the condition for part2 is x > z-C, but we also have x<=z-B.\n\nSo the breakpoint is at x = floor(z-C) (integer). Actually, x must be integer.\n\nBut note: the expression for part2: the count for x is (z-x - B + 1). This is linear in x.\n\nWe can compute the sum of part2 by:\n\n   Let L = max(A, min(B, z-C)+1)\n   Let R = min(B, z-B)\n\n   Then if L <= R:\n        The sum for part2 = sum_{x=L}^{R} (z-x - B + 1)\n\n        = (R-L+1)*(z-B+1) - sum_{x=L}^{R} x\n\n        = (R-L+1)*(z-B+1) - (L+R)*(R-L+1)//2\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the range [L,R] might be empty.\n\nBut then we have to do this for each z from C to D. The total operations would be O(D-C+1) which is up to 500000, and each operation is O(1). That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must compute the two parts for each z.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the condition for part1: we require that z-C >= A, and for part2: we require that min(B, z-C)+1 <= min(B, z-B). \n\nBut note: the condition for part2: x must be in [max(A, min(B, z-C)+1), min(B, z-B)]\n\nBut note: the condition for part1: we are only including x from A to min(B, z-C). This is valid only if z-C >= A, otherwise part1 is 0.\n\nSimilarly, for part2: we require that the lower bound (max(A, min(B, z-C)+1)) is <= the upper bound (min(B, z-B)). \n\nBut note: the entire x range is from A to min(B, z-B). We split the x range at z-C.\n\nBut note: we must check that z-B >= A, because otherwise the entire x range is empty (then F(z)=0). However, since z>=C and B<=C, then z-B >= C-B >= 0, but A might be greater than z-B? \n\nWait: we defined x from A to min(B, z-B). So if z-B < A, then the range is empty. Then we set F(z)=0.\n\nBut note: z-B < A  => z < A+B. Since the smallest x+y is A+B, then if z < A+B, then no pair (x,y) satisfies x+y<=z. This is consistent.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\n   total_pairs = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1)\n\n   ans = 0\n   for z from C to D:\n        # If z < A+B, then F(z)=0, so we can skip the calculation?

And for x>z-B, we don't have any y (because y>=B, so x+y>=x+B>z-B+B=z).

They are not included in F_z, but they are not bad either?

So these x contribute (B - x_upper) * (C-B+1) to the good pairs.\n\n        # But wait, in our current F_z we did not account for the entire set of pairs (x,y). We only considered the pairs (x,y) for x from A to x_upper. The pairs (x,y) for x from x_upper+1 to B are not bad (they are all good) and we didn't subtract them as bad. \n\n        # However, our F_z is the count of bad pairs. The bad pairs only come from Set1. The pairs from Set2 are all good, so we don't subtract them. \n\n        # Therefore, the total bad pairs is F_z (only from Set1). Then the good pairs from Set1 is (number of pairs in Set1) - F_z, and the good pairs from Set2 is (B - x_upper) * (C-B+1).\n\n        # But note: the entire set of pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). Then the good pairs is (entire set) - (bad pairs) = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F_z.\n\n        # However, note: the entire set includes both Set1 and Set2. The bad pairs are only in Set1. So the good pairs are:\n        #   (Set1: the pairs that are good) + (Set2: all pairs)\n\n        # Which is (|Set1| * (C-B+1) - F_z) + ((B - x_upper) * (C-B+1))\n\n        # But |Set1| is (x_upper - A + 1) * (C-B+1) ? Not exactly: the pairs in Set1 are not all the pairs (x,y) for x in [A, x_upper] because for each x, the y is bounded by min(C, z-x). However, we computed F_z as the count of bad pairs (x+y<=z) for Set1, and the total pairs in Set1 is: sum_{x=A}^{x_upper} (min(C, z-x) - B + 1) [if min(C, z-x)>=B, else 0] but wait, we did split and that's how we computed F_z.\n\n        # Actually, we computed F_z exactly as the number of bad pairs from Set1. The entire Set1 has (x_upper - A + 1) * (C-B+1) pairs? No, because for each x, the y is not necessarily the entire [B,C] but only [B, min(C, z-x)]. \n\n        # So we cannot say the entire Set1 has (x_upper - A + 1) * (C-B+1) pairs. \n\n        # Therefore, we stick to:\n\n        #   Total pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)\n        #   Bad pairs = F_z   [from Set1, and Set2 has no bad pairs]\n\n        #   Then the good pairs for this z is: (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) - F_z\n\n        # Why is that? Because the entire set of pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). The bad pairs are the ones in Set1 that satisfy x+y<=z (and we computed F_z). The rest (including the pairs in Set2 and the pairs in Set1 that are good) are good.\n\n        # But wait: the entire set of pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). And the bad pairs are exactly F_z. Then the good pairs are the complement.\n\n        # However, note: the entire set of pairs (x,y) is independent of z. But the condition for being bad is x+y<=z. And we computed F_z as the count of pairs (x,y) (over the entire x in [A,B]) that satisfy x+y<=z. But wait, our computation for F_z only considered x from A to x_upper (<=z-B). But note: if x>z-B, then there is no y such that x+y<=z, so the bad pairs are exactly the pairs (x,y) with x<=z-B and x+y<=z. \n\n        # So we did compute F_z correctly.\n\n        # Therefore, the number of good pairs for this z is total_pairs - F_z.\n\n        # Then we add (total_pairs - F_z) to the answer.\n\n   Print ans.\n\nBut wait: is that correct?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle must satisfy the condition \\(x + y > z\\) to be non-degenerate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). The key constraint is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the ordering \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition to check is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Insight**: For each \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\), we need to count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This can be efficiently computed by first calculating the total number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) without the triangle condition and then subtracting the pairs that do not meet \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Total Pairs Calculation**: The total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) is \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)\\).\n   - **Bad Pairs Calculation**: For each \\(z\\), count the pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x + y \\leq z\\). This involves:\n     - Determining the range of \\(x\\) values (from \\(A\\) to \\(\\min(B, z - B)\\)) since \\(x\\) must be small enough so that \\(x + y \\leq z\\) for some \\(y\\).\n     - Splitting the \\(x\\) range into two parts based on whether \\(z - x\\) is less than or equal to \\(C\\) or greater.\n     - Using arithmetic series properties to compute the sum of valid \\(y\\) values for each \\(x\\) part efficiently.\n   - **Good Pairs Calculation**: Subtract the bad pairs from the total pairs to get the number of valid pairs for each \\(z\\). Sum these values across all \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) to get the final answer.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\) once, performing constant-time operations for each \\(z\\). Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(D - C + 1)\\), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n    ans = 0\n    \n    for z_val in range(C, D + 1):\n        x_upper = min(B, z_val - B)\n        if x_upper < A:\n            F_z = 0\n        else:\n            x_break = z_val - C\n            count1 = 0\n            part1_x_low = A\n            part1_x_high = min(x_upper, x_break)\n            if part1_x_high >= part1_x_low:\n                count1 = (part1_x_high - part1_x_low + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n                \n            part2_x_low = max(A, x_break + 1)\n            part2_x_high = x_upper\n            count2 = 0\n            if part2_x_low <= part2_x_high:\n                n_terms = part2_x_high - part2_x_low + 1\n                sum_x = (part2_x_low + part2_x_high) * n_terms // 2\n                count2 = n_terms * (z_val - B + 1) - sum_x\n                \n            F_z = count1 + count2\n            \n        good_pairs = total_pairs - F_z\n        ans += good_pairs\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The total number of possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) is calculated as \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)\\).\n3. **Iterating Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\):\n   - **Determine Valid \\(x\\) Range**: \\(x\\) must be between \\(A\\) and \\(\\min(B, z - B)\\) to potentially form a triangle with some \\(y\\).\n   - **Split \\(x\\) Range**: The range of \\(x\\) is split into two parts based on whether \\(z - x\\) is within the bounds of \\(C\\).\n   - **Count Bad Pairs**: For each part, count the pairs \\((x, y)\\) that do not satisfy \\(x + y > z\\) using arithmetic series properties for efficiency.\n   - **Calculate Good Pairs**: Subtract the bad pairs from the total pairs to get the number of valid pairs for the current \\(z\\).\n4. **Output Result**: Sum the good pairs for all \\(z\\) and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid triangles by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid brute-force checks, ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
