And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we calculate the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of sleep times in all weeks (each week is a contiguous k days).\n Then, the average is S / (number of weeks) = S / (n - k + 1).\n\n But note: Each week is defined by k consecutive days. How to compute S?\n We can precompute the prefix sum array for the list `a` so that we can quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Precompute prefix sums: \n        prefix[0] = 0\n        prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n    Then the sum of days from i to j (0-indexed, inclusive) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n 3. For each week starting at index i (from 0 to n-k), the week consists of days [i, i+k-1].\n    The sum for this week is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n\n 4. Then, S = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n However, note: We can also compute S without iterating each week by noticing:\n\n    S = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n But wait, let's break down:\n\n    Actually, we have:\n        Week0: [0, k-1] -> prefix[k] - prefix[0]\n        Week1: [1, k]   -> prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]\n        ...\n        Week(n-k): [n-k, n-1] -> prefix[n] - prefix[n-k]\n\n    Then, S = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can precompute the prefix sum and then use two loops? But note n and k can be up to 200,000.\n\n However, we can compute the sum of the prefix array from index k to n and from 0 to n-k separately.\n\n But note: We don't need to store the entire prefix array if we do it smartly, but we do need the prefix array.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total S by:\n\n    Let P = [0]*(n+1)\n    P[0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n    Then, S = 0\n    for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        S += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n    Then, average = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: This loop runs (n-k+1) times, which is about 200,000, so that's acceptable.\n\n However, we can also use a different approach to avoid the inner loop for each week? \n\n Another idea: \n    S = (P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]) - (P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[n-k])\n\n    We can precompute the prefix sum of the prefix array (i.e., a cumulative sum for P) to get the sum of P from l to r.\n\n    But wait, we already have the prefix array P. Then:\n\n        part1 = sum(P[k:n+1])\n        part2 = sum(P[0:n-k+1])\n        S = part1 - part2\n\n    However, note: our P has indices from 0 to n (inclusive). So:\n\n        part1 = sum of P from index k to n (inclusive) -> indices from k to n (which is n - k + 1 elements)\n        part2 = sum of P from index 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> indices from 0 to n-k (which is n-k+1 elements)\n\n    Then, S = part1 - part2\n\n    But wait, let me test with the example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n        P[0]=0\n        P[1]=3\n        P[2]=3+4=7\n        P[3]=3+4+7=14\n\n        Then, part1 = P[2] + P[3] = 7 + 14 = 21\n        part2 = P[0] + P[1] = 0 + 3 = 3\n        S = 21 - 3 = 18\n\n        Number of weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n        Average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> matches.\n\n    But wait, let me check with the example: n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n\n        P[0]=0, P[1]=10\n        part1 = P[1] = 10\n        part2 = P[0] = 0\n        S=10, average=10/1=10 -> correct.\n\n    However, note: the example \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" \n        n=8, k=2, so weeks = 7.\n        We'll compute the prefix P for the list [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]:\n\n        P[0]=0\n        P[1]=1\n        P[2]=3\n        P[3]=7\n        P[4]=100007\n        P[5]=100130\n        P[6]=100586\n        P[7]=200586\n        P[8]=200587\n\n        Then, part1 = P[2] to P[8]: indices 2 to 8 (inclusive) -> 3,7,100007,100130,100586,200586,200587\n        part2 = P[0] to P[6] (because n-k=6) -> 0,1,3,7,100007,100130,100586\n\n        S = (3+7+100007+100130+100586+200586+200587) - (0+1+3+7+100007+100130+100586)\n\n        Let's subtract:\n\n            S = (3+7+100007+100130+100586+200586+200587) - (0+1+3+7+100007+100130+100586)\n\n        Notice that the terms from index2 to index6 (which are 100007,100130,100586) appear in both and will cancel.\n\n        Then, S = (3+7+200586+200587) - (0+1+3+7)   [Wait, no: actually the entire set of indices from 2 to 8 is 7 numbers, and from 0 to 6 is 7 numbers, so the cancellation is not just those three?]\n\n        Actually, let me write the two sets:\n\n        Set1 (part1): indices 2 to 8: [3,7,100007,100130,100586,200586,200587]\n        Set2 (part2): indices 0 to 6: [0,1,3,7,100007,100130,100586]\n\n        Then, S = (3+7+100007+100130+100586+200586+200587) - (0+1+3+7+100007+100130+100586)\n                = 200586+200587 - (0+1)   because the rest cancels.\n\n        = 401173 - 1 = 401172\n\n        Then, average = 401172 / 7 = ?\n\n        Let me compute: 401172 // 7 = 57310.285714...? \n\n        But the example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n        Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n        Let me recalculate the example manually:\n\n        The list is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n        We have 7 weeks (since n-k+1 = 8-2+1 = 7):\n\n        Week0: [1,2] -> 3\n        Week1: [2,4] -> 6\n        Week2: [4,100000] -> 100004\n        Week3: [100000,123] -> 100123\n        Week4: [123,456] -> 579\n        Week5: [456,789] -> 1245\n        Week6: [789,1] -> 790\n\n        Sum of these weeks: 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n        3+6=9, 9+100004=100013, 100013+100123=200136, 200136+579=200715, 200715+1245=201960, 201960+790=202750.\n\n        Then, average = 202750 / 7 ≈ 28964.2857142857\n\n        So what went wrong in the prefix sum method?\n\n        In the prefix sum method, we defined:\n            P[0]=0\n            P[1]=1\n            P[2]=1+2=3\n            P[3]=1+2+4=7\n            P[4]=1+2+4+100000=100007\n            P[5]=100007+123=100130\n            P[6]=100130+456=100586\n            P[7]=100586+789=101375\n            P[8]=101375+1=101376   [I had an error above: I wrote 200586 and 200587, but that was wrong]\n\n        Correction: the list has 8 elements, so P[8] should be the total sum of the 8 elements.\n\n        The total sum is 1+2+4+100000+123+456+789+1 = 101376.\n\n        Now, part1 = P[2] to P[8] (indices 2 to 8 inclusive) -> \n            P[2]=3, P[3]=7, P[4]=100007, P[5]=100130, P[6]=100586, P[7]=101375, P[8]=101376\n\n        part2 = P[0] to P[6] (indices 0 to 6 inclusive) -> \n            P[0]=0, P[1]=1, P[2]=3, P[3]=7, P[4]=100007, P[5]=100130, P[6]=100586\n\n        Then, S = (3+7+100007+100130+100586+101375+101376) - (0+1+3+7+100007+100130+100586)\n\n        The common terms: 100007,100130,100586 are in both. Subtract them and we are left with:\n\n        Left: 3+7+101375+101376\n        Right: 0+1+3+7\n\n        Then, S = (3+7+101375+101376) - (0+1+3+7) \n               = (101375+101376 + 10) - (10)\n               = 202751 + 10 - 10 = 202751\n\n        But wait, we have 3+7=10, so 101375+101376+10 = 202761, and then subtract 10 (from the right) gives 202751.\n\n        Then, average = 202751 / 7 ≈ 28964.42857...\n\n        But wait, the manual calculation was 202750.\n\n        Let me recalc the manual:\n\n        Week0: 1+2 = 3\n        Week1: 2+4 = 6\n        Week2: 4+100000 = 100004\n        Week3: 100000+123 = 100123\n        Week4: 123+456 = 579\n        Week5: 456+789 = 1245\n        Week6: 789+1 = 790\n\n        Total = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790\n\n        3+6=9\n        9+100004=100013\n        100013+100123=200136\n        200136+579=200715\n        200715+1245=201960\n        201960+790=202750.\n\n        So why did the prefix method give 202751?\n\n        Let me recalc the prefix array correctly:\n\n        a = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n        P[0]=0\n        P[1]=1\n        P[2]=1+2=3\n        P[3]=3+4=7\n        P[4]=7+100000=100007\n        P[5]=100007+123=100130\n        P[6]=100130+456=100586\n        P[7]=100586+789=101375\n        P[8]=101375+1=101376\n\n        Then, part1 (indices 2 to 8) = P[2] + P[3] + P[4] + P[5] + P[6] + P[7] + P[8]\n            = 3 + 7 + 100007 + 100130 + 100586 + 101375 + 101376\n\n        Let me add:\n\n            3+7=10\n            10+100007=100017\n            100017+100130=200147\n            200147+100586=300733\n            300733+101375=402108\n            402108+101376=503484\n\n        part2 (indices 0 to 6) = P[0]+P[1]+P[2]+P[3]+P[4]+P[5]+P[6]\n            = 0+1+3+7+100007+100130+100586\n            = 1+3+7=11, then 11+100007=100018, 100018+100130=200148, 200148+100586=300734\n\n        Then, S = 503484 - 300734 = 202750.\n\n        So I must have made an arithmetic error earlier.\n\n        Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute S by:\n\n            S = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                S += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n        But note: the above direct summation is O(n) and n can be 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also use the formula:\n\n            S = (sum of P from k to n) - (sum of P from 0 to n-k)\n\n        But note: the prefix array P has length n+1, and we are summing two contiguous parts.\n\n        We can precompute the entire prefix sum (the array P) and then use prefix sums for P (if we want to avoid the two loops for the two parts) or simply use the built-in sum function on slices.\n\n        Since n is 200000, slicing and summing might be O(n) for each slice, so two slices would be O(n). Alternatively, we can precompute a prefix sum array for P (let's call it Q) such that:\n\n            Q[i] = P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[i]\n\n        Then, the sum from index l to r (inclusive) is Q[r] - (Q[l-1] if l>0 else 0). But note, we have P[0..n] (n+1 elements).\n\n        However, the problem says n and k can be up to 200000, so we can do:\n\n            part1 = Q[n] - (Q[k-1] if k>=1 else 0)   # because we want from k to n, so indices k to n (inclusive) -> from index k to index n (both inclusive) in the array P.\n\n        But note: our array P has indices 0 to n (n+1 elements). \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building an extra prefix for P and just use the built-in sum for the slices.\n\n        Since the constraints are 200000, and we are only doing two slices, the total operations would be about 400000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the first method (iterating over each week) is also O(n). However, we can do:\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            S = 0\n            for i in range(total_weeks):\n                S += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n        This is one pass and we have the prefix array already. \n\n        Which is more efficient? The two-slice method uses two slices and two separate summations (each O(n)), so total O(2*n). The for-loop is O(n). Both are acceptable.\n\n        However, note that the two-slice method requires building the entire prefix array (which is O(n)), and then two slices (each O(n)).\n\n        The for-loop method requires building the prefix array (O(n)) and then a single loop (O(n)).\n\n        They are similar in complexity.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method:\n\n            part1 = sum(P[k:])   # from index k to end (index n, inclusive)\n            part2 = sum(P[:n-k+1])   # from start to index n-k (inclusive)\n\n        However, note: the second slice goes from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> that's n-k+1 elements.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            part1 = sum(P[k:n+1])   # because P has indices 0..n, so from k to n (inclusive) -> n+1 - k elements\n            part2 = sum(P[0:n-k+1])  # from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> n-k+1 elements\n\n        But wait, in Python, slicing [k:] goes from k to the end (which is index n, because the list has n+1 elements). Similarly, [:n-k+1] goes from 0 to n-k (inclusive) because the slice stops at n-k+1 (exclusive). Actually, to include n-k, we need to go to n-k+1 (exclusive) so that's correct.\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, then n-k+1 = 2, so part2 = P[0:2] -> indices 0 and 1.\n\n        That matches: part2 = P[0] + P[1] = 0+3.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Build prefix array P of length n+1\n            P = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            # Using the two-slice method:\n            part1 = sum(P[k:])   # from index k to the last element (index n)\n            part2 = sum(P[:total_weeks])   # from 0 to total_weeks-1, but note: total_weeks = n-k+1, and we want indices 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> that's n-k+1 elements.\n\n            # But wait, the part2 should be from 0 to n-k (inclusive) -> that's n-k+1 elements, and total_weeks = n-k+1, so the slice [0:total_weeks] is exactly [0, n-k] (because total_weeks is n-k+1, and the slice goes to index total_weeks-1, which is n-k).\n\n            Then, S = part1 - part2\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the direct for-loop for the weeks:\n\n            S = 0\n            for i in range(total_weeks):\n                S += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n        Both methods are O(n). Let's choose the direct for-loop because it is straightforward.\n\n        However, note: the direct for-loop does not require two separate sums and might be simpler.\n\n        But wait, the two-slice method is concise and we have already built P. The for-loop is also clear.\n\n        Since the problem constraints are 200000, we can use either.\n\n        However, note: the two-slice method uses two passes (each of length about n) and the for-loop uses one pass (of length total_weeks, which is about n). So they are both linear.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method does two passes (each O(n)), while the for-loop does one pass (O(n)). \n\n        Actually, the two-slice method:\n\n            Building P: O(n)\n            Then, part1 = sum(P[k:]) -> O(n - k + 1) ~ O(n)\n            Then, part2 = sum(P[:n-k+1]) -> O(n-k+1) ~ O(n)\n\n        The for-loop:\n\n            Building P: O(n)\n            Then, the for-loop: O(n-k+1) ~ O(n)\n\n        So both are O(n). \n\n        But note: the two-slice method might be faster because it uses built-in C-optimized sum and slicing, and the for-loop does a simple addition.\n\n        However, the problem says n up to 200000, so we can choose either.\n\n        Let's stick with the direct for-loop for clarity.\n\n        Steps for the for-loop method:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            P = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            total_sum = 0.0   # use float to avoid integer division? but the problem says to output with decimal, so we can use float\n            for i in range(total_weeks):\n                total_sum += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n            average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        Then format the average to have at least 6 decimal places.\n\n        However, note: the numbers can be large (n up to 200000, a[i] up to 100000, so total_sum can be up to 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which is within integer range, but we are dividing by an integer (weeks) and then formatting as float.\n\n        But the problem says: output the average with absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        Example: 9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n        However, note: the example output uses 10 digits.\n\n        But let me check the example: 9.0 becomes \"9.0000000000\", which is 10 zeros.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\n        But wait, the example output: ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n        Our calculated value for the third example was 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... so we need to output 10 digits.\n\n        However, note: 202750 / 7 is an exact fraction? 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857... repeating every 6 digits.\n\n        We must be cautious with floating point precision. But the numbers are integers and the divisor is an integer (at most 200000) so the quotient might have many digits.\n\n        But the problem says: the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. So 10 decimal digits are more than enough.\n\n        However, using float might run into precision issues for very large numbers? \n\n        But note: the maximum total_sum is about 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which is 2e10, and then we divide by 200000, so the maximum average is 2e10 / 1 = 2e10, which is within the range of float (which can represent integers exactly up to 2^53). 2e10 is about 2e10, which is 20 billion, and 2^53 is about 9e15, so yes, it's safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic and then convert to float for formatting.\n\n        But the division might be done as float division.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        One more thing: the problem input can be read from stdin.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            P = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            num_weeks = n - k + 1\n            total = 0.0\n            for i in range(num_weeks):\n                total += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n            avg = total / num_weeks\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n            n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n            P = [0,3,7,14]\n            num_weeks=2\n            i=0: add P[2]-P[0] = 7-0=7\n            i=1: add P[3]-P[1] = 14-3=11\n            total=18, avg=9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n        Example2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n            n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n            P=[0,10]\n            num_weeks=1\n            i=0: add P[1]-P[0]=10\n            avg=10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n        Example3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n            We calculated total=202750, num_weeks=7, so 202750/7 = 28964.285714285714...\n\n            Format to 10 decimal places: \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n        But wait, when I do 202750/7 in Python:\n\n            >>> 202750/7\n            28964.285714285714\n\n            Formatting with 10 decimal places: \n\n            >>> \"{:.10f}\".format(28964.285714285714)\n            '28964.2857142857'\n\n        However, note: the example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n        But wait, the example output string is '28964.2857142857' (exactly 10 digits after the decimal? Actually, the example output has 10 digits including the whole part? Let's count:\n\n            28964.2857142857 -> whole part is 5 digits, fractional part 10 digits? Actually, no: the format specification in Python produces 10 digits after the decimal point.\n\n            But the example output has 10 digits after the decimal? Actually, the example output is given as '28964.2857142857' which is 5 (whole) + 10 (fractional) = 15 digits.\n\n        The format {:.10f} produces 10 digits after the decimal, so the example output is 15 characters.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point\", and 10 is more than 6.\n\n        But the example outputs 10 digits.\n\n        We'll output 10 digits.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # If n==0, but n>=1 per constraints.\n\n            # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n            P = [0] * (n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            num_weeks = n - k + 1\n            total = 0.0\n            # Iterate over each week\n            for i in range(num_weeks):\n                total += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n            # Calculate the average\n            avg = total / num_weeks\n\n            # Format the average to have 10 decimal places\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\n        But note: we can also use the two-slice method which is slightly more efficient (one less operation in the inner loop) but same big O.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            # Using the two-slice method (without the for-loop for the weeks)\n            # total = (sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:num_weeks]))   # but wait, num_weeks = n-k+1, and the second part is P[0:num_weeks] (which is the first num_weeks elements) -> that's correct.\n\n            # However, note: the second part is the first (n-k+1) elements, which is correct.\n\n            # But we can do:\n\n            total = sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:num_weeks])\n\n        Then, the same.\n\n        Which is better? The two-slice method uses two built-in sum functions, which are implemented in C and fast.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method:\n\n            total = sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:num_weeks])\n\n        This is two passes (each of length about n) and then one subtraction.\n\n        The for-loop method is one pass (over the weeks) and then a division.\n\n        Both are O(n). \n\n        However, the two-slice method is shorter and avoids the loop.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method requires that we build the entire prefix array, which we already did.\n\n        Let me compare:\n\n            Two-slice method:\n\n                total = sum(P[k:]) - sum(P[:num_weeks])\n\n            For-loop method:\n\n                for i in range(num_weeks):\n                    total += P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n        The two-slice method does two full scans (each of about n) and the for-loop does one scan (of about n). \n\n        The two-slice method does two passes, the for-loop does one. So for-loop is better.\n\n        But wait, the two-slice method:\n\n            P[k:] has length n+1 - k, and P[:num_weeks] has length num_weeks (which is n-k+1). \n\n            The total work is O(n) for the first sum and O(n) for the second sum, so O(2n). The for-loop is O(n). \n\n        However, the constant factor for the two-slice method is higher. But both are acceptable for n=200000.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method is simpler and less prone to off-by-one errors? \n\n        Actually, we have to be cautious: the two-slice method uses two slices and then sums. The for-loop is straightforward.\n\n        I'll choose the for-loop method.\n\n        However, note: the for-loop iterates over num_weeks (n-k+1) which can be up to 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: if k is 1, then num_weeks is 200000, so the for-loop runs 200000 times.\n\n        This is acceptable because 200",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in total. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous subsequences of length k in a given sequence of n integers. The challenge is to do this efficiently without resorting to a brute-force method that would be too slow for large inputs (up to 200,000 elements).\n\n2. **Intuition**: The key insight is to use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subsequence. The prefix sum array allows us to calculate the sum of any k consecutive days in constant time by subtracting two elements from the prefix array.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the original sequence. This enables O(1) range sum queries.\n   - **Iterate Over Weeks**: For each starting index of a week (from 0 to n-k), compute the sum of the week using the prefix array and accumulate these sums.\n   - **Calculate Average**: Divide the total sum of all weeks by the number of weeks (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for constructing the prefix array and O(n) for iterating over all weeks, resulting in an overall linear time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    P = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(num_weeks):\n        total_sum += P[i+k] - P[i]\n        \n    avg = total_sum / num_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are n (number of days) and k (length of a week). The subsequent values are the sleep times for each day.\n\n2. **Prefix Array Construction**: The prefix array `P` is constructed such that `P[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep time array. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of any subsequence.\n\n3. **Summing Week Sums**: For each week starting at index `i`, the sum of sleep times from day `i` to day `i+k-1` is computed as `P[i+k] - P[i]`. These sums are accumulated into `total_sum`.\n\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is obtained by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`). The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the prefix sum technique to handle large input sizes within feasible time complexity, ensuring accurate and prompt computation of the desired average sleep time.",
