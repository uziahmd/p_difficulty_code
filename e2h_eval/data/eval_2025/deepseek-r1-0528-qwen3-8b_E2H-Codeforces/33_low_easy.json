You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two lines: the first is the integer `a` (as a string of digits) and the second is the sequence `s` (also as a string of digits).\n\n We can use each digit in `s` at most once, and we can choose any position in `a` to replace. We want to maximize the number.\n\n Important: The original number doesn't have leading zeros, and the answer must not have leading zeros.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are allowed to use replacements arbitrarily (each element in `s` at most once) and we can choose which positions to replace, we can think greedily:\n\n We want to make the leftmost digits as large as possible. However, note that if we replace a digit, we are replacing one digit with another. But we cannot introduce a leading zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to consider the available digits from `s` (which we can sort in descending order) and then try to assign the largest available digit to the leftmost positions that can be improved.\n\n However, note: We are not forced to use all the operations. We can choose which ones to use.\n\n But also note: We can use each digit in `s` at most once, and each operation is independent.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n - We are allowed to use each digit in `s` only once, so we have a multiset of digits from `s`. We can sort the digits in `s` in descending order.\n\n - Then, we traverse the digits of the original number from left to right. At each position, we consider: what is the maximum digit we can put here? \n   But note: we are allowed to do multiple replacements, but we can use each replacement only once.\n\n However, we must consider that we might want to save a larger digit for a later position? Actually, no: because the leftmost digit has the highest weight. So we should try to maximize the leftmost digit first.\n\n But caution: sometimes we might have a situation where we have two digits in `s`: '9' and '8'. The original digit is '1'. Then we would replace the first digit with '9'. But if the original digit is already '9', then we don't need to replace it. \n\n However, there's a catch: We might have more than one replacement. We want to maximize the entire number.\n\n Let me break down:\n\n We are allowed to replace any set of positions (without repetition) with the digits from `s` (each at most once). We want the maximum number.\n\n We can think:\n\n - We want to replace a digit in the original number with a digit from `s` only if the replacement digit is greater than the original one, and we have to choose the best available digit for the leftmost positions.\n\n However, what if we have a limited supply of high digits? We can use a greedy strategy:\n\n Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in `s` (or sort `s` and then use a multiset or just a sorted list).\n\n Step 2: Traverse the original number from left to right. For each digit, we consider: what is the best digit we can put here?\n\n But note: We are allowed to use each operation only once, and we can use the same digit multiple times if it appears multiple times? Actually, we are given a sequence s, so duplicates are allowed and each occurrence is separate.\n\n However, we can use each element of s only once, so if we use one '9' from s, then we cannot use it again.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let's create an array (or string) for the result, initially the original number.\n\n Then, we have a multiset (or a frequency dictionary) of the digits in s.\n\n Then, for each position from left to right:\n\n   We look at the current digit. We try to find the largest digit in our multiset that is greater than the current digit.\n\n   However, we must also consider: maybe we don't need to use the largest digit if we can use a smaller one and save the larger ones for later? But note: the goal is to maximize the entire number. Since we process from left to right, the leftmost digit is the most significant.\n\n   Actually, we should always use the largest digit available that is greater than the current digit? What if there are multiple digits greater? Then we take the largest.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two digits: [9, 8] and the current digit is 7. We replace with 9. Then we have 8 left. Then the next digit is 0, we can replace with 8 -> becomes 98.\n\n   Alternatively, if we replace the 7 with 8 and then the 0 with 9, then we get 89. Which is bigger? 98 > 89.\n\n   So we should use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit.\n\n   But",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, where each digit in the sequence can be used at most once. The goal is to perform these replacements in such a way that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves transforming the original number into the largest possible number by strategically replacing its digits with digits from a given sequence. Each digit in the sequence can be used only once, and we can choose any subset of the sequence for replacements.\n2. **Key Insight**: The leftmost digits have the highest significance. Therefore, to maximize the number, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest possible digits from the sequence that are greater than the original digit.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, we sort the sequence of digits in descending order to easily access the largest available digits.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, we replace it with the largest digit from the sorted sequence that is greater than the current digit. This ensures that each replacement contributes maximally to the overall value of the number.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - Sorting the sequence takes O(m log m) time, where m is the length of the sequence.\n   - Traversing the original number and performing replacements takes O(n) time, where n is the number of digits in the original number.\n   - The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(m log m + n), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    s_list = list(s_str)\n    s_list.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    result_list = list(a_str)\n    s_index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(result_list)):\n        if s_index >= len(s_list):\n            break\n        \n        current_digit = result_list[i]\n        found = False\n        \n        while s_index < len(s_list) and not found:\n            candidate = s_list[s_index]\n            s_index += 1\n            if candidate > current_digit:\n                result_list[i] = candidate\n                found = True\n        \n    print(''.join(result_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The original number and the sequence of digits are read from standard input.\n2. **Sorting Digits**: The sequence of digits is sorted in descending order to prioritize larger digits during replacements.\n3. **Greedy Replacement**: For each digit in the original number (from left to right), the algorithm checks if there's a larger digit available in the sorted sequence. If found, it replaces the current digit with the largest available digit that is greater than it.\n4. **Output**: The modified number, after all possible beneficial replacements, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal use of the available replacement digits while adhering to the problem constraints.",
