    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (0-indexed in our mind, but note the problem says first, second, etc.), the inner rectangle it uses has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)   [but note: the first ring (i=1) uses the entire w and h, then subtracts 4 for each subsequent ring?]\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n However, note that the first ring is the outermost. For the first ring (i=1): \n   w1 = w, h1 = h -> the ring is the outer border, which is 2*w + 2*h - 4 (since the corners are counted twice).\n\n But wait, let's break down the ring calculation:\n\n Actually, we can compute the number of cells in the i-th ring as the perimeter of the inner rectangle (with width = w - 4*(i-1) and height = h - 4*(i-1)) minus the next inner perimeter if we were to have a next ring? \n\n Alternatively, think of it as:\n\n Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1) and m_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the i-th ring is the border of this inner rectangle. However, note that the ring has width 1. So the number of cells in the ring is:\n   top and bottom: each has length n_i (but wait, the inner rectangle for the ring is actually of size (n_i, m_i) and the border is the same as the outer rectangle of an (n_i, m_i) plate.\n\n But note: the problem states that the i-th ring goes along the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). This inner rectangle is the entire area we are considering for the i-th ring, and the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n So the number of cells for the i-th ring is the perimeter of that inner rectangle, but wait: the inner rectangle has a border that is 1 cell thick. However, the standard way to compute the border of a rectangle (without overlapping) is:\n\n   If the inner rectangle has dimensions n_i x m_i, then the border (which is the set of cells that are either on the top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column) is:\n\n     top row: m_i cells\n     bottom row: m_i cells\n     left column (excluding the top and bottom already counted): (n_i - 2) cells\n     right column (excluding the top and bottom already counted): (n_i - 2) cells\n\n So total = 2 * m_i + 2 * (n_i - 2) = 2*m_i + 2*n_i - 4 = 2*(m_i+n_i) - 4.\n\n However, note that the inner rectangle must have at least 1x1 to have a border? Actually, if n_i <= 0 or m_i <= 0, then we cannot form a ring. But the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), so we are safe.\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring uses the entire plate, so for i=1:\n   n_1 = w, m_1 = h -> then the number of cells for the first ring would be 2*(w+h) - 4.\n\n Example: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> matches example.\n\n Second example: w=7, h=9, k=1 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4=28 -> matches.\n\n Third example: w=7, h=9, k=2 -> then we have two rings.\n\n For the first ring (i=1): 2*(7+9)-4 = 28.\n For the second ring (i=2): \n   n_2 = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3\n   m_2 = 9 - 4*(2-1)=5\n   Then the second ring: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4=12",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, and each ring has a width of 1 cell. The first ring is placed along the outer edge of the plate, and subsequent rings are placed inward.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring's dimensions can be derived from the original plate dimensions by reducing both width and height by 4 for each subsequent ring (since each ring moves inward by 2 cells on each side). The number of cells in each ring is calculated as the perimeter of the inner rectangle formed by these dimensions minus the overlapping parts.\n2. **Insight**: For the i-th ring, the inner rectangle dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). The number of cells in this ring is then given by the formula: \\(2 \\times (n_i + m_i) - 4\\), where \\(n_i\\) and \\(m_i\\) are the width and height of the inner rectangle, respectively.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating through each ring from 1 to k, computing the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, and summing the cells for all rings. The loop runs k times, each time adjusting the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting 4 from both width and height.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, which is efficient given the constraints (k is at most floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4) and w, h are up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        n = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        m = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * (n + m) - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells for all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Calculate Inner Dimensions**: The inner rectangle dimensions are computed by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both width and height. This adjustment accounts for the inward shift of each subsequent ring.\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes non-positive, the loop breaks early as further rings would not be feasible.\n   - **Sum Cells**: The number of cells for the current ring is calculated using the perimeter formula \\(2 \\times (n + m) - 4\\) and added to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and straightforward arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
