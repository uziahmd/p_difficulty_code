In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, s).\n We have to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu (which can be a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that initially there are 3 tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (each one any tile) until we have a set that contains at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note: We don't necessarily need to use all the drawn tiles. We just need to have at least one mentsu (three tiles) in the entire hand.\n\n Since we can draw any tiles, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Already have a mentsu (0 draws)\n   - Check for koutsu: three identical tiles? (same digit and same suit)\n   - Check for shuntsu: three consecutive digits (in sorted order) and same suit.\n\n Option 2: If not, then maybe by drawing 1 tile we can form a mentsu?\n   - After drawing one tile, we have four tiles. But note: the problem does not require that the entire hand is used for the mentsu. Actually, the condition is that there is at least one mentsu (a set of three tiles). So we can use three out of the four.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile, and we can choose which one to draw. We want the minimum number of draws.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 0: Already has a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n Case 1: Can we form a mentsu with one draw?\n   We have three tiles. We can draw one tile, so we have four tiles. Then, we need to check if among these four we can form a mentsu.\n\n   But note: we don't need to use the drawn tile necessarily in the mentsu? Actually, we can ignore the other tiles. However, the mentsu must be three tiles from the hand. So we can use the drawn tile and two of the original ones, or three of the original ones (if we drew a tile we might break an existing koutsu? but wait, we are only drawing one and we can choose any tile, so we can avoid breaking an existing triplet if we had one? Actually, we already checked for 0 draws, so if there's no mentsu, then we need to form one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: we are going to add one tile, and then we look for a mentsu. The added tile can complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n   How can we form a triplet with one draw?\n     - We have two tiles of the same kind: then we need one more to complete the triplet.\n     - Or, we have one tile of a kind, then we cannot complete a triplet with one draw (because we need two more).\n\n   How can we form a sequence with one draw?\n     - Consider each suit separately. For a given suit, we have some numbers. We can look for gaps in sequences.\n\n   However, note: we can also draw a tile that is not in the same suit as the original ones? Actually, the problem says we can draw any tile. But a sequence must be of the same suit. So if we are forming a sequence, the drawn tile must be of the same suit as the two other tiles we are using.\n\n   But wait: we have three tiles. They might be of different suits. We can only form a sequence within one suit.\n\n   Steps for one-draw:\n\n   Possibility 1: Drawing a tile to complete a triplet (if we have two of the same tile). Then the drawn tile is exactly that tile.\n\n   Possibility 2: Drawing a tile to complete a sequence (if we have two consecutive numbers in the same suit, then we can draw the missing one to form a sequence). But note: we can also have two non-consecutive numbers and then draw a tile to form a sequence? Actually, for a sequence we need three consecutive. So if we have two tiles of the same suit, say [x, y] (with x and y being the same suit), then we can form a sequence if the two tiles are consecutive or if they are separated by one missing number.\n\n   However, we have three tiles. They could be:\n\n   Example: ['1m', '2m', '4m'] -> we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] or [2m,3m,4m] (actually [1m,2m,3m] is one sequence and [2m,3m,4m] is another). But note: we are drawing one tile and then we have four tiles. Then we can pick three to form a sequence",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same digit and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive digits in the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n\n2. **Check for One-Draw Mentsu**: If no mentsu exists initially, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing the third one completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: If there are two tiles of the same suit with consecutive or near-consecutive numbers, drawing the missing tile completes a sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two-Draw Mentsu**: If neither of the above conditions is met, then drawing two tiles is sufficient to form a mentsu. For example, drawing two identical tiles to complete a triplet or filling two gaps in a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    tiles = [tile[0] for tile in data]\n    suits = [tile[1] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing koutsu or shuntsu\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for shuntsu in the same suit\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        indices = [i for i in range(3) if suits[i] == suit]\n        if len(indices) < 3:\n            continue\n        nums = sorted([int(tiles[i]) for i in indices])\n        if len(nums) == 3 and nums[2] == nums[0] + 2:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n    # Check for one-draw possibilities\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_tiles = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        count_tiles[t] += 1\n        \n    count_suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(3):\n        count_suits[suits[i]].append(tiles[i])\n        \n    # Check for two same tiles that can be completed by one draw for triplet\n    found_one = False\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        if len(count_suits[suit]) >= 2:\n            nums = sorted(set(count_suits[suit]))\n            num_count = {}\n            for num_str in nums:\n                num_count[num_str] = count_suits[suit].count(num_str)\n            for num_str in nums:\n                if num_count[num_str] == 2:\n                    # Drawing one more of this tile would complete a triplet\n                    found_one = True\n                    break\n            if found_one:\n                break\n                \n    if found_one:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one-draw possibilities for sequences\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        if len(count_suits[suit]) < 2:\n            continue\n        nums = sorted(set(count_suits[suit]))\n        num_count = {}\n        for num_str in nums:\n            num_count[num_str] = count_suits[suit].count(num_str)\n        num_list = [int(x) for x in nums]\n        for i in range(len(num_list) - 1):\n            if num_list[i+1] - num_list[i] == 1:\n                if num_count[str(num_list[i])] >= 1 and num_count[str(num_list[i+1])] >= 1:\n                    # We have two consecutive numbers, now check if we can form a sequence by drawing one tile\n                    # The sequence could be [num_list[i]-1, num_list[i], num_list[i+1]] or [num_list[i], num_list[i+1], num_list[i+1]+1]\n                    if num_list[i] - 1 in num_count:\n                        if num_count.get(str(num_list[i] - 1), 0) >= 1:\n                            found_one = True\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        if num_list[i+1] + 1 in num_count:\n                            if num_count.get(str(num_list[i+1] + 1), 0) >= 1:\n                                found_one = True\n                                break\n            elif num_list[i+1] - num_list[i] == 2:\n                mid = num_list[i] + 1\n                if str(mid) in num_count and num_count.get(str(mid), 0) >= 1:\n                    if num_count[num_list[i]] >= 1 and num_count[num_list[i+1]] >= 1:\n                        found_one = True\n                        break\n        if found_one:\n            break\n            \n    if found_one:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # If still not found, then two draws are needed\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the three tiles form a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). If either is found, it immediately returns 0 since no draws are needed.\n2. **One-Draw Check for Triplet**: It then checks if there are two identical tiles in any suit. If so, drawing one more of the same tile completes a triplet, requiring only one draw.\n3. **One-Draw Check for Sequence**: Next, it checks if there are two tiles of the same suit with consecutive or near-consecutive numbers. If the missing tile(s) required to complete a sequence can be drawn in one go, it returns 1.\n4. **Two-Draw Default**: If none of the above conditions are met, the solution defaults to requiring two draws, as drawing two tiles (either two identical tiles for a triplet or two specific tiles to complete a sequence) will suffice.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws needed, ensuring optimal performance even for the given constraints.",
