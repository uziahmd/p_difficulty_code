He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (indicating Roman numerals) or both integers.\n The second line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is an integer and not 'R', then we convert the number from base a to base 10 (as an integer), then from base 10 to base b.\n 2. If b is 'R', then we convert from base a to base 10, then convert the base 10 integer to a Roman numeral string (with the condition that the number is between 1 and 300010).\n 3. Similarly, if a is given as an integer and b is 'R', then we do the same: base a to base 10, then to Roman.\n\n But note: the input format says the first line has two tokens. The second token might be 'R'. Also, the first token is an integer, but the second might be either an integer or 'R'.\n\n Important: The problem states that the input number c is given in base a and may contain leading zeros, but its length is <= 1000.\n\n However, note that the base a can be as high as 25, and the number c in base a can have up to 1000 digits. We must be cautious with converting from base a to base 10 because the number might be very large (but the problem says that if it's Roman, then the number is <= 300010, so for non-Roman bases, the number can be up to 10^1510? Actually, wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — which I think is a typo. Let me re-read: \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that would be a huge number. Alternatively, it says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\". So the string length is at most 1000, but the base a is at most 25, so the maximum value for non-Roman cases is (a^1000) which is astronomical. However, the problem also says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that might be a mistake. Actually, looking at the example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" — which is 1111001 in base2, which is 1234567 in decimal. Then we convert to base2 again, so output is the same.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that seems to mean 10^(15*10)=10^150? Or maybe 10^15 then 10? But actually, the example input \"12 13\\nA\" — that's A in base12, which is 10 in base12, then we convert to base13: 10 in base13 is represented as 'A'. \n\n However, the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning that when b is not R, the number c (in base a) is guaranteed to be <= 10^(15^10). But wait, 15^10 is 576650390625, and 10^that is too big to represent. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant the decimal representation of the number is at most 10^15? Or the number itself is at most 10^15? But the example says the number in base a (which is given as a string) is non-negative and in base a (with digits allowed up to a-1). \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". This is ambiguous. But note: the input string length is at most 1000, so we cannot convert the entire string to an integer if the base is 2 and the string is 1000 ones (which is 2^1000 - 1, a number with about 300 digits). But 10^15^10 is way bigger than 2^1000. \n\n Let me clarify: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". But wait, the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" — that's 1000 digits? Actually, no, that example is 7 digits. The problem says the length doesn't exceed 1000, so we can have up to 1000 digits.\n\n However, the guarantee for non-Roman cases is that the number is <= 10^15^10. This is likely a typo and they meant 10^15 or something else. But note: the example input \"12 13\\nA\" — that's a one-digit number, so no problem.\n\n Since the problem says that in non-Roman cases the number is at most 10^15^10, which is a number with 15^10+1 digits, which is 576650390625+1 digits, which is too many to store as an integer. Therefore, we cannot convert the entire string to an integer if we use standard integer types.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n For conversion from base a to base b (if b is an integer) or to Roman, we need to handle numbers that are too big for standard integers.\n\n However, note the conditions:\n\n 1. When converting to Roman: the number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 (so we can safely use an integer representation for that part).\n\n 2. When converting to an integer base (non-Roman): the problem says the number is at most 10^15^10. But 10^15^10 is a number with 15^10+1 digits, which is about 576 billion digits. That is impossible to store as an integer.\n\n Therefore, the problem must mean something else. Let me read again: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". This is ambiguous. Maybe it's 10^15, i.e., 1e15? But then the example \"2 2\\n1111001\" is 1234567, which is less than 1e15. But then what about base 2 with 1000 digits? The maximum base2 number with 1000 digits is 2^1000 - 1, which is about 1e300, which is greater than 1e15.\n\n Alternatively, the problem statement might have been intended to say: \"In any other case the decimal representation of the number (when written in base10) is at most 10^15\", but then base2 with 1000 digits is too big.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \n   \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\"\n\n Wait, the problem says \"the number\" (meaning the value) in non-Roman cases is not greater than 10^15^10. But 10^15^10 is a very big number. However, the input string is only up to 1000 digits. We must avoid converting the entire string to a big integer if it's too big.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the number\" (the value) is <= 10^15^10. So if we are to output base b (an integer base), we must convert the big number from base a to base10, then to base b. But if the base10 representation is too big (like 10^15^10 has 15^10+1 digits, which is 576650390626 digits, which is too many), then we cannot use standard integer conversion.\n\n However, the problem also says that the input string has at most 1000 digits. The value of the number in base a is at most (a^1000) - 1. And a is at most 25. 25^1000 is an astronomically huge number. But the guarantee says the number (the value) is <= 10^15^10. \n\n This is confusing. Let me check the examples: the examples are small.\n\n After reading the problem statement again, I see: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". But wait, there's a possibility that the problem meant 10^15? Or maybe 10^10? Or perhaps it's a typo and it's 10^15.\n\n But note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is 7 digits, and the value is 1234567, which is less than 10^15.\n\n Another example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> 10 in base12 is 10, which is less than 10^15.\n\n The problem says: \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning 10^(15^10). But 15^10 is 576650390625, so 10^(576650390625) is a number with 576650390626 digits. This is impossible to store.\n\n Therefore, I suspect the problem statement has a typo. It should be \"the number won't be greater than 10^15\" (i.e., one quadrillion) or something more reasonable. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\". \n\n There is a contradiction: if the base a is 2, then a number of 1000 digits can be as large as 2^1000, which is about 1e301, which is greater than 10^15. So the guarantee must be for the decimal representation? Or the problem means the input string length is 1000, but the actual value is bounded by 10^15^10? \n\n Given the confusion, let me look at the constraints again:\n\n - a, b are between 2 and 25, inclusive, and b can be 'R'.\n - The input string (number in base a) has length at most 1000.\n\n Since the problem says that in non-Roman cases the number (value) is <= 10^15^10, but 10^15^10 is a fixed huge number, we can assume that the input numbers for non-Roman cases are such that their value is within the range that we can handle with Python's big integers? Because Python can handle arbitrarily large integers, but the operations (like converting to base b) might be slow for numbers with millions of digits.\n\n However, 10^15^10 is a number with about 576 billion digits, which is too many to store. Therefore, the problem must mean something else.\n\n Another interpretation: the problem says \"the number\" (the value) is <= 10^15^10. But 10^15^10 is 10 raised to the power of (15*10) = 10^150. That is a number with 151 digits. But wait, the input string is up to 1000 digits in base a (at most base25). The value of a base25 number with 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is much larger than 10^150.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have meant: the number (in base10) is at most 10^15. Then base2 with 1000 digits is too big. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — which is 10^(15^10). \n\n I think the problem intended to say: the number (the value) is at most 10^15 (one quadrillion) or 10^100 (a googol) or something. But the example inputs are small.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So for Roman, we have a bound (<=300010). For non-Roman, we have a bound of 10^15^10, which is huge.\n\n Since the problem says the input string has at most 1000 digits and base a is at least 2, the number can be very large. But the guarantee for non-Roman is that the value is <= 10^15^10. So we can assume that the input numbers for non-Roman cases are not arbitrary 1000-digit base a numbers, but they are chosen such that the value is <= 10^15^10.\n\n However, 10^15^10 is a fixed number, so even if the input string is long, the value is bounded by that. But 10^15^10 is so huge that even a 1000-digit base25 number (which is 25^1000) is about 10^(1000*log10(25)) ~ 10^(1000*1.4) = 10^1400, and 10^1400 is greater than 10^15^10 (which is 10^150). So wait, 10^1400 > 10^150, so the input could be a 1000-digit base25 number that exceeds 10^150. But the problem says the number is <= 10^15^10. So the input must be such that the value is <= 10^150.\n\n Therefore, we must design the conversion without converting the entire string to an integer if the base is low and the string is long. \n\n But note: the base a is at most 25, and the number of digits is at most 1000. The maximum value is 25^1000, which is about 10^1400, and 10^1400 is greater than 10^150 (which is the bound). However, the problem says the number is at most 10^15^10 (which is 10^150). So the input will not give a number that is too big? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". So we can assume that the input numbers for non-Roman cases are such that their value is <= 10^150.\n\n Now, 10^150 is a number with 151 digits. We can convert the input string to an integer if the base is not too high and the length is 1000, but the integer might have up to 151 digits. Python can handle integers with thousands of digits, but 10^150 is 151 digits, which is acceptable.\n\n However, wait: the input string can be 1000 digits in base2. The value of a base2 number with 1000 digits is 2^1000, which is about 10^301, which is greater than 10^150. So the problem guarantee is that the value is <= 10^150, so the base2 input with 1000 digits must be a number that is <= 10^150. That means the base2 number must have at most floor(log2(10^150)) + 1 = floor(150*log10(2)) + 1 = floor(150*0.3010) + 1 = floor(45.15)+1 = 45+1 = 46 digits. So the input string for base2 in non-Roman cases will have at most 46 digits? \n\n Similarly, for base3: log3(10^150) = 150 * log10(3) / log10(3) — wait, we need the maximum length L such that (base-1)^L <= 10^150? Actually, the value of a base-a number with L digits is at most (a^L)-1. We require a^L <= 10^150 + 1. So L <= log_a(10^150) = 150 * log10(a) / log10(10) — no, actually: a^L <= 10^150 => L * log10(a) <= 150 => L <= 150 / log10(a)\n\n For base2: L <= 150 / 0.3010 ≈ 498.3 -> so 498 digits? But wait, 2^498 is about 10^150 (because 498 * log10(2) ≈ 498 * 0.3010 ≈ 150). So base2 input can have up to 498 digits. But the problem says the input string length doesn't exceed 1000, so that is acceptable.\n\n However, the guarantee is that the value is <= 10^150, so the input string for base a (non-Roman) must be such that the value is <= 10^150. \n\n So, we can do:\n\n Step 1: Read a and b.\n\n Step 2: Read the string s (the number in base a).\n\n Step 3: If b is 'R':\n    Convert s from base a to a base10 integer (if the base10 integer is 0, then output empty string? But note: the problem says for Roman, the number is not 0 and <=300010. So we don't have to handle 0.\n    Then convert the base10 integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n Step 4: Else (b is an integer):\n    Convert s from base a to a base10 integer. But note: the input s is a string that may contain digits and possibly letters (if base > 10, then digits above 9 are represented by letters). The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n    How to convert from base a to base10?\n        We can iterate over each character in the string and compute the value.\n\n    Then, convert the base10 integer to base b (if the base10 integer is 0, then output \"0\", unless the problem says non-negative and 0 is allowed? The problem says non-negative, and the example never includes 0. But note: the problem says the Roman numeral case excludes 0, but for non-Roman, we must consider 0. However, the problem says \"non-negative\", so 0 is possible. But the Roman case says \"it won't be 0\", so if we get 0 and b is not 'R', then we output \"0\".\n\n    However, the problem says: \"You must omit leading zeros.\" So if the base10 integer is 0, then the output should be \"0\", not omitted.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\" — so if the base10 integer is 0, then we output \"0\". For positive integers, we output the base b representation without leading zeros.\n\n However, the issue is: the base10 integer might be too big to represent as a normal integer? But the problem says the value is <= 10^15^10, which is 10^150, and 10^150 is an integer that Python can handle (it's 1 followed by 150 zeros). But wait, 10^150 is a number with 151 digits, which is acceptable for Python's int.\n\n But wait, the input string can be up to 1000 digits, and base a is up to 25, so the maximum value is 25^1000. However, the problem guarantees that the value is <= 10^150, so we don't have to worry about numbers beyond 10^150.\n\n However, 25^1000 is (25^10)^100, and 25^10 is 95367431640625 (15 digits), then raised to 100 is astronomical. But the guarantee says the value is <= 10^150, so the input string must represent a number that is <= 10^150.\n\n Therefore, we can convert the input string to an integer in base10 by processing each digit, but note: the base a is given, and the digits in the string are either digits or uppercase letters from 'A' to ... (depending on base). \n\n Steps for base a to base10:\n\n   total = 0\n   for each char in s:\n        if char is a digit: d = int(char)\n        elif char is a letter: d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        then total = total * a + d\n\n But wait, if the base a is 11, then the digit 'A' represents 10, which is correct.\n\n However, we must validate that each character is a valid digit for base a. The problem says the input is in base a, so we assume the digits are valid.\n\n But note: the input string may contain leading zeros.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10 to base2: 1 is \"1\"\n   Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base16 to Roman: 5 is \"V\"\n\n But wait, the example: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base5 to Roman: 4 is \"IV\"\n\n However, the example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2 to base2: 1111001 is 1234567 in base10, and then in base2 is \"1111001\", so output \"1111001\"\n\n Example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12: A is 10, then base13: 10 is represented as 'A'\n\n But note: in base13, the digits go from 0 to 12. The problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — so for base13, we use A for 10, B for 11, C for 12, and then D for 13? Actually, no: the representation of 13 in base13 would be \"10\", but the problem says we are converting 10 (decimal) to base13. 10 in base13 is a single digit: since 10 < 13, so we use the digit for 10, which is 'A'.\n\n However, the example input \"12 13\\nA\" is: \n   First token: 12 (base a=12)\n   Second token: 13 (base b=13)\n   The number is \"A\", which in base12 is 10 (decimal). Then we convert 10 (decimal) to base13: which is \"A\".\n\n Implementation:\n\n We'll break down:\n\n 1. Parse the first line: two tokens. The first is an integer a, the second is either an integer (then convert to string and compare with 'R'? No, wait: the input may have the second token as a string. But the problem says: the first line contains two integers a and b, but b may be replaced by 'R'. So we read the first token as integer, the second token as string.\n\n    Example: \"10 2\" -> a=10, b='2'\n    Example: \"16 R\" -> a=16, b='R'\n\n 2. Read the next line: the string s.\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n        n = convert_base_a_to_int(s, a)   # This returns the integer value in base10\n        roman = convert_int_to_roman(n)\n        print(roman)\n\n 4. Else:\n        n = convert_base_a_to_int(s, a)\n        # Now convert n to base b (which is an integer base)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num = n\n            # We convert n to base b, but note: the base b is between 2 and 25.\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n            # Now, we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first). We need to reverse.\n            s_digits = [str(x) if x < 10 else chr(ord('A') + x - 10) for x in reversed(digits)]\n            print(''.join(s_digits))\n\n But wait, the problem says: the input number c is non-negative. So we don't have negative.\n\n However, the above conversion for base a to base10 might be done with a loop. But note: the input string can be up to 1000 digits, and the base a is up to 25, so the integer n can be up to 10^150, which is a number with 151 digits. Python can handle that, but the conversion from base a to base10 by iterating 1000 times is acceptable.\n\n But wait, the base a is given, and the digits: for example, base a=25, then the digits can be from '0' to 'T' (since T is the 20th letter? Actually, base25: digits 0-9, then A=10, B=11, ..., Y=24. So the digit 'Z' is not used. The input string will only contain digits and uppercase letters, and the digits must be in the range [0, a-1].\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact characters used for bases above 10, but it says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n So we can do:\n\n   def convert_base_a_to_int(s, a):\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            # But note: if the base a is 11, then d must be in [0,10]. The input is guaranteed to be in base a, so d should be < a.\n\n            n = n * a + d\n\n        return n\n\n However, we must be cautious: the input string might have leading zeros, but that doesn't affect the integer value.\n\n But wait: the problem says the number is non-negative and the string may contain leading zeros.\n\n Example: base10, string \"00\" -> 0.\n\n But the problem says: omit leading zeros in the output. So if the base10 integer is 0, we output \"0\", and if the base10 integer is positive, we output the base b representation without leading zeros.\n\n However, the above function for base a to base10 works for 0.\n\n But wait: the Roman numeral case: the problem says the number is not zero. So if we get 0 and b is 'R', then we don't have to handle it (because the input guarantee says non-zero). But if we get 0 and b is an integer, then we output \"0\".\n\n Now, the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n We need a function that converts an integer (from 1 to 300010) to a Roman numeral string.\n\n Steps for Roman numeral conversion:\n\n   We can use a mapping of the standard Roman numerals, including subtractive notation.\n\n   Standard Roman numerals use the following symbols:\n      M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n   We can create a list of tuples:\n\n      roman_numerals = [\n          (1000, \"M\"),\n          (900, \"CM\"),\n          (500, \"D\"),\n          (400, \"CD\"),\n          (100, \"C\"),\n          (90, \"XC\"),\n          (50, \"L\"),\n          (40, \"XL\"),\n          (10, \"X\"),\n          (9, \"IX\"),\n          (5, \"V\"),\n          (4, \"IV\"),\n          (1, \"I\")\n      ]\n\n   Then, we can define:\n\n      def convert_int_to_roman(n):\n          result = []\n          for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n              while n >= value:\n                  n -= value\n                  result.append(symbol)\n          return ''.join(result)\n\n   However, this algorithm is standard.\n\n   But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010. Our list goes up to 1000, so we cover 300010? \n\n   Let's check: 300010 is 300000 + 10. 300000 is 300 * 1000, but our list doesn't have 300000. Actually, the standard Roman numerals don't have a standard way to represent numbers above 3999. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, and the example includes up to 300010.\n\n   According to the problem, they use the same system as described (including subtractive and using the same symbols). But 300010 is 300000 + 10. 300000 is 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n   So they are using the standard subtractive method. But how to represent 300000? \n\n   The problem doesn't specify beyond 4000. However, the example input \"5 R\\n4\" is 4, which is \"IV\", so they are using the standard.\n\n   But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we must represent numbers up to 300010.\n\n   Standard Roman numerals didn't have a standard way for numbers above 3999. However, sometimes they used an overline, but the problem doesn't mention that. \n\n   Alternatively, we can extend the list by breaking down the number into thousands, hundreds, etc.\n\n   However, 300010 is 300000 + 10. We can break 300000 as 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the same system\" — meaning the same set of symbols? Then we have to use multiple M's? \n\n   Actually, the standard system uses the same symbols repeated, but limited to three. For example, 4000 is MMMM? But wait, the subtractive principle is for the next higher symbol. \n\n   However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so 300000 is the maximum. We can represent 300000 as \"MMMC\"? No, because M is 1000, so 300000 is 300 * 1000. But in Roman numerals, we break the number into thousands, hundreds, etc.\n\n   Actually, the standard representation for 300000 is \"MMMC\" is not correct. The standard is to use the thousands place: 300000 is 3 * 100000, but without a symbol for 100000, we would write \"MMMC\" for 300000? No, that would be 3000 + 100, which is 3100.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the additive principle: 100000 is represented by a bar over M, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\n   Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we can break the number as:\n\n   We can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999, and then for numbers above 3999, we break the number into groups of thousands. But the problem does not specify.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"the same system\" — meaning the same symbols. So we have the symbols up to M (1000). Then to represent 2000, we use MM. 3000 is MMM. 4000 is MMMM? But wait, the subtractive principle is used for the next higher symbol, which is not defined. \n\n   But the problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base\". The base here refers to the next higher symbol. So for 4000, we use the next higher symbol? But there isn't one. \n\n   However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we don't have to handle 4000 or above. So we can simply use the additive form for the thousands: 1000=M, 2000=MM, 3000=MMM, 4000=MMMM (but we don't need 4000). \n\n   So we can modify the list to include:\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n\n   But wait, ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either a standard integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting the resulting base 10 number to the desired output base (either an integer base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values, which include the source base (a), the target base (b), and the number string (c) in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input number string from the source base to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its decimal value, and accumulating the total value by considering the positional value of each digit.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base 10 number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (using letters for values greater than 9).\n   - **Roman Numeral**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 number to a Roman numeral by using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols. The conversion involves subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols until the number is reduced to zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"Invalid input for base a\")\n        return\n        \n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    def convert_base_a_to_int(s, a):\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            if d >= a:\n                continue\n            n = n * a + d\n        return n\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        num = convert_base_a_to_int(s, a)\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n        else:\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, \"M\"),\n                (900, \"CM\"),\n                (500, \"D\"),\n                (400, \"CD\"),\n                (100, \"C\"),\n                (90, \"XC\"),\n                (50, \"L\"),\n                (40, \"XL\"),\n                (10, \"X\"),\n                (9, \"IX\"),\n                (5, \"V\"),\n                (4, \"IV\"),\n                (1, \"I\")\n            ]\n            roman_parts = []\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while num >= value:\n                    num -= value\n                    roman_parts.append(symbol)\n            roman_str = ''.join(roman_parts)\n            print(roman_str)\n            \n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except Exception:\n            print(\"Invalid input for base b\")\n            return\n            \n        num = convert_base_a_to_int(s, a)\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n_val = num\n            while n_val:\n                n_val, r = divmod(n_val, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n            digits.reverse()\n            res = []\n            for digit in digits:\n                if digit < 10:\n                    res.append(str(digit))\n                else:\n                    res.append(chr(ord('A') + digit - 10))\n            print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line specifies the source base (a) and the target base (b), which can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line provides the number string (c) in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The function `convert_base_a_to_int` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its decimal value and accumulating the total value by considering the base. For example, the string \"1A\" in base 16 would be converted to 26 in decimal.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs. The algorithm repeatedly subtracts the largest possible Roman numeral value from the number and appends the corresponding symbol to the result string.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: If the target base is an integer, the base 10 number is divided by the target base repeatedly. The remainders of these divisions are collected and mapped to their corresponding digits (using letters for values 10 and above). These digits are then reversed to form the correct output string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and the more complex Roman numeral conversion, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
