The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000). There are n+2 towns (0 to n+1). We build a tower in each town i (for i from 1 to n) with probability 1/2 independently.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n2. Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one radio tower.\n\nConditions for a tower at town i (with power p):\n- It reaches every city c such that |c - i| < p.\n\nWe need to compute the probability that there exists a way to set the signal powers so that the constraints are met.\n\nObservation:\n\nFirst, note that the problem requires that each town j (from 1 to n) is covered by exactly one tower. This implies that we must have a tower in at least one of the towns (because if a town is not built, then it cannot be covered). However, note that the constraint says \"exactly one\", so even if a tower could cover multiple towns, we must assign each town to exactly one tower and no two towers should cover the same town (except possibly that a tower might cover multiple towns, but then the coverage must be disjoint).\n\nMoreover, the two endpoints (0 and n+1) must not be covered.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The leftmost town that can be covered without covering town 0 is town 1: because a tower at town 1 with power p must satisfy that the leftmost point it covers is 1-p+? Actually, the condition for covering a town c is |c-i| < p. So for town 0, we require that no tower has |0-i| < p, i.e., for all built towers at i, p <= i (since |0-i|=i, so we need i < p => p>=i+1 would cover 0? Actually, wait: the condition for covering 0 is |0-i| < p, i.e., i < p. So to avoid covering 0, for a tower at i, we must set p <= i (because if p = i+1, then |0-i| = i < i+1, so 0 is covered). Therefore, for a tower at i, we must set its power p <= i.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1, the condition is |n+1 - i| < p. To avoid covering n+1, we must set p <= n+1-i.\n\nBut note: we also have to cover each town from 1 to n exactly once.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not require that the signal power is set arbitrarily. We have freedom to choose the power for each tower as long as the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"after building the towers, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from 1 to n\". \n\nNow, let's consider what a valid configuration requires.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to: we have a set S (subset of {1,2,...,n}) of built towers. Then we must assign to each tower in S a power p_i (an integer from 1 to n) such that:\n\nFor each town j (from 1 to n):\n  There is exactly one tower i in S such that |j - i| < p_i.\n\nAdditionally, for the endpoints:\n  For all i in S, p_i <= i   (so that 0 is not covered) and p_i <= n+1-i (so that n+1 is not covered). But note: the condition for 0 is that no tower satisfies |0-i| < p_i, i.e., p_i > i. Similarly, the condition for n+1 is that no tower satisfies |n+1-i| < p_i, i.e., p_i > n+1-i. However, the problem states that we set the power and then the constraints must hold. But note: the problem says we set the powers after building the towers, and we can choose any power from 1 to n.\n\nWait: actually, the problem states two separate constraints:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 don't get any signal.\n2. Towns 1,2,...,n get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nSo for condition 1: we must ensure that for every tower i (if built), the chosen power p_i is such that:\n   p_i <= i   [to avoid covering 0] \n   p_i <= n+1-i [to avoid covering n+1]\n\nBut wait, that is not the entire story. Because the condition for covering is |c - i| < p_i. So to avoid covering 0, we require that the leftmost point covered by tower i is at least 1 (the next town). The leftmost",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2, there exists a way to set signal powers for these towers such that towns 0 and n+1 do not receive any signal, and each town from 1 to n receives signal from exactly one tower. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a valid configuration to exist, the built towers must be contiguous from some leftmost town `l` to some rightmost town `r`, forming a block of consecutive towns where all towers are built. The leftmost town `l` must satisfy `l <= n+1 - l` (i.e., `l <= (n+1)/2`), and similarly, the rightmost town `r` must satisfy `r >= ceil((n+1)/2)`. This ensures that the entire block can be covered without overlapping signals beyond the required towns.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that a contiguous block of towns from `l` to `r` is built (and possibly some towns outside this block are not built) is calculated by considering the number of such valid blocks. Each valid block contributes a probability of `(1/2)^(r-l+1)` multiplied by the probability that the towns outside the block are not built. The total probability is the sum over all valid contiguous blocks.\n\n3. **Modulo Handling**: Since the result needs to be presented modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic throughout the calculation, including the computation of powers and the summation of probabilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    inv2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    total = 0\n    \n    L = 1\n    R = n\n    while L < R:\n        if L < (n + 1) // 2 + 1:\n            if R > (n + 1) // 2:\n                break\n        else:\n            break\n        length = R - L + 1\n        ways_inside = pow(2, n - (R - L + 1), MOD)  # Not building the outside ones\n        power = pow(inv2, length, MOD)\n        total = (total + ways_inside * power) % MOD\n        R += 1\n        L = n - (R - 1)\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n` and handling the special case when `n = 1` directly.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic Setup**: The modular inverse of 2 (`inv2`) is precomputed for efficient division under modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Loop Through Valid Blocks**: The loop runs from the smallest valid leftmost town `L` to the largest valid rightmost town `R`. For each block `[L, R]`, the number of ways to not build towers outside this block is calculated as `2^(n - (R-L+1))`.\n4. **Probability Calculation**: For each valid block, the probability that all towers within the block are built is `(1/2)^(length of the block)`. This probability is multiplied by the number of ways to not build towers outside the block and added to the total probability.\n5. **Output**: The total probability, computed modulo 998244353, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible contiguous blocks of built towers that can form a valid configuration, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure correctness.",
