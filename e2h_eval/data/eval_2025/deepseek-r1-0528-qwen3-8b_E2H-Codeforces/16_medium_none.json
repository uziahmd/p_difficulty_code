Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and the university are in some blocks (regions). The movement from one block to another is allowed only if they share a common border (i.e., they are separated by exactly one line). Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct lines that separate the home from the university.\n\n Why? Because each time we cross a line, we move from one side to the other. We can only step between adjacent regions (sharing a border), and each step must cross one line. However, note that the problem does not require stepping on the lines, but the boundaries are the lines.\n\n But note: if we are in two different half-planes defined by a given line, then we must have crossed that line an odd number of times (if we are going from one side to the other). However, the minimal steps might be the number of lines that actually separate the two points.\n\n However, here's the catch: we don't necessarily have to cross every line that separates them. Actually, the minimal number of steps is the number of distinct lines for which the two points lie on opposite sides.\n\n Explanation: Each road (line) divides the plane. For each line, check whether home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides, then that line must be crossed at least once. Moreover, because the roads are infinite and the movement is such that you can only cross one road at a time (and each step crosses exactly one road), the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if they share a nonzero length border, meaning they are separated by exactly one line. So to go from the home block to the university block, we must cross every line that separates the two, and we cannot avoid crossing any such line. And we can cross multiple lines at the same time? Actually, no: when you cross one line, you move from one half-plane to the other. However, note that the regions are formed by multiple lines. The minimal path from home to university will be the minimal number of line crossings, which is the number of lines that separate the two points (because each crossing changes the side for one line, and we need to change the side for all separating lines).\n\n However, consider: if we have two lines, and the home and university are separated by both, then we must cross both. But can we cross both in one step? No, because each step is moving from one block to an adjacent block (which is separated by exactly one line). Therefore, we must cross one line at a time.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of lines for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the coordinates of home and university.\n 2. Read the number of roads, n.\n 3. For each road (each line with coefficients a, b, c):\n      Evaluate the sign of the expression for home: a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n      Evaluate the sign of the expression for university: a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    Since the points are not on the line, these values are nonzero.\n\n    If the signs (considering the sign as positive or negative) are opposite (one positive and the other negative, or vice versa) then this line separates the two points.\n\n 4. Count the number of such lines.\n\n However, wait: what if there are duplicate lines? The problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\" So we don't have duplicate lines.\n\n Example input 1: \n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), and two roads: [0,1,0] and [1,0,0]\n   For road [0,1,0]: equation is y = 0. \n        At (1,1): 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 -> wait, wait: the equation is 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        Actually, the equation is 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y = 0.\n        Then (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n        (-1,-1): 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 (negative) -> opposite, so count this line.\n\n   For road [1,0,0]: equation x=0.\n        (1,1): 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n        (-1,-1): 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 (negative) -> opposite, count this line.\n\n   Total count = 2.\n\n Example input 2:\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), and three roads: [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,-3]\n\n   The first two we already know separate. What about the third?\n        Equation: x + y - 3 = 0.\n        (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 (negative)\n        (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 (negative) -> same side, so not counted.\n\n   So count is 2.\n\n But wait, why the example output is 2 for both? \n\n However, note: the example input format has two examples. The first example output is 2 and the second example output is 2.\n\n But let me check: the second example input is:\n     1 1\n     -1 -1\n     3\n     1 0 0\n     0 1 0\n     1 1 -3\n\n So the answer is 2.\n\n But wait, there is a known issue: sometimes the sign representation might be negative. We have to compare the signs. However, we can do:\n\n   Let f(p) = a*p.x + b*p.y + c\n\n   Then, if f(home) * f(university) < 0, then they are on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: if the value is zero, then the point lies on the line, but the problem states that neither home nor university is on the road.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is negative? The product being negative means opposite sides.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple. But note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the sign of the expression flips, but the condition (same side or opposite) remains the same.\n\n So we can use the product.\n\n However, we must be cautious with the data type and the range (numbers can be as large as 10^6, so the product might be as large as 10^12, which is acceptable in Python integers, but we are only checking the sign.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   home_x, home_y = map(int, line.split())\n   univ_x, univ_y = map(int, next_line.split())\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   lines = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Compute for home and university\n        home_val = a * home_x + b * home_y + c\n        univ_val = a * univ_x + b * univ_y + c\n\n        # Check if they are opposite: home_val and univ_val have opposite signs.\n        if (home_val < 0 and univ_val > 0) or (home_val > 0 and univ_val < 0):\n            # Then this line separates the two\n            count += 1\n\n   But wait, we can also use: if home_val * univ_val < 0 then they are on opposite sides.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if home_val * univ_val < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   However, note: if the line equation is multiplied by a negative constant, then the signs flip, but the product remains negative (because negative times negative is positive, and positive times positive is positive). Actually, wait:\n\n        Original equation: a*x+b*y+c = 0\n        Consider a different representation: k*(a*x+b*y+c)=0, then the signs of the expressions are multiplied by k.\n\n        Then, if k is negative, then the product (home_val * univ_val) would be (k*a1)*(k*b1) = k^2 * (a1*b1) which is positive, but wait:\n\n        Actually, the product for the two points would be: (k * home_val_original) * (k * univ_val_original) = k^2 * (home_val_original * univ_val_original)\n\n        So if the original product was negative, then k^2 is positive, so the product becomes positive. But wait, that would be wrong.\n\n        However, note: the condition for separation is independent of the scaling factor. We don't want to depend on the scaling. But observe:\n\n          The condition is: the two points are on opposite sides if and only if (a*x1+b*y1+c) and (a*x2+b*y2+c) have opposite signs, regardless of the scaling factor (as long as we use the same equation for both). But if we scale the equation by k (which is nonzero), then the signs of the two expressions are both multiplied by k. Then the product becomes k^2 * (original product). Since k^2 is positive, the sign of the product is the same as the original product.\n\n        However, wait: if the original product was negative, then after scaling by k (any nonzero) the product becomes positive? No, wait: k^2 is always positive. So if the original product was negative, then the new product is negative * positive = negative? Actually, no: the product of two numbers is negative if one is positive and the other negative. After scaling, both are scaled by k (so same factor). Then:\n\n          Original: home_val_orig and univ_val_orig: one positive and the other negative, so their product is negative.\n          After scaling by k: home_val = k * home_val_orig, univ_val = k * univ_val_orig.\n          Then product = k * k * (home_val_orig * univ_val_orig) = k^2 * (negative) -> negative (since k^2 is positive).\n\n        Similarly, if the original product was positive, then the new product is positive.\n\n        So we can use the product without worrying about the scaling.\n\n        BUT: what if k is negative? Then the signs of the individual values flip, but the product remains the same (because negative times negative is positive, and positive times positive is positive). Actually, no: if we multiply by a negative, then the signs flip, but the product of two negatives is positive and two positives is positive. Wait, no: flipping both signs doesn't change the relative signs. Actually, the condition (opposite signs) is invariant under scaling by a positive factor, and also by a negative factor? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n          Condition for separation: the two points are on opposite sides of the line. This is equivalent to: \n              (a*x1+b*y1+c) and (a*x2+b*y2+c) have opposite signs.\n\n          Now, if we define a new equation: k*(a*x+b*y+c)=0, then the two values become k*(a*x1+b*y1+c) and k*(a*x2+b*y2+c). The product is k^2 * (original product). The original product is negative (for separation). Then k^2 is positive, so the new product is negative. Similarly, if the original product was positive, the new product is positive.\n\n          However, if we use the product, we are effectively checking:\n\n             (a*x1+b*y1+c) * (a*x2+b*y2+c) < 0\n\n          But if we scale the equation by k (which is negative), then we get:\n\n             (k*(a*x1+b*y1+c)) * (k*(a*x2+b*y2+c)) = k^2 * (original product)\n\n          Since k^2 is positive, the sign of the product is the same as the original product.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the product.\n\n        However, note: the product might be very large (but we only care about the sign). But the product of two numbers that are each up to 10^6 * 10^6 (wait, no: the equation coefficients are up to 10^6, and the coordinates are up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value for the expression is |a|*|x| + |b|*|y| + |c|, which can be up to 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, so about 2e12. Then the product is (2e12)^2 = 4e24, which is too big for integers in terms of performance? Actually, Python integers can handle that, but we are only comparing the sign. Alternatively, we can avoid the product by:\n\n            if (a*x1+b*y1+c) < 0 and (a*x2+b*y2+c) > 0:\n                count += 1\n            elif (a*x1+b*y1+c) > 0 and (a*x2+b*y2+c) < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        This avoids the huge product.\n\n        But note: the product method is safe because the numbers are integers and the product of two integers in the range [-2e12, 2e12] is an integer that Python can handle (though it might be slow for 300 lines, but 300 is small). However, the absolute value might be as large as 4e24, which is within Python's integer range (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the operations might be slower for very large numbers). But 300 lines is small, and 4e24 is a fixed number of digits (about 24 zeros? Actually, 4e24 is 4 followed by 24 zeros, which is 25-digit number). But we are only doing 300 multiplications and comparisons. It should be acceptable.\n\n        However, to be safe from overflow (though the problem constraints say the numbers are up to 10^6, so the product is 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6? Actually, wait: the expression is a*x1+b*y1+c. The maximum absolute value for a*x1 is (10^6)*(10^6)=10^12, and similarly for b*y1 and c. Then the maximum absolute value is about 3e12. Then the product of two such numbers is 9e24, which is still acceptable in Python.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the coefficients a, b, c can be as low as -10^6 and as high as 10^6, and the coordinates as well. So the worst-case expression is:\n\n           |a*x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12\n           |b*y1| <= 10^12\n           |c| <= 10^6\n\n        So the expression can be as large as 10^12 + 10^12 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12.\n\n        Then the product is (2e12) * (2e12) = 4e24, which is a 25-digit number. Python can handle integers of arbitrary size, but the multiplication of two 12-digit numbers (each about 10^12) is efficient. Since we do at most 300 lines, it's acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also avoid the product by using the sign comparison without the product, which is two comparisons per line (so 600 comparisons) and one multiplication per line (for the two expressions) which is 600 multiplications. The multiplications are of numbers up to 10^6 * 10^6 (which is 10^12, so 12-digit numbers) and then comparing two integers. \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the two expressions and then compare their signs.\n\n        I'll use:\n\n            expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            if expr1 * expr2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        But wait: what if the expressions are zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so expr1 and expr2 are nonzero.\n\n        So we can use the product method.\n\n        However, let me test with the example:\n\n            Example 1: \n                Line: 0 1 0 (y=0) for home (1,1): 0*1+1*1+0 = 1, for university (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product = 1 * (-1) = -1 -> negative, so count.\n\n            Example 2: \n                Line: 1 1 -3 (x+y=3) for home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1, for university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> product = (-1)*(-5)=5 -> positive, so not counted.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But note: the equation could be represented with negative coefficients. For example, the line x=0 can be represented as -1 0 0. Then:\n\n            home (1,1): -1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = -1\n            university (-1,-1): -1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = 1\n            product = (-1)*1 = -1 -> negative, so counted.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Code:\n\n            x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n            x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n            n = int(input().strip())\n\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n                expr1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n                expr2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n                if expr1 * expr2 < 0:\n                    count += 1\n\n            print(count)\n\n        However, wait: the example input format is given as:\n\n            Input: \n                ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        But note: the problem reads from stdin. The example input is provided as two strings, but in reality, the input is provided as standard input.\n\n        Let me run the example:\n\n            Example 1: \n                x1,y1 = 1,1; x2,y2=-1,-1; n=2; then two lines: [0,1,0] and [1,0,0]. Output 2.\n\n            Example 2: \n                x1,y1=1,1; x2,y2=-1,-1; n=3; then three lines: [1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,-3]. Output 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input string is given as:\n\n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ...]\n\n        So we read from stdin, which is one string per line.\n\n        However, the problem says: \n            The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1.\n            The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2.\n            The third line contains an integer n.\n            Then n lines, each containing three integers.\n\n        So the code above should work.\n\n        But wait: the example output is 2 for both, but the example input 2 has 3 roads, and we count 2 of them. So yes.\n\n        However, wait: the example input 2: the third road is [1,1,-3]. But note: the equation x+y-3=0. The home (1,1) is on the side: 1+1-3 = -1, and the university (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5, so same side (both negative). So indeed we don't count it.\n\n        But wait, what if a line is defined as -x-y+3=0? Then the equation is the same as x+y-3=0 multiplied by -1. Then:\n\n            home: -1-1+3 = 1 (positive)\n            university: -(-1)-(-1)+3 = 1+1+3=5 (positive) -> same side, so not counted.\n\n        So the representation doesn't matter.\n\n        However, there's an alternative: what if the equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? The product method still holds because the signs of the two expressions are flipped (but then the product is positive, which is the same as before).\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n            x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n                # Calculate the value for the home and the university\n                val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n                val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n                if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                    count += 1\n\n            print(count)\n\n        Let me test with a simple case: two points on the same side of all lines -> 0 steps? But wait, the problem says: we are in one block and the university is in another. If they are in the same block, then we don't need to cross any line? But the problem says the movement is from one block to another, and we are in the same block? Then the answer is 0.\n\n        Example: home (0,0) and university (1,1) and one road: x=0 (equation 1 0 0). Then:\n\n            home: 1*0+0*0+0=0 -> but wait, the problem says the points are not on the road. So let's choose home (0,0) is on the road, so we cannot use that. Let me choose home (0,1) and university (0,2) and road x=0: then both are on the road? That's invalid. So let me choose home (1,0) and university (2,0) and road x=0: then both are positive, so same side.\n\n        Another example: home (1,0) and university (0,1) and road x+y=0 (equation 1 1 0). Then:\n\n            home: 1+0=1 (positive)\n            university: 0+1=1 (positive) -> same side, so 0 steps.\n\n        But wait, what if the two points are in the same block? Then the answer is 0.\n\n        However, note: the problem says: \"The roads divide the plane into connected regions\", and the home and university are in some blocks. So if they are in the same block, then we don't need to cross any road. \n\n        Therefore, the answer is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n        But wait, is that always the minimal number of steps?\n\n        Consider: each step moves from one block to an adjacent block (crossing one road). To get from one block to another, we must cross every road that separates the two. However, note that the two points might be separated by multiple roads, and we must cross each one at least once.\n\n        However, is it possible that we cross a road more than once? The minimal path would never cross the same road twice because that would be unnecessary. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n        But wait: in graph terms, the arrangement of lines partitions the plane into regions, and two regions are adjacent if they share a border (i.e., separated by one line). The minimal path between two regions is the number of lines that must be crossed. And since each line that separates the two must be crossed, and each step crosses one, then the minimal steps is the number of separating lines.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if two lines are the same? The problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\"\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But note: the equations are given as aix+biy+ci=0, and the coefficients are integers. Two different representations of the same line are not allowed.\n\n        One more thing: the lines might be vertical or horizontal, but our calculation works for any linear equation.\n\n        Let me test a vertical line: x=1 (equation 1 0 -1). Home (0,0): 1*0+0*0-1 = -1, university (2,0): 1*2+0*0-1=1 -> opposite, so count.\n\n        A horizontal line: y=1 (equation 0 1 -1). Home (0,0): 0*0+1*0-1=-1, university (0,2): 0*0+1*2-1=1 -> opposite, so count.\n\n        Diagonal: x+y=1 (equation 1 1 -1). Home (0,0): -1, university (2,2): 2+2-1=3 -> opposite? Actually, (0,0) and (2,2) are on opposite sides? The line x+y=1: (0,0) is below (x+y<1) and (2,2) is above (x+y>1). So yes.\n\n        So the code should be:\n\n            Read home and university coordinates.\n            Read n.\n            For each of the n lines:\n                Read a, b, c.\n                Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n                Compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n                If val1 * val2 < 0, then increment count.\n\n            Print count.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This condition is automatically satisfied by two blocks that are separated by exactly one line (because the common border is the segment of that line). However, note that two blocks might be separated by more than one line? Actually, no: the common border is defined by the set of lines that form the boundary. But the condition for adjacency is that the common border has nonzero length. In the arrangement of lines, two regions are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one line and the rest of the lines do not prevent that common border. \n\n        However, the key is: the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each step must cross one line, and you must cross all the lines that separate the two points.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n        I think we are done.\n\n        However, note: the problem statement says \"Output the answer to the problem\", and the examples output 2.\n\n        But wait: in the example, the two points are separated by two lines. Then the minimal steps is 2. Because we must cross two lines. However, the movement is from block to block. Initially, we are in the home block. After crossing the first line, we are in an intermediate block. Then crossing the second line, we get to the university block. So two steps.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n        However, what if the two points are separated by k lines, then the minimal steps is k.\n\n        But wait: is it always k? Consider that you might cross two lines at the same time? Actually, no: the problem says that in one step you can only move from one block to another by crossing one road (the common border is a segment of one road). So you must cross one road at a time.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n        However, wait: what if the two points are separated by two lines, but the two lines are parallel? Then the arrangement is such that the two points are in the same cell of the arrangement of two parallel lines? Actually, no: two parallel lines divide the plane into three regions. The two points would be either in the same region or in two adjacent regions (separated by one line) or in two regions that are separated by two lines (if they are on opposite sides of both). \n\n        Example: two parallel lines: x=1 and x=2. Home at (0,0) and university at (3,0). Then both are separated by both lines. The minimal steps: we must cross x=1 and then x=2, so two steps.\n\n        But note: the two lines are distinct and parallel. The common borders between the regions are the two lines. The region containing (0,0) is the leftmost, then the middle, then the rightmost. To go from left to right, we must cross two lines, so two steps.\n\n        So the product method still applies: for x=1: (0-1) and (3-1) -> negative and positive -> opposite, so count. For x=2: (0-2) and (3-2) -> negative and positive -> opposite, so count. Total 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        IMPORTANT: The input might be large (n up to 300) but we are only doing 300 iterations, so it's efficient.\n\n        Code:\n\n            x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n            x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n                # Calculate the value for the home and the university\n                val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n                val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n                # Since the points are not on the road, val1 and val2 are non-zero.\n                if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                    count += 1\n\n            print(count)\n\n        However, note: the product might be negative zero? But the values are integers and nonzero, so no.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input:\n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                3\n                1 0 0\n                0 1 0\n                1 1 -3\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        But wait: the example input 2 has three roads, and we count two. The third road is [1,1,-3] which we computed as not separating.\n\n        However, the example input 2 is given as:\n\n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        But wait, the example input 2 in the problem statement is:\n\n            Input: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                3\n                1 0 0\n                0 1 0\n                1 1 -3\n\n        And the expected output is 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input 1 in the problem statement is:\n\n            Input: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n        And the expected output is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code outputs 2 for both.\n\n        However, the example input 1 is the first example, and example input 2 is the second example.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \n            Example Input:\n                ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n            Example Output:\n                ['2', '2']\n\n        Our code produces the same.\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says:\n\n            Example Input:\n\n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', \n             '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n            Example Output:\n\n            ['2', '2']\n\n        However, in the problem statement, the example input is given as two separate inputs, but we are reading from stdin. The judge will provide one input.\n\n        I think we are good.\n\n        However, wait: there is a known pitfall: the product might be very large, but we are only checking the sign. There is an alternative: we can avoid the product by checking the signs individually. But the product is safe.\n\n        But note: the product might be positive even if the signs are the same, and negative if opposite. So the condition is correct.\n\n        One more edge: if the product is 0? But the problem states the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are nonzero, so the product cannot be zero.\n\n        Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n        Let me submit.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the roads are defined by aix+biy+ci=0. What if the equation is written with negative leading coefficient? We already tested that.\n\n        However, note: the product is negative if the signs are opposite, and positive if the same. So the condition is correct.\n\n        We'll run the code with the sample tests.\n\n        Sample Test 1: \n            Input: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        Sample Test 2:\n            Input:\n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                3\n                1 0 0\n                0 1 0\n                1 1 -3\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        Sample Test 3: \n            Input: \n                0 0\n                2 2\n                2\n                1 0 -2   # line x=2\n                0 1 -2   # line y=2\n\n            Here, the home (0,0) and university (2,2) are separated by the line x=2 and y=2?\n            For x=2: 1*0+0*0-2 = -2, 1*2+0*2-2=0 -> wait, (2,2) is on the line x=2? But the problem says the university is not on the road. So we must choose a university not on the line.\n\n            Let me choose university (3,3). Then:\n\n                x=2: 1*0+0*0-2=-2, 1*3+0*3-2=1 -> opposite, so count.\n                y=2: 0*0+1*0-2=-2, 0*3+1*3-2=1 -> opposite, so count.\n\n            Then output 2.\n\n        But wait, the minimal steps: from (0,0) to (3,3) with two lines x=2 and y=2. The regions are divided by x=2 and y=2. The home (0,0) is in the bottom-left, then we must cross x=2 and then y=2 (or y=2 and then x=2). So two steps.\n\n        However, the two lines are independent. The common borders: the two lines divide the plane into four quadrants. The home is in the bottom-left, the university in the top-right. We must cross both.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        I think we are ready.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the roads are infinite line roads. The example above uses two vertical/horizontal lines, but the same logic applies for any line.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n            x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n                val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n                val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n                if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                    count += 1\n            print(count)\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n            Process:\n                First road: a=0, b=1, c=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university in Crazy Town. The city is divided by infinite line roads, and each step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block by crossing one road. The key observation here is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes, and the minimal steps required to reach the university from home is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many lines (roads) separate the home and university blocks. Each line is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The home and university are not located on any road, so they lie strictly in one of the two half-planes created by each line.\n2. **Intuition**: For each line, if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line, then this line must be crossed at least once to move from one block to the other. The minimal number of steps is simply the count of such separating lines.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each line, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the line, and thus the line separates them. Count all such lines.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each line exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. With \\(n\\) lines (up to 300), the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads \\(n\\).\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are extracted. The line equation \\(a x + b y + c = 0\\) is evaluated at both home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Separation**: The product of the evaluations at home and university is checked. If it is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the line, indicating the line separates them.\n4. **Counting Separating Lines**: The count of such separating lines is incremented for each line that meets the separation condition.\n5. **Output Result**: The total count of separating lines is printed, which represents the minimal steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties of lines and points to determine the solution with optimal performance.",
