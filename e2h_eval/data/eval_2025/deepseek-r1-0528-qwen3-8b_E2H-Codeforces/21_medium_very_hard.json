The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the condition is: a chest i can be opened by a key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n So, we can categorize the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chests with even numbers: E_c\n   Chests with odd numbers: O_c\n\n   Keys with even numbers: E_k\n   Keys with odd numbers: O_k\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd, which is 1 mod 2).\n Similarly, an odd chest can only be opened by an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n   Matching 1: even keys (O_k) to even chests (E_c) -> but wait, no: even chest requires odd key. So:\n      - even chest (E_c) requires odd key (O_k)\n      - odd chest (O_c) requires even key (E_k)\n\n So, the two sets are:\n\n   Set1: even chests (E_c) -> need odd keys (O_k)\n   Set2: odd chests (O_c) -> need even keys (E_k)\n\n Then the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of:\n\n   The maximum matching between E_c and O_k (which is min(|E_c|, |O_k|)) but wait, we can't necessarily use all because we have two separate constraints? Actually, note:\n\n However, observe: the keys are shared between the two types of chests? No, because each key is either even or odd, and each chest is either even or odd. But note: one key cannot be used twice.\n\n Actually, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   Graph1: Even keys (O_k) for Even chests (E_c) -> actually no: wait, let me correct:\n\n Condition: \n   For an even chest (a_i even): we need a key j such that b_j is odd (so that even + odd = odd).\n   For an odd chest (a_i odd): we need a key j such that b_j is even (so that odd + even = odd).\n\n And the keys are divided into even and odd.\n\n So, the matching for even chests must use odd keys, and the matching for odd chests must use even keys.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Let:\n        count_even_chest = number of even chests\n        count_odd_chest = number of odd chests\n\n        count_even_keys = number of even keys\n        count_odd_keys = number of odd keys\n\n Then, the even chests can be matched with at most count_odd_keys, but we also cannot exceed count_even_chest.\n\n Similarly, the odd chests can be matched with at most count_even_keys, but we also cannot exceed count_odd_chest.\n\n However, wait: is that the entire story? \n\n Actually, we can use each key only once. But note: the two matchings are independent because the keys used for even chests are odd keys, and the keys used for odd chests are even keys. There's no overlap in the keys used. So the total matching is the minimum of (count_even_chest, count_odd_keys) plus the minimum of (count_odd_chest, count_even_keys)?\n\n But wait, what if we have more odd keys than even chests? Then we can only use up to the number of even chests. Similarly for the other.\n\n However, consider: we have two separate sets of keys (even and odd) and two separate sets of chests (even and odd). The matching for the even chests uses odd keys and the matching for the odd chests uses even keys. Since these sets of keys are disjoint, the two matchings don't interfere.\n\n Therefore, the maximum number of chests we can open is:\n\n        min(count_even_chest, count_odd_keys) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_keys)\n\n But wait, let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n        9: odd, 14: even, 6: even, 2: even, 11: odd\n        even_chest: [14,6,2] -> count_even_chest = 3\n        odd_chest: [9,11] -> count_odd_chest = 2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n        8: even, 4: even, 7: odd, 20: even\n        even_keys: [8,4,20] -> count_even_keys = 3\n        odd_keys: [7] -> count_odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then: \n        even_chest part: min(3, 1) = 1\n        odd_chest part: min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> count_even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd, so even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n\n   Then: \n        even_chest part: min(5,1)=1\n        odd_chest part: min(0,0)=0\n        total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n   Then: \n        even_chest part: min(1,0)=0\n        odd_chest part: min(0,4)=0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: what if there is a case where the same key could be used for two different chests? But the condition is one key per chest and one chest per key. But in our categorization, the keys are categorized by parity, and the chests are too. The condition is strictly by parity. \n\n But note: the problem says the condition is a_i+b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2). So only one type of key (by parity) can open a given chest.\n\n Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n However, wait: what if we have multiple keys of the same parity? We are not limited by the distinctness beyond the counts? Actually, the condition is purely on parity. So if we have two even keys, they can both be used for odd chests (if available). Similarly, two odd keys can be used for even chests.\n\n Therefore, the solution is as simple as:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list a of n integers\n   Read list b of m integers\n\n   Count the number of even and odd in a and b.\n\n   Then, answer = min(count_even_chest, count_odd_keys) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_keys)\n\n But wait, is that really the maximum? Because we are matching two sets independently. However, note that the keys are limited: we have a total of count_odd_keys odd keys and count_even_keys even keys. But the two types of chests require different keys. And the matching for even chests uses odd keys, and the matching for odd chests uses even keys. There is no constraint that an odd key cannot be used for two different even chests? Actually, the condition is that one key can open at most one chest. But we already separated the keys by type. So we are using the odd keys only for even chests and even keys only for odd chests.\n\n However, the above calculation does not account for the fact that the same key cannot be used twice, but since we are counting the maximum possible from two independent sets, we are effectively using the keys without exceeding the available counts.\n\n But note: we have two separate bipartite graphs and the two sets of keys are disjoint. So the total matching is indeed the sum of the two independent matchings.\n\n But wait, is there any dependency? Actually, no. Each key is used at most once, and the two sets of keys are disjoint. The two sets of chests are disjoint. So we can open up to min(count_even_chest, count_odd_keys) even chests and min(count_odd_chest, count_even_keys) odd chests.\n\n However, what if the counts are such that we have more keys of one type than the chests of the opposite type? Then we are limited by the smaller side.\n\n Therefore, the code becomes:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chest = 0\n   odd_chest = 0\n   for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n\n   even_key = 0\n   odd_key = 0\n   for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n\n   result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   print(result)\n\n However, wait: the condition is (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, which is equivalent to one even and one odd. \n\n But note: the example Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\" works.\n\n But let me test with another example:\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,2] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=1\n        Keys: [2,3] -> even_key=1, odd_key=1\n\n        Then: min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1+1 = 2 -> which is correct.\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,2] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=1\n        Keys: [2] -> even_key=1, odd_key=0\n\n        Then: min(1,0) + min(1,1) = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n        Explanation: the odd chest (1) requires an even key (2) -> can open the odd chest. The even chest (2) requires an odd key (none) -> cannot open. So total 1.\n\n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,2] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=1\n        Keys: [3] -> even_key=0, odd_key=1\n\n        Then: min(1,1) + min(1,0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n        Explanation: the even chest (2) requires an odd key (3) -> can open the even chest. The odd chest (1) requires an even key (none) -> cannot open. So total 1.\n\n This seems correct.\n\n But wait, what if we have more keys than chests? Then we are limited by the number of chests of the opposite parity.\n\n However, note: the condition is that we can use each key at most once, and each chest at most once. The matching is constrained by the minimum of the two sides for each bipartite graph.\n\n Therefore, the above formula is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a chest that is even, but we have more than one odd key? Then we can use one odd key for that even chest, and then another even chest can use another odd key. The formula min(even_chest, odd_key) is the maximum matching for the even_chest to odd_key.\n\n Similarly for odd_chest to even_key.\n\n Since the two bipartite graphs are independent, the total is the sum.\n\n Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n But note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5 for n and m, so we are doing two passes (one for a_list and one for b_list) and then simple arithmetic. This is efficient.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, wait: the example inputs are given as strings. The problem says the first line has n and m, then the next two lines have the lists.\n\n We'll read the first line, then the second line, then the third line.\n\n Example input format:\n\n     \"5 4\"\n     \"9 14 6 2 11\"\n     \"8 4 7 20\"\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string in the example, but in reality we read from stdin.\n\n So the code:\n\n     n, m = map(int, input().split())\n     a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n     b_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n     even_chest = sum(1 for num in a_list if num % 2 == 0)\n     odd_chest = len(a_list) - even_chest\n\n     even_key = sum(1 for num in b_list if num % 2 == 0)\n     odd_key = len(b_list) - even_key\n\n     result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n     print(result)\n\n However, wait: the example input is provided as a string that might have multiple lines. The input() function reads a line. So this should work.\n\n But wait: the example input is given in the problem as:\n\n     ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ... ]\n\n But in the actual input, we read three lines.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n     Input: \n          n=5, m=4\n          a_list = [9,14,6,2,11]\n          b_list = [8,4,7,20]\n\n     even_chest: \n         9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd -> even_chest=3, odd_chest=2\n     even_key: \n         8->even,4->even,7->odd,20->even -> even_key=3, odd_key=1\n\n     result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: \n     Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n     n=5, m=1\n     a_list = [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n     b_list = [5] -> even_key=0, odd_key=1\n     result = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3: \n     Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n     n=1, m=4\n     a_list=[10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n     b_list=[20,30,40,50] -> even_key=4, odd_key=0\n     result = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0+0 = 0 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, I think this is the solution.\n\n But wait: let me think of a potential pitfall.\n\n Consider: \n     Chests: [1,2] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=1\n     Keys: [1,2] -> even_key=1, odd_key=1\n\n     Then: min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n     Now, how do we assign?\n        Chest 1 (odd) needs an even key -> we have key 2 (even) -> use it.\n        Chest 2 (even) needs an odd key -> we have key 1 (odd) -> use it.\n\n     So total 2. Correct.\n\n Another case: \n     Chests: [1,2,3] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=2\n     Keys: [2,4,6] -> even_key=3, odd_key=0\n\n     Then: min(1,0)=0 for even_chest, min(2,3)=2 for odd_chest -> total 2.\n\n     But wait: the odd_chest requires even keys. We have 3 even keys, so we can open 2 odd_chests (since there are only 2). But the even_chest (chest 2) requires an odd key (none) -> so we cannot open the even_chest. So total 2. Correct.\n\n One more: \n     Chests: [1,2,3] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=2\n     Keys: [1,3,5] -> even_key=0, odd_key=3\n\n     Then: min(1,3)=1 for even_chest, min(2,0)=0 for odd_chest -> total 1.\n\n     Explanation: the even_chest (2) can be opened by an odd key (we have 3, so yes). The odd_chests (1 and 3) require even keys (none) -> cannot open. So total 1. Correct.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n     n, m = map(int, input().split())\n     a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n     b_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n     even_chest = 0\n     for num in a_list:\n         if num % 2 == 0:\n             even_chest += 1\n\n     odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n     even_key = 0\n     for num in b_list:\n         if num % 2 == 0:\n             even_key += 1\n\n     odd_key = m - even_key\n\n     result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n     print(result)\n\n Let me run the sample inputs through this code.\n\n But wait, the problem says the input integers can be up to 10^9, but modulo 2 is safe.\n\n However, note: negative numbers? The problem says the numbers are at least 1, so positive. So no issue.\n\n Therefore, we output the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and the number of even and odd keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys (since each even chest needs an odd key).\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys (since each odd chest needs an even key).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests from the given list.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys from the provided list.\n   - Calculating the result by combining the two independent matchings as described above.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the number of chests (n) and keys (m). The next `n` values are the chest numbers, followed by `m` values for the keys.\n2. **Counting Chests and Keys**: We count how many chests and keys are even and odd. This is done by iterating through each list and checking the parity of each number.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two minimum values calculated earlier.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the available keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
