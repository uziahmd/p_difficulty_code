She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a single line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (with boundaries defined by the current minimum and maximum unclosed tabs)\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor or all tabs to the right of the cursor.\n\n However, note that initially all tabs from 1 to n are open, and we want to leave only [l, r].\n\n The key observation:\n  We can break the problem into two parts:\n    - Closing the tabs to the left of l (if any)\n    - Closing the tabs to the right of r (if any)\n\n But note: we might not need to close both if one side is already within [l, r] or if the cursor doesn't have to move.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> Output: 5\n\n Steps for example 1:\n   Initially: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n   We need to close tabs 1, 5, 6.\n\n   One way:\n     - Move left from 3 to 2 (1 second). Then close left (closing tab 1) -> now a becomes 2, b remains 6 (but then after closing left, the segment becomes [2,6]).\n     - Then move right from 2 to 4 (2 seconds: 2->3, 3->4). Then close right (closing tabs 5 and 6). \n\n   Total: 1 (move left) + 1 (close left) + 2 (moves right) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: First close the left part, then the right part.\n   Option 2: First close the right part, then the left part? But note: after closing one side, the boundaries change.\n\n However, note that we can also consider moving the cursor to one end and then close, but sometimes we don't need to go all the way.\n\n Actually, the problem can be simplified by considering the necessary moves:\n\n  We must ensure that the entire segment [l, r] remains. So:\n    - If there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., if l > 1), we need to close them. Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of r (i.e., if r < n), we need to close them.\n\n  The operations are independent in the sense that we can do the left and right closures separately, but the order and the movement of the cursor matter.\n\n  Let's define:\n    left_closing_required = (l > 1)\n    right_closing_required = (r < n)\n\n  However, note that we can also use the fact that we can move the cursor and then close. The closure operation will remove all tabs outside the specified side.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  Case 1: No closure needed (l == 1 and r == n). Then answer is 0.\n\n  Case 2: Only one side needs closure.\n\n    Subcase 2a: Only left closure is needed (l == 1, so no left closure, but wait: if l==1, then we don't need to close left. Actually, if l>1 then left is needed; if r<n then right is needed).\n\n    Actually, the conditions are:\n      If l == 1 and r == n: 0.\n      Else if l == 1: then we only need to close the right part (from r+1 to n). How?\n        We can move the cursor to the rightmost tab that is still open (which is at least r) and then close the right part.\n\n        But note: we start at 'pos'. We might be anywhere.\n\n        Steps for closing only right:\n          We need to get the cursor to a position >= r (so that when we close the right, it removes everything from the cursor+1 to n). However, note: the closure operation for right closes [cursor+1, b]. So if we are at a position i (with i <= r) then we cannot close the right without first moving to a position that is beyond the desired segment? Actually, we don't need to move beyond the desired segment because the closure operation for right doesn't require being at r or beyond? \n\n        Let me clarify: The closure operation for right closes all tabs to the right of the cursor. So if we are at a tab i (with i<=r) then we can close the right part by being at a tab i that is at most r (so that we don't remove the desired ones). But wait: the definition says: close all the tabs with indices from [i+1, b]. So if we are at a tab i (and i <= r) then we are not removing any desired tab (since the desired tabs are [l, r] and we are at i which is <= r, then i+1 might be <= r or not). Actually, we can close the right part from any position as long as the cursor is at a tab that is <= r. Then the closure will remove everything from i+1 to b (the current maximum). But if we are at a tab i and i <= r, then the closure will remove from i+1 to the current maximum (which is initially n, but if we have already closed some tabs then it changes). \n\n        However, in this subcase we haven't closed anything else. So we start with all tabs. We are at 'pos'. We need to close the right part (tabs from r+1 to n). \n\n        We can do:\n          Option 1: Move the cursor to the right until we reach a tab that is at least r (actually, we don't even need to go beyond r, because if we are at r, then the closure will remove from r+1 to n. But if we are at a tab i (with i <= r) then we can close the right part and it will remove everything from i+1 to n. But note: if i < r, then we are leaving the tabs from i+1 to r-1, which is okay because we don't want to touch them? Actually, we don't need to worry about leaving extra tabs because the closure operation only removes the right part. However, we must not remove any desired tab. Since we are at i (<=r), the closure removes from i+1 to n. The desired segment is [l, r]. The desired segment includes from i+1 to r? Only if i+1 <= r. But if i is less than r, then we are not removing any desired tab because we are only removing from i+1 to n, and the desired segment is from l to r (which includes i+1 to r). So that is okay.\n\n        So we can close the right part from any tab i (as long as i <= r). Therefore, we don't need to move to the very right. We just need to move the cursor to a tab that is <= r (if we are not already) and then close the right part.\n\n        However, note: we might not need to move at all if we are already at a tab <= r. Then we just do one operation (close right). But what if we are at a tab > r? Then we cannot close the right part from that tab because we would remove too much (we are at a tab i>r, then we are removing from i+1 to n, but we also have to remove from the left side? Actually, in this subcase we don't need to remove the left side because l==1, but if we are at a tab i>r, then we are in the right side and we can close the left part? But wait, the condition for closing left is: close all tabs from a to i-1. In this case, we don't need to close the left part, so we don't want to close any left tab. But if we are at a tab i>r, then we can close the left part? That would close from a to i-1, which includes our desired segment [1, r] if i-1>=r? Actually, no: the closure left operation closes from the current minimum (which is a) to i-1. Since we are at i>r, then i-1>=r, so we would close from a to i-1, which includes the entire desired segment [1, r] and more. That is bad.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid closing the left part. So if we are at a tab i>r, then we must first move the cursor to the left (until we are at a tab <= r) and then close the right part.\n\n        Similarly, if we are at a tab i<=r, we can close the right part.\n\n        Steps for only right closure (l==1 and r<n):\n          Let's assume we are at 'pos'. We need to move the cursor to the left until we are at a tab <= r (if we are not already) and then close the right part.\n\n          How many moves?\n            If pos <= r: then we can close the right part without moving (or actually, we don't need to move). But wait: if we are at a tab i (<=r) we can close the right part. However, we might be at a tab i that is already in [l, r] (which is [1, r]), so we don't need to move. Then total seconds: 1 (for closing right).\n\n            But wait, what if we are at a tab i (<=r) but we don't want to leave the cursor at a tab that is not the last one? Actually, we don't care. We just need to close the right part.\n\n          However, what if we are at a tab i>r? Then we need to move left until we hit the tab r (or any tab <=r). The number of moves required to get from pos to r is (pos - r) moves (each move left is one second). Then we do one close operation.\n\n          So total seconds = (if pos>r then (pos - r) + 1, else 1)\n\n        But wait, in the example: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=4. This is the same as the first example? Actually, the first example has l=2, not 1.\n\n        Let me take an example with only right closure: n=5, pos=4, l=1, r=3.\n\n          We need to close the right part (tabs 4,5). \n          We are at pos=4. Since 4>3, we need to move left to 3 (1 move). Then close the right part (1 move). Total 2 seconds.\n\n        But let me check: \n          After moving to 3: we are at 3. Then we close the right part: which removes 4 and 5. Then we are done. Correct.\n\n        Another example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3.\n          We are at 2, which is <=3. Then we can close the right part: 1 second. Total 1 second.\n\n        Now, what if we are at a tab that is to the left of r but we don't want to close the right part from that tab? Actually, we can. The closure operation for right doesn't require being at the rightmost desired tab.\n\n        But wait: the problem says that the closure operation for right closes [i+1, b]. In the example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3: \n          We are at 2, then we close the right part: that closes [3,5] (because i+1=3, and b=5). But we want to keep [1,3]. So we removed 3! That's bad.\n\n        Correction: In the example n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3, we cannot close the right part from 2 because that would remove 3. We only want to remove the right part (from 4 to 5). \n\n        So what went wrong? The operation for closing the right part closes all the tabs to the right of the cursor. But we want to leave [1,3]. So we must not remove tab 3.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at a tab i such that i+1 > r, meaning i >= r. But wait, if we are at i=r, then we close [r+1, ...] which is safe. If we are at i>r, then we close from i+1 to ... (which is also safe). But if we are at i<r, then we close from i+1 to ... which includes some of the desired segment (from i+1 to r) if i+1<=r.\n\n        So the condition for safely closing the right part is: the cursor must be at a tab i >= r. Then the closure operation for right will close from i+1 to n, which does not include any part of the desired segment [l, r] (since i>=r, then i+1>r). \n\n        Similarly, for closing the left part: the cursor must be at a tab i <= l-1 (so that the closure operation for left, which closes from a to i-1, does not remove any part of the desired segment [l, r]). Because the desired segment starts at l, and we are closing from a to i-1, and i-1 < l (if i<=l-1) then we don't remove any desired tab.\n\n        Therefore, we must adjust:\n\n        For only right closure (l==1 and r<n):\n          We need to move the cursor to a tab i >= r (if we are not already). Then we can close the right part.\n\n          Steps:\n            If pos < r: then we need to move right from pos to r (which takes (r - pos) seconds) and then close the right part (1 second). But wait, if we are at pos < r, then we can move to the right until we are at r (then we close). However, what if we move beyond r? Actually, we can stop at r. Then the closure will remove from r+1 to n, which is safe.\n\n            If pos >= r: then we don't need to move (or we can just close the right part). But wait, if we are at pos>r, then we are at a tab that is beyond r. Then we can close the right part from there? Yes, because then we remove from pos+1 to n, which is safe.\n\n          So total seconds for only right closure: \n            moves = 0\n            if pos < r: moves += (r - pos)\n            then add 1 for the closure.\n\n          But wait, what if we are at a tab that is beyond the desired segment? We don't need to move to r necessarily. We can close from any tab i (>=r). So if we are at a tab i>=r, we don't need to move. If we are at a tab i<r, we need to move to at least r (so we need to move (r-pos) steps to the right).\n\n          However, what if we are at a tab i that is between 1 and r-1 (in the desired segment)? Then we need to move to the right until we hit r (so (r-pos) moves).\n\n          Example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3: we need to move from 2 to 3 (1 move) and then close (1 move) -> total 2 seconds.\n\n          But wait, in the example above we thought that we couldn't close from 2 because it would remove 3. However, according to our corrected condition, we must be at a tab >= r (which is 3) to close the right part. So from 2 we must move to 3 (then we are at 3) and then close.\n\n          So the above reasoning was correct: we must be at a tab >= r to close the right part.\n\n        Similarly, for only left closure (l>1 and r==n):\n          We must be at a tab i <= l-1 to close the left part (then the closure operation for left will remove from a to i-1, and since i<=l-1, then i-1<=l-2, so we don't remove l).\n\n          Steps:\n            If pos > l-1: then we need to move left from pos to l-1 (which is (pos - (l-1)) moves).\n            Then we do 1 operation to close the left part.\n\n          Example: n=5, pos=4, l=3, r=5 (only left closure because l=3>1 and r=5=n). \n            We need to be at a tab <=2 (l-1=2). Currently at 4, so we move left 2 steps (to 2) then close left. Total 3 seconds.\n\n        Now, what if both sides need closure (l>1 and r<n)?\n\n        Then we have to close both the left part (from 1 to l-1) and the right part (from r+1 to n). \n\n        We have two operations: one for left and one for right.\n\n        The challenge is: can we do the two closures in any order? And how many moves?\n\n        Option 1: First close the left part, then the right part.\n          To close the left part, we must be at a tab i <= l-1.\n          Then, after closing the left part, the browser tabs become [l, n] (with the cursor at i, which is <=l-1). But wait, after closing the left part, the minimum index a becomes l, and the maximum index b is still n (until we close the right). Then we have to move the cursor from i (<=l-1) to a position j >= r (to close the right part). \n\n          Steps for Option 1:\n            Step 1: Move from pos to a tab <= l-1 (if not already). The number of moves: \n                      if pos > l-1: then we need to move left (pos - (l-1)) moves to get to l-1 (or we could stop earlier? Actually, we must be at a tab <= l-1. The minimal moves to get to a tab <= l-1 is to move left until we are at l-1, unless we are already at a tab <= l-1. \n            Step 2: Close the left part (1 second).\n            Step 3: Now, the tabs are [l, n]. The cursor is at i (<=l-1). But wait, after closing the left part, the minimum index a becomes l, and the maximum index b is still n. The cursor is still at i (which is now invalid because the tab i is closed? Actually, the problem says: \"the mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab\". But when we close the left part, we close all tabs from a to i-1. But note: the cursor is at i, and i is in the [l, n] segment? No, because we moved to i (<=l-1) and then closed the left part (which includes i? Actually, no: the closure operation for left closes [a, i-1]. So if i is at l-1, then we close from a (which is the smallest unclosed tab, initially 1) to i-1 (which is l-2). Then the cursor remains at i (which is now l-1) but the tab l-1 is still open? Or is it closed?\n\n        Let me read the problem: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" — meaning the tabs from a to i-1. The cursor is at i, and i is not closed. So the cursor remains on i (which is l-1) and then the next state: the tabs are from l to n, and the cursor is at l-1. But wait, l-1 is now closed? Actually, the closure operation for left closes from a to i-1. Since i is l-1, then i-1 is l-2. So the closure operation closes from a (which is 1) to l-2. Then the cursor is still at l-1 (which is open) because we didn't close the tab at i (which is l-1) — only from a to i-1.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that the closure operation for left closes the segment [a, i-1]. So the cursor's tab (i) is not included.\n\n        But wait, in the example: n=6, l=2, so we want to leave [2,6]. We are at i=1 (if we moved to 1). Then we close the left part: [a, i-1] = [1,0]? Actually, a is 1, i=1 -> [1,0] is empty? \n\n        Actually, the closure operation for left is defined as: close all the tabs to the left of the cursor (from a to i-1). If i is 1, then i-1 is 0, so nothing is closed. \n\n        Correction: The closure operation for left requires that there are tabs to the left. But the problem says: \"if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1]\". So if i-1 < a, then the segment [a, i-1] is empty. \n\n        Therefore, we must be at a tab i such that i-1 >= a. But initially a=1, so i must be at least 2 to have any left tab to close? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"she can move the cursor to the tab max(i - 1, a)\" — so the boundary is a. Similarly for the right.\n\n        So to close the left part, we must have at least one tab to the left of the cursor (i.e., i>a). But wait, the definition of the closure operation does not require that there is a tab to the left, but the segment [a, i-1] is defined. If i-1 < a, then the segment is empty. So we cannot close any tab if there is none. \n\n        Therefore, to close the left part, we must be at a tab i such that i > a (so that i-1>=a). Similarly for the right.\n\n        But note: a and b change as we close tabs.\n\n        Let me reexamine the problem statement: \"In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.\"\n\n        Initially, a=1, b=n.\n\n        After closing the left part (if we do it first) from a tab i (with i<=l-1 and i>a) then:\n          We close [a, i-1]. Then the new a becomes i (because the smallest unclosed tab is now i, which is l-1 in our example). \n\n        Then, we need to close the right part. To close the right part, we must be at a tab j such that j <= r (but wait, we are at i which is l-1, and we need to close the right part (from r+1 to n). The condition for the right closure is that we are at a tab j and then we close [j+1, b]. But note: we have already closed the left part, so the current b is still n (unless we close the right part). \n\n        However, we are at i = l-1 (which is < l, so we are still in the left-closed state). Then we need to move the cursor from l-1 to a position >= r (to close the right part). But note: the current a is l (because we closed from a to i-1, so the remaining tabs start at i, which is l-1, but wait: we closed from a to i-1, so the remaining tabs are from i to b. Then the new a is i (which is l-1) and the new b is n.\n\n        Then to close the right part, we must be at a tab j such that j >= r (so that j+1>r). But note: we are at l-1, and we need to move to r (which is at least l, because l<=r). The distance from l-1 to r is (r - (l-1)) moves to the right.\n\n        Then we close the right part.\n\n        Steps for Option 1 (first left then right):\n          Step 1: Move from pos to a tab i (<=l-1) that is also greater than a (initially a=1) so that we can close the left part. The minimal moves for this: \n                  We can choose the closest tab to the left of l that is still open. But initially, the entire range [1, n] is open. So we can move to l-1 (if we are not already there) and we must ensure that we are at a tab i such that i>a (so i>=2). \n\n          Actually, the minimal moves to get to a tab <=l-1 and also to be able to close the left part (i>a) is to move to l-1 (if we are not already at a tab <=l-1) and then we must be at least 2 (if l-1>=2). \n\n          But note: we might be able to do the closure from a tab that is not necessarily l-1? We must be at a tab i such that i<=l-1 and i>a (so that i-1>=a). Since initially a=1, then i must be at least 2. So if l-1<2, i.e., l=2, then we must be at 1 (but then i=1, and i>a=1? -> i>a is 1>1 -> false, so we cannot close from 1. Then we must move to a tab that is greater than 1 (so at least 2) and also <=l-1 (which is 1) -> impossible. \n\n        This suggests that for l=2, we cannot close the left part from the initial state? \n\n        Let me check the example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 (the first example). We did: \n          Move left to 2 (then we are at 2). Then close the left part: \n            The left closure from 2: [a, i-1] = [1,1] -> closes tab 1. Then the new a becomes 2.\n\n          So we can close the left part from 2 (which is l-1) because 2>1 (so i=2>a=1). \n\n        Therefore, we don't require i>a (initially) but the condition for the closure operation is defined by the current a and i. \n\n        The problem says: \"close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1]\". The segment [a, i-1] is non-empty if i-1>=a. \n\n        So to close the left part, we need i-1>=a. \n\n        Initially, a=1, so we require i>=2.\n\n        But after we close the left part, a changes.\n\n        So for Option 1 (left then right) for the example n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4:\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 2 (1 move). Now we are at 2 (which is >=2, so we can close the left part). \n          Step 2: Close the left part (1 move): closes [1,1].\n          Step 3: Now the tabs are [2,6], so a=2, b=6. The cursor is at 2.\n          Step 4: We need to move to a tab >=4 (r=4). From 2 to 4: 2 moves (right twice: 2->3, 3->4).\n          Step 5: Close the right part: closes [5,6] (1 move).\n\n          Total moves: 1 (move left) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move right) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n        Alternatively, Option 2: First close the right part, then the left part.\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4 (1 move). Then close the right part: closes [5,6] (1 move). Now the tabs are [1,4], so a=1, b=4.\n          Step 2: Then we need to close the left part. We are at 4 (which is >=4, so we can close the right part, but for the left part we need to be at a tab i such that i-1>=a (which is 1). We are at 4, which is >1, so we can close the left part? But we are at 4, and the left part is from 1 to 3. However, the closure operation for left closes from a (current a=1) to i-1 (which is 3). So that closes [1,3] — which includes the desired segment [2,4] because 2 is in [1,3]? \n\n          We don't want to close the desired segment. So we must not close the left part from 4 because we would remove the desired segment [2,4] (at least the part [2,3] is desired? Actually, the desired segment is [2,4]. We are at 4, and we close [1,3] — which removes tabs 1,2,3. Then we are left with only 4. That is bad.\n\n          Therefore, we must not be at 4 when closing the left part. We need to be at a tab i such that i-1 < 2 (the start of the desired segment). The desired segment starts at 2, so we must close the left part from a tab i such that i<=1 (so that i-1<=0, and then we close from a=1 to i-1=0 -> empty). But wait, we cannot close the left part from a tab i<=1 because then we cannot close any tab (since i-1<1). \n\n          Actually, we need to close the left part from a tab i that is in the left part (so i<=1) but then the closure operation for left would close from a (which is 1) to i-1 (which is 0) — nothing. \n\n          Alternatively, we must close the left part from a tab i that is in the desired segment? But that would close the desired segment.\n\n        It seems we must be at a tab i that is strictly to the left of the desired segment (i.e., i<l) and also i>a (the current a) to have a non-empty segment to close. But after closing the right part, the a is still 1 (because we only closed the right part). \n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n          After closing the right part, the tabs are [1,4] (a=1, b=4). We are at 4. We wish to close the left part. We must move the cursor to a tab i such that i<=1 (the left boundary) and i>a (which is 1) -> no solution.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to close the left part from the current position (4) without moving? Then we close [a, i-1] = [1,3] which removes 1,2,3. Then we are left with 4. Then we have to leave [2,4] but we removed 2 and 3. So that is bad.\n\n        Therefore, we must not close the left part from 4. We need to move the cursor to the left from 4 to a tab <=1 (so that we can close the left part). \n\n        Steps for Option 2 (right then left):\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4 (1 move) [to be able to close the right part without affecting the desired segment]\n          Step 2: Close the right part (1 move): now tabs [1,4], a=1, b=4.\n          Step 3: Now, we need to close the left part. We must be at a tab i such that i<=1 (to close the left part, and we need i>a=1 -> no solution). \n\n        Alternatively, we can close the left part from a tab i that is in the desired segment? But then we remove too much.\n\n        So Option 2 doesn't work.\n\n        Therefore, the example must be solved by Option 1.\n\n        Now, is there a better way?\n\n        What if we do:\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 2 (1 move)\n          Step 2: Close the left part (1 move) -> [2,6]\n          Step 3: Then move from 2 to 4 (2 moves)\n          Step 4: Close the right part (1 move) -> total 5.\n\n        What if we do:\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4 (1 move)\n          Step 2: Close the right part (1 move) -> [1,4]\n          Step 3: Then we are at 4, but we cannot close the left part from 4 (as above). So we must move the cursor to a tab <=1 (but the current a is 1, so we can't have i<=1 and i>a). \n\n        Alternatively, we can move from 4 to 1 (3 moves) and then close the left part (1 move). Then we are left with [2,4]. \n\n        Steps for Option 2 (with extra moves):\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4: 1 move\n          Step 2: Close right: 1 move -> [1,4]\n          Step 3: Move from 4 to 1: 3 moves (right? no, we are at 4 and we want to go to 1, so we move left 3 times: 4->3->2->1)\n          Step 4: Close left: 1 move -> [2,4] (because the closure operation for left from 1: [a, i-1] = [1,0] -> nothing? Wait, no: after step 3, the tabs are [1,4] (from step 2) and then we move to 1. Then we close the left part: [a, i-1] = [1,0] -> nothing. \n\n        Why? Because the closure operation for left is defined as [a, i-1] where a is the current minimum. After step 2, the minimum a is 1. Then we move to 1, so i=1, then we close [1,0] -> nothing. \n\n        But we want to close the left part (tab 1). How? We must be at a tab i such that i>a. Here a=1, so i>1. But we are at 1, which is not >1. \n\n        Therefore, we must not move to 1. We must move to a tab that is >1 and <=1? Impossible.\n\n        So Option 2 is invalid.\n\n        Hence, we must do Option 1.\n\n        But wait, is there another way?\n\n        Alternative approach: maybe we don't need to close the left part from the leftmost desired tab. We can close the left part from a different tab.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4 (1 move)\n          Step 2: Close the right part (1 move) -> [1,4]\n          Step 3: Then move from 4 to 3 (1 move) [now at 3]\n          Step 4: Close the left part? From 3: [a, i-1] = [1,2] -> closes tabs 1 and 2. Then we are left with [3,4]. But we wanted [2,4] — we removed 2! \n\n        Not good.\n\n        Step 3: Move from 4 to 2 (2 moves) [from 4->3->2]\n        Step 4: Close the left part: from 2: [a, i-1]=[1,1] -> closes tab 1. Then we are left with [2,4]. That works.\n\n        Steps for Option 3 (right then left, but moving to 2 instead of 1):\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4: 1 move\n          Step 2: Close the right part: 1 move\n          Step 3: Move from 4 to 2: 2 moves (4->3->2)\n          Step 4: Close the left part: 1 move\n\n          Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n        Same as Option 1.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal time is 5.\n\n        Now, how to generalize for both closures?\n\n        We have two operations: left and right. The total time is the sum of:\n          - The moves to get to a starting position for the first closure (if we choose to do left first, then we need to move to a tab <=l-1 and also we must be at a tab i such that i>a_initial? Actually, no: the condition is i>a (current a) but initially a=1, so i>=2. But after closing one part, the a changes.\n\n        Actually, we have two independent movements: we need to visit two regions: the left region (<=l-1) and the right region (>=r). We can do them in any order, and the moves required are the distances from the current pos to these regions.\n\n        However, we must account for the fact that after one closure, the boundaries change, so the movement for the second closure might",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given tab position. The solution involves analyzing the required operations (moving the cursor and closing tabs) based on the initial conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The cursor starts at a given position, and each second Luba can either move the cursor left or right by one tab or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution depends on whether the desired segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs or only parts of it. Specifically:\n   - If the entire range is already covered (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no operations are needed.\n   - If only the left part needs closing (i.e., l = 1 and r < n), move the cursor to a position >= r and then close the right part.\n   - If only the right part needs closing (i.e., l > 1 and r = n), move the cursor to a position <= l-1 and then close the left part.\n   - If both parts need closing (i.e., l > 1 and r < n), the minimal operations involve moving the cursor to either the left region (<= l-1) or the right region (>= r), performing the closure, and then moving to the other region if necessary.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for each scenario and calculating the minimal moves required. The moves are determined by the distance from the starting position to the nearest boundary in the required direction.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if l_val == 1:\n        if pos < r_val:\n            moves = (r_val - pos) + 1\n        else:\n            moves = 1\n        print(moves)\n        return\n        \n    if r_val == n:\n        if pos > l_val - 1:\n            moves = (pos - (l_val - 1)) + 1\n        else:\n            moves = 1\n        print(moves)\n        return\n        \n    moves1 = 0\n    if pos < l_val - 1:\n        moves1 += (l_val - 1 - pos)\n    moves2 = 0\n    if pos < r_val:\n        moves2 += (r_val - pos)\n        \n    option1 = moves1 + 1 + moves2 + 1\n    \n    moves1 = 0\n    if pos > r_val:\n        moves1 += (pos - r_val)\n    moves2 = 0\n    if pos > l_val - 1:\n        moves2 += (pos - (l_val - 1))\n        \n    option2 = moves1 + 1 + moves2 + 1\n    \n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (l = 1 and r = n), the answer is 0 since no operations are needed.\n2. **Left Closure Only**: If only the left part needs closing (l = 1), the cursor must be moved to a position >= r. The number of moves is calculated based on the starting position relative to r.\n3. **Right Closure Only**: If only the right part needs closing (r = n), the cursor must be moved to a position <= l-1. The number of moves is calculated based on the starting position relative to l-1.\n4. **Both Sides Need Closing**: For scenarios where both left and right closures are required, two options are considered:\n   - Move to the left region first, then to the right region.\n   - Move to the right region first, then to the left region.\n   The minimal total moves between these two options is chosen as the solution.\n5. **Output**: The solution outputs the minimal number of seconds required, considering all possible operations and their respective move counts.",
