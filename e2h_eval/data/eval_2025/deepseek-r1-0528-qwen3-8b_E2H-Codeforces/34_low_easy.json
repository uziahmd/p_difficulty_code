And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we calculate the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average is ( (3+4) + (4+7) ) / (number of weeks) = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\". This means we are to compute:\n   total_sleep = (sum of sleep times for each week)\n   number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n Then average = total_sleep / number_of_weeks.\n\n However, note the third example: \n   Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n   Output: '28964.2857142857'\n\n How to compute the total_sleep?\n   We can use a sliding window to compute the sum for each week.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n   2. If k == 1, then each week is one day, so the average is the average of the entire array? Actually, no: \n        There are n weeks, each week is the single day. So total_sleep = sum(a) and number_of_weeks = n, so average = sum(a)/n.\n      But note: if k==n, then there's only one week, so average = sum(a)/1.\n\n   3. We can use a sliding window to avoid recalculating the whole window every time.\n\n Plan:\n   Let total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   Precompute the prefix sum for the array to quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total_sleep = 0\n   window_sum = sum(a[0:k])   # first window\n   total_sleep += window_sum\n\n   Then for i from 1 to n-k:\n        window_sum = window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sleep += window_sum\n\n   Then average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n But note: n and k can be up to 200,000, so we have to be efficient.\n\n Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n   total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n   First window: [3,4] -> sum=7\n   Then move: subtract a[0]=3, add a[2]=7 -> window becomes [4,7] -> sum=11\n   total_sleep = 7+11 = 18\n   average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n However, note the second example: \"1 1\\n10\"\n   n=1, k=1: total_weeks=1, window_sum=10, average=10.0.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n     Read n, k and the list of n integers.\n\n     total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n     If k == 0: but k>=1 per input, so skip.\n\n     We can use a list for prefix sums or use a running window.\n\n     Since n can be up to 200000, we can do:\n\n        total = 0\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total += current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total += current_sum\n\n        average = total / total_weeks\n\n     But wait: the example with k=1, n=1: \n        total_weeks = 1\n        current_sum = a[0:1] = [a0] -> 10, then total=10, then loop runs from 1 to 0 (so no iterations). Then average=10.\n\n     This matches.\n\n     However, note: if k==n, then we only have one window, and we don't enter the loop.\n\n     But what if k==0? Not possible.\n\n     But note: k<=n, so we are safe.\n\n     However, the problem says n and k are at least 1 and k<=n.\n\n     Now, we must output the average with absolute or relative error <= 1e-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then determining the average across all weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to consider every contiguous subarray of length `k` in the given list of sleep times. For each such subarray (week), we compute the sum of sleep times. The average sleep time is then the total sum of all these weekly sums divided by the number of weeks (which is `n - k + 1`).\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use a sliding window technique. This allows us to compute the sum for each subsequent window in constant time by adjusting the previous window's sum. Specifically, the sum for the current window is derived by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We first compute the sum of the initial window (first `k` elements). Then, for each subsequent window, we adjust the sum by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the next element in the list. This approach ensures an O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for large inputs (up to 200,000 elements).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element once to compute the initial window sum and then processes each subsequent window in constant time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1) (excluding the input storage), making it efficient for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sleep = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sleep += current_sum\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`. If there are no weeks (though constraints ensure `k <= n`), the output is set to \"0.0000000000\".\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: The sum of the first window (initial `k` elements) is computed. This sum is added to a running total (`total_sleep`). For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element.\n4. **Output**: The average is computed by dividing the total sleep time by the number of weeks. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average using a linear pass through the data, leveraging the sliding window technique to minimize redundant calculations.",
