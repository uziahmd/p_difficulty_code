The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length between 1 and 1000) containing only 'R','S','P'\n\n The game is played for n rounds. In each round i (from 0 to n-1):\n   Nikephoros uses the character at position (i mod m) in string A.\n   Polycarpus uses the character at position (i mod k) in string B.\n\n We need to count the total number of red spots (losses) for both players.\n\n Note: \n   - A red spot is added to the loser's body for each loss. Draws add nothing.\n   - So, we need to count the losses for Nikephoros and for Polycarpus.\n\n However, note that in each round one of the two can lose (or both? Actually, no: if it's a draw, then no one loses; if not, one of them wins and the other loses).\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Idea:\n   We note that the sequence of moves for Nikephoros is periodic with period m, and for Polycarpus with period k.\n\n   Therefore, the entire game has a period that is the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. But note: we are going to have a cycle of length L = LCM(m, k). However, the LCM might be very large (but m,k <= 1000, so LCM <= 1000*1000) but wait: 1000 and 1000 gives LCM=1000000 which is acceptable, but note n can be up to 2e9, so we don't want to iterate over LCM cycles if we can avoid it.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles (with cycle length = L = LCM(m,k)) and then a remainder.\n\n However, note: the state in a round i is determined by (i mod m, i mod k). The entire sequence of rounds is periodic with period L = LCM(m,k). \n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Compute L = LCM(m, k). We know that LCM(m,k) = (m * k) / GCD(m,k). But note: we are dealing with integers, and m,k up to 1000, so we can compute GCD and then LCM.\n\n  2. Precompute the outcomes for all rounds in one cycle (from round 0 to round L-1). Then, we can count:\n        total_red_spots_Nikephoros = (n // L) * (count of losses for Nikephoros in one cycle) + (count in the remaining r rounds)\n        Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n  3. But note: n can be 2e9, and L could be as large as 1000*1000 (if m and k are coprime) which is 10^6. Then, the number of cycles is n // L which is about 2000 (since 2e9 / 10^6 = 2000). But if we precompute one cycle (which is 10^6 rounds) and then use that to compute the entire n, then we can do:\n\n        Let cycle_length = L\n        Let full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n        Let remainder_rounds = n % cycle_length\n\n        Then, we can precompute an array for one cycle (length L) that tells for each round j (0-indexed from 0 to L-1) whether:\n            - In round j: \n                Let a = A[j % m]\n                Let b = B[j % k]\n\n            Then, determine the outcome:\n\n            According to the rules:\n                Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n                Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n                Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n            So, if a == b: draw -> no loss.\n\n            Otherwise, we check:\n                If (a, b) is a win for Nikephoros (so b loses) then:\n                    (a is R and b is S) OR (a is S and b is P) OR (a is P and b is R) -> then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n\n                Similarly, if (b, a) is a win (i.e., Polycarpus wins) then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n        We can also define a function:\n\n            def outcome(a, b):\n                if a == b:\n                    return 0, 0   # no one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use predefined sequences of moves that repeat cyclically. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a brute-force simulation of each round is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using repeating sequences of moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current moves of both players. The key observation is that the sequence of moves for each player is periodic, and thus the entire game's outcomes repeat every `L` rounds, where `L` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences.\n2. **Intuition**: By identifying one full cycle of length `L`, we can compute the total losses incurred by each player during this cycle. The total losses for `n` rounds can then be derived by multiplying the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles (`n // L`) and adding the losses from the remaining rounds (`n % L`).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences.\n   - For each round in one full cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) based on the current moves of both players.\n   - Sum the losses for each player over one full cycle.\n   - Use these sums to compute the total losses over `n` rounds by considering full cycles and the remaining rounds separately.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The complexity is dominated by the computation of the LCM and processing one full cycle, which is feasible since the sequence lengths are at most 1000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // g\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    count_N = 0\n    count_P = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            count_N += 1\n        elif (b_char == 'R' and a_char == 'S') or \\\n             (b_char == 'S' and a_char == 'P') or \\\n             (b_char == 'P' and a_char == 'R'):\n            count_P += 1\n            \n    total_N = full_cycles * count_N + count_N_remaining(remainder, A_str, B_str)\n    total_P = full_cycles * count_P + count_P_remaining(remainder, A_str, B_str)\n    \n    print(total_N, total_P)\n\ndef count_N_remaining(rem, A_str, B_str):\n    count = 0\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef count_P_remaining(rem, A_str, B_str):\n    count = 0\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if (b_char == 'R' and a_char == 'S') or \\\n           (b_char == 'S' and a_char == 'P') or \\\n           (b_char == 'P' and a_char == 'R'):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the length of one full game cycle.\n3. **Full Cycles Processing**: The total losses for each player over all full cycles are calculated by multiplying the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles.\n4. **Remaining Rounds Processing**: The remaining rounds after processing full cycles are handled separately by simulating each round and counting the losses.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
