Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Each hour, Vasily uses one candle (which burns for that hour).\n   - When a candle burns out, it becomes a burned candle.\n   - He can collect 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n However, note that the burning process might be thought of as:\n   - Initially, we have `a` new candles. We burn them, which gives us `a` hours and `a` burned candles.\n   - Then, from the burned candles, we can form `floor(a / b)` new candles, and we have `a % b` burned candles left over.\n\n But note: we can use the new candles we form again. So the process is iterative.\n\n Steps:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n   total_hours += current_candles   (because we burn all current_candles)\n   Then, we get current_candles burned candles. We can form new_candles = (current_candles + leftover) // b\n   And update the leftover = (current_candles + leftover) % b\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 2\" -> output 7.\n\n Let's simulate:\n\n   Start with 4 new candles.\n   Burn 4 candles -> 4 hours, and we have 4 burned candles.\n   Then, we can make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and leftover = 0.\n   Now we burn the 2 new candles -> 2 more hours (total 6), and then we get 2 burned candles.\n   Then, we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and leftover = 0 (but wait, actually from 2 burned we get 1, and then we burn that one -> 1 more hour (total 7) and then we get 1 burned, which is not enough for a new candle.\n\n But note: when we form the new candle, we use the burned ones and then we burn the new ones, so the cycle continues until we don't have enough burned candles to form a new one.\n\n However, the above simulation:\n\n   Hour 1-4: burn 4 candles -> total hours=4, burned=4\n   Then we make 4//2 = 2 new candles, and we have 0 leftover burned.\n   Now we have 2 new candles. Burn them for 2 hours (total 6), and then we have 2 burned.\n   Then we make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and 0 leftover.\n   Then we burn the 1 new candle for 1 hour (total 7), and then we have 1 burned, which we cannot use.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well?\"\n\n We can also think: the burning process is continuous, but the making of new candles happens after burning. However, note that the problem allows using the burned candles immediately to form new ones, which are then available for burning in the next hour? Actually, the process is:\n\n   Step 1: Use a candle (from either initial or recycled) to burn for an hour, then it becomes burned.\n   Step 2: Periodically, we take the burned candles and convert them (in groups of b) into new candles.\n\n Since we can use the new candles as soon as they are made, we can consider:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while current_new > 0:\n        # Burn all current_new candles\n        total_hours += current_new\n        burned += current_new\n        # Now, from burned, we can make new candles: floor(burned / b)\n        current_new = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n\n However, let's test with a=4, b=2:\n\n   Iteration 1:\n        current_new = 4, burned = 0\n        Burn 4: total_hours=4, burned=4\n        current_new = 4//2 = 2, burned = 0\n\n   Iteration 2:\n        Burn 2: total_hours=6, burned=2\n        current_new = 2//2 = 1, burned = 0\n\n   Iteration 3:\n        Burn 1: total_hours=7, burned=1\n        current_new = 1//2 = 0, burned=1\n\n   Then the loop stops. So total_hours=7.\n\n   Another example: a=6, b=3 -> output 8\n\n   Iteration 1:\n        current_new=6, burned=0\n        total_hours=6, burned=6\n        current_new",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be recycled to form new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial number of candles, `a`, and the recycling factor, `b`.\n2. **Burning Process**: For each iteration, burn all available new candles, adding their count to the total hours. The burned candles from these new candles are then used to form new candles.\n3. **Recycling Burned Candles**: Calculate how many new candles can be made from the burned candles (each new candle requires `b` burned candles). Update the count of new candles and the remaining burned candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when there are not enough burned candles left to form even one new candle (i.e., when the number of burned candles is less than `b`).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring that we account for all possible hours of light by continuously recycling the burned candles into new ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_new = a\n    burned = 0\n    \n    while current_new > 0:\n        total_hours += current_new\n        burned += current_new\n        current_new = burned // b\n        burned = burned % b\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_hours` keeps track of the total burning time. `current_new` starts with `a` and represents the candles available for burning in each iteration. `burned` accumulates the count of burned candles.\n3. **Loop Execution**: \n   - **Burning Phase**: In each iteration, all `current_new` candles are burned, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The burned candles from the current iteration are added to the pool. The number of new candles that can be made is calculated by integer division of the total burned candles by `b`. The remainder after division gives the leftover burned candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when no new candles can be formed (`current_new` becomes zero), and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the burning time by efficiently recycling burned candles into new ones, thus providing the optimal solution.",
