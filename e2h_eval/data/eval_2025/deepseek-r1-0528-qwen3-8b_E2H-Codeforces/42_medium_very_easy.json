Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each of size at most 1000 bytes (so maximum total size is 100*1000 = 100000 bytes).\n We are to find all integers x in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying when both progress bars show x.\n\n The first progress bar (current file) shows: floor(100 * (bytes copied in current file) / (size of current file))\n The second progress bar (overall) shows: floor(100 * (total bytes copied so far) / (total sum of all files))\n\n We note:\n   Let total = sum(a_i) for i=1..n.\n   We process files one by one.\n\n For the k-th file (with size a_k), we consider copying from 0 to a_k bytes.\n\n At the moment when we have copied 'b' bytes (0 <= b <= a_k) from the k-th file, the current progress bar is:\n   p1 = floor(100 * b / a_k)\n\n And the overall progress bar is:\n   p2 = floor(100 * (S + b) / total)   where S = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k-1}\n\n We require p1 == p2 == x (for some integer x between 0 and 100).\n\n However, note: the problem says that we update after every byte. So we can consider any b from 0 to a_k (inclusive) for the k-th file.\n\n But note: the overall progress bar depends on the entire history. We cannot simply consider each file independently because the overall progress bar accumulates.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the total number of bytes is at most 100000, but we are only asked for numbers from 0 to 100, we can try the following:\n\n Idea: Instead of iterating over every byte (which would be too slow if we do it for each file separately because 100000 bytes * 100 files is 10e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? Actually, worst-case 100000*100 = 10e6, which is acceptable in C++/Java but in Python might be borderline in speed? But note: n<=100, and total bytes <=100000, so worst-case 100000*100 is 10 million, which is acceptable in Python if we do simple operations.)\n\n However, we can avoid iterating over every byte by using mathematical reasoning.\n\n Alternatively, we can note: the condition for a particular x (from 0 to 100) is: there exists a file index k and a byte count b (0<=b<=a_k) such that:\n\n   floor(100 * b / a_k) = x   -->  which means: \n        x <= 100*b/a_k < x+1\n        => (x * a_k) / 100 < b <= ((x+1)*a_k)/100\n\n   and \n\n   floor(100 * (S + b) / total) = x   --> \n        x <= 100*(S+b)/total < x+1\n        => (x * total) / 100 < S+b < ((x+1)*total)/100\n\n But note: S is fixed (the sum of the previous files). And b must be an integer in [ceil((x*a_k+1)/100), floor(((x+1)*a_k)/100)]? Actually, the first condition is:\n\n        b_min1 = floor((x * a_k) / 100) + 1   [if we want strict inequality, but note: floor(100*b/a_k)=x => b must satisfy: ceil((x * a_k)/100) <= b <= floor(((x+1)*a_k - 1)/100)?]\n\n Let me re-express:\n\n   Condition 1: x <= 100*b / a_k < x+1\n        => (x * a_k) <= 100*b < (x+1)*a_k\n        => b >= ceil((x * a_k) / 100)   [but note: since 100*b must be at least x*a_k, and 100*b is integer? Actually, no: b is integer, but we have to use integer division?]\n\n Actually, we can write:\n\n        b_min1 = ceil((x * a_k) / 100.0)\n        b_max1 = floor(((x+1) * a_k) / 100.0 - 1e-9)   ? But note: the condition is strict less than (x+1)*100. Actually, we can use:\n\n        Condition: 100*b >= x * a_k   and 100*b < (x+1)*a_k.\n\n        So b_min1 = ceil((x * a_k) / 100.0)   [since 100*b >= x*a_k, then b >= ceil(x*a_k/100)]\n        and b_max1 = floor(((x+1)*a_k - 1) / 100)   [because 100*b < (x+1)*a_k => b < (x+1)*a_k/100, so maximum integer b is floor((x+1)*a_k/100 - epsilon) = floor((x+1)*a_k/100) - 1 if (x+1)*a_k is divisible by 100? But wait, if (x+1)*a_k is divisible by 100, then 100*b must be strictly less than that, so b_max1 = (x+1)*a_k//100 - 1? Or we can use:\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n        b_min1 = (x * a_k + 99) // 100   [because ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b]\n        But let's check: ceil(10*x/100) = ceil(x/10) -> (x + 9) // 10. So for a_k=100, x=5: ceil(500/100)=ceil(5)=5, but (5*100+99)//100 = (500+99)//100 = 599//100=5 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition is 100*b >= x*a_k. Then the smallest b is ceil(x*a_k/100). We can compute:\n\n        b_min1 = (x * a_k + 99) // 100   [if we use integer arithmetic, this gives the ceiling of (x*a_k)/100]\n\n        Similarly, the condition 100*b < (x+1)*a_k  => b < (x+1)*a_k/100, so the maximum b is floor((x+1)*a_k/100 - 1e-9) but we can use:\n\n        b_max1 = (x+1)*a_k // 100   if (x+1)*a_k % 100 != 0, then floor((x+1)*a_k/100) is the maximum? Actually, no: the condition is strict, so if (x+1)*a_k is divisible by 100, then we cannot have 100*b equal to (x+1)*a_k, so the maximum b is (x+1)*a_k//100 - 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        b_min1 = (x * a_k + 99) // 100\n        b_max1 = ( (x+1) * a_k ) // 100   # but wait, the condition is 100*b < (x+1)*a_k, so if (x+1)*a_k is divisible by 100, then we cannot reach (x+1)*a_k, so the maximum b is (x+1)*a_k//100 - 1.\n\n        Actually, the condition is 100*b < (x+1)*a_k. Then:\n\n        b_max1 = ( (x+1)*a_k - 1 ) // 100   [because we want the largest integer b such that 100*b < (x+1)*a_k]\n\n        So:\n          b_min1 = ceil(x*a_k / 100) = (x*a_k + 99) // 100\n          b_max1 = floor( ( (x+1)*a_k - 1 ) / 100 ) = ( (x+1)*a_k - 1 ) // 100\n\n        Then for the overall progress bar, we have:\n\n        Condition 2: x <= 100*(S+b)/total < x+1\n          => (x * total) <= 100*(S+b) < (x+1)*total\n          => (x * total) <= 100*S + 100*b < (x+1)*total\n\n          => (x * total - 100*S) <= 100*b < (x+1)*total - 100*S\n\n        Then:\n\n          b_min2 = ceil( (x * total - 100*S) / 100 )   [if positive, else 0?] but note: S+b >=0 and total>=0, and x>=0, so if (x * total - 100*S) is negative, then the condition is automatically satisfied for the lower bound (because 100*b is nonnegative). However, we must have b>=0.\n\n        Actually, we can combine the conditions for b:\n\n        Condition 1: b in [b_min1, b_max1] (for the current file)\n        Condition 2: b in [max(0, ceil((x * total - 100*S)/100)), floor(( (x+1)*total - 100*S - 1 ) / 100) ]   [but note: condition 2: 100*b >= x * total - 100*S and 100*b < (x+1)*total - 100*S]\n\n        But wait, condition 2: 100*(S+b) >= x * total  => 100*b >= x * total - 100*S, and 100*(S+b) < (x+1)*total => 100*b < (x+1)*total - 100*S.\n\n        Then for condition 2, we have:\n\n          b_min2 = max(0, (x * total - 100*S + 99) // 100)   [ceiling if positive, else 0] but note: if x * total - 100*S is negative, then we can take b_min2=0.\n\n        However, note: the ceiling formula (x * total - 100*S + 99) // 100 might be negative? Then we should set the minimum to 0.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n          low_bound = (x * total - 100*S + 99) // 100\n          Then b_min2 = max(0, low_bound)\n\n        But wait: the ceiling of a negative number? Let me test with negative: if x * total - 100*S is negative, say -5, then (-5+99)//100 = 94//100 = 0 -> which is correct (we need b_min2=0). So yes.\n\n        Similarly, for the upper bound:\n\n          high_bound = ( (x+1)*total - 100*S - 1 ) // 100   [because we want the largest integer b such that 100*b < (x+1)*total - 100*S]\n\n        Then condition 2 requires b to be in [b_min2, high_bound] (and note: high_bound might be negative, then no solution).\n\n        Now, for a fixed x and fixed file k (with size a_k, and S = sum_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i):\n\n          Condition 1: b must be in [b_min1, b_max1] (from 0 to a_k)\n          Condition 2: b must be in [b_min2, high_bound] (but note: b cannot exceed a_k, and also note that the overall progress bar condition must hold at the same time as the current file condition)\n\n        Then we require that the two intervals [b_min1, b_max1] and [b_min2, high_bound] (intersected with [0, a_k]) have at least one integer b.\n\n        However, note: we must also ensure that the overall progress bar condition uses the current file's progress (b) and the previous files (S). Also, we are processing the files one by one, so we know S.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        We can iterate x from 0 to 100.\n\n        For each x, we iterate over k from 0 to n-1 (each file) and set S = (prefix sum of the first k-1 files). Then:\n\n          Condition 1 (current file): \n            b_min1 = (x * a_k + 99) // 100\n            b_max1 = ( (x+1)*a_k - 1 ) // 100   [because 100*b < (x+1)*a_k]\n\n          Condition 2 (overall):\n            Let T = total = sum(a_i) for i=0 to n-1.\n            Let S_prev = S (the sum of the first k-1 files)\n            Then we require: 100*(S_prev + b) >= x * T   and 100*(S_prev + b) < (x+1)*T.\n\n            Then:\n              b_min2 = max(0, (x * T - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100)\n              b_max2 = ( (x+1)*T - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100\n\n          Now, b must be in [max(b_min1, b_min2), min(b_max1, b_max2, a_k)] and also the interval must be non-empty.\n\n        But note: we must also ensure that the current file condition does not exceed a_k, and the overall condition must use the current file's b (so the overall progress bar includes the current file's b).\n\n        However, there is a catch: the overall progress bar condition uses the entire history (including the current file's partial copy). Therefore, the above formulation is correct.\n\n        But wait: the condition for the overall progress bar is:\n\n            floor(100 * (S_prev + b) / T) = x\n\n        This condition is independent of the order of files? Actually, yes, because we are processing sequentially.\n\n        However, note: the overall progress bar is computed after each byte, so even if we are in the middle of a file, the overall progress bar is updated.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Let T = total sum (for the entire array)\n\n          For x from 0 to 100:\n\n            Let found = False\n\n            For k in range(n):   # k from 0 to n-1\n                a = a_list[k]\n                S_prev = prefix_sum[k]   # sum of the first k files (if we are at file k, then the previous files are from 0 to k-1, so S_prev = prefix_sum[k] without including a_k)\n\n                # Condition 1: current file (file k) must have a b that satisfies the current progress bar being x.\n                b_min1 = (x * a + 99) // 100\n                # But note: if x*a is 0, then b_min1=0, which is okay.\n\n                # However, the condition for the current file: we require that the current file has been processed at least b_min1 bytes and at most b_max1 bytes (without exceeding a).\n                b_max1 = ( (x+1)*a - 1 ) // 100\n\n                # If b_min1 > a, then no solution in this file for current progress bar being x.\n                if b_min1 > a:\n                    continue\n\n                # Condition 2: overall progress bar at the same time must be x.\n                # The total so far (before the current file) is S_prev, and we add b from the current file.\n\n                # Compute the required total bytes for overall progress bar to be at least x and less than x+1.\n                # The condition: x <= (100*(S_prev+b)) / T < x+1\n                # => 100*(S_prev+b) >= x*T and 100*(S_prev+b) < (x+1)*T.\n\n                # But note: we cannot have more than T bytes, and we are in the middle of the last file.\n\n                # The minimal total bytes for overall progress bar x is x*T (then floor(100 * (total_so_far)/T) = x if total_so_far >= x*T and < (x+1)*T/100? Actually, the condition is:\n\n                #   x <= 100*(S_prev+b)/T < x+1\n                #   => (x * T) <= 100*(S_prev+b) < (x+1)*T\n\n                # Then:\n                #   Lower bound for S_prev+b: ceil( (x*T) / 100.0 )? Actually, we can use:\n\n                #   b_min2 = max(0, (x*T - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100)\n                #   b_max2 = ( (x+1)*T - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100\n\n                # But note: the overall progress bar condition must be satisfied, and we are allowed to use the current file's b.\n\n                # However, we must also ensure that the overall progress bar condition is satisfied at the same moment (same b) as the current file's condition.\n\n                # Now, we require that b is at least b_min1 (from condition1) and at least b_min2 (from condition2) and at most min(b_max1, b_max2, a) (because we cannot exceed a in the current file).\n\n                # But note: condition2 does not restrict b by the current file's a? Actually, no: condition2 only requires the total amount of data so far (which is S_prev+b) to be in [x*T, (x+1)*T). However, we cannot have more than T, and also the current file's b cannot exceed a.\n\n                # Therefore, the upper bound for b from condition2 is ( (x+1)*T - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100, but note: we cannot exceed a (the current file's size). So the overall upper bound is min(a, ( (x+1)*T - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100).\n\n                # Similarly, the lower bound is max(b_min1, b_min2, 0) but we already set b_min1 and b_min2 to nonnegative.\n\n                # Then, we check if the interval [L, R] (where L = max(b_min1, b_min2) and R = min(b_max1, ( (x+1)*T - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100, a)) is non-empty and L <= R.\n\n                # But note: condition1 already requires that b_min1 <= a (we checked above) and condition2 requires that the total so far (S_prev+b) is at least x*T (which might require b_min2 to be negative, then we set to 0) and also that the total so far is less than (x+1)*T.\n\n                # However, we must also consider that the overall progress bar condition must be satisfied with the current file's b. The value of S_prev+b must be at least x*T and less than (x+1)*T.\n\n                # Steps for condition2:\n\n                #   Let A = 100 * (S_prev + b) must be in [x*T, (x+1)*T)\n\n                #   Then the minimal b for condition2 is: b_min2 = max(0, (x*T - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100)   [ceiling of (x*T - 100*S_prev)/100, but if negative then 0]\n\n                #   The maximal b for condition2 is: b_max2 = ( (x+1)*T - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100   [largest integer b such that 100*(S_prev+b) < (x+1)*T]\n\n                #   But note: condition2 does not impose an upper bound on b from the current file's a? Actually, we are already in the current file and b cannot exceed a. So we must combine with condition1's a.\n\n                #   Also, condition2's b_max2 might be larger than a, then we use a.\n\n                #   Now, we require that there exists an integer b in the intersection of [b_min1, b_max1] and [b_min2, b_max2] and [0, a].\n\n                #   So let L = max(b_min1, b_min2)\n                #       R = min(b_max1, b_max2, a)\n\n                #   Then if L <= R, then we have found an x that is achieved at this file k.\n\n                #   Then we mark x as valid and break out of the inner loop (or continue to next x).\n\n            However, note: the same x might be achieved multiple times, but we just need to know if there exists one moment (any file) for x.\n\n        But wait: what about the fact that the overall progress bar condition must be satisfied at the same moment (same b) and the current file condition? Yes, we are checking for the same b.\n\n        However, note: the overall progress bar condition uses the entire history, so we must have S_prev+b (the total bytes so far) and the current file's b. This is correct.\n\n        But note: the condition for the overall progress bar is floor(100*(S_prev+b)/T) = x, which is equivalent to:\n\n            x <= 100*(S_prev+b)/T < x+1\n\n        And for the current file: floor(100*b/a_k)=x.\n\n        We are combining these two conditions.\n\n        However, note: the overall progress bar condition is independent of the current file's condition, so we are good.\n\n        But note: we must consider that the same x might be achieved in different files. We don't care which file, so we can break early for x once we find one.\n\n        However, we must not break the outer x loop, but we can break the inner k loop once we find one file that satisfies the condition for x.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          total_sum = sum(a_list)\n\n          Let results = set()\n\n          For x in range(0, 101):\n              found = False\n              for k in range(n):\n                  a = a_list[k]\n                  S_prev = prefix_sum[k]   # prefix_sum[k] = sum(a_list[0:k])\n\n                  # Condition 1: current file k\n                  #   We require: floor(100*b/a) = x\n                  #   => (x * a) <= 100*b < (x+1)*a\n\n                  #   So b_min1 = ceil((x * a) / 100) = (x*a + 99) // 100\n                  b_min1 = (x * a + 99) // 100\n                  #   b_max1 = floor(( (x+1)*a - 1 ) / 100) = ( (x+1)*a - 1 ) // 100\n\n                  if x == 100:\n                      # Then condition1: we require 100*b >= 100*a -> b >= a, so b_min1 = a (if we use ceiling: (100*a +99)//100 = a + (99//100)=a) and b_max1 = (101*a-1)//100.

But (101*a-1)//100: for example, a=100: (10100-1)//100 = 10099//100 = 100, so then b_min1=a and b_max1=a, so condition1 requires b=a.\n\n                  # But note: if x==0, then condition1: 0 <= 100*b/a < 1 -> 0 <= 100*b < a -> b_min1=0, b_max1=(a-1)//100.\n\n                  # Condition2: \n                  #   Let A = 100*(S_prev+b) must be in [x*total_sum, (x+1)*total_sum)\n\n                  #   So the minimal b for condition2: \n                  #       b_min2 = max(0, (x*total_sum - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100)\n                  #   The maximal b for condition2:\n                  #       b_max2 = ( (x+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1 ) // 100\n\n                  #   However, note: we cannot have b greater than a (current file) and also the overall condition must hold.\n\n                  #   Now, we require that there exists a b in the interval [b_min1, b_max1] (for the current file) and also in [b_min2, b_max2] (for the overall progress bar) and also 0<=b<=a.\n\n                  #   Then, the valid b must be in [max(b_min1, b_min2), min(b_max1, b_max2, a)]\n\n                  #   But note: condition1 requires b<=b_max1 and condition2 requires b<=b_max2, and we also cannot exceed a.\n\n                  #   However, we must also note: the overall condition must be satisfied, and the overall condition does not impose an upper bound on b beyond the total_sum? Actually, the total_sum is fixed, but note: we are in the middle of the file, so the total so far (S_prev+b) must be less than (x+1)*total_sum.

But note: the overall progress bar condition requires that the total so far is less than (x+1)*total_sum. Since the total so far (S_prev+b) is at most S_prev+a (which is <= total_sum) and (x+1)*total_sum might be greater than total_sum (if x+1>100, then x=100: then (x+1)*total_sum = 101*total_sum, which is greater than the actual total_sum). \n\n                  #   Actually, the overall progress bar condition is defined as floor(100*(total_so_far)/total_sum). The total_so_far is at most total_sum, so the maximum value of the overall progress bar is 100.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive that can be simultaneously displayed on both progress bars during the copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing each file sequentially and checking for each possible percentage (0 to 100) if there exists a point during the copying process where both progress bars display the same percentage. The key insight is that for each file, we need to check specific byte ranges that would make the current file's progress bar show a certain percentage, and simultaneously ensure that the overall progress bar also shows the same percentage at that exact moment.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each percentage `x` (from 0 to 100), we iterate over each file. For each file, we calculate the range of bytes (`b_min1` to `b_max1`) that would make the current file's progress bar show `x`. Then, we calculate the range of bytes (`b_min2` to `b_max2`) that would make the overall progress bar show `x` at the same time. The intersection of these two ranges must be non-empty for `x` to be valid.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sums**: Compute prefix sums of the file sizes to quickly access the total bytes copied before the current file.\n   - **Range Calculation**: For each file and each percentage `x`, compute the valid byte ranges for both progress bars. The intersection of these ranges determines if `x` is achievable.\n   - **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks each percentage and each file in O(n) per percentage, making it feasible given the constraints (n ≤ 100, file sizes ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    prefix_sum = [0] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + a_list[i]\n    \n    results = set()\n    \n    for x in range(0, 101):\n        found = False\n        for k in range(n):\n            a_k = a_list[k]\n            S_prev = prefix_sum[k-1] if k > 0 else 0\n            \n            b_min1 = (x * a_k + 99) // 100\n            if b_min1 > a_k:\n                continue\n                \n            b_max1 = ((x + 1) * a_k - 1) // 100\n            \n            if x * total_sum <= 100 * S_prev:\n                b_min2 = 0\n            else:\n                b_min2 = (x * total_sum - 100 * S_prev + 99) // 100\n                if b_min2 < 0:\n                    b_min2 = 0\n                    \n            b_max2_val = ( (x + 1) * total_sum - 100 * S_prev - 1 ) // 100\n            \n            L = max(b_min1, b_min2, 0)\n            R = min(b_max1, b_max2_val, a_k)\n            \n            if L <= R:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.add(x)\n            \n    for x in sorted(results):\n        print(x)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array helps in quickly accessing the total bytes of all files processed before the current file.\n3. **Checking Percentages**: For each percentage `x` from 0 to 100:\n   - **Current File Check**: Calculate the range of bytes (`b_min1` to `b_max1`) that would make the current file's progress bar show `x`.\n   - **Overall Progress Check**: Calculate the range of bytes (`b_min2` to `b_max2`) that would make the overall progress bar show `x` at the same time.\n   - **Intersection Check**: If the ranges for both progress bars overlap, `x` is added to the results.\n4. **Output**: The valid percentages are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible percentages by leveraging mathematical ranges and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
