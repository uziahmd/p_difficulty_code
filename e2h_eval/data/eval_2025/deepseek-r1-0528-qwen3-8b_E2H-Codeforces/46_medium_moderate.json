    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to change at most one number in the subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We are going to consider three cases:\n 1. The entire sequence is already strictly increasing -> then answer n (with 0 changes) or if not, we can have a segment that might require one change.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n We can break the problem into:\n\n Case 1: Without any change, the longest strictly increasing contiguous subsegment.\n Case 2: With one change, we can merge two increasing sequences by fixing the element that breaks the increasing condition.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's define:\n   left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change).\n   right[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without any change).\n\n How to compute left[i]?\n   left[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, right[i]:\n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n Then, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Entirely increasing without change: maximum value of left[i] (or the whole array if it is increasing)\n\n Option 2: With one change, we can consider:\n\n   We are allowed to fix one element. There are two possibilities:\n\n   a) The fixed element is at the beginning (so the subsegment is [x, ..., y] and we fix x to be less than the next, but then we have to check the entire segment including the left part? Actually, we can consider a segment that is broken at some point, and we fix one element to bridge the gap.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: what are the candidate segments?\n\n   Consider a segment that is almost increasing, and we fix one element.\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n   - The segment is entirely increasing: then we don't need a fix, but we can also consider merging two increasing parts by fixing the middle element.\n\n   How to handle one change?\n\n   We can try to consider each position i as the one that we fix (or maybe the change is at the boundary). But note: we can fix one element arbitrarily.\n\n   Another idea: we can consider two adjacent increasing sequences and try to merge them by fixing the element between them.\n\n   Let's say we have two increasing sequences: [a0, a1, ..., ak] and [ak+1, ..., am] and at position k+1, ak >= ak+1. Then if we change ak+1 to be greater than ak, then the two sequences can be merged. Then the total length would be (left[k] + right[k+1])? But wait, we have to check the boundaries.\n\n   However, note that the change can be anywhere, so we can also consider a segment that is increasing except for one drop. We can consider:\n\n   For an index i (from 1 to n-2), if a[i-1] < a[i+1], then we can consider a segment from the start of the increasing run ending at i-1 to the end of the increasing run starting at i+1, and then the entire segment [j, j+1, ... , k] where j is the start of the left increasing part and k is the end of the right increasing part, but note we have to include i and change a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. But actually, we don't even need to know the exact value: we just need to know that the condition a[i-1] < (value at i) < a[i+1] holds.\n\n   However, note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   Let's say we fix an index i (the element we change). Then the segment we are considering must be such that:\n\n      [L, R] is the segment, and we are allowed to change a[i] to something that fits between its neighbors.\n\n   Conditions:\n\n      If i is at the beginning (i=0) or the end (i=n-1), then we can only fix one element and the segment is the entire contiguous increasing part that includes that element.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Candidate 1: Without any fix, the entire array might be increasing? Then we can get n.\n\n   Candidate 2: With one fix, we can combine two increasing runs by fixing the element that is causing the break.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let ans = max(left)   # because without changing, we can have a segment of length max(left)\n\n   Then, consider each index i (from 0 to n-1) as the candidate for the fixed element.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to fix only one element, and the entire segment must be strictly increasing. The segment we choose must be contiguous.\n\n   How about:\n\n   For an index i (which we fix), we want to extend to the left and right as much as possible.\n\n   We can define:\n\n     left_bound[i] = the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending at i (without considering the fixed element at i) but including i? Actually, we don't know the value at i until we fix it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n     Let L[i] = left[i]  (the increasing run ending at i)\n     Let R[i] = right[i] (the increasing run starting at i)\n\n   Now, if we fix index i, then we can merge the left increasing run and the right increasing run, but we have to ensure that the element we fix is greater than the one on the left and less than the one on the right.\n\n   However, note: the fixed element can be chosen arbitrarily. So the condition for being able to merge is:\n\n     Condition for merging: \n        If i is not at the boundary, then we require that the left part (if exists) and the right part (if exists) can be connected.\n\n        Specifically, if i is in the middle (i.e., has both left and right neighbors), then we require:\n          a[i-1] < a[i+1]   (because we can set a[i] to any value between a[i-1] and a[i+1])\n\n        Then the total length would be: left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1   (we are including the fixed element at i)\n\n        But note: the left part ends at i-1, and the right part starts at i+1. We are merging these two.\n\n        However, what if the left part is empty? Then we don't have a left neighbor. Similarly, if the right part is empty.\n\n   Therefore, we can consider:\n\n     For each index i (from 1 to n-2), if a[i-1] < a[i+1], then the segment from i-left_run-1 to i+right_run+1 can be fixed by changing a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. Then the length is left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1.\n\n     Also, we can consider fixing an element at the boundaries:\n\n        Fixing at the first element (i=0): then the segment is from 0 to (right[1]-1) + 1? Actually, we can fix the first element and then the entire right part starting from 0? But note: the segment must be contiguous and strictly increasing.\n\n        After fixing a[0], the next element must be greater than the fixed a[0]. Since we can choose arbitrarily, we can set a[0] to a value less than a[1]. Then the segment can be from 0 to the entire increasing run starting at 0 (if we fix the first element, then the rest must be increasing). However, note: we are only allowed one change.\n\n        So the segment that we fix the first element would be from 0 to (the entire increasing run starting at 0) but wait, we don't break the increasing condition after the first element? Actually, we can set a[0] to a value that is less than a[1], then the rest of the segment must be increasing.\n\n        Therefore, the segment from 0 to j (for j from 0 to n-1) is valid if we fix a[0] and the rest is increasing. But note: the rest of the segment must be increasing. However, the entire segment from 0 to j must be strictly increasing. We can set a[0] arbitrarily, so the condition is that the subarray from 1 to j must be strictly increasing.\n\n        Then the length is: (length of the increasing run starting at 1) + 1 (for the fixed a[0])? Actually, we can set a[0] to be less than a[1] and then the entire segment from 0 to j (where j is the end of the increasing run starting at 1) is valid.\n\n        So for i=0, the candidate is: 1 + right[1]   (because we fix a[0] and then we can use the entire increasing run starting at 1)\n\n        Similarly, for i=n-1 (last element): candidate is left[n-2] + 1.\n\n        But wait: what if the entire segment from 0 to n-1 is increasing? Then we don't need a fix, but we are allowed to change one, so we can still take the entire segment? Actually, if we change one element arbitrarily, we can also take the entire segment (by changing one element that doesn't break the increasing condition, but we don't need to change anything). However, the problem says \"at most one\", so we can do zero or one. So we are already covering the entire segment without change.\n\n        But note: the above candidate for i=0 and i=n-1 might be redundant with the left and right arrays because the entire array might be increasing.\n\n        However, we must consider that sometimes the entire array is increasing, then our candidate without fix is n, which is the maximum.\n\n   But note: the above candidate for the middle index i requires that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. What if there is no left or right? Then we don't require that condition.\n\n   Actually, we can generalize:\n\n     Let candidate = 1 (at least one element)\n\n     For an index i (fixed):\n\n        If i is the first element (i==0):\n            candidate = max(candidate, 1 + right[1])\n\n        If i is the last element (i==n-1):\n            candidate = max(candidate, left[n-2] + 1)\n\n        If i is in the middle (0 < i < n-1):\n            # Check if we can merge the left and right without violating the condition\n            # We require that the left part (ending at i-1) and the right part (starting at i+1) can be merged by a single fixed value at i.\n            # Condition: a[i-1] < a[i+1] (then we can choose a value between them for a[i])\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = max(candidate, left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1)\n\n        Additionally, we can consider that we might fix an element that is already in a strictly increasing sequence? Actually, if we fix an element that is already in a strictly increasing sequence, then we don't need to change it, but we are allowed to change one. However, we can always choose to not change it, so the segment without change is already considered. But note: we are trying to maximize the length.\n\n        However, note: the above candidate for the middle index i might be larger than the left[i] or right[i] because we are merging two parts.\n\n   But wait, is that all? Consider: we are only allowed to change one element. The above candidate for the middle index i uses one change. Similarly, the boundary candidates use one change.\n\n   However, what if the entire segment is not increasing, but we fix an element that is in the middle and the left and right parts are not necessarily the entire increasing runs? Actually, the left[i-1] is the increasing run ending at i-1, and right[i+1] is the increasing run starting at i+1. So they are maximal.\n\n   But note: the entire segment we consider for the middle index i is from (i - left[i-1]) to (i+1 + right[i+1] - 1). And we are setting a[i] to a value that is between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. Then the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n   However, what if the left part and the right part are separated by more than one element? Actually, we are only changing one element, so we are considering the entire segment from the beginning of the left run to the end of the right run, with the fixed element in the middle.\n\n   But note: we must ensure that the entire segment is strictly increasing. The left part is increasing, the right part is increasing, and we set the fixed element to be greater than the left neighbor and less than the right neighbor. Then the entire segment is increasing.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the left part and the right part are separated by the fixed element. The left part ends at i-1, and the right part starts at i+1. The fixed element is at i. So we have:\n\n        ... , a[i-1], (fixed value), a[i+1], ...\n\n        and we set the fixed value to be between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. Then the condition for the entire segment is satisfied.\n\n   But note: we are not forced to use the entire left run and entire right run. We can use a part of the left run and a part of the right run. However, the left[i-1] gives the maximal increasing run ending at i-1, and right[i+1] gives the maximal increasing run starting at i+1. So by taking the entire left run and entire right run, we are getting the maximal contiguous increasing segments that can be merged.\n\n   But what if the left run and the right run are not adjacent? Actually, we are fixing the element at i, so the entire segment from the start of the left run to the end of the right run is:\n\n        [start_left, start_left+1, ..., i-1, i, i+1, ..., end_right]\n\n        And the length is (left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1])? Actually, the left run of length left[i-1] ends at i-1, so the start of the left run is i-1 - left[i-1] + 1. Then the fixed element is at i, and the right run starts at i+1 and has length right[i+1]. So the total length is (left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]).\n\n   However, wait: our left[i] is defined as the length of the increasing subsegment ending at i. So for index i-1, left[i-1] is the increasing run ending at i-1, meaning that the segment from (i - left[i-1]) to (i-1) is increasing. Then we add the fixed element at i, and then the segment from i+1 to (i+right[i+1]) is increasing.\n\n   But note: the entire segment from (i - left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]) is:\n\n        [i - left[i-1], i - left[i-1] + 1, ..., i-1, i, i+1, ..., i+right[i+1]]\n\n        The length is: left[i-1] (from i-left[i-1] to i-1) + 1 (for i) + right[i+1] (from i+1 to i+right[i+1]) = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n   But wait, our candidate for the middle index i is left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1.\n\n   However, we must consider: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. We have:\n\n        Condition 1: The left part is increasing (by definition of left[i-1]).\n        Condition 2: The right part is increasing (by definition of right[i+1]).\n        Condition 3: The fixed element must be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1].\n\n   But note: we are allowed to choose the fixed element arbitrarily, so condition 3 is satisfied if a[i-1] < a[i+1].\n\n   However, what if the left part and the right part are not contiguous? Actually, we are making the entire segment contiguous by fixing the element at i.\n\n   But note: the left part ends at i-1 and the right part starts at i+1. The entire segment is from (i - left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]), and we are inserting the fixed element at i. Then the increasing condition must hold between the last element of the left part and the fixed element, and between the fixed element and the first element of the right part. That is exactly condition 3.\n\n   But what about the rest of the connections? The left part is increasing and the right part is increasing, and the fixed element is between the two. Then the entire segment is increasing.\n\n   However, note: the left part and the fixed element are connected by the condition that the fixed element must be > a[i-1]. Similarly, the fixed element and the right part are connected by the condition that the fixed element must be < a[i+1]. The rest of the connections within the left and right parts are already satisfied.\n\n   But wait: what if the left part is empty? Then we don't have a left neighbor. Similarly for the right part.\n\n   Actually, we already handled the boundaries separately. For the middle, we assume both neighbors exist.\n\n   However, let me reexamine the boundaries:\n\n        i=0: we don't have a left, so we require that the entire segment from 0 to (right[1]-1) is increasing? Actually, we fix the first element, so the condition is that the rest (from 1 to ...) is increasing. Then the entire segment from 0 to (the end of the increasing run starting at 1) is valid. The length is 1 + right[1].\n\n        Similarly, i=n-1: we fix the last element, so the condition is that the part from 0 to n-2 is increasing. Then the entire segment from 0 to n-1 is valid? Actually, we fix the last element arbitrarily, so we set it to be greater than a[n-2]. Then the entire segment from 0 to n-1 is valid. The length is left[n-2] + 1.\n\n   But wait, what if the entire array is increasing? Then:\n\n        Without fix: we can take the entire array (n) and with fix we can also take the entire array (but we don't need to fix). However, our candidate for the entire array is already captured by the left array (max(left) >= n). Then we don't need to do anything.\n\n   However, what if we fix an element that is already in an increasing segment? Then we might get a longer segment? Actually, no: because if the entire array is increasing, then we don't need to fix. But if we fix an element arbitrarily, we can extend beyond the increasing run? \n\n   Example: [1, 2, 3, 4] (entirely increasing). Then we can fix the first element to 0, then [0,2,3,4] is still increasing. But we are already allowed to take the entire array. However, the entire array is already included.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"at most one\" change.\n\n   However, our method for the boundaries and the middle might not cover the case when we fix an element that is not the only one breaking the increasing condition? Actually, the problem allows us to change one element arbitrarily. So we are free to change one element and then extend the segment arbitrarily (as long as the rest is increasing). However, note: we cannot break the condition that the rest of the segment is increasing.\n\n   But wait, our method for the middle index i is:\n\n        We require that the left and right parts are increasing and that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then we can merge.\n\n   This method does not consider the possibility that the break is not exactly at i, but somewhere else? Actually, we are considering every index as the candidate for the fixed element.\n\n   But note: the break in the increasing condition might be fixed by changing one element. The entire segment we consider must be contiguous.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if the break is not a single element? Actually, we can only fix one element. So the segment must have at most one violation of the strictly increasing condition, and that violation must be fixed by changing that one element.\n\n   But note: if there are multiple breaks, then we cannot fix the entire segment by changing one element.\n\n   Our approach:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute left and right arrays.\n\n        Step 2: ans = max(max(left), max(right))   [Actually, we don't need max(right) because we can traverse the entire array? But note: the left array gives the increasing run ending at each index, so the maximum left[i] is the longest increasing run without any fix. But we can also have a segment that is entirely increasing and appears in the middle. But note: the left array already captures the entire increasing run from the beginning? Actually, no: the left array is computed from the left, so the maximum left[i] is the longest increasing run that ends at some index.\n\n        However, the entire array might be increasing, then the maximum left[i] is n.\n\n        Step 3: Consider the boundaries and the middle indices.\n\n        But wait: what if the longest increasing run is in the middle, and we can extend it by one change? Then we have to consider merging two increasing runs.\n\n        However, note: we are already considering the entire array (without fix) in step 2.\n\n        Step 4: Then consider:\n\n            candidate_ans = max(ans, \n                                (if i=0: 1+right[1] if n>=2 else 1),\n                                (if i=n-1: left[n-2]+1 if n>=2 else 1),\n                                (for i from 1 to n-2: if a[i-1] < a[i+1] then left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1))\n\n        But wait, what if the array has length 1? Then n=1, then we don't have any boundaries (since i=0 is the only index, and we don't have left or right). Then the candidate for i=0: we don't have a right[1] because n=1, so we skip the middle and boundary conditions. Then we output 1.\n\n        However, the problem says: we can change at most one number. The entire segment of length 1 is already strictly increasing (no change needed). So 1 is correct.\n\n        But note: the above step 2: if n=1, then left[0]=1, so ans=1.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            ans = max( max(left), \n                      1 + (right[1] if n>1 else 0),\n                      (left[n-2]+1 if n>1 else 0),\n                      (left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1 for i in range(1, n-1) if n>2 and a[i-1] < a[i+1]) )\n\n        However, we must avoid index errors.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate through the array and consider:\n\n            candidate = 1   # at least one element\n\n            Then, for the entire array without fix, we have candidate = max(candidate, max(left))\n\n            Then, for i in range(n):\n                if i == 0:\n                    if n > 1:\n                        candidate = max(candidate, 1 + right[1])\n                elif i == n-1:\n                    if n > 1:\n                        candidate = max(candidate, left[n-2] + 1)\n                else:\n                    # i from 1 to n-2\n                    if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                        # We can fix a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]\n                        candidate = max(candidate, left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1)\n\n        But wait, what if the entire array is increasing? Then the candidate from the boundaries and the middle might be larger? Actually, no: because if the entire array is increasing, then for i=0: 1 + right[1] = 1 + (n-1) = n, which is the same as max(left). Similarly, for i=n-1: left[n-2]+1 = (n-1) + 1 = n. And for the middle: left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1 = (some value) but the entire array is increasing, so the condition a[i-1] < a[i+1] holds, and the candidate would be (left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1). However, note: if the entire array is increasing, then left[i-1] = i (because from 0 to i-1) and right[i+1] = n - (i+1) (from i+1 to n-1). Then the candidate is i + (n-i-1) + 1 = n. So we get n.\n\n        But note: we are already capturing n from the left array (max(left)=n). So we don't need to worry.\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if the array is not entirely increasing, but we can fix one element and get a longer segment than the entire array? \n\n        Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n            Without fix: the longest increasing contiguous subsegment is 2 (either [1,3] or [2,4] or [3,2] is not increasing, so the max(left) is 2 (for the first two and the last two) and 1 for the middle 3,2.\n\n            Now, consider fixing the 3 (at index1) to 0: then [0,2,4] is increasing, but wait, the segment we are considering must be contiguous. We cannot remove the 3 from the middle? Actually, the entire array is [1,0,2,4] and the entire array is increasing? Then we can have a segment of length 4.\n\n            How do we capture this?\n\n            In our method, we consider the entire array as the segment that we fix the element at index1. But note: the entire array is from index0 to index3.\n\n            We are considering the fixed element at index1. Then we look at the left part: left[0] = 1 (since a[0]=1). The right part: right[2] = 2 (since a[2]=2 and a[3]=4, so from index2 to index3 is increasing of length2). Then the candidate for i=1: left[0] + right[2] + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\n            Then the answer is 4.\n\n        But wait, how about the condition for the fixed element? We require a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Here, i=1: a[0]=1, a[2]=2 -> 1<2, so condition holds.\n\n        So that works.\n\n        Another example: [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]\n\n            Without fix: the longest increasing contiguous subsegment is 4 (from index2 to index4: [2,3,4]) or [1,5] is not increasing because 1<5 but then 5>2, so the increasing runs: \n                left: [1,1,1,2,3] \n                right: [1,1,2,2,1] -> wait, let's compute:\n\n                a = [1,5,2,3,4]\n\n                left: \n                  index0: 1\n                  index1: 5>1 -> 2\n                  index2: 2<5 -> 1\n                  index3: 3>2 -> 2\n                  index4: 4>3 -> 3\n\n                right:\n                  index4: 1\n                  index3: 3<4 -> 2\n                  index2: 2<3 -> 3\n                  index1: 5>2 -> 1\n                  index0: 1<5 -> 1, but wait: the increasing condition for right: from the current index to the right.\n\n                Actually, right should be computed as:\n\n                  right[4]=1\n                  right[3]= (a[3]<a[4]) -> 2\n                  right[2]= (a[2]<a[3]) -> 3 (because 2<3, then 3<4, so from index2: 2,3,4 -> length3)\n                  right[1]= (a[1]=5, then compare to a[2]=2 -> 5>=2 -> so right[1]=1\n                  right[0]= (a[0]=1 < a[1]=5 -> then right[0]=right[1]+1=2)\n\n                Then, the candidate for the entire array without fix is max(left)=3 (at index4) and max(right)=3 (at index2).\n\n                Now, consider fixing index1 (the 5). Then condition: a[0]=1 < a[2]=2 -> yes. Then candidate = left[0] + right[2] + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.\n\n                Then the entire array becomes [1, x, 2,3,4] and we set x to a value between 1 and 2, say 1.5. Then the entire array is [1,1.5,2,3,4] which is strictly increasing. So the answer is 5.\n\n        However, note: the original array has length 5, so we are capturing the entire array.\n\n        But wait: the entire array is [1,5,2,3,4]. After fixing 5 to 1.5, we have [1,1.5,2,3,4]. This is strictly increasing.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n            Read n and list a.\n\n            if n==0: print(0)\n            elif n==1: print(1)\n\n            else:\n                left = [1]*n\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                        left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n\n                right = [1]*n\n                for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n                    if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                        right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n\n                ans = max(max(left), max(right))   # without fix\n\n                # Consider the boundaries and the middle\n\n                # Boundary i=0\n                if n > 1:\n                    # We can fix the first element\n                    candidate0 = 1 + right[1]   # if we fix a[0], then we can take the entire increasing run starting at 1 (which is right[1]) and add the fixed a[0] at the beginning.\n                    ans = max(ans, candidate0)\n\n                # Boundary i=n-1\n                if n > 1:\n                    candidate_last = left[n-2] + 1\n                    ans = max(ans, candidate_last)\n\n                # Middle indices: from 1 to n-2\n                for i in range(1, n-1):\n                    if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                        # We can fix a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]\n                        # Then the segment we can form is from the beginning of the left run ending at i-1 to the end of the right run starting at i+1, with the fixed element at i.\n                        candidate_mid = left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1\n                        ans = max(ans, candidate_mid)\n\n                print(ans)\n\n        However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,5,3,4]?\n\n            Without fix: \n                left: [1,2,3,1,2] -> max=3\n                right: [3,2,1,2,1] -> max=3\n\n            Now, fix the element at index2 (5) because 1<3. Then candidate_mid for i=2: left[1] + right[3] + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n            Then the entire array becomes [1,2,x,3,4] and we set x to a value between 2 and 3 (say 2.5). Then [1,2,2.5,3,4] is strictly increasing. So the answer is 5.\n\n        But what if the array is [1,2,5,3,4,5]?\n\n            Without fix: left: [1,2,3,1,2,3] -> max=3\n            right: [4,3,2,2,2,1] -> max=4 (from the entire array from index0 to index3? Actually, let's compute right:\n\n                right[5]=1\n                right[4]= (a[4]=5, a[5]=5 -> not strictly increasing, so right[4]=1)\n                right[3]= (a[3]=3, a[4]=5 -> 3<5 -> then right[3]=right[4]+1=2\n                right[2]= (a[2]=5, a[3]=3 -> 5>=3 -> right[2]=1\n                right[1]= (a[1]=2, a[2]=5 -> 2<5 -> right[1]=right[2]+1=2\n                right[0]= (a[0]=1, a[1]=2 -> 1<2 -> right[0]=right[1]+1=3\n\n            Then without fix, the maximum is 3 (from left) and 3 (from right) and 4? Actually, the entire array without fix: [1,2,5] is increasing (length3), [3,4,5] is increasing (length3). \n\n            Now, fix index2 (5): condition a[1]=2 < a[3]=3 -> yes. Then candidate_mid = left[1] (which is 2) + right[3] (which is 2) + 1 = 5.\n\n            Then the entire array becomes [1,2,x,3,4,5] and we set x between 2 and 3. Then the entire array is increasing. So the answer is 6? Wait, the entire array has 6 elements.\n\n            But wait, our candidate_mid calculation: the segment we are considering is from (i-left[i-1]) to (i+right[i+1]). \n\n            For i=2: \n                left[i-1] = left[1] = 2 -> so the left part is from index0 to index1 (because left[1] is the increasing run ending at index1, which is 2). Then we fix index2, and then the right part is from index3 to index5 (because right[3]=2, so from index3 to index4? Actually, right[3] is the increasing run starting at index3: [3,4,5] -> so right[3] should be 3? \n\n            Let me recalc right for [1,2,5,3,4,5]:\n\n                right[5]=1\n                right[4]= (a[4]=4 < a[5]=5) -> 2\n                right[3]= (a[3]=3 < a[4]=4) -> 3\n                right[2]= (a[2]=5 >= a[3]=3) -> 1\n                right[1]= (a[1]=2 < a[2]=5) -> 1 + right[2] = 1+1=2\n                right[0]= (a[0]=1 < a[1]=2) -> 1 + right[1] = 3\n\n            Then for i=2: \n                candidate_mid = left[1] + right[3] + 1 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n            So the entire array is captured.\n\n            But wait, the entire array is [1,2,5,3,4,5]. After fixing the 5 at index2 to, say, 2.5, we get [1,2,2.5,3,4,5]. This is strictly increasing.\n\n            So the algorithm must use the correct right[i] and left[i]. \n\n            However, note: the right[i] is defined as the length of the increasing run starting at i. So for i=3, the increasing run is [3,4,5] -> length3.\n\n            Therefore, the code must be:\n\n                left = [1]*n\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                        left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n\n                right = [1]*n\n                for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n                    if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where at most one element can be changed to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the array to determine the maximum possible length of such a subsegment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by altering at most one element. The key insight is that the subsegment must be almost strictly increasing, with at most one violation that can be fixed by changing a single element.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution leverages dynamic programming to precompute two arrays:\n   - `left[i]` which stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - `right[i]` which stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute `left` and `right` arrays to capture the lengths of increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n   - The answer is derived from three scenarios:\n     - The longest increasing subsegment without any modifications (maximum value in `left` or `right`).\n     - The longest subsegment obtained by fixing the first element (if applicable).\n     - The longest subsegment obtained by fixing an interior element (if applicable), provided the neighboring elements allow merging adjacent increasing subsegments.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes the array twice (once for `left` and once for `right`), resulting in a time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the `left` and `right` arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(max(left), max(right))\n    \n    candidate0 = 1 + right[1]\n    ans = max(ans, candidate0)\n    \n    candidate_last = left[n-2] + 1\n    ans = max(ans, candidate_last)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            candidate_mid = left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1\n            ans = max(ans, candidate_mid)\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the array size `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array size is 1, the result is trivially 1 since a single element is already strictly increasing.\n3. **Left Array Calculation**: The `left` array is filled such that each element `left[i]` holds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n4. **Right Array Calculation**: The `right` array is filled such that each element `right[i]` holds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n5. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is the maximum value found in either the `left` or `right` arrays, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n6. **Boundary Cases Handling**: The solution checks the cases where the first or last element is modified to potentially extend the longest subsegment.\n7. **Middle Elements Handling**: For each middle element, if modifying it allows merging adjacent increasing subsegments, the potential new subsegment length is calculated and the maximum is updated accordingly.\n8. **Output**: The final result, which is the length of the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by modifying at most one element, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios where a single modification could extend the longest strictly increasing subsegment, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
