Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines with (l, r, cost)\n Conditions:\n  - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n  - The two vouchers must not intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1) be the duration of voucher i.\n    Then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n 2. We want to minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n 3. The non-intersection condition: \n      Condition 1: r_i < l_j   => voucher i ends before voucher j starts.\n      Condition 2: r_j < l_i   => voucher j ends before voucher i starts.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    Since the total number of days is up to 200000 and n up to 200000, we cannot try all pairs.\n\n    Idea:\n        Group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d (from 1 to x-1), we can have multiple vouchers.\n\n        But note: x can be as large as 200000, so we can have durations from 1 to 200000.\n\n        We are only interested in pairs (d, x-d). So we can create a dictionary (or list) that maps duration d to a list of (l, r, cost) for each voucher.\n\n    However, the non-intersection condition depends on the intervals. We need to check if two vouchers (with durations d and x-d) do not overlap.\n\n    Alternate idea:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute the duration for each voucher and store the voucher (l, r, cost) by duration.\n\n        Step 2: For each duration d, let the other duration be x-d. We will consider pairs (voucher from d, voucher from x-d).\n\n        But how to efficiently check non-intersection? And also, we want the minimal cost for a pair (d, x-d) that satisfies the non-intersection condition.\n\n        However, we cannot iterate over every pair of vouchers because there might be many with the same duration.\n\n    How to handle the non-intersection condition?\n\n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j   -> This means that the first voucher ends before the second starts.\n        Condition 2: r_j < l_i   -> Similarly.\n\n        We can break the problem into two cases:\n\n        Case 1: First voucher ends before the second starts (r_i < l_j).\n        Case 2: Second voucher ends before the first starts (r_j < l_i).\n\n        But note: we are considering two distinct vouchers, and we don't know which one comes first.\n\n        Actually, the condition is symmetric in the sense that we require at least one of the two.\n\n        However, we can consider:\n\n            For a fixed pair (voucher i, voucher j) with durations d and x-d, we have two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: Use voucher i (duration d) and voucher j (duration x-d) and check if r_i < l_j.\n            Possibility 2: Use voucher j (duration x-d) and voucher i (duration d) and check if r_j < l_i.\n\n        But wait, the condition is defined without order: the two conditions are independent of which voucher is which.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: they do not intersect. Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] do not intersect if either b < c or d < a.\n\n        So we can consider two cases:\n\n            Case A: The first voucher (i) has duration d, and the second (j) has duration x-d, and we require r_i < l_j.\n            Case B: The first voucher (i) has duration d, and the second (j) has duration x-d, and we require r_j < l_i? \n\n        But note: the condition is symmetric. We can fix an order arbitrarily.\n\n        However, we are going to consider both orders by having two different groups (if we swap the two vouchers, then the durations are swapped). \n\n        But note: the two vouchers have fixed durations: one is d and the other is x-d. So if we have two different durations, then we can consider:\n\n            Group1: duration d, Group2: duration x-d.\n\n        Then we want to find a voucher i from Group1 and a voucher j from Group2 such that either:\n            (a) r_i < l_j   OR (b) r_j < l_i.\n\n        However, note that if d != x-d, then we have two distinct groups. If d == x-d, then we are taking two vouchers from the same group (but distinct indices). Then we require that the two vouchers do not intersect.\n\n        But wait, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be taken in any particular order. The condition is symmetric.\n\n        However, when we fix the two groups (if d != x-d) then we can consider:\n\n            Case 1: Take a voucher from Group1 (duration d) and a voucher from Group2 (duration x-d) and check if the first ends before the second starts (r1 < l2).\n            Case 2: Take a voucher from Group2 (duration x-d) and a voucher from Group1 (duration d) and check if the second ends before the first starts (r2 < l1)? \n\n        But actually, the condition is independent of the order: we just need the two intervals to be disjoint. However, the two orders might lead to the same pair (if we consider unordered pairs) but we are storing two groups.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the two cases separately:\n\n            Case A: For a voucher i in Group1 (duration d) and voucher j in Group2 (duration x-d), we require r_i < l_j.\n\n            Case B: For a voucher i in Group1 (duration d) and voucher j in Group2 (duration x-d), we require r_j < l_i.\n\n        But note: the condition is automatically satisfied if one of these holds. However, we must remember that we are considering the two groups independently.\n\n        However, the condition is about the entire interval, so we can precompute for each group the best cost for a voucher that ends by a certain day (for case A) and the best cost for a voucher that starts after a certain day (for case B).\n\n        But wait, how?\n\n        Let's break down:\n\n        Case A: We want to find a voucher i in Group1 (duration d) and a voucher j in Group2 (duration x-d) such that r_i < l_j.\n\n            For voucher j in Group2, we require l_j > r_i. We can preprocess Group2: for each starting day s (l_j), we have a minimal cost for any voucher in Group2 that starts at s (or more precisely, we want the minimal cost for any voucher in Group2 that starts at s, and then we can use that to combine with a voucher i from Group1 that ends by s-1).\n\n        Similarly, for Case B: We require r_j < l_i.\n\n            For voucher i in Group1, we require l_i > r_j. Then we can preprocess Group1 for each starting day, and then for each voucher j in Group2, we look for a voucher i in Group1 with l_i > r_j.\n\n        But note: the condition in Case A is: r_i < l_j. This is equivalent to: the entire interval of voucher i is [l_i, r_i] and voucher j is [l_j, r_j] and r_i < l_j.\n\n        How to do this efficiently?\n\n        We can do:\n\n        For a fixed pair of durations (d, x-d):\n\n            Let A = list of vouchers (each as (l, r, cost)) for duration d.\n            Let B = list of vouchers for duration x-d.\n\n            We want to consider two conditions:\n\n                Condition 1: There exists a voucher in A with r < l of some voucher in B.\n                Condition 2: There exists a voucher in B with r < l of some voucher in A.\n\n            But note: we are iterating over all pairs of durations (d, x-d). The total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but note that x can be even or odd, and we are only interested in d and x-d.\n\n        However, we cannot iterate over each distinct d and then over each voucher in A and B because the total number of vouchers is 200000 and the groups might be large.\n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute an array for all durations: for each duration d, store a list of (l, r, cost). Then, we are only concerned with d and x-d.\n\n        But we cannot iterate over all d from 1 to x (which is 200000) and then for each d, iterate over the two groups (if they exist). That would be O(n^2) in worst-case.\n\n        We need a better idea.\n\n        Insight:\n\n        Instead of grouping by duration, we can consider:\n\n        We need two vouchers: one with duration d, the other with duration x-d.\n\n        Let F(d) = list of (l, r, cost) for duration d.\n\n        We want to find min_{i in F(d), j in F(x-d)} { cost_i + cost_j } subject to (r_i < l_j) OR (r_j < l_i).\n\n        We can split the condition into two separate cases and then take the minimum of the two cases.\n\n        Case 1: Condition (r_i < l_j) for i in F(d) and j in F(x-d).\n\n        Case 2: Condition (r_j < l_i) for i in F(d) and j in F(x-d).\n\n        Then answer = min( answer_case1, answer_case2 )\n\n        But note: it is possible that for a fixed (d, x-d) both cases yield a solution, but we are looking for the minimal cost.\n\n        However, we must consider that d and x-d might be the same (if x is even and d = x/2). Then we are taking two distinct vouchers from the same group.\n\n        How to handle Case 1?\n\n            We want: for a voucher i in F(d): we require that there exists a voucher j in F(x-d) with l_j > r_i.\n\n            We can precompute for F(x-d): \n                Let T = sorted list of (l, cost) for each voucher in F(x-d). But note: we also have r, but the condition is only on l_j and we know that the voucher j must start after r_i.\n\n            However, we also have the cost. We want the minimal cost for a voucher j in F(x-d) that has l_j > r_i.\n\n            Similarly, for F(d): we have multiple vouchers i, each with r_i.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Precompute for each duration group (for each d) a data structure that allows us to query:\n\n                For a given value v (like r_i for Case1), we want the minimal cost of a voucher in F(x-d) that has l_j > v.\n\n            But note: we are going to do this for every d that is less than x (and d <= x-d) and then for the symmetric case.\n\n        However, the total number of distinct durations might be large, but note that the input n is up to 200000, so the distinct durations are at most 200000.\n\n        But the total work would be: for each distinct d (that is, for each key in the duration map) we consider the complementary duration x-d. Then we have to query the two groups.\n\n        The problem: We cannot build a data structure for each complementary group on the fly because we might have many distinct durations.\n\n        Instead, we can precompute for each duration group (for all durations) a sorted list by l and then build a segment tree or a Fenwick tree for the minimal cost for vouchers with a given starting day? \n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each group (each duration) the following:\n\n            Sort the vouchers by l (starting day) and then for each starting day, we can keep the minimal cost for that starting day (but we don't care about starting day, we care about the condition on l_j > r_i).\n\n        Then, for a fixed complementary duration g = x-d, we can:\n\n            Build an array for group g: sort by l (the starting day). Then, we can also precompute an array min_cost_from_right: for each index i (in the sorted list by l) we store the minimum cost from i to the end (so that we can quickly get the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= some value).\n\n            Actually, we want: for a given r_i, we want the minimal cost of a voucher in group g with l_j > r_i.\n\n            Steps for group g:\n\n                Step 1: Extract all (l, r, cost) from group g.\n                Step 2: Create an array of (l, cost) and sort by l.\n                Step 3: Then, we want to ignore the r? Actually, the condition is only on l_j. But note: the voucher j must have l_j > r_i. However, we don't care about the r of voucher j (except that it must be consistent with the duration, but the duration is fixed by g, so r_j = l_j + g - 1). But we don't need the r for the condition in Case1.\n\n            However, we have stored the entire voucher, but the condition only uses l_j. So we can ignore the r for the condition? But we must ensure that the voucher j is valid (it has duration g). The duration is fixed by g, so we know that the voucher j has duration g, hence r_j = l_j + g - 1. But the condition does not require anything about the r_j, only that l_j is greater than r_i.\n\n        Therefore, for Case1:\n\n            For a fixed d and complementary g = x-d, we do:\n\n                Let A = F(d)   (each element is (l_i, r_i, cost_i))\n                Let B = F(g)   (each element is (l_j, r_j, cost_j))\n\n                Then, for each voucher i in A, we need to find the minimal cost_j from B such that l_j > r_i.\n\n                We can preprocess B: sort B by l_j, and then create an array for the minimal cost from the last element to the first (for increasing l_j, we want the minimal cost for all vouchers with l_j >= L).\n\n                Specifically, for B:\n\n                    Sort B by l_j (increasing). Then, we can create an array min_cost_after_index[i] for the sorted B: meaning, for the i-th smallest l_j, what is the minimal cost among all vouchers from i to the end.\n\n                Then, for a given r_i, we can do a binary search in B (on l_j) to find the smallest index such that l_j > r_i. Then the minimal cost for vouchers with l_j > r_i is min_cost_after_index[index].\n\n            Then, for voucher i, we get candidate = cost_i + (min_cost_after_index[index] if exists)\n\n            Then we take the minimum candidate over all i in A.\n\n        Similarly, for Case2 (complementary condition):\n\n            Condition: r_j < l_i.\n\n            Now, we fix d and g=x-d.\n\n            We want: for each voucher j in B (duration g), we want to find a voucher i in A (duration d) such that l_i > r_j.\n\n            Similarly, we can preprocess A: sort A by l_i, and then create min_cost_after_index for A (by l_i).\n\n            Then, for each voucher j in B, we find the minimal cost_i in A such that l_i > r_j (using the same method).\n\n        Then, the answer for the pair (d, g) is the minimum between the two cases (if both cases exist).\n\n        However, we must consider that we are only allowed to use two distinct vouchers.\n\n        Also, if d == g, then we are using two vouchers from the same group. But note: the condition still requires non-intersection.\n\n        This method works for both same and different groups.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, x and the n lines.\n\n            Step 2: Group the vouchers by duration. Let groups = {}\n                    For each voucher (l, r, cost):\n                        d = r - l + 1\n                        Append (l, r, cost) to groups[d]\n\n            Step 3: Preprocess for each duration d that appears (and also for d' = x-d if d <= x-d to avoid duplicate processing? But note: we need to consider both d and x-d. However, if d != x-d, then we will process the pair (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) is the same. So we can restrict to d <= x-d to avoid double counting.\n\n            But wait: the two conditions (Case1 and Case2) are symmetric? Actually, no: in Case1 we are checking condition with the first voucher (duration d) and the second (duration x-d). In Case2 we are checking the same condition but swapping the roles. However, if we process the pair (d, x-d) we cover both cases.\n\n            However, we must consider: if d != x-d, then we process the pair (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) is the same, but our grouping by duration d and x-d are separate. Actually, we don't need to process both because we are going to consider:\n\n                For a given d (<= x-d) and g = x-d, we process:\n\n                    Case1: A = group[d], B = group[g] and condition (voucher from A ends before voucher from B starts)\n                    Case2: A = group[g], B = group[d] and condition (voucher from B ends before voucher from A starts)\n\n            But wait, in Case2 above we did:\n\n                Condition: r_j < l_i, and we fixed d and g=x-d, then we used A = group[d] and B = group[g]. Actually, in Case2 we did:\n\n                    We want: for each voucher j in B (g) we look for a voucher i in A (d) with l_i > r_j.\n\n            But note: the condition is symmetric. However, we must consider that the two vouchers are distinct and the condition is defined without order.\n\n            Actually, the two cases are:\n\n                Case1: (voucher from d) must end before (voucher from x-d) starts: r_d < l_{x-d}\n                Case2: (voucher from x-d) must end before (voucher from d) starts: r_{x-d} < l_d\n\n            These are two different conditions.\n\n            Therefore, we must process each unordered pair (d, x-d) (with d <= x-d) and then consider both conditions.\n\n            However, note: if d != x-d, then the two conditions are independent and we are covering both. But if d == x-d, then the two conditions are the same? Actually, no: in the same group, we are taking two distinct vouchers. The condition is symmetric: if we swap the two vouchers, the condition becomes the same. But note: we are processing the same group twice? \n\n            Actually, when d == x-d, then we are processing the pair (d, d). Then:\n\n                Case1: We take two vouchers from group d: condition is that the first ends before the second starts: r1 < l2.\n                Case2: We take two vouchers from group d: condition is that the second ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n            But these two conditions are the same: we require two distinct vouchers that do not intersect. So we can merge them: we are effectively checking both orders. But note: if we have two vouchers i and j, then the condition is either r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i. So we must check both.\n\n            However, in our processing for (d, d) we are doing:\n\n                Case1: A = group[d], B = group[d] and condition (voucher from A ends before voucher from B starts)\n                Case2: A = group[d], B = group[d] and condition (voucher from B ends before voucher from A starts)\n\n            But wait, in Case1 we are using the same set of vouchers for both A and B, and we are requiring that for a voucher i in A, there exists a voucher j in B (which might be the same set) such that r_i < l_j. And similarly for Case2.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. But the problem says two distinct vouchers. Our grouping by duration d and then using the same group for both A and B, we must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct. \n\n            How do we handle that?\n\n            In the preprocessing for a group (for Case1 and Case2) we should not remove duplicates? Actually, the input has distinct vouchers (each line is a voucher) and we are storing all. But when we process the same group for both A and B, we are allowing the same voucher to be chosen twice? \n\n            We must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct. However, the condition in the problem is two distinct vouchers (i != j). \n\n            In Case1 and Case2 for the same group, we are considering two distinct vouchers. But note: when building the data structure for the group, we have all the vouchers. Then, when we query for a voucher i in A, we are allowed to pick any voucher j in B (including the same voucher if it appears twice? but each voucher is distinct). Actually, we are storing the vouchers by (l, r, cost). The same voucher (same l, r, cost) might appear multiple times? The problem does not say they are distinct. But the input: each line is a voucher. So we can assume that two vouchers are distinct if they are different lines.\n\n            However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. In our grouping, we are storing each voucher. Then, in Case1 for the same group, if we have a voucher i, we are allowed to pick a different voucher j from the same group. \n\n            But note: the condition in Case1: r_i < l_j. This condition is independent of the identity of the voucher. However, if the same voucher appears twice (two identical vouchers) then we have two distinct vouchers (because they are two different lines) and then we can use both.\n\n            But the problem does not guarantee uniqueness. So we must consider that.\n\n            However, the problem states: \"choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\".\n\n            So if the same voucher (same l, r, cost) appears twice, then we have two distinct vouchers.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Step 1: Group by duration.\n\n            Step 2: For each duration d that is <= x-d (to avoid duplicates for pairs (d, x-d) and (x-d, d)), we do:\n\n                Let g = x - d\n\n                Case1: \n                    A = group.get(d, [])\n                    B = group.get(g, [])\n\n                    If A and B are both non-empty, then:\n\n                    Preprocessing for B (for Case1): \n                        Sort B by l (the start day). Then, we want to ignore the r (because the condition is only on l) and then for each starting day, we want the minimal cost for any voucher in B that has that starting day or higher? Actually, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l_j >= L (for a given L).\n\n                    Steps for Case1:\n\n                        Sort B by l: sorted_B = sorted(B, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        Then, we can extract the list of l's and the list of costs, and then compute an array min_cost_from_end:\n\n                            Let L_arr = [b[0] for b in sorted_B]\n                            Let cost_arr = [b[2] for b in sorted_B]\n\n                            min_cost_arr = [0]*len(sorted_B)\n                            if len(sorted_B) > 0:\n                                min_cost_arr[-1] = cost_arr[-1]\n                                for idx in range(len(sorted_B)-2, -1, -1):\n                                    min_cost_arr[idx] = min(cost_arr[idx], min_cost_arr[idx+1])\n\n                            Then, for a given r_i (from a voucher in A), we need to find the smallest index in sorted_B such that l_j > r_i.\n\n                            How? We can do a binary search in L_arr for r_i, then take the next index.\n\n                    Then, for each voucher i in A:\n\n                        Let r_i = voucher_i[1] (the end day of voucher i)\n\n                        We need to find the first voucher j in B with l_j > r_i.\n\n                        If found, candidate = cost_i + min_cost_arr[index] (where index is the first index where l_j > r_i)\n\n                    Then, update the global answer with the minimal candidate from Case1.\n\n                Case2:\n\n                    Now, we are going to consider the condition: r_j < l_i.\n\n                    Here, we want to use B (duration g) and A (duration d). \n\n                    Preprocessing for A (for Case2): \n                        Sort A by l (the start day). Then, similarly, we can build an array for the minimal cost from the end.\n\n                    Then, for each voucher j in B (duration g):\n\n                        Let r_j = voucher_j[1] (the end day of voucher j)\n\n                        We need to find the minimal cost_i in A such that l_i > r_j.\n\n                    Then, update the global answer.\n\n            Additionally, we must consider the possibility that the same pair (d, x-d) might be processed again when d > x-d? We avoid that by processing only d <= x-d.\n\n            However, what if d > x-d? Then we skip. But note: if d > x-d, then we would have processed the pair (x-d, d) when d was x-d and then we skipped because x-d <= d is false? Actually, we are iterating d from ...? We haven't specified the iteration.\n\n            We should iterate over all durations d that are present and such that d <= x-d. But note: if x-d is not present, then we skip.\n\n            Also, if d > x, then we skip because the duration d must be <= x (since the other duration is x-d, which must be positive). But our grouping only includes d from 1 to max_duration (which is 200000). And x can be up to 200000.\n\n            But note: the duration d is at least 1 and at most 200000, and x can be up to 200000. So if d > x, then x-d would be negative, which is impossible. So we require d <= x.\n\n            So we can iterate over all d in the keys of the group dictionary (and also including durations that are not present? No, we only have the ones that appear). But we must consider that if d > x, then skip.\n\n            However, the problem says: the vacation is exactly x days, and the total duration must be x. So if d > x, then we don't consider.\n\n            Steps for iteration:\n\n                Let ans = a very large number (or infinity)\n\n                For each duration d in the keys of groups:\n                    if d > x: continue\n                    g = x - d\n                    if g < d: continue   # because we only process d <= g to avoid duplicate pairs (d, g) and (g, d). But wait: if d <= g, then we process. But if d > g, then we skip. However, note: we are processing the pair (d, g). But if d > g, then the complementary duration g is less than d, and we will process the pair (g, d) when we get to g (if g is in the keys). But we don't know if g is in the keys.\n\n                Alternatively, we can iterate over d from 1 to x//2 (inclusive) and if d <= x-d and d is in the keys, then process (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) is the same? Actually, we are processing the pair (d, x-d) and we are considering both conditions (Case1 and Case2). \n\n                But note: the conditions are not symmetric in the two groups. Case1 is for (d, x-d) and Case2 is for (x-d, d) but we are processing the same pair (d, x-d) and we are using:\n\n                    Case1: A = group[d], B = group[x-d] and condition (A ends before B starts)\n                    Case2: A = group[x-d], B = group[d] and condition (B ends before A starts)\n\n                But wait, in Case2 we are using the same two groups, but we swapped the roles. \n\n                However, note: in Case1 we are using the duration d for the first voucher and x-d for the second. In Case2 we are using the duration x-d for the first voucher and d for the second. But the condition is:\n\n                    Case1: r_i (from duration d) < l_j (from duration x-d)\n                    Case2: r_j (from duration x-d) < l_i (from duration d)\n\n                This is correct.\n\n            However, we must consider that if d == x-d, then we are processing the same group for both A and B. Then, the two conditions are independent and we must ensure that we don't use the same voucher twice.\n\n            But in the processing for the same group, we are storing the entire list. Then, when we do the binary search in the sorted list (for the other group) we are allowed to use any voucher from the same group. However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice.\n\n            How? \n\n                In the same group (d == x-d), we are processing Case1: \n                    A = group[d], B = group[d]\n\n                Then, we are querying for each voucher i in A: we look in B for a voucher j with l_j > r_i.\n\n                This query returns a candidate from B. But if the same voucher i is in B, then we might pick j=i? \n\n                But note: the condition is that the two vouchers are distinct. In the same group, we are storing the same set. We must avoid matching the same voucher.\n\n                However, we don't know which voucher is which. But note: we are storing the entire voucher (l, r, cost). The same voucher (same l, r, cost) might appear multiple times (but they are distinct by the input). But if we have two identical vouchers (same l, r, cost) then they are distinct and we can use both.\n\n                But if we have a single occurrence of a voucher, then we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n                How to avoid using the same voucher?\n\n                In the same group, we must ensure that when we query for a voucher i, we are not returning the same voucher i (if it exists in the same group). However, we don't know which voucher is which. \n\n                We can do:\n\n                    In the preprocessing for the group (for Case1 and Case2) we can store the vouchers along with an id (but the problem doesn't require to output the vouchers, only the minimal cost). \n\n                Alternatively, we can preprocess the group (for Case1) by removing duplicates? But wait, two identical vouchers (same l, r, cost) are distinct and we should consider them as two different vouchers.\n\n                Actually, the condition is based on the interval. Two vouchers with the same l, r, cost are identical and will have the same effect. But if we have two identical vouchers, then we can use both. However, if we have one voucher, then we cannot use it twice.\n\n                But note: in the same group, we are storing the entire list. Then, when we build the sorted list for the group, we include all vouchers. Then, when we do the query for a given r_i, we are getting the minimal cost from the entire list (including the same voucher i if it appears). \n\n                However, the same voucher i is represented by (l_i, r_i, cost_i). When we query for l_j > r_i, we are looking for a voucher j (which might be a different voucher) with l_j > r_i. But if the same voucher i has l_i and r_i, then we require l_j > r_i. But note: the same voucher i has l_i, and we don't know if l_i > r_i? (No, because l_i <= r_i). So the same voucher i will not satisfy the condition (unless there is another voucher with the same l_i and r_i, then we have two copies and we can use one copy for i and the other for j).\n\n                Therefore, if the same voucher appears multiple times, then we have multiple entries in the list, and the query will return the same cost (if the minimal cost is from a copy of the same voucher) and that is acceptable.\n\n                But if we have only one copy, then we cannot use the same voucher twice, and the query will return a different voucher (if exists) or not.\n\n                However, we are storing the entire list, and the query does not distinguish between the same voucher. It just looks for any voucher in the group with l_j > r_i.\n\n                So if we have one copy, then we are safe because we are not including the same voucher (unless there is a voucher j with l_j > r_i that happens to be the same as i? but no, because the same voucher has l_i, and we require l_j > r_i, and since l_i <= r_i, then l_i > r_i is false. So the same voucher i is not included in the query result.\n\n                Therefore, we don't need to worry about the same voucher being used twice.\n\n            However, there is one more issue: the condition for non-intersection is independent of the identity of the voucher. We are only using the intervals.\n\n        Step 4: After processing all d (with d <= x-d and d <= x), we output the minimal cost found, or -1 if no solution.\n\n        But note: we are processing the pair (d, x-d) for d <= x-d. What if the minimal solution comes from a pair (d, x-d) with d > x-d? Then we would have processed it when d was the smaller one. So we don't need to process d > x-d.\n\n        However, what if d == x-d? Then we process it once.\n\n        Example: n=4, x=5, vouchers: [ (1,3,4), (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4) ]\n\n        Voucher1: (1,3,4) -> duration=3\n        Voucher2: (1,2,5) -> duration=2\n        Voucher3: (5,6,1) -> duration=2\n        Voucher4: (1,2,4) -> duration=2\n\n        Then, we are looking for two vouchers with total duration 5. So d=2 and g=3.\n\n        Then, we process d=2 (<=3) and g=3.\n\n        Case1: A = [ (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4) ] (duration 2) and B = [ (1,3,4) ] (duration 3)\n\n            For each voucher in A:\n\n                voucher (1,2,5): r_i=2, then we look in B for l_j>2 -> the only voucher in B has l_j=1 -> no match.\n                voucher (5,6,1): r_i=6, then look for l_j>6 -> no match.\n                voucher (1,2,4): r_i=2, no match.\n\n            Case1: no solution.\n\n        Case2: Now, we use A = B (duration 3) and B = A (duration 2) for the condition: r_j (from duration 2) < l_i (from duration 3)\n\n            For each voucher j in A (which is now the original A for duration 2, but wait: no, in Case2 we are using:\n\n                A = group[g] = group[3] = [ (1,3,4) ]\n                B = group[d] = group[2] = [ (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4) ]\n\n            Then, for each voucher j in A (duration 3): \n                voucher (1,3,4): r_j=3, then we look in B for l_i>3 -> \n                    B: [ (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4) ] -> sorted by l: [1,1,5] -> the minimal cost for l_i>3 is the one with l_i=5: cost=1 -> candidate = 4+1 = 5.\n\n            So we get candidate 5.\n\n        Then, we output 5.\n\n        However, the example input says the answer is 5.\n\n        But wait, in the example input, the two vouchers are the first and the third. The first voucher is (1,3,4) (duration 3) and the third is (5,6,1) (duration 2). \n\n        Why did we not get the first voucher in the first case? \n\n        In Case1, we were using the first voucher (duration 3) as the second voucher and the third voucher (duration 2) as the first. Then the condition was: the first voucher (third) ends at 6, and we require the second voucher (first) to start after 6 -> but the first voucher starts at 1, so fails.\n\n        But in Case2, we used the first voucher (duration 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their durations and then checking pairs of durations that sum to `x` while ensuring the non-overlapping condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. Each voucher's duration is calculated as `r_i - l_i + 1`. This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Processing Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d` (where `d <= x - d`), we check if there exists another duration `g = x - d` in the grouped vouchers. If both durations exist, we proceed to find valid pairs of vouchers from these groups that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n3. **Non-Overlapping Conditions**: There are two conditions to consider:\n   - **Case 1**: The end day of a voucher from group `d` is strictly less than the start day of a voucher from group `g`.\n   - **Case 2**: The end day of a voucher from group `g` is strictly less than the start day of a voucher from group `d`.\n4. **Efficient Query Handling**: For each case, we preprocess the vouchers of the complementary group by sorting them by their start day and building a structure to quickly find the minimal cost voucher that starts after a given day.

If both durations exist, the algorithm checks for valid non-overlapping pairs between the two groups.\n4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For each voucher in one group, the algorithm uses binary search to find the earliest voucher in the complementary group that starts after the current voucher ends. The minimal cost for such vouchers is stored to ensure the solution is found efficiently.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal total cost of valid pairs is tracked throughout the process. If no valid pair is found, the result is `-1`; otherwise, the minimal cost is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and find the optimal solution by leveraging grouping and binary search techniques.",
