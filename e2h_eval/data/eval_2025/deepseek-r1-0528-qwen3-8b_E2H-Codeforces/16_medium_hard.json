Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation for this problem is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The block containing a point can be described by the side of each line (either positive or negative). \n\n However, note that we are allowed to cross a road only at a common border (which is the entire line? but actually we can cross one road at a time, and the step from one block to another requires crossing one or more roads? Actually, the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that two blocks are adjacent (have a common border) if they share a segment of one of the roads (so they are separated by exactly one road). \n\n Therefore, the graph we can build has nodes as blocks (each defined by a sign pattern for all n lines) and edges between two blocks that differ in exactly one line (because if two blocks are separated by exactly one road, then they are adjacent and have a common border). Then the problem reduces to: given two nodes (home and university) in this graph, what is the minimum number of steps (edges) required to go from home to university?\n\n But note: the total number of blocks is 2^n, which is too large to explicitly build the graph when n can be up to 300.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Notice that crossing a road changes the sign for that road. So the state of a block is a binary vector of length n (each element indicating which side of the i-th road the block is on). \n\n Now, consider the home and the university. For each road, we can determine which side of the road the home is on, and which side the university is on. Let s_i = 1 if the home and university are on the same side of road i, and 0 otherwise.\n\n Then, the minimum number of road crossings needed to go from home to university is the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides (because for each such road, we must cross it an odd number of times, and for the others, we don't need to cross). However, note the movement rule: we can only move from one block to an adjacent one (crossing one road) at a time. But wait, the problem does not require crossing one road at a time? Actually, the step condition is that the common border is nonzero. Since the common border is a segment of one road (if the two blocks are adjacent), then we cross exactly one road per step.\n\n However, observe that if two blocks are separated by k roads, then we must cross each of these k roads an odd number of times and the others even (but even can be zero). The minimal path would cross each separating road exactly once. But note: we can cross a road multiple times, but that would not be minimal.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides? \n\n However, wait: if we cross a road, we flip the side. So the entire journey must flip the side for every road that separates the two. But note: the graph is bipartite? Actually, the graph is a hypercube of dimension n, but with the hypercube edges being defined by flipping one bit. Then the distance from home to university is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\n But note: the sign vector for a point is determined by the side of each road. How to compute the side?\n\n For a given road equation: ai*x + bi*y + ci = 0.\n For a point (x0, y0): \n   value = ai*x0 + bi*y0 + ci\n\n Then the side is positive if value > 0, negative if < 0. But we don't care about the actual value, just the sign.\n\n Now, let's define for the home and the university:\n   For each road i, let h_i = sign(ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci) [we can use >0 as True, <0 as False, for example]\n   Similarly, u_i = sign(ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci)\n\n Then, the two points are on the same side of road i if h_i == u_i, and opposite if h_i != u_i.\n\n The minimal number of steps is the number of roads i for which h_i != u_i.\n\n But wait: is that really the case? Consider: \n   Step 1: cross one road (flip one bit) -> then we are one step closer in terms of matching the sign vectors.\n\n However, note: we are moving in the plane, and we cannot jump arbitrarily. But the graph is defined by the arrangement of lines, and the adjacency is by crossing one road. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n Example from input: \n   Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n\n   For Road1 (y=0):\n        Home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive? Actually, the equation is 0*x+1*y+0=0 -> y=0. \n        For home (1,1): 1 (positive) and university (-1,-1): -1 (negative) -> opposite.\n\n   For Road2 (x=0):\n        Home: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n        University: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 (negative) -> opposite.\n\n   Therefore, both roads separate the two points, so the answer is 2.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   We have three roads:\n        Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n        Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n        Road3: 1*x + 1*y - 3 = 0 -> x+y=3\n\n   For home (1,1):\n        Road1: 1 -> positive\n        Road2: 1 -> positive\n        Road3: 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n\n   For university (-1,-1):\n        Road1: -1 -> negative\n        Road2: -1 -> negative\n        Road3: -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative\n\n   Now, compare:\n        Road1: positive vs negative -> opposite\n        Road2: positive vs negative -> opposite\n        Road3: negative vs negative -> same\n\n   So the answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads for which the two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: the sign function: we must be cautious because the equation can be multiplied by -1 and still represent the same line. But the side is defined by the sign of the expression. \n\n But note: the problem says the roads are defined by aix+biy+ci=0, and we are guaranteed that the home and university are not on any road.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n   Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For each of the n roads (each with a, b, c):\n        Compute value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        Compute value2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        If (value1 > 0 and value2 < 0) or (value1 < 0 and value2 > 0):\n            Then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Count the number of roads that satisfy the above.\n\n   Print the count.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is given as a line that is defined by (a,b,c) and we use the expression without normalizing the sign? \n\n The expression a*x+b*y+c is linear, and the sign depends on the orientation of the line. However, note that if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the signs for the two points will flip. But that doesn't change the fact that they are opposite: if originally (value1 and value2) are opposite, then after multiplying by -1, (value1 becomes negative of original, and value2 becomes negative of original) so the opposite relation is preserved.\n\n However, we are using the same equation for both points. The important thing is consistency: if the two points are on opposite sides, then the product value1 * value2 should be negative (unless one is zero, but they are guaranteed not to be on the road). \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if (value1 > 0 and value2 < 0) or (value1 < 0 and value2 > 0):\n\n But note: we might have very large numbers, but the comparison is straightforward.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the equation might be defined with a different sign convention, but the condition for opposite sides is independent of the scaling (as long as we use the same equation for both). \n\n But note: if we multiply the equation by a positive constant, the signs remain the same. If we multiply by a negative constant, the signs flip. However, the problem does not specify the sign. \n\n But observe: the condition for the two points being on opposite sides is that they are separated by the line. The line divides the plane, and the two points are on opposite sides regardless of the representation. \n\n However, our computation uses the given equation. So if we use the same equation for both, then if the equation is given as (a,b,c) and we compute value1 and value2, then the sign of the expression for the two points is fixed by the equation.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify which side is positive. However, the definition of the road equation is arbitrary. But the condition for opposite sides is symmetric: we don't care about the meaning of positive/negative, we just care if they are the same or not.\n\n However, the above condition (using the given equation) is correct because:\n\n   The line is defined by a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0.\n\n   The two points are on the same side if (a_i*x1+b_i*y1+c_i) and (a_i*x2+b_i*y2+c_i) have the same sign (both positive or both negative).\n\n   They are on opposite sides if one is positive and the other negative.\n\n But note: the product (value1 * value2) < 0 is equivalent to (value1>0 and value2<0) or (value1<0 and value2>0).\n\n However, we must be cautious for integer overflow? The values can be as large as 10^6 for a, b, c and x, y. Then the maximum absolute value is 10^6 * (10^6) * 3 (for the three coefficients) but wait: the equation is a*x+b*y+c, so:\n\n   |a*x| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, and similarly for b*y. Then adding them with c (which is up to 10^6) we get a number that is up to about 2*10^12 in absolute value. This is acceptable in Python integers.\n\n However, note: the problem says the inputs can be negative, so the signs are important.\n\n But there is one more issue: what if the equation is given with a negative leading coefficient? It doesn't matter because we are comparing the relative signs.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the two points are on opposite sides of the road\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n    Home (1,1), University (-1,-1), n=2, roads: [0,1,0] and [1,0,0]\n\n    Road1: [0,1,0] -> equation: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> opposite -> count=1\n\n    Road2: [1,0,0] -> equation: x=0.\n        val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 -> negative -> opposite -> count=2\n\n    Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n    Home (1,1), University (-1,-1), n=3, roads: [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,-3]\n\n    Road1: [1,0,0] -> x=0: \n        val1=1, val2=-1 -> opposite -> count=1\n    Road2: [0,1,0] -> y=0:\n        val1=1, val2=-1 -> opposite -> count=2\n    Road3: [1,1,-3] -> x+y-3=0:\n        val1=1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n        val2=-1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same -> no count.\n\n    Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: the example input was provided as:\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n    But note: the third road is given as [1,1,-3]. \n\n    Our calculation for the third road: \n        val1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1\n        val2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5\n\n    Both negative -> same side.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n But wait, the example output is '2'. So it matches.\n\n However, what if the road equation is defined with a negative sign? \n\n Example: same road as [ -1, -1, 3] (which is the same line as [1,1,-3] multiplied by -1). Then:\n\n        Road3: [-1,-1,3] \n        val1 = -1*1 + (-1)*1 + 3 = -1-1+3 = 1\n        val2 = -1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + 3 = 1+1+3 = 5\n\n        Then both positive -> same side.\n\n    So the condition still holds.\n\n Therefore, the solution is as above.\n\n But wait: what if the line equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? The condition for opposite sides is that the product is negative, and that is invariant under multiplying the equation by a positive constant. But if we multiply by a negative constant, then the signs flip. However, note:\n\n        Original: a*x+b*y+c = 0, and we use (a*x+b*y+c) to determine the side.\n\n        If we use -a*x -b*y -c = 0 (which is the same line), then the signs for the two points become flipped.\n\n        But the condition for opposite sides: \n            Original: (val1>0 and val2<0) OR (val1<0 and val2>0) \n            New: (-val1>0 and -val2<0) OR (-val1<0 and -val2>0) \n                => (val1<0 and val2>0) OR (val1>0 and val2<0) -> same condition.\n\n        Because the condition is symmetric.\n\n    Therefore, it is robust.\n\n However, note: the product condition (val1 * val2 < 0) is the same as the condition above. And that product is independent of the scaling factor (if we multiply the equation by a positive constant, the product remains the same; if by a negative, the product also remains the same because (k*val1)*(k*val2) = k^2 * (val1*val2) and k^2 is positive). \n\n But wait: if we multiply by a negative constant, then the product condition is the same because the product of two negatives is positive and the product of two positives is positive, and the product of one positive and one negative is negative. And then we check for negative product.\n\n Actually, we don't need to use the condition via product, but the explicit condition is clear.\n\n However, there is a caveat: what if the value is zero? But the problem states that the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are nonzero.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read home, university, n\n   count = 0\n   for each road:\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        v1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        v2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (v1 < 0 and v2 > 0) or (v1 > 0 and v2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me run through the example with negative coefficients again:\n\n   Road: [-1, -1, 3] for home (1,1): v1 = -1*1 -1*1 + 3 = 1\n          university (-1,-1): v2 = -1*(-1) -1*(-1) + 3 = 1+1+3=5 -> both positive -> not counted.\n\n   But wait, the original representation was [1,1,-3] which we saw was both negative, so same side. And now with [-1,-1,3] we get both positive -> same side. Correct.\n\n However, note: the product condition is the same: 1*5 = 5 (positive) -> same side.\n\n So we can also write:\n\n        if v1 * v2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n But caution: integer overflow? The values can be as large as 10^12, so the product can be up to 10^24, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n However, the problem says the inputs can be as large as 10^6, and the product of two numbers of magnitude 10^12 is 10^24, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow in terms of representation, but the multiplication may be slow for such large numbers). \n\n But note: the input numbers are integers, and we are only doing n (<=300) multiplications. So it's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the multiplication by using the sign comparison.\n\n Since both methods are equivalent, we can choose the one that is more efficient or clearer. \n\n However, the problem does not require performance beyond n=300, so either way is acceptable.\n\n I'll stick to the explicit condition to avoid any potential confusion (though the product condition is mathematically equivalent).\n\n But wait: what if one of the values is zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so v1 and v2 are nonzero. So the product condition is safe.\n\n However, the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n Therefore, we can write:\n\n        if (v1 * v2) < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n This is simpler.\n\n But let me test with the examples:\n\n Example1: \n        Road1: v1=1, v2=-1 -> product=-1 -> opposite -> count=1\n        Road2: v1=1, v2=-1 -> product=-1 -> opposite -> count=2\n\n Example2: \n        Road1: v1=1, v2=-1 -> opposite\n        Road2: v1=1, v2=-1 -> opposite\n        Road3: v1=-1, v2=-5 -> product=5 -> same.\n\n So the product condition works.\n\n However, note: the product might be very large, but again, we are only doing 300 such multiplications and the numbers are integers, so it's acceptable.\n\n But wait: what if the product overflows in other languages? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow. But if we were in C++, we'd worry. However, the problem doesn't specify the language, but we are writing in Python.\n\n But the problem constraints say the inputs are up to 10^6. The maximum absolute value for v1 and v2 is about 10^12 (since |a*x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, and similarly for b*y1 and c). Then the product can be as large as (10^12)^2 = 10^24, which is a big integer but Python can handle.\n\n However, there is a possibility that the product is negative and we only care about the sign. But we are checking for <0.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0):\n\n This is equivalent and avoids the large product.\n\n Let me do:\n\n        if (v1 < 0) and not (v2 < 0): # then opposite\n        or \n        if (v1 < 0) ^ (v2 < 0): \n\n But wait: the condition for opposite is that one is negative and the other is positive. \n\n        (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0) is the same as (v1 < 0) XOR (v2 < 0)\n\n        But note: if one is negative and the other positive, then (v1<0) is true and (v2<0) is false -> true XOR false is true.\n\n        However, if both are negative: (v1<0) is true and (v2<0) is true -> true XOR true is false.\n\n        If both are positive: (v1<0) is false and (v2<0) is false -> false XOR false is false.\n\n        So yes, (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0) is equivalent.\n\n But wait: what if one of the values is positive and the other negative? Then one is less than 0 and the other is not. \n\n However, we know that the values are not zero, so we can use:\n\n        if (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0):\n\n This condition is equivalent to the product being negative, but without computing the product.\n\n Also, it avoids the large product.\n\n So we can use:\n\n        if (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0):\n\n This is efficient and clear.\n\n Final code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        v1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        v2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the two points are on opposite sides of the road\n        if (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples again.\n\n Example1: \n        Road1: v1=1 (positive) -> v1<0 is False; v2=-1 (negative) -> v2<0 is True -> False != True -> True -> count=1\n        Road2: same -> count=2.\n\n Example2: \n        Road3: v1=-1 -> v1<0 is True; v2=-5 -> v2<0 is True -> True != True -> False -> no count.\n\n Perfect.\n\n However, note: the condition (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0) is true if one is negative and the other is positive. \n\n But note: we are not considering the possibility that the equation might have been defined with a negative sign, but as argued earlier, the condition is independent of the sign of the equation.\n\n Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n Let me submit the code accordingly.\n\n But wait: what if the equation has a negative sign? \n\n Example: Road defined as [-1,0,0] (same as x=0 but with negative sign).

The roads in Crazy Town are infinite line segments that divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). The key observation here is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and the blocks are defined by which side of each road they lie on. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to determining how many roads separate the home and university blocks. Each road that separates the two points (i.e., the points lie on opposite sides of the road) must be crossed exactly once in the minimal path. The minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. This can be done by evaluating the sign of the linear equation (aix + biy + ci) for both points. If the signs differ, the road separates them.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation for both the home and university coordinates. If one value is positive and the other negative, increment the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `n` roads once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 300`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    v1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    v2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (v1 < 0) != (v2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients (a, b, c) are read. The linear equation `ax + by + c` is evaluated for both the home (`x1, y1`) and university (`x2, y2`) coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: The signs of the evaluated expressions for both points are compared. If they differ, the road separates the two points, and the step count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads gives the minimal number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road's contribution to separating the two points, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution.",
