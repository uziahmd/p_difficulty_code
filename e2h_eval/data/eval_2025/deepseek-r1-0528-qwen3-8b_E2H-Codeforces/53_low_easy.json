    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can do an O(n^3) solution by checking each substring and then checking if it appears elsewhere.\n\n However, we can do better by:\n   - Considering all substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is half the string? but note: occurrences can overlap) down to 1.\n   - But note: the substring might be of length L and we need at least two occurrences (they can overlap). The maximum L for which this is possible is floor(n/2) because if we have two non-overlapping occurrences then the substring length must be <= n/2. But wait: the problem says they can overlap. For example, in \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears three times, but we only need two. However, the condition is that the same substring appears at least twice. So the maximum L we need to check is floor(n/1) but actually we can have overlapping so we don't require non-overlapping.\n\n Actually, the substring can appear more than twice and we are only concerned with the maximum length. We can try:\n\n Approach 1: Brute-force by checking every substring and record the frequency of each substring. Then traverse from the largest substring (by length) that has frequency >=2.\n\n But note: the problem says \"longest substring\". So we want the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n However, the total number of substrings is about n*(n+1)//2 which for n=100 is about 5000, which is acceptable.\n\n Steps for brute-force:\n  Let s be the input string.\n  Create a dictionary (or defaultdict) to store the frequency of each substring.\n\n  But note: we don't need to store every substring. We can iterate over all starting indices and lengths, and update the frequency.\n\n  Alternatively, we can generate all substrings and count their frequencies.\n\n  Then, we look for the substring (by length) that has frequency>=2 and take the maximum length.\n\n  However, we can break early: we want the maximum length. So we can iterate from the longest substring to the shortest until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n  But note: the same substring of different starting positions but same content is considered the same.\n\n  How to generate all substrings?\n      for start index i from 0 to n-1:\n          for length L from 1 to n-i:\n              substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n  Then update a dictionary: key = substring, value = count.\n\n  Then, we can:\n      max_len = 0\n      for each substring in the dictionary:\n          if count >= 2 and len(substring) > max_len:\n              max_len = len(substring)\n\n  However, we can also do: \n      Let's iterate by substring length from n down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n  This might be more efficient if we break early.\n\n  But since n is at most 100, we can do either.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a set for each distinct substring and then group by length.\n\n  However, let's do:\n\n      n = len(s)\n      max_length = 0\n      found = False\n      # We'll iterate by length from n//2 to 1? Actually, we don't know, but we can go from max possible length (which is n) down to 1.\n\n      But note: the maximum length substring that can appear twice: \n          If we have a substring of length L, then we need at least two occurrences. The first occurrence starts at i, the second at j, and we require that the substring of length L starting at i equals the substring of length L starting at j, and j must be less than i+L (overlapping is allowed). \n\n      The maximum L we can get is floor(n/1) but actually, we can have two occurrences that are the same substring and the entire string? Only if the string is periodic. But the problem doesn't require the two occurrences to be contiguous. However, the two occurrences must be contiguous substrings.\n\n      Example: \"abcabc\" -> the substring \"abc\" appears twice, and its length is 3, which is half the string.\n\n      Actually, the maximum L for which two occurrences exist is when the two occurrences are as close as possible: they can start at indices i and j, and we require i < j and j-i >= L? Actually, no: they can overlap. The minimal requirement is that the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings and check their frequencies efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) that appears more than once in the input string. The key observation here is that overlapping occurrences are allowed, which simplifies the problem compared to non-overlapping cases.\n2. **Intuition**: By generating all possible substrings and counting their occurrences, we can determine the longest substring that meets the frequency requirement. Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, a brute-force approach is feasible.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each substring encountered. For each starting index in the string, we expand the substring length incrementally and update the frequency count in the dictionary. After processing all substrings, we look for the substring with the highest length that has a frequency of at least 2.\n4. **Optimization**: The solution efficiently checks all possible substrings by iterating through each character and extending the substring length. The dictionary allows quick updates and lookups, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    max_len = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n            substr = s[i:j]\n            freq[substr] += 1\n            if freq[substr] == 2:\n                L = len(substr)\n                if L > max_len:\n                    max_len = L\n                    \n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input string is read, and its length is determined. A dictionary `freq` is initialized to store the frequency of each substring encountered.\n2. **Substring Generation**: Using nested loops, the outer loop iterates over each starting index `i`, and the inner loop extends the substring from `i` to each possible ending index `j`. Each generated substring is added to the dictionary, and its frequency is incremented.\n3. **Tracking Maximum Length**: Whenever a substring's frequency reaches 2, its length is compared to the current maximum length (`max_len`). If it is longer, `max_len` is updated.\n4. **Output**: After processing all substrings, the maximum length found (or 0 if no duplicate substring exists) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible substrings and leverages dictionary operations for quick frequency updates, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
