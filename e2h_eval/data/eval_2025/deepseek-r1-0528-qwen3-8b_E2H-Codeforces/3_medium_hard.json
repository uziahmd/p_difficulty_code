Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street [0, l] is lit.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider that the street has two ends: from 0 to l.\n\n Approach:\n We can think of the problem as covering the entire interval [0, l] with intervals (each lantern provides an interval [a_i - d, a_i + d]).\n However, we want the minimal d.\n\n Another way is to note that the entire street must be covered. The gaps in coverage will be at the beginning, middle, or end.\n\n Let's break it down:\n\n - The leftmost point is 0. The first lantern should cover from 0 to (first lantern position + d). \n   To cover 0, the first lantern must have d at least the distance from the first lantern to 0 (if the first lantern is not at 0).\n\n - Similarly, the rightmost point is l. The last lantern must extend at least to l.\n\n - In between, we need to cover the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n Specifically, we can consider:\n\n 1. The gap from 0 to the first lantern: if the first lantern is at position a0, then we require d >= a0 (to cover from 0 to a0).\n    But note: if d is chosen so that the first lantern covers from a0-d to a0+d, then to cover 0 we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0.\n\n 2. The gap between two consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (x < y), the gap between them is from x+d to y-d.\n    To cover the entire street, we need to ensure that the intervals from each lantern overlap appropriately. The condition for covering the gap between x and y is:\n        x + d >= y - d   =>   2*d >= y - x\n    So the required d for this gap is at least (y - x)/2.\n\n 3. The gap from the last lantern to l: if the last lantern is at position a_{n-1}, then we require d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\n Therefore, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n   a. The distance from the first lantern to 0 (i.e., the first element in sorted list) because d must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0 (so that 0 is covered).\n   b. The distance from the last lantern to l (i.e., l minus the last element).\n   c. For each consecutive pair (x, y): half the gap between them (i.e., (y-x)/2) because the two lanterns must meet in the middle.\n\n However, note that if two lanterns are at the same location, then (y-x)=0, so no problem.\n\n But wait: consider the entire segment [0, l] must be covered.\n\n Let's formalize:\n\n   d_min = max( \n        a[0],   # because the left end: we need to cover from 0 to a[0]. The lantern at a[0] must extend left by a[0] (if d < a[0], then 0 is not covered)\n        l - a[-1], # similarly, the right end\n        max( (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2.0 for i in range(1, n) )   # but wait, actually for consecutive lanterns, the gap between a[i-1] and a[i] is (a[i] - a[i-1]). The required d to cover the gap is (a[i] - a[i-1])/2, because the first lantern covers up to a[i-1]+d and the next from a[i]-d. We require a[i-1]+d >= a[i]-d -> d >= (a[i]-a[i-1])/2.\n   )\n\n However, note: the above condition for consecutive lanterns is necessary only if the gap is positive. But we can use the formula.\n\n But wait, let me test with the example: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n   n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n\n   First lantern: d must be at least 2 (to cover from 0 to 2? Actually, the first lantern is at 2, so to cover 0, we need d>=2. Similarly, the last lantern at 5: d must be at least 0 (because 5-d<=5 and we need to cover up to 5, so d>=0). Then the gap between 2 and 5: (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n\n   Then d_min = max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> correct.\n\n Another example: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n   First, sort the lanterns: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n   a[0] = 0 -> so d must be at least 0 (for the left end).\n   l - a[-1] = 15 - 15 = 0.\n\n   Now, consecutive gaps:\n     3-0 = 3 -> requires d>=1.5\n     5-3 = 2 -> requires d>=1.0\n     7-5 = 2 -> requires d>=1.0\n     9-7 = 2 -> requires d>=1.0\n     14-9 = 5 -> requires d>=2.5\n     15-14 = 1 -> requires d>=0.5\n\n   Then d_min = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> which matches the sample.\n\n However, wait: why do we take the maximum of all these? \n\n Explanation:\n\n   The entire street must be covered. The leftmost part requires that the first lantern extends at least to 0, so d must be at least the first lantern's distance from 0.\n\n   Similarly, the rightmost part requires that the last lantern extends at least to l.\n\n   In the middle, we require that the gap between two consecutive lanterns is covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The condition is that the right edge of the left lantern (a[i-1] + d) must meet or exceed the left edge of the right lantern (a[i] - d). This gives d >= (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.\n\n   But note: the entire street might have multiple gaps. The minimal d must be large enough to cover the worst-case gap (the largest requirement from any one of these conditions).\n\n Therefore, the answer is the maximum of:\n   - The left gap: a[0] (if the first lantern is at a[0], then d must be at least a[0] to reach 0)\n   - The right gap: l - a[-1]\n   - The mid gaps: (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2 for every consecutive pair\n\n However, note: what if there are no lanterns? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Steps in code:\n\n  1. Read the first line to get n and l.\n  2. Read the next line to get the list of n integers.\n  3. Sort the list.\n  4. Initialize d_min to 0.0.\n\n  5. Check the left end: d_min = max(d_min, a[0])\n  6. Check the right end: d_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\n  7. For i from 1 to n-1:\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        d_min = max(d_min, required_d)\n\n  8. Print d_min with formatting to have absolute or relative error <= 1e-9.\n\n However, wait: is that really correct?\n\n Let me test with a simple example: one lantern at position 0, street length 10.\n\n   Then n=1, l=10, a=[0]\n\n   Left gap: 0 -> d_min becomes 0\n   Right gap: 10 - 0 = 10 -> d_min becomes 10\n   No consecutive pairs.\n\n   So answer is 10. That is correct: the lantern must cover from 0 to 10, so d=10.\n\n Another example: two lanterns, both at 0, street length 10.\n\n   Left gap: 0\n   Right gap: 10 - 0 = 10\n   Consecutive gaps: none (since n=2, but the two lanterns are at the same point? Actually, we have two points, but they are the same. Then we have two lanterns at 0, so the consecutive gap calculation: a[1]-a[0]=0, so required_d=0.\n\n   Then d_min = max(0, 10, 0) = 10.\n\n   But wait, if we have two lanterns at 0, then the coverage is from -d to d (but we only care from 0 to l). The lanterns are at 0, so they cover [-d, d] and [ -d, d] again. The left end is 0, so we need to cover from 0 to 10. The right end is 10, so we need d>=10.\n\n   Correct.\n\n Another example: three lanterns at positions [0, 5, 10] for street length 10.\n\n   Left gap: 0 -> d_min=0\n   Right gap: 10-10=0\n   Consecutive gaps:\n        gap1 = 5-0 =5 -> required_d=2.5\n        gap2 =10-5=5 -> required_d=2.5\n\n   Then d_min=2.5.\n\n   Check: \n        First lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so covers 0 to 2.5.\n        Second lantern at 5: covers [2.5, 7.5] (because 5-2.5=2.5, 5+2.5=7.5)\n        Third lantern at 10: covers [7.5, 12.5] -> so covers from 7.5 to 10.\n\n   The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But note: the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, so the two lanterns must meet at the midpoint (2.5). Similarly, the gap between 5 and 10 is 5, so they must meet at 7.5.\n\n   However, the entire street from 0 to 10 is covered by d=2.5.\n\n   This matches.\n\n But wait: what if we have lanterns that are not covering the entire gap? For example, if we have two lanterns at positions [0, 10] and the street is length 10.\n\n   Then left gap: 0, right gap:0, consecutive gap: (10-0)/2=5.\n\n   Then d_min=5.\n\n   Check: \n        First lantern: [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] -> covers from 0 to 5.\n        Second lantern: [10-5,10+5] = [5,15] -> covers from 5 to 10.\n\n   So the entire street is covered.\n\n   However, what if the street is longer than the last lantern? Example: [0,10] and l=15.\n\n   Then left gap:0, right gap:15-10=5, consecutive gap:5 (from the two lanterns).\n\n   Then d_min = max(0,5,5)=5.\n\n   Check: \n        The first lantern: [-5,5] -> covers 0 to 5.\n        The second lantern: [5,15] -> covers from 5 to 15 (since 10+5=15). \n        So the entire street [0,15] is covered.\n\n   But wait, the street length is 15, so the right end is 15. The second lantern covers up to 15, so that's good.\n\n However, what if the lanterns are not placed at the ends? Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at [2,8].\n\n   Left gap: 2 (so d must be at least 2 to cover 0).\n   Right gap: 10-8=2 (so d must be at least 2 to cover 10).\n   Consecutive gap: (8-2)/2 = 3.\n\n   Then d_min = max(2,2,3)=3.\n\n   Check: \n        First lantern at 2: [2-3,2+3] = [-1,5] -> covers from 0 to 5 (since we start at 0, we cover [0,5]).\n        Second lantern at 8: [8-3,8+3]=[5,11] -> covers from 5 to 10 (since the street ends at 10, we only need to 10, but 11 is beyond, so [5,10] is covered).\n\n   So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        d_min = 0.0\n\n        # If there's only one lantern, then we have to cover both ends: from 0 to l, so the lantern must cover from 0 to l.\n        # But our method: left gap is a[0] (which is the lantern's position), and right gap is l - a[0].\n        # Then d_min = max(a[0], l - a[0])\n\n        # However, if there are multiple lanterns, we do the above.\n\n        # Step 1: left end\n        d_min = max(d_min, a[0])\n\n        # Step 2: right end\n        d_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\n        # Step 3: gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2, because the two lanterns must meet in the middle.\n            required_d = gap / 2.0\n            if required_d > d_min:\n                d_min = required_d\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n\n However, wait: is the above sufficient? \n\n What if the lanterns are not contiguous? For example, three lanterns: [0, 5, 10] for street length 10, we got 2.5.\n\n But what if we have a gap that is very large, but the lanterns are not consecutive? Actually, the consecutive gaps are taken care of because we iterate over consecutive pairs.\n\n But note: the entire street must be covered. The consecutive gaps are the critical ones because if two lanterns are separated by a gap g, then we require d >= g/2. However, the left and right gaps are also critical.\n\n This algorithm considers:\n\n   - The left end: from 0 to the first lantern.\n   - The right end: from the last lantern to l.\n   - The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n Since the street is continuous, if we cover the gaps between lanterns (by ensuring that the lanterns' light overlaps) and the ends, then the entire street is covered.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n However, note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the same point. Our consecutive gap calculation for two identical points: gap=0, then required_d=0, which doesn't affect the maximum.\n\n Let me test with two lanterns at the same point: [0,0] for street length 10.\n\n   Left gap: 0\n   Right gap: 10\n   Consecutive gap: 0\n\n   Then d_min = 10 -> correct.\n\n But wait, what if the street is from 0 to 10, and we have two lanterns at 0 and 10? \n\n   Then left gap:0, right gap:0, consecutive gap: (10-0)/2=5.\n\n   Then d_min=5 -> correct.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   d_min = 0.0\n\n   # Check the left end\n   d_min = max(d_min, a[0])\n\n   # Check the right end\n   d_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\n   # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n   for i in range(1, len(a)):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > d_min:\n            d_min = required_d\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n\n But wait, the above code does not consider the possibility that the entire street might be covered by a lantern that is not the first or last? Actually, we are considering the entire street from 0 to l by looking at the leftmost and rightmost lanterns and the gaps between them.\n\n However, note: the gaps between consecutive lanterns are the only gaps that might leave unlit segments if d is too small. And the ends are the two boundaries.\n\n But consider: what if we have more than two lanterns? The gaps are consecutive, and the entire set of lanterns is sorted, so the gaps we check are the gaps between the consecutive lanterns.\n\n Example: [0, 2, 4] for street length 5.\n\n   Left gap: 0\n   Right gap: 5-4=1\n   Gaps between: \n        2-0=2 -> required_d=1.0\n        4-2=2 -> required_d=1.0\n\n   Then d_min = max(0,1,1.0,1.0)=1.0\n\n   Check: \n        Lantern at 0: [-1,1] -> covers [0,1] (since we start at 0)\n        Lantern at 2: [1,3] -> covers [1,3] (from 2-1=1 to 2+1=3)\n        Lantern at 4: [3,5] -> covers [3,5] (from 4-1=3 to 4+1=5)\n\n   The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   However, note that the entire street is [0,5] and we have a gap from 0 to 2: the first lantern covers up to 1, then the second lantern starts at 2 and goes to 3, so there's a gap from 1 to 2? \n\n   But wait, the first lantern covers up to 1 (at d=1) and the second lantern starts at 2. Then the point 1.5 is not covered? \n\n   Let me recalc: \n        The first lantern at 0 with d=1: covers [-1,1] -> so 1 is included.\n        The second lantern at 2 with d=1: covers [1,3] -> so 1 is included (because 2-1=1) and 3 is the upper bound.\n\n   So the point 1.5 is covered by the second lantern? Actually, the second lantern covers from 1 to 3, so yes, 1.5 is in [1,3].\n\n   But wait, the gap between the first and second lantern is 2 (from 0 to 2). The condition for the gap was that the two lanterns must meet: the first lantern covers up to 0+d and the second lantern covers from 2-d. We require 0+d >= 2-d -> 2d>=2 -> d>=1. So d=1 is the minimum.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the condition for the consecutive gaps is that the entire segment between two lanterns must be covered. The condition is that the left lantern's right end (a[i-1]+d) must be at least the right lantern's left end (a[i]-d). This ensures that there is no gap between the two intervals.\n\n But note: the entire street might have a gap that is covered by more than two lanterns? Actually, the gaps between consecutive lanterns are the only ones that matter because the street is continuous and the lanterns are sorted. The coverage of non-consecutive lanterns is automatically ensured by the consecutive ones.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n Let me run the provided examples:\n\n Example 1: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n   Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n   Left: 0\n   Right: 15-15=0\n   Consecutive gaps: \n        3-0=3 -> 1.5\n        5-3=2 -> 1.0\n        7-5=2 -> 1.0\n        9-7=2 -> 1.0\n        14-9=5 -> 2.5\n        15-14=1 -> 0.5\n   Then d_min = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> output \"2.5000000000\"\n\n Example 2: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   Sorted: [2,5]\n   Left: 2\n   Right: 5-5=0\n   Consecutive gaps: 5-2=3 -> 1.5\n   Then d_min = max(2,0,1.5) = 2.0 -> output \"2.0000000000\"\n\n But wait, the example input format is given as two separate lines. The sample input is:\n\n   ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n So we read from stdin.\n\n Code implementation:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n However, note: the input may have multiple numbers per line. We assume the first line has two integers, the second line has n integers.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says the first line contains two integers n, l, and the next line contains n integers.\n\n However, there is a possibility that the input has more than one line for the lanterns? The problem says: \"The next line contains n integers\", so we assume one line.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   d_min = 0.0\n\n   # If there are no lanterns, then n==0, but the problem says n>=1, so we skip handling n==0.\n\n   # Left end\n   d_min = max(d_min, a[0])\n\n   # Right end\n   d_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\n   # Consecutive gaps\n   for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > d_min:\n            d_min = required_d\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"7 15\" and then \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n   Output: 2.5000000000\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"2 5\" and then \"2 5\"\n   Output: 2.0000000000\n\n However, wait: in the second example, the consecutive gap is (5-2)=3 -> 3/2=1.5, but the left gap is 2 which is greater than 1.5, so we use 2.\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait, let me test the example with two lanterns at the same point: [5,5] for l=10.\n\n   n=2, l=10, a=[5,5]\n   Left: 5\n   Right: 10-5=5\n   Consecutive gap: 0 -> 0\n   Then d_min=5.\n\n   Check: \n        The two lanterns at 5: they cover [0,10] if d>=5 (because 5-d<=0 and 5+d>=10 -> d>=5 and d>=5). So correct.\n\n One more edge: when the street is exactly covered by the lanterns, meaning the first lantern is at 0 and the last at l.\n\n   Then left gap=0, right gap=0, and consecutive gaps are ... whatever.\n\n   Example: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10]\n   d_min = max(0, 10-10=0, (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5) -> 2.5.\n\n   Correct.\n\n But wait, what if the street is [0,10] and we have lanterns at [0, 10] (n=2) -> then consecutive gap is (10-0)/2=5, and left gap=0, right gap=0 -> d_min=5.\n\n   Check: \n        First lantern: [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] -> covers [0,5]\n        Second lantern: [10-5,10+5] = [5,15] -> covers [5,10]\n        So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code should be:\n\n   Read n, l\n   Read list a of n integers\n   Sort a\n\n   d_min = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\n   Then for i from 1 to n-1:\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        candidate = gap / 2.0\n        if candidate > d_min:\n            d_min = candidate\n\n   Then print d_min with 10 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the initial value of d_min is set to 0, but then we update with the left and right gaps. Alternatively, we can set d_min = 0.0 and then update, but we can also set it to the maximum of the two ends and then the gaps.\n\n But the above code does that.\n\n Let me write the code now.\n\n Important: The problem constraints say that the numbers can be as large as 10^9, and n up to 1000, so using floating point division is safe.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   d_min = 0.0\n\n   # Check left end\n   if n > 0:\n        d_min = a[0]  # because we are going to compare with the right end and gaps, but we can set initially to the max of the two ends and then gaps.\n\n   # Actually, we can do:\n\n   # d_min = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n   # then iterate for gaps.\n\n   # But let's stick to the current structure.\n\n   # Update for left end\n   d_min = max(d_min, a[0])\n\n   # Update for right end\n   d_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\n   # Update for consecutive gaps\n   for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > d_min:\n            d_min = required_d\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n\n But note: if n==0, then we cannot access a[0] or a[-1]. The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to handle n==0.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   d_min = 0.0\n\n   # Since n>=1, we can safely index\n   d_min = max(d_min, a[0])\n   d_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\n   for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > d_min:\n            d_min = required_d\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` that ensures the entire street from 0 to `l` is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from 0 to `l`. Each lantern at position `a_i` covers the interval `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. The entire street must be covered by the union of these intervals. The challenge is to find the smallest `d` such that there are no gaps between these intervals.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the point 0. Thus, `d` must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the point `l`. Thus, `d` must be at least the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined coverage. Specifically, the right edge of the left lantern's coverage must meet or exceed the left edge of the right lantern's coverage. This requires `d` to be at least half the distance between consecutive lanterns.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the lantern positions to easily check the leftmost and rightmost positions and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - **Determine Minimum `d`**: Compute the required `d` for the left end, right end, and each consecutive gap. The maximum of these values will be the minimal `d` needed to cover the entire street.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent steps involve linear scans (O(n)) to compute the required `d` values. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nd_min = 0.0\n\nd_min = max(d_min, a[0])\nd_min = max(d_min, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    required_d = gap / 2.0\n    if required_d > d_min:\n        d_min = required_d\n\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`. The second line reads the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate checking the leftmost and rightmost positions and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial `d` Calculation**: The initial value of `d` is set to the maximum of the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0) and the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n4. **Checking Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required `d` to cover the gap between them is half the distance between them. The maximum of these values and the initial `d` gives the minimal `d` needed.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the entire street is covered by the minimal light radius by systematically addressing the coverage requirements at the street ends and between consecutive lanterns.",
