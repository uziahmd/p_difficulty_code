Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the key observation here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. Moreover, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent (and can be moved in one step) if they share a nonzero boundary segment. This is equivalent to crossing exactly one road.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to physically cross the roads arbitrarily; we are allowed to move arbitrarily within a block. The catch is: to go from one block to a non-adjacent block, we might have to cross multiple roads, but the minimal steps is the number of roads we must cross.\n\n But note: the example input and output:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0\n      1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      3\n      1 0 0\n      0 1 0\n      1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2\n\n How do we interpret this?\n\n Observation: Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university lie in some half-planes for each road.\n\n The problem of moving from home to university: we can think of it as needing to change the side (crossing a road) for some set of roads. However, note that the movement is defined by steps that cross one road at a time (i.e., moving to an adjacent block).\n\n Actually, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home from the university. But wait: how many roads separate them?\n\n However, note that the roads are infinite lines. We can define for each road whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n\n For a given road: aix + biy + ci = 0.\n   Let f(x,y) = aix + biy + ci.\n Then, if f(home) and f(university) have the same sign (or both zero, but zeros are not allowed since neither home nor university lies on the road), then the home and university are on the same side of the road.\n\n If they are on opposite sides, then the road separates them. And to get from home to university, we must cross that road.\n\n But note: we can cross multiple roads? Actually, we can only cross one road per step. However, we can cross the roads in any order? But the problem is asking for the minimum number of steps (which is the minimum number of road crossings). Since we can cross one road per step, and we need to cross every separating road at least once, then the answer is the number of roads that separate home from university.\n\n However, wait: what if we cross a non-separating road? Then we don't necessarily have to. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate home and university.\n\n But consider: when you cross a separating road, you change from one side to the other. However, the problem does not require to cross roads in any particular order. And once you cross a separating road, you are no longer separated by that road. So the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n Why then the example outputs are 2?\n\n Example 1:\n   Home: (1,1)\n   University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0. \n        f(1,1)=1, f(-1,-1)=-1 -> opposite signs -> separating.\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 =0 -> x=0.\n        f(1,1)=1, f(-1,-1)=-1 -> opposite signs -> separating.\n\n   So two separating roads -> answer 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Home: (1,1)\n   University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 =0 -> x=0. Separating.\n   Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 =0 -> y=0. Separating.\n   Road3: 1*x + 1*y -3 =0 -> x+y=3.\n        f(1,1)=1+1-3=-1\n        f(-1,-1)=-1-1-3=-5 -> same sign (both negative) -> not separating.\n\n   So two separating roads -> answer 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n   Step 2: Read n, then n lines of [a, b, c] for the road equation ax+by+c=0.\n\n   For each road i:\n        value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town. The key observation here is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and the home and university blocks lie on certain sides of these roads. The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads separate the home and university blocks. Each road is an infinite line defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The home and university are not on any road, so they lie strictly in one of the two half-planes created by each road.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, if the home and university lie on opposite sides (i.e., the evaluation of the line equation at the home and university coordinates have opposite signs), then this road separates them. The minimal number of steps required to reach the university is equal to the number of such separating roads.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves checking each road's line equation with the coordinates of the home and university. If the results have opposite signs, the road is counted as a separator. The total count of such separators is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing a constant amount of work per road. With \\(n\\) roads (up to 300), the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, starting with the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\) is evaluated at the home and university coordinates. The sign of the result determines which side of the road each point lies.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: If the evaluations for the home and university have opposite signs, the road is counted as a separator. The total count of such roads gives the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university from home.\n4. **Output Result**: The result, which is the count of separating roads, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with a linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
