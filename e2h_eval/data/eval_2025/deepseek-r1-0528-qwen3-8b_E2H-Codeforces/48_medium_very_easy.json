He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b.\n The second line is a string representing a number in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the given number (which is in base a) to an integer (base 10) first, then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    However, note: the input number is given in base a. We must first convert it to base 10 (or decimal) and then if b is R, we convert from base 10 to Roman.\n\n 2. But wait: the problem says the second part is either an integer b or the letter 'R'. So we have two cases.\n\n Approach:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (so we can convert a and b to integers)\n   - Convert the given string (which is in base a) to a base-10 integer.\n   - Then convert that base-10 integer to base b (with digits above 9 represented by letters starting from 'A' for 10).\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n   - Convert the given string (base a) to base 10.\n   - Then convert the base-10 number (which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 300010) to a Roman numeral string.\n\n However, note: the problem says the input number c is non-negative, and in the case of Roman numerals, the number is at least 1 and at most 300010.\n\n Steps for conversion from base a to base 10:\n   Let s = the string of the number in base a.\n   We know that the base a can be from 2 to 25. The digits in base a might include digits beyond '9' (if a>10) but note the input length doesn't exceed 1000? Actually, the problem says \"its length doesn't exceed 10^3\", meaning up to 1000 characters.\n\n But note: the input number c is non-negative and may contain leading zeros.\n\n Steps for base a to base 10:\n   value = 0\n   For each character in the string (from left to right, but note: the leftmost is the most significant? Actually, the usual way is from left to right as the highest power, so we do:\n      value = value * a + digit_value(char)\n\n However, note: the problem says the number is written in base a. The representation is standard: the first digit is the most significant.\n\n But wait: what if the base a is greater than 10? Then the digits are from '0' to the digit representing a-1. And when a>10, we use letters? Actually, the problem states: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n So, for base a (a from 2 to 25), the digits are:\n   Digits: 0 to 9, then A to Z (for values 10 to a-1). But note: the input string may use letters only if the base is greater than 10.\n\n How to map a character to a digit?\n   If the character is between '0' and '9', then digit = int(char)\n   Else, if the character is between 'A' and ... then digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\n However, note: the input string might have been given with letters in uppercase (since the example uses uppercase). Also, the problem says the number is given in base a and may have leading zeros.\n\n But note: the input string is provided as a string. We must handle both digits and letters.\n\n Steps for converting base a string to base 10:\n\n   n = 0\n   for char in s:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        elif 'A' <= char <= chr(ord('A') + a - 10 - 1): \n            # But wait: if a <= 10, then no letter. If a > 10, then we use letters from 'A' to the (a-10)-th letter, but note: we only go up to 25 base, so maximum digit is 24 (base 25) -> which is 'Y' (since A=10, B=11, ..., Y=24).\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n        if char in '0123456789':\n            d = int(char)\n        else:\n            d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\n   Then, n = n * a + d\n\n But note: the input might have leading zeros. This method works because the leading zeros don't change the value.\n\n However, what if the entire number is zero? The problem says for Roman numerals the number is at least 1, but in the general case, we must consider non-negative integers.\n\n But note: the problem says \"non-negative integer\", and the example includes '1'. Also, the condition for Roman numerals says the number is not 0 and at most 300010.\n\n However, in the other case, the number can be 0? The problem says \"non-negative\", so 0 is allowed. But the output should omit leading zeros, so if the base 10 value is 0, then we output 0? But wait, the problem says: \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\"\n\n However, note: if the base is R, then the input number is at least 1, so we don't have to worry about 0 in that case.\n\n But what about the general case? The input says \"non-negative\", so 0 is possible. However, the example does not show 0.\n\n According to the problem: the input number c is non-negative and its length doesn't exceed 1000. Also, for Roman numerals, it's guaranteed to be at least 1.\n\n So, if the base is not R, then we must consider that the input could be 0.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2\\n0\" -> output \"0\" in base 2? But base 2: 0 is \"0\". However, the problem says \"omit leading zeros\", so \"0\" is acceptable.\n\n However, note: if the base is 10 and the number is 0, then output \"0\".\n\n Steps for converting base 10 number to base b (when b is an integer and >=2 and <=25):\n\n   We convert the base10 number (let's call it n) to base b.\n\n   Special case: if n == 0, then output \"0\"\n\n   Otherwise, we do:\n        digits = []\n        while n:\n            r = n % b\n            digits.append(r)\n            n //= b\n\n        Then reverse the digits and map each digit to a character.\n\n   Mapping: \n        if digit < 10: then use str(digit)\n        else: use chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n\n   But note: the base b can be up to 25, so the digits can be up to 24, which is within the range of letters (since 10+14=24, and 'A' is 10 -> then 24 corresponds to the 15th letter after 'A'? Actually, 'A'=10, so 10->'A', 11->'B', ... 24->'O'? Let's check: \n        'A' is 0-indexed as 0, then 10 + 0 = 10 -> 'A'\n        10 + 1 = 11 -> 'B'\n        ...\n        10 + 14 = 24 -> the 15th letter is 'O'? Actually, from 'A' to 'O' is 15 letters? \n        A(0) to O(14) is 15 letters, but we want 10 to 24: that's 15 distinct numbers.\n\n   Since our base b is at most 25, the maximum digit is 24, which is 'O' (because 10+14=24, and 14th letter from 'A' is 'O').\n\n Steps for converting base10 to Roman:\n\n   We are guaranteed that the number is between 1 and 300010.\n\n   We can define the Roman numeral mapping for thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n   However, note: the standard Roman numerals use subtractive notation for 4 and 9. Also, there are special cases for 40, 90, etc.\n\n   We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n   Let n = base10 number (integer)\n\n   Steps for Roman conversion (for numbers up to 300010, which is 300 thousand and 10):\n\n   We can do:\n\n   roman_map = {\n        1000: 'M',\n        900: 'CM',\n        500: 'D',\n        400: 'CD',\n        100: 'C',\n        90: 'XC',\n        50: 'L',\n        40: 'XL',\n        10: 'X',\n        9: 'IX',\n        5: 'V',\n        4: 'IV',\n        1: 'I'\n   }\n\n   But wait, the example: 5 -> 'V', 4 -> 'IV'\n\n   However, note: the problem says the number is at least 1 and at most 300010.\n\n   We can write a function:\n\n   def to_roman(n):\n        roman_map = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = ''\n        for value, symbol in roman_map:\n            count = n // value\n            res += count * symbol\n            n -= value * count\n        return res\n\n   But note: 300010 is 300000 + 10. 300000 is not directly in our map. We have to represent 300000 as 'C' repeated three times? Actually, 300000 is 3 * 100000, but we don't have 100000 in our map.\n\n   However, the standard Roman numerals don't have a standard symbol for millions or higher. But note the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break it down:\n\n   Actually, 300000 is 3 * 100000, but 100000 is not defined. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300010, so we can use the same method for 300000.\n\n   But wait, how did they represent 300000? In Roman numerals, 300000 would be MMM followed by C (but actually, 300000 is MMMC? No, actually 100000 is not a standard Roman numeral. \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"it won't be 0\" and \"at most 300010\", so the maximum is 300010. \n\n   But the problem statement also says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" for the base conversion part, but for Roman, we use the standard system.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n   So we don't have to handle numbers above 300010 in Roman. But 300010 is 300000 + 10. \n\n   How to represent 300000? \n\n   According to the standard, we break the number into thousands, hundreds, etc. But 300000 is 300 thousands? Actually, 300000 is 300 * 1000.\n\n   However, the standard Roman numerals use 'C' for 100,000? Actually, no. The standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 100,000. But the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300,010.\n\n   There are extended Roman numerals for large numbers, but the problem doesn't specify. However, note that 300010 is 300,010, which is 3 hundred thousands and 10.\n\n   Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we can use the following:\n\n   Break the number into parts: we can use the fact that the largest unit we have is 1000, then 900, etc.\n\n   But 300000 is 3 * 100000, and we don't have 100000. However, note: 300000 can be represented as 300 * 1000, but that is not standard.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the additive principle: 300000 = 3 * 100000, but since we don't have 100000, we cannot use that.\n\n   Wait, let me check: the problem says the number is at most 300010. 300010 is 300000 + 10. How is 300000 represented?\n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify the representation for numbers beyond 3999. But the example input '5 R' gives 'V', and '4' gives 'IV'. So the example is small.\n\n   However, 300010 is 300000 + 10. In standard Roman numerals, numbers above 3999 are sometimes represented by a bar over the top of the numeral (multiplying by 1000) but that is not standard in this problem.\n\n   But note: the guarantee is that the number is at most 300010. So we must represent 300010.\n\n   After checking: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so the maximum is 300010.\n\n   How to represent 300010?\n\n   Let's break it down:\n\n   300010 = 300000 + 10.\n\n   How to represent 300000? We don't have a symbol for 100000. However, note that the problem does not require the standard representation for numbers above 3999, but the example only goes to 5.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for 4000 and above? But 300010 is 300000 + 10, which is 300010.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but that was for the base conversion, not for Roman.\n\n   Since the problem constraints are up to 300010, we must handle that.\n\n   However, looking at the example: the input '16 R\\n5' -> 'V', and '5 R\\n4' -> 'IV'. There is no example for larger numbers.\n\n   I found that some historical sources use an apostrophe or a bar to denote thousands, but the problem does not specify.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base\", and the example uses the standard subtractive notation.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem: it says \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n   This implies that the standard subtractive rules are used, but the problem does not specify how to represent numbers beyond 3999.\n\n   However, the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n   So we must represent numbers from 1 to 300010.\n\n   We can use the following approach for Roman numerals:\n\n   We break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones, but we need to represent the thousands part.\n\n   Standard extended Roman numeral uses a bar to mean multiplication by 1000. But the problem doesn't mention that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break the number as:\n\n   Let n = 300010.\n\n   We can break it into:\n     300010 = 3 * 100000 + 10, but we don't have 100000.\n\n   However, note: 100000 is not defined, but 1000 is defined. So we can use:\n\n   300000 = 3 * 1000 * 100, but that's not the way.\n\n   Another idea: use the standard method for numbers below 4000, and then for the thousands part, use the same symbols with a bar (but the problem doesn't say that).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the additive method without bars, but that would be very long.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the Roman empire\", and the Roman numeral system was originally for numbers up to about 4000. However, the problem extends to 300010.\n\n   After research, there are systems that use parentheses or bars, but the problem does not specify.\n\n   Let me think: the problem says the number is at most 300010. 300010 is 300 thousand and ten.\n\n   We can break the number into:\n\n   - The thousands part: 300 thousand -> 300 * 1000.\n\n   How to represent 300 thousand? In standard, we would use C (hundred) and M (thousand) but we need to represent 300 thousands.\n\n   Actually, we can break the number as:\n\n   Let n = 300010.\n\n   Step 1: Extract the thousands part (i.e., the number divided by 1000, then we have 300, and remainder 10).\n\n   Then, represent 300 in Roman? But 300 is 'C' repeated three times? Actually, 300 is 'CCC'.\n\n   Then, we put a bar over the 'CCC' to mean 300 * 1000? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the standard representation for numbers beyond 3999, and the example only goes up to 5.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might expect the representation without bars, just repeating the symbols. But repeating the 'M' 300 times for 300000 is not practical.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b.\" and the example inputs are small.\n\n   And the note: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", but wait, the input says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that seems like a typo. Actually, the problem says:\n\n   \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\"\n\n   But wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me read the original problem statement:\n\n   \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\"\n\n   Actually, I think there was a formatting issue. The intended meaning is:\n\n   - When b is R, the number (in base 10) is between 1 and 300010.\n   - In other cases (b is an integer), the number (in base 10) is at most 10^15^10? That is 10^(15*10)=10^150, which is huge.\n\n   But wait, the example inputs are small. The problem says the input string's length is at most 1000, and the base a is from 2 to 25.\n\n   However, the base10 number in the non-Roman case can be very big (up to 10^150). We cannot convert such a big number to base b by standard methods (like using modulus and division) because the number is too big.\n\n   Therefore, we must use a different approach for the non-Roman case.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", but wait, that is a very big number. However, the input string has at most 1000 digits. We can use an algorithm that converts the base a string to base b without converting to base10?\n\n   But note: the base a is from 2 to 25, and base b is from 2 to 25 (if integer). The number can be huge (up to 10^150) so we cannot convert to base10 (as an integer) because that number is too big for Python integers? Actually, Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but the problem says \"non-negative integer\" and the length of the string is up to 1000, so the base10 number has at most 1000 digits in base a, which is a number with about 1000 * log10(a) digits? \n\n   However, the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning 10^(15*10) = 10^150. But 10^150 is a 1 followed by 150 zeros. The base a string of length 1000 and base a (minimum base 2) can represent numbers up to a^1000, which for a=2 is 2^1000 (about 10^300) and for a=25 is 25^1000, which is astronomically larger than 10^150.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", so we are guaranteed that the base10 value is <= 10^150.\n\n   So, we can convert the base a string to base10? The base10 number has at most 1000 digits in base a, and base a is at most 25, so the base10 number has at most 1000 * log10(25) ~ 1000 * 1.4 = 1400 decimal digits. That is manageable.\n\n   However, the problem says the base10 number in the non-Roman case is at most 10^150, which has 151 digits. But 1000 digits in base25 can be as big as 25^1000, which is way bigger than 10^150.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning the base10 number is at most 10^150. So we can safely convert the base a string to base10 (using arbitrary precision integers) because the base10 representation will have at most 151 digits, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the input string has at most 1000 digits. The base10 number can be as big as (a-1) * (a^(n-1)) for n=1000, which for a=25 is 25*(25^999). But the problem guarantees that the base10 number is <= 10^150. So we can rely on the guarantee.\n\n   Therefore, we can convert the base a string to base10 (an integer) and then convert that integer to base b (if b is integer) or to Roman (if b is 'R').\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read the first line: split into tokens -> [a_str, b_str]\n   Read the second line: s (the string)\n\n   If b_str is 'R':\n        n = convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a_str)\n        # Since the problem guarantees n is between 1 and 300010, we can safely convert to Roman.\n        roman_str = to_roman(n)\n        print(roman_str)\n\n   Else:\n        a_int = int(a_str)\n        b_int = int(b_str)\n        n = convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a_str)\n        # Now convert n (base10) to base b_int, omitting leading zeros.\n\n        if n == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num = n\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, b_int)\n                digits.append(r)\n            # Now digits are in reverse order, so we reverse them.\n            base_b_str = ''\n            for d in reversed(digits):\n                if d < 10:\n                    base_b_str += str(d)\n                else:\n                    base_b_str += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n            print(base_b_str)\n\n   But wait, there is a problem: the conversion from base a to base10 might be inefficient for very large numbers (with 1000 digits) but 1000 digits in base25 is a number with about 1000*log2(25) bits, which is about 3500 bits, which is acceptable for Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but 1000 digits in base25 is about 25^1000, which is a number with about 1000*1.4 = 1400 decimal digits, which is acceptable).\n\n   However, the problem says the base10 number is at most 10^150 (so 151 digits) in the non-Roman case. But wait, the input string is in base a, so the base10 number is the value of that string. The problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning the base10 value is at most 10^150.\n\n   Therefore, we can safely convert the base a string to base10 (integer) because the base10 integer will have at most 151 digits, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the input string might have leading zeros. Our conversion function must ignore leading zeros.\n\n   Let's write the helper function for base a to base10:\n\n   def convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a_str):\n        a = int(a_str)\n        n = 0\n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n            # But wait: what if the digit is greater than or equal to a?\n            # The problem says the number is in base a, so each digit must be in [0, a-1]. We assume the input is valid.\n\n            n = n * a + d\n\n        return n\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is in base a, so digits must be less than a.\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 11, and the string contains a digit 'A'? Then d=10, which is <11 -> valid.\n\n   But if the base a is 10, then the digit 'A' is invalid. So we must ensure that the input string only contains digits that are valid for base a.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"a single non-negative integer c in base a\", so the input string is valid.\n\n   Now, the Roman conversion function:\n\n   We'll define:\n\n   def to_roman(n):\n        # We know n is between 1 and 300010.\n        # We break the number into thousands, hundreds, etc.\n\n        # But note: 300010 = 300000 + 10, and 300000 is 300 * 1000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        # Standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 100000. However, we can use the fact that 100000 is 100 * 1000, but that is not standard.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then extend.\n\n        # Actually, the standard method for numbers above 3999 uses a bar (or other notations) but the problem does not specify.\n\n        # Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we can break the number as:\n\n        # Let's create a mapping for all values from 1 to 300010? That's too many.\n\n        # Better: break the number into parts: thousands, hundreds, tens, ones, but we have to account for the thousands part beyond 3999.\n\n        # However, note: 300010 is 300000 + 10, and 300000 is 3 * 100000. But we don't have 100000.\n\n        # There is a known extended Roman numeral for large numbers: \n        #   For example, 500000 is often written as = or something, but the problem does not specify.\n\n        # After re‐reading the problem: the example inputs are small, and the problem does not require standard representation for large numbers.\n\n        # But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010. So we must represent 300010.\n\n        # We can use the following: represent 300010 as 300000 + 10, but 300000 is 3 * 100000, and we don't have 100000.\n\n        # Another idea: use the standard subtractive principle and the additive principle for thousands beyond 3999 by repeating the M's? \n        #   But 300000 would be 300 M's? That's 300 'M's, which is acceptable for the problem? The problem doesn't specify efficiency, but the number is fixed to 300010, so the maximum is 300010.\n\n        # However, 300010 is 300000+10, and 300000 is 300 thousands, so we can break it as:\n\n        #   Break the number into groups of thousands. But we don't have a symbol for thousands beyond M.\n\n        # Since the problem does not specify, and the example inputs are small, perhaps the test cases for Roman are small (like the examples: 5 and 4).\n\n        # But the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we must handle up to 300010.\n\n        # I found that there is a system called \"Indian numeral system\" or other, but the problem says \"Roman\".\n\n        # After checking online: the standard Roman numerals use the following for large numbers:\n\n        #   Sometimes, a bar over a Roman numeral multiplies it by 1000. So, M with a bar is 1,000,000.\n\n        #   But our number is 300,010, which is 300000 + 10.\n\n        #   300000 = 300 * 1000 = 300 * M (but that would be 300 M's) OR we can use a bar over the 'C' (which is 100) to make it 100,000? Then 300000 = 3 * C with bar = 3 * 100000 = 300000.\n\n        #   But the problem does not specify the use of bars.\n\n        # Given the ambiguity, I will use the following:\n\n        #   We break the number into parts: thousands, hundreds, tens, ones, but we treat the thousands part separately.\n\n        #   Actually, we can use the standard subtractive and additive for numbers up to 3999, and then for numbers above 3999, we break the number as:\n\n        #   Let n = n // 1000 * 1000 + (n % 1000)\n\n        #   Then, represent the thousands part (n//1000) as a Roman numeral (for numbers up to 300) and then add a bar (or something) to indicate thousands? \n\n        #   But the problem does not specify.\n\n        # After reading the problem statement again: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — so the problem uses letters for digits above 9, but for Roman numerals, they are using the standard system.\n\n        # Since the problem does not specify the representation for large numbers in Roman, and the example inputs are small, I will assume that the test cases for Roman are small (like the examples: 5 and 4) and the rest of the Roman test cases are small enough to be represented without extended notations.\n\n        # But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010. 300010 is not small.\n\n        # I found that the problem statement might have intended to limit the Roman numeral inputs to numbers that can be represented without extended notations (i.e., up to 3999). But the guarantee is up to 300010.\n\n        # Alternatively, the problem might have meant that the input string (in base a) for Roman is at most 300010 in base10, but the representation is still the standard one.\n\n        # How to represent 300010 in standard Roman numerals?\n\n        # Standard Roman numerals do not have a standard way to represent numbers above 3999. However, one common method is to use parentheses for thousands. For example, (M) = 1000, (MM) = 2000, etc.\n\n        # But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        # Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the sample inputs are small, I will use the following:\n\n        #   Convert the number to a string of the standard subtractive form for numbers up to 3999, and then for the thousands part (if any) we simply repeat the 'M's.\n\n        #   However, 300000 would be 300 'M's, which is acceptable.\n\n        #   But wait, the standard subtractive form for 4000 is 'MMMM', but 4000 is usually written as 'MMMM' (which is 40",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting this base 10 number to the desired target base, which could be either an integer base or the Roman numeral system.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal (Base 10):** \n   - The input number is provided as a string in a given base `a` (ranging from 2 to 25). We parse each digit of this string, converting it from its respective base to a decimal value. For digits beyond '9', we use letters 'A' to 'Z' to represent values from 10 onwards.\n   \n2. **Conversion to Target Base:**\n   - If the target base `b` is an integer (2 to 25), we convert the decimal number to this base by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped back to digits (using letters for values greater than 9).\n   - If the target base is 'R' (Roman numerals), we convert the decimal number to its Roman numeral representation. This involves breaking down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, then using predefined mappings to form the Roman numeral string. Special care is taken to handle subtractive notations (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a_str):\n    a = int(a_str)\n    n = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + d\n    return n\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n    roman_map = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_map:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        n = convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a_str)\n        roman_numeral = to_roman(n)\n        print(roman_numeral)\n    else:\n        try:\n            a_int = int(a_str)\n            b_int = int(b_str)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Error:\", e)\n            return\n            \n        if a_int < 2 or a_int > 25 or b_int < 2 or b_int > 25:\n            print(\"Invalid base\")\n            return\n            \n        n = convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a_str)\n        \n        if n == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num = n\n            while num:\n                num, r = divmod(num, b_int)\n                digits.append(r)\n                \n            base_b_str = ''\n            for d in reversed(digits):\n                if d < 10:\n                    base_b_str += str(d)\n                else:\n                    base_b_str += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n                    \n            print(base_b_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal:** The function `convert_base_a_to_base10` processes each character of the input string, converting it from its respective base `a` to a decimal value. Digits are converted by their numerical value, and letters (for bases greater than 10) are converted by subtracting 'A' and adding 10.\n2. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The function `to_roman` breaks down the decimal number into components (thousands, hundreds, tens, units) using predefined mappings. It constructs the Roman numeral string by iteratively subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n3. **Main Function:** The `main` function reads input, checks for valid bases, converts the input number to decimal, and then either converts it to the specified integer base or to Roman numerals. The result is printed without leading zeros, handling edge cases such as zero appropriately.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and the more complex Roman numeral conversion, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
