And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we compute the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of sleep times in all weeks.\n\n Then, the average is S / (number_of_weeks) = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: How do we compute S?\n We can precompute the prefix sum array to quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Alternatively, note that each element ai might appear in multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position i (0-indexed) will appear in \n max(0, min(k, n-i+1)) ... Actually, let's think:\n\n The first week starts at index 0, so the element at index i appears in weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n - k) [if we consider the week must be of length k and within the array].\n\n Actually, the number of weeks that include the element at index i is:\n   left_count = i + 1   [weeks starting from 0 to i]\n   right_count = n - i   [weeks ending at n-1 to i, but wait]\n\n Alternatively, the element at index i is included in weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n-k) but actually:\n\n   The week must start at s such that s <= i and s+k-1 >= i, i.e., s <= i and s >= i - k + 1, and also s must be at least 0 and at most n-k.\n\n So the valid starts are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n But note: n-k is the maximum start index (since the last week starts at n-k). Then the count is:\n   count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n Then S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * count_i\n\n However, there is a simpler way: use a sliding window.\n\n But note: n and k can be up to 200000, so we need an O(n) solution.\n\n We can compute the total sum S by:\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   First, compute the first window's sum: window0 = sum(a[0:k])\n   Then, the next window: window1 = window0 - a[0] + a[k]\n\n   Then, we can iterate for windows from 0 to n-k.\n\n But wait: the problem asks for the average of the averages of each week? Actually, no: the average is defined as the total sum of all sleep times in all weeks divided by the number of weeks.\n\n But note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. Then the total sum is 3+4+4+7 = 18, and the number of weeks is 2, so average is 18/2 = 9.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_sum += sum(a[i:i+k])\n\n But that would be O(n*k) which is too slow for n, k up to 200000.\n\n Instead, we can use a sliding window to compute the sum of each window in O(n). Then the total sum S would be computed in O(n).\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   Precompute a prefix sum array for a, so that we can get the sum of any contiguous segment in O(1).\n\n   Or even better: use a single pass with a running window.\n\n   Example:\n\n     Let arr = [3,4,7] and k=2.\n     We want to compute:\n        window0 = 3+4 = 7\n        window1 = 4+7 = 11\n        total_sum = 7 + 11 = 18\n\n   Then average = 18 / 2 = 9.0\n\n   Similarly, for the second example: \"1 1\\n10\" -> n=1, k=1, total_weeks=1, total_sum=10, average=10.0\n\n   Third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n        n=8, k=2, total_weeks=7\n\n        We need to compute the sum of 7 windows:\n\n          [1,2] -> 3\n          [2,4] -> 6\n          [4,100000] -> 100004\n          [100000,123] -> 100123\n          [123,456] -> 579\n          [456,789] -> 1245\n          [789,1] -> 790\n\n        total_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n\n        Then average = total_sum / 7\n\n   But wait, let me compute:\n\n        3+6 = 9\n        9+100004 = 100013\n        100013+100123 = 200136\n        200136+579 = 200715\n        200715+1245 = 201960\n        201960+790 = 202750\n\n        Then 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   So the example output is correct.\n\n   However, we can avoid iterating over each window and adding k elements by using a sliding window.\n\n   Steps for sliding window:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        current_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n   This is O(n) because we do one initial sum (O(k)) and then n-k steps each O(1).\n\n   But note: k can be large, so the initial sum might be heavy if we do it naively for k up to 200000, but we have to do one initial sum anyway.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use prefix sums to compute the first window as well:\n\n        prefix[0] = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        Then the sum of a[i:j] is prefix[j] - prefix[i]\n\n        Then the total_sum can be computed by:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n            j = i + k\n            total_sum += prefix[j] - prefix[i]\n\n        Then average = total_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n   But this is still O(n) because we are iterating over n-k+1 windows and each window uses two array lookups.\n\n   However, we can use the sliding window method to update the current_sum without building a full prefix array.\n\n   Since n and k can be up to 200000, both methods are acceptable. But note: the sliding window method only requires one initial sum and then n-k additions/subtractions.\n\n   Let me code with the sliding window.\n\n   Edge case: k==0? But k>=1.\n\n   Example: n=1, k=1 -> one window.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        # If k == 0, but k>=1 so skip.\n\n        # If k > n, then total_weeks becomes negative? But the problem states 1<=k<=n, so no.\n\n        # Calculate the first window\n        if total_weeks == 0:\n            # But k<=n, so total_weeks>=1, so we don't need this.\n            print(0.0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        # If k==0, but k>=1, so we can assume k>=1.\n\n        # If k==n, then only one window.\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n\n        # Now slide the window from i=1 to i=n-k (inclusive)\n        for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            # Remove the element that is leaving: a[i-1]\n            # Add the new element: a[i+k-1]\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the output to have 10 decimal places.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   Let's test with the example: [3,4,7], k=2, n=3.\n\n        total_weeks = 2\n        current_sum = 3+4 = 7, total_sum=7\n        i=1: current_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2] = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11, total_sum=18\n        average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n   Another example: [10], k=1, n=1.\n\n        total_weeks=1\n        current_sum = 10, total_sum=10\n        average=10.0\n\n   Third example: [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1], k=2, n=8.\n\n        total_weeks=7\n        current_sum = 1+2 = 3, total_sum=3\n        i=1: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[2] = 3 - 1 + 4 = 6, total_sum=9\n        i=2: current_sum = 6 - a[1] + a[3] = 6 - 2 + 100000 = 100004, total_sum=100013\n        i=3: current_sum = 100004 - a[2] + a[4] = 100004 - 4 + 123 = 100123, total_sum=200236\n        Wait, wait: our array is 0-indexed: \n            a[0]=1, a[1]=2, a[2]=4, a[3]=100000, a[4]=123, a[5]=456, a[6]=789, a[7]=1.\n\n        i=3: we remove a[3-1]=a[2]=4 and add a[3+2-1]=a[4]=123 -> 100004-4+123 = 100123, then total_sum becomes 3+6+100004+100123 = 200136? \n\n        Actually, let me recalc step by step:\n\n            i=0: current_sum=3, total_sum=3\n            i=1: current_sum=3 - 1 + 4 = 6, total_sum=3+6=9\n            i=2: current_sum=6 - 2 + 100000 = 100004, total_sum=9+100004=100013\n            i=3: current_sum=100004 - 4 + 123 = 100123, total_sum=100013+100123=200136\n            i=4: current_sum=100123 - 100000 + 456 = 100123-100000+456 = 579, total_sum=200136+579=200715\n            i=5: current_sum=579 - 123 + 456 = 579-123+456 = 912? But wait, the next window should be [456,789] -> 456+789=1245.\n\n        Correction: In the window at i=5, the window starts at index 5, so the elements are a[5] and a[6] (because k=2). \n        But our method:\n\n            At i=5: we subtract a[5-1] = a[4] (which is 123) and add a[5+2-1] = a[6] (which is 789).\n\n            So current_sum = 579 (from previous window [123,456]) -> remove a[4]=123 and add a[6]=789 -> 579 - 123 + 789 = 1245.\n\n        Then i=6: we subtract a[5] (which is 456) and add a[7] (which is 1) -> 1245 - 456 + 1 = 790.\n\n        Then total_sum = 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = 3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201960; 201960+790=202750.\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        So the mistake was in the step i=4: we were removing a[4] (which is 123) and adding a[6] (789) to get 579? \n\n        Actually, the window at i=4: \n            Start index i=4, so the window is [a[4], a[5]] = [123,456] -> sum=579.\n\n        Then for i=5: \n            We remove the element that was at the beginning of the window at i=4, which is a[4] (123), and add the next element a[6] (789). \n            So from window [123,456] (sum=579) we remove 123 and add 789 -> 579 - 123 + 789 = 1245, which is correct.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n   But note: the indexing in the for-loop for the sliding window:\n\n        We are iterating i from 1 to total_weeks-1 (because range(1, total_weeks) goes from 1 to total_weeks-1 inclusive).\n\n        total_weeks = n-k+1, so the number of windows is total_weeks, and we already did the first one.\n\n        The indices for the next windows: \n            The window at index i (the i-th window, 0-indexed) is from i to i+k-1.\n\n        In the update: \n            We remove the element at the beginning of the previous window (which is at index i-1) and add the new element at the end (which is at index i+k-1).\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   However, note that the array has n elements, and the last window starts at index n-k, so the last element we add is at index n-k+k-1 = n-1.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the range of i in the for loop: from 1 to total_weeks-1, which is n-k (because total_weeks = n-k+1, so the last index is n-k).\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: we must be cautious about the performance. The initial sum is O(k) and then we do (n-k) iterations, each O(1). \n\n   Since n and k can be up to 200000, the initial sum is 200000 which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the prefix sum method without the initial O(k) if we use a precomputed prefix array, but the initial sum is already O(k) so we can't avoid that.\n\n   But note: if k is large, say 200000, then the initial sum is 200000 additions, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n   Yes, 200000 is acceptable.\n\n   However, let's see if we can do better: \n\n        We can use the prefix sum array to compute the first window as well, but the initial computation of prefix is O(n). \n\n        But the problem says the array has up to 200000 elements, so building a prefix array of 200000 is acceptable.\n\n   Another approach: \n\n        total_sum = 0\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        average = total_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n   This is also O(n) and avoids the sliding window update, but the inner loop runs n-k+1 times, which is about 200000, and each iteration is O(1). \n\n   Which one is faster? The sliding window method does one initial sum (O(k)) and then n-k steps (each O(1)), so total operations is k + (n-k) = n. \n\n   The prefix sum method does n steps for building the prefix array and then n-k+1 steps for the windows, so about 2*n. \n\n   But note: the initial sum in the sliding window is k, which is the same as the first k elements. The prefix sum method builds the entire prefix array (n steps) and then uses the first n-k+1 windows.\n\n   So the sliding window method is slightly better if k is small, but if k is large, the initial sum is heavy. \n\n   However, k is at most 200000, so worst-case the initial sum is 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say n and k up to 200000, so we are allowed to do an O(n) solution.\n\n   I'll choose the sliding window because it uses one initial sum and then a simple loop.\n\n   However, we can also use the fact that the entire array is given and we can compute the total sum of all windows by:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        # We can also use a frequency array? Not necessary.\n\n   But the sliding window is straightforward.\n\n   Let me write the code with the sliding window.\n\n   One more edge: k==n, then we have one window.\n\n   Example: n=3, k=3, a=[1,2,3]\n        total_weeks = 1\n        current_sum = 1+2+3 = 6\n        Then we don't enter the for loop (since range(1,1) is empty)\n        average = 6/1 = 6.0\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        if total_weeks < 1:  # though k<=n, so not needed\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # If k==0, but k>=1, so skip.\n\n        if k == 0:\n            # But k>=1, so we don't need, but for safety we can check.\n            # According to the problem, k>=1, so we ignore.\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Compute the sum of the first window\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        # If there is only one window, we don't need to do anything else.\n        for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            # Subtract the element that is leaving (at index i-1) and add the new element (at index i+k-1)\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the answer to 10 decimal places.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n        total_weeks = 2\n        current_sum = 3+4 = 7\n        i from 1 to 1 (inclusive)\n            i=1: current_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7 - 3 + a[2] = 7-3+7=11\n            total_sum = 7+11=18\n        average=18/2=9.0 -> formatted to '9.0000000000'\n\n   Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n        n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n        total_weeks=1\n        current_sum=10\n        loop from 1 to 0 -> doesn't run\n        average=10.0 -> '10.0000000000'\n\n   Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        We already did the calculation and got 28964.2857142857...\n\n   However, note: the third example output is '28964.2857142857' (exactly 10 digits after the decimal, but note the example output string has 10 digits).\n\n   But wait, 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... indeed.\n\n   We'll output with 10 decimal places.\n\n   But note: floating point precision. The numbers are integers and the division might be exact or not.\n\n   Since the total_sum is an integer and total_weeks is an integer, the division might not be exact, but we are asked for absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n   Using float division and formatting to 10 decimal places should be safe for these numbers (within 10^5 and n,k up to 200000, so total_sum can be as large as 200000 * 10^5 * (n-k+1) ??? Actually, no.\n\n   Actually, the maximum value in a is 10^5, and there are at most 200000 windows, each window has k (max 200000) elements, so worst-case total_sum could be:\n\n        Each element a[i] (which is at most 10^5) appears in at most (min(i+1, n-i, k)) ... but worst-case if k is large, then an element in the middle appears in k windows? Actually, the count for an element is at most k (if k <= n, and the element is in the middle, then it appears in k windows). \n\n        But note: the entire array is of size n, and each window is k consecutive days.\n\n        Actually, the total_sum is the sum of each window. The maximum value for a window is k * 10^5, and there are n-k+1 windows, so total_sum is at most (n-k+1)*k*10^5.\n\n        n, k <= 200000, so (200000)*(200000)*10^5 is 4e10 * 10^5 = 4e15, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, no, because 4e15 is 4000000000000000, which is within the range of Python integers (though it's a big number, but Python integers are arbitrary precision, so it's okay). But then we divide by (n-k+1) which is at least 1 and at most 200000, so the result might be a float that is around 4e15 / 200000 = 2e10, which is 20 billion, which is representable as a float (floats have about 15-16 digits of precision).\n\n   However, we are using floating point for the division. But note: the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n   Since the numbers are integers and the division is by an integer, we can use integer arithmetic until the division, but the quotient might not be an integer.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that:\n\n        total_sum is an integer, and we are dividing by an integer (total_weeks). \n\n   But the problem does not require integer division, and the answer might be fractional.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   However, if total_sum is very large, we might lose precision by using float. But note: total_sum can be up to 4e15, which is within the range of float (which can represent integers exactly up to 2**53, which is about 9e15). So 4e15 is less than 9e15, so it is represented exactly.\n\n   Then the division: 4e15 / 200000 = 2e10, which is exactly representable in float.\n\n   But wait, what if the total_sum is not divisible by total_weeks? Then we have a fractional part.\n\n   Example: total_sum=5, total_weeks=2 -> 2.5, which is representable.\n\n   Therefore, the floating point representation should be accurate enough.\n\n   However, the problem says \"absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6\", so we must output the number with at least 6 digits.\n\n   The formatting with {:.10f} will give us 10 digits, which satisfies the condition.\n\n   Let me test with a non-integer average: \n\n        n=3, k=2, a=[1,2,3] -> two windows: [1,2] and [2,3] -> total_sum=1+2+2+3=8, average=4.0.\n\n        Another: a=[1,1,1,1], k=2, n=4, total_weeks=3, windows: [1,1]=2, [1,1]=2, [1,1]=2 -> total_sum=6, average=2.0.\n\n        But let's try: [1,2,3,4], k=2, n=4: windows: [1,2]=3, [2,3]=5, [3,4]=7, total_sum=3+5+7=15, average=5.0.\n\n        Now, [1,2,3,4,5], k=3, n=5: windows: [1,2,3]=6, [2,3,4]=9, [3,4,5]=12, total_sum=6+9+12=27, average=9.0.\n\n        Now, [1,2,3,4,5,6], k=3, n=6: windows: [1,2,3]=6, [2,3,4]=9, [3,4,5]=12, [4,5,6]=15, total_sum=6+9+12+15=42, average=10.5.\n\n        Let me compute: 42/4 = 10.5, which is exact.\n\n        Now, a non-exact: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], k=3, n=8: \n            windows: \n                [1,2,3]=6\n                [2,3,4]=9\n                [3,4,5]=12\n                [4,5,6]=15\n                [5,6,7]=18\n                [6,7,8]=21\n            total_sum=6+9+12+15+18+21=81\n            average=81/6=13.5 -> exact.\n\n        Let me try a non-exact: [1,1,1,1,1,1], k=3, n=6: \n            windows: [1,1,1]=3, [1,1,1]=3, [1,1,1]=3, total_sum=9, average=9/3=3.0.\n\n        How about [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], k=3, n=7: \n            windows: [1,1,1]=3 (3 times for the first three windows, then two more?): \n                [1,1,1] (start0), [1,1,1] (start1), [1,1,1] (start2), [1,1,1] (start3), [1,1,1] (start4) -> 5 windows.\n            total_sum=5*3=15, average=15/5=3.0.\n\n        Now, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k=3, n=7: \n            windows: \n                0: [1,2,3] -> 6\n                1: [2,3,4] -> 9\n                2: [3,4,5] -> 12\n                3: [4,5,6] -> 15\n                4: [5,6,7] -> 18\n            total_sum=6+9+12+15+18=54, average=54/5=10.8\n\n        Now, 10.8 is exact in base 10, but is it exact in base 2? \n\n        Actually, 10.8 = 108/10 = 54/5, which is 10.8. \n\n        But note: 54/5 = 10.8, which is a decimal that terminates, so it's exact.\n\n        Let me try a non-terminating decimal: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], k=2, n=9: \n            total_weeks=8, \n            windows: \n                [1,1]=2 (8 times)\n            total_sum=16, average=16/8=2.0.\n\n        How about [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k=2, n=10: \n            total_weeks=9\n            windows: \n                1+2=3\n                2+3=5\n                3+4=7\n                4+5=9\n                5+6=11\n                6+7=13\n                7+8=15\n                8+9=17\n                9+10=19\n            total_sum=3+5+7+9+11+13+15+17+19 = 99\n            average=99/9=11.0.\n\n        Now, let me try [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], k=3, n=9: \n            total_weeks=7\n            windows: \n                1+2+3=6\n                2+3+4=9\n                3+4+5=12\n                4+5+6=15\n                5+6+7=18\n                6+7+8=21\n                7+8+9=24\n            total_sum=6+9+12+15+18+21+24=105\n            average=105/7=15.0.\n\n        To get a non-exact, let me try: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k=3, n=10: \n            total_weeks=8\n            windows: \n                1+2+3=6\n                2+3+4=9\n                3+4+5=12\n                4+5+6=15\n                5+6+7=18\n                6+7+8=21\n                7+8+9=24\n                8+9+10=27\n            total_sum=6+9+12+15+18+21+24+27=122\n            average=122/8=15.25 -> exact.\n\n        Let me try [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k=4, n=10: \n            total_weeks=7\n            windows: \n                1+2+3+4=10\n                2+3+4+5=14\n                3+4+5+6=18\n                4+5+6+7=22\n                5+6+7+8=26\n                6+7+8+9=30\n                7+8+9+10=34\n            total_sum=10+14+18+22+26+30+34=154\n            average=154/7=22.0.\n\n        How about non-exact: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k=5, n=10: \n            total_weeks=6\n            windows: \n                1+2+3+4+5=15\n                2+3+4+5+6=20\n                3+4+5+6+7=25\n                4+5+6+7+8=30\n                5+6+7+8+9=35\n                6+7+8+9+10=40\n            total_sum=15+20+25+30+35+40=165\n            average=165/6=27.5 -> exact.\n\n        To get a non-exact, we need a division that doesn't result in a decimal that is a finite representation in base 2.\n\n        Example: [1,1,1,1,1], k=3, n=5: \n            total_weeks=3\n            windows: [1,1,1]=3, [1,1,1]=3, [1,1,1]=3 ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in the given sequence of days. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks to consider. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all these weeks and then dividing by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a sequence of integers where each integer represents the sleep time on a particular day. We need to consider every contiguous subsequence (window) of length k, sum the sleep times within each window, and then compute the average of these sums across all windows.\n2. **Intuition**: The straightforward approach would involve iterating over each window, summing the elements within it, and accumulating these sums. However, this would result in an O(n*k) time complexity, which is inefficient for large n and k (up to 200,000). Instead, we use a sliding window technique to optimize the process.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The sliding window approach allows us to compute the sum of each subsequent window in constant time by adjusting the previous window's sum. Specifically, we start with the sum of the first k elements. For each subsequent window, we subtract the leftmost element of the previous window and add the new rightmost element. This reduces the time complexity to O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The initial sum of the first k elements takes O(k) time. Each of the remaining (n - k) windows is processed in O(1) time, leading to an overall O(n) time complexity. The space complexity is O(n) to store the input array, but no additional significant space is used.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    if total_weeks <= 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n\n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`. If there are no valid weeks (though constraints ensure this doesn't happen), the output is set to 0.0.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum**: The sum of the first window (first k elements) is computed. This sum is then adjusted for each subsequent window by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. The cumulative sum of all window sums is maintained in `total_sum`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average is obtained by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks (`total_weeks`). The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
