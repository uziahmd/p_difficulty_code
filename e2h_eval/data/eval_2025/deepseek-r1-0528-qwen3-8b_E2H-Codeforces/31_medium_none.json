Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add a set of cards (each card between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] arbitrarily many times.\n\n 4. We are to find the minimum number of cards (nonnegative integer) k, such that there exists k numbers (each in [-x, x]) that sum to -S.\n\n 5. Observing the problem:\n\n    Let T = -S (the target sum we need to achieve by adding k cards).\n\n    We are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. Note that the maximum absolute value of a card is x.\n\n    We can consider:\n\n        - If T == 0, then we don't need any card -> answer 0.\n\n        - Otherwise, we are looking for the smallest k such that T can be represented as the sum of k integers, each between -x and x.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to use any integers in the range. This means:\n\n        For k=1: we can achieve any T in the range [-x, x]. So if |T| <= x, then k=1 is possible.\n\n        For k=2: we can achieve any T in the range [-2*x, 2*x] (because the minimum sum is -2*x and maximum is 2*x). But note: not every number in that interval is necessarily achievable? Actually, with two cards, we can achieve every integer between -2*x and 2*x because the steps are 1 (since we can choose any integer). However, wait: we have all integers from -x to x. Then the set of sums for two cards is:\n            { a + b : a, b in [-x, x] } \n            which is exactly the set of integers from -2*x to 2*x.\n\n        Similarly, for k cards, the minimum sum is -k*x and the maximum is k*x, and we can form every integer in between (because we have consecutive integers in the base set). \n\n    Therefore, we can say that for a given k, we can form any integer T' in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n    But note: what if k=0? Then we can only form 0.\n\n    So the condition for k is: k must be at least ceil(|T| / x) ??? Not exactly.\n\n    Actually, we require:\n        k*x >= |T|\n\n    However, wait: is that sufficient? For example, if T = 5, x=2, then k must be at least ceil(5/2)=3. But with k=3, the maximum absolute value we can get is 6, so yes. But also, we must check that the entire interval [-3*2, 3*2] = [-6,6] is covered, and 5 is in that interval.\n\n    However, note that the above reasoning says that for k cards we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x. Therefore, the condition is:\n\n        k*x >= |T|\n\n    Then the minimal k would be the smallest integer k (>=0) such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    But wait: is that true for negative T? Yes, because |T| is symmetric.\n\n    However, let's test with the examples:\n\n    Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2]\n        Current sum S = (-1+1+2) = 2 -> T = -2 (we need to add cards that sum to -2)\n\n        Then |T|=2, so we need k such that k*2 >= 2 -> k>=1. So k=1 is the minimum.\n\n        Example output is 1.\n\n    Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2]\n        Current sum S = -4 -> T = 4.\n\n        Then |T|=4, so we need k such that k*3 >= 4 -> k>= ceil(4/3) = 2 (since 1*3=3 <4, 2*3=6>=4). So k=2.\n\n        Example output is 2.\n\n    However, wait: is it always just the ceiling of |T|/x?\n\n    Let me think: \n\n        Condition: k*x >= |T|\n\n        Then k_min = ceil(|T| / x)   [if |T|>0]\n\n    But wait, what if T=0? Then k_min=0.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to use 0 as well. But if we use k=0, then the sum is 0. That is correct.\n\n    But is there a catch? Consider: we might have a situation where the current sum is already zero? Then T=0, k=0.\n\n    But wait, what if we have a current sum that is not zero, but we can use negative and positive cards arbitrarily? \n\n    However, note: the above reasoning about forming any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x] is correct because:\n\n        With one card: we can get any integer in [-x, x].\n        With two cards: we can get any integer in [-2*x, 2*x] because the set is closed under addition and the base set is consecutive.\n\n    But wait: is the set of sums for k cards the entire interval [-k*x, k*x]? \n\n        Yes, because we can use the following greedy argument:\n\n        We can represent any integer T (in the range [-k*x, k*x]) as follows:\n\n        Let d = |T|. We want to know if there exists k numbers (each between -x and x) that sum to T.\n\n        We can use the idea: start with the maximum positive contribution we can get (if T is positive) is k*x, and we can adjust by 1 by replacing a card of value x by x-1, then x-2, etc.\n\n        Alternatively, since we have consecutive integers, the set of representable numbers is consecutive.\n\n        However, note: the base set is all integers from -x to x. Then the set of k-card sums is the set of all integers between -k*x and k*x.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest nonnegative integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    But note: k must be an integer, and we are looking for the minimal k.\n\n        k_min = ceil(|T| / x)   if |T| > 0, and 0 if |T|==0.\n\n    However, let's compute: ceil(|T|/x) = (|T| + x - 1) // x   [if we use integer ceiling] but wait:\n\n        Actually, we can compute k_min = (|T| + x - 1) // x   when |T|>0, but if |T| is divisible by x, then (|T|//x) is an integer and we don't need to add x-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   if abs(T) > 0, but if abs(T)==0 then k_min=0.\n\n        However, note: if |T|==0, then k_min=0.\n\n        But wait, what if |T| is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x>=1, then (x-1)//x is 0). So we can write:\n\n        k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   if abs(T) % x != 0, but actually integer division with ceiling is:\n\n        k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n        However, let me test:\n\n          |T|=5, x=2: (5+1)//2 = 6//2 = 3 -> correct.\n          |T|=4, x=3: (4+2)//3 = 6//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if |T| is 0? (0+2-1)//2 = (1)//2 = 0 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: if |T| is exactly divisible by x, then:\n\n          |T|=4, x=4: (4+3)//4 = 7//4 = 1 (in integer floor division) -> but wait, we want 1 because 1*4>=4. However, 4//4=1, so (4+3)//4 = 7//4=1 (in Python, integer division truncates toward floor, but we want ceiling). \n\n        Actually, the formula for ceiling division is: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b, for positive a and b.\n\n        Since |T| and x are positive, we can use that.\n\n    However, wait: there is a catch. The above reasoning about forming any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x] is correct, but note:\n\n        In fact, we don't necessarily need to use the entire k*x. We just need the interval to cover |T|. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|, which is indeed the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Let S = sum(found_cards)\n        Let T = -S\n        Let abs_T = abs(T)\n\n        If abs_T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        Else:\n            k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   # This is the ceiling of abs_T/x\n\n        But wait: is that always sufficient? What if we have a very large |T|? But note: we are only concerned with the minimal k. And we can always form T if k*x>=abs_T.\n\n    However, wait: the problem does not require that we use the entire k*x, but the entire interval is covered, so yes.\n\n    But wait: consider the example where T is positive and we use negative cards? Actually, no: we can use both positive and negative cards arbitrarily. The condition is that the absolute value of the sum of k cards must be at least |T|? Actually, no: the condition is that the total sum we add must be T (which could be negative or positive). But note: the interval [-k*x, k*x] is symmetric, and T is in that interval if and only if k*x >= |T|.\n\n    However, note: if T is negative, then we need to form T (which is negative). But we can use negative cards to form a negative T. The condition is still k*x >= |T|.\n\n    So the answer is k = ceil(|T|/x)\n\n    But wait, look at the example: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> T = 4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n    Another example: \n        Suppose we have found cards: [1, 1, 1] (n=3) and x=1.\n        Then S=3, T=-3.\n        Then k = ceil(3/1)=3.\n\n        But wait: can we form -3 with 3 cards? Each card can be -1 (because x=1, so we can use -1). So three cards of -1: sum=-3. So 3 is correct.\n\n    However, is there a possibility that we can form the target with fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards? \n\n        No, because if we use k-1 cards, then the maximum absolute value we can get is (k-1)*x, which is less than |T| (if |T| > (k-1)*x). So we cannot form |T| with k-1 cards.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x).\n\n    However, wait: there is a caveat. The above reasoning assumes that we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. But is that always true?\n\n        Let me check for k=2 and x=2: the set of two-card sums is from -4 to 4. But can we form every integer in between?\n            -4: (-2, -2)\n            -3: (-2, -1) -> -3\n            -2: (-2,0) or (-1,-1)\n            -1: (-1,0) or (1,-2) doesn't work, but (-1,0) is there.\n            0: (0,0) or (1,-1) etc.\n            So yes, we can form every integer.\n\n        The reason is that the base set is consecutive (from -x to x). Then the set of k-card sums is the set of all integers from -k*x to k*x.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read n and x.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n\n        S = sum(list)\n        T = -S   (the target sum for the additional cards)\n\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n\n        if abs_T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n            # But wait: what if T is not an integer? Actually, T is an integer because S is an integer and the found cards are integers.\n\n            # However, note: the above formula for ceiling division works for positive integers.\n\n            print(k)\n\n    However, wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then T is positive, and |T| is positive. Same calculation.\n\n    But wait: is there any other constraint? \n\n        The problem says: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x.\"\n\n        And we are allowed to use any number of any card. So the above reasoning holds.\n\n    However, wait: consider the following example:\n\n        n=1, x=5, found card = [3]\n        Then S=3, T=-3, abs_T=3, k = ceil(3/5)=ceil(0.6)=1.\n\n        But wait: can we form -3 with one card? Yes, because -3 is in the range [-5,5].\n\n        Now, consider: n=1, x=2, found card=[3] -> wait, but the input guarantees that the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value. So the found card [3] would not be given if x=2. So the input is valid.\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\"\n\n    So the found cards are in the range [-x, x]. And the x given is at least 1.\n\n    Therefore, the code:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        n = int(data[0])\n        x = int(data[1])\n        cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n    Then compute the sum and proceed.\n\n    However, wait: what if the current sum S is zero? Then T=0, and we output 0. Correct.\n\n    But wait, the example: \n        Input: \"1 10\\n0\" -> then S=0, T=0 -> output 0.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards to find\". We don't need to find any.\n\n    However, what if we have multiple zeros? Then the sum is zero, so we don't need any.\n\n    But wait: what if we have non-zero cards that sum to zero? Then we don't need any.\n\n    So the code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            x = int(data[1])\n            cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            total = sum(cards)\n            target = -total\n            if target == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_target = abs(target)\n                # Compute the minimal k: smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs_target\n                # k = ceil(abs_target / x)\n                # Using integer arithmetic: (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n                k = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n    But wait: let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> total = -1+1+2 = 2, target = -2, abs_target=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> total = -4, target=4, abs_target=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is negative? We take absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n    But wait: there is a flaw. The above reasoning assumed that we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. However, note that the cards are integers, so the target must be an integer. But our target is the negative of the sum of integers, so it is an integer. So that's okay.\n\n    However, let me test with a different example:\n\n        Example: n=2, x=5, cards = [1, 2] -> total=3, target=-3, abs_target=3.\n        k = (3+5-1)//5 = (7)//5 = 1. So we need 1 card. But we can use a card with value -3? Yes, because -3 is in [-5,5]. Correct.\n\n    Another example: n=2, x=5, cards = [3,3] -> total=6, target=-6, abs_target=6.\n        k = (6+5-1)//5 = (10)//5=2. So 2 cards. But wait, can we form -6 with two cards? The maximum negative we can get with two cards is -10 (two cards of -5). But we need -6. How? We can use two cards: -3 and -3. But wait, -3 is in [-5,5]. So two cards of -3 gives -6. So yes. But note: we don't need to use the maximum absolute value. The minimal k is 2 because one card can only give from -5 to 5, and -6 is not in that range.\n\n    But wait: why did we use the condition k*x>=abs_target? \n\n        Because the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x (if we use k cards of the same sign). However, we are allowed to mix positive and negative. But the condition for the existence of a representation is that the absolute value of the target must be at most k*x (because the sum of k cards cannot exceed k*x in absolute value). However, note that the minimal k must satisfy that the interval [-k*x, k*x] covers the target, i.e., |target| <= k*x.\n\n    However, the above condition is necessary and sufficient (as we argued that every integer in [-k*x, k*x] is representable). So the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |target|.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But wait, let me consider a more complex example:\n\n        Suppose we need to form 7 with x=3. Then k_min = ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Indeed, with 3 cards: maximum we can get is 9, and we can form 7? \n            We can use two 3's and one 1: 3+3+1=7. But wait, we are forming a positive 7. But note: the problem allows both positive and negative. However, we are forming a positive 7, so we use positive cards.\n\n        However, the condition was k*x>=7, and 3*3=9>=7 -> so k=3 is the minimal.\n\n        But wait: can we form 7 with 2 cards? The maximum with two cards is 6 (3+3) which is less than 7, so no.\n\n    So the formula holds.\n\n    Therefore, the final code:\n\n        Read n and x.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n        Compute total = sum(list)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_target = abs(target)\n            k = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is negative? We use absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n    But note: the above formula for ceiling division: (abs_target + x - 1) // x is standard for positive integers.\n\n    Let me test with some edge cases:\n\n        Case 1: target=0 -> handled by the if.\n\n        Case 2: target=1, x=1 -> k=(1+0)//1 = 1 -> correct.\n        Case 3: target=5, x=3 -> (5+2)//3 = 7//3 = 2 (in integer floor division) -> 2*3=6>=5 -> correct.\n\n    But wait: 7//3 is 2 in Python (floor division). However, the formula (a+b-1)//b for ceiling is correct for positive a and b.\n\n        Example: a=5, b=3 -> (5+3-1)=7, 7//3=2 -> which is ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2.\n\n    However, note: if we use integer floor division, the formula (a+b-1)//b is the standard way to compute the ceiling of a/b for positive a and b.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if x is 1 and target is 0? Then we don't go into the else, so we print 0. Correct.\n\n    One more example: n=1, x=1000, card=[0] -> total=0, then 0. Correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the found cards sum to a very large number? \n\n        Example: n=1000, x=1000, cards = [1000]*1000 -> total=1000000, target=-1000000, abs_target=1000000.\n        k = (1000000 + 1000 - 1) // 1000 = (1000999)//1000 = 1000 (because 1000*1000=1000000, and 1000000 is divisible by 1000 -> ceil(1000000/1000)=1000).\n\n        But wait: 1000 cards of -1000 will give -1000000. So 1000 cards is the minimal.\n\n    However, is there a way to do it with fewer than 1000 cards? \n\n        The maximum absolute value per card is 1000. So the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is 1000*k. We need 1000*k>=1000000 -> k>=1000. So no.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    But wait: I just realized that the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\", and we are computing k = ceil(|T|/x). \n\n    However, note that the target T is the negative of the current sum. But the current sum can be positive or negative.\n\n    We have taken absolute value, so it doesn't matter.\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is negative? Then we need to form a negative number. But the same reasoning applies because we can use negative cards.\n\n    Therefore, we output k.\n\n    But wait: what if the target is negative and large in absolute value? \n\n        Example: n=1, x=5, card=[-3] -> total=-3, target=3. Then k = ceil(3/5)=1. But wait, we can use a card with 3 (which is positive) to make the total zero? \n\n        Actually, the problem: we have found one card: [-3]. We want to add some cards so that the total sum is 0.\n\n        So we need to add cards that sum to 3. We can use one card with 3 (which is in [-5,5]). So k=1 is correct.\n\n    So the code is:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            x = int(data[1])\n            # There are n integers after the first two\n            cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            s = sum(cards)\n            t = -s\n            if t == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_t = abs(t)\n                # Calculate the minimal k: smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs_t\n                # Using ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n                k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n    Let me run the provided examples again:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> k=(2+1)//2? Wait, wait: (2+2-1)=3, 3//2=1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs_t=4 -> (4+3-1)=6, 6//3=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n    However, wait: in the example \"2 3\\n-2 -2\", the target is 4 (positive) and we are using two cards: each card can be at most 3, so two cards can give at most 6. But 4 is less than 6, so we can form 4. \n\n    But wait: can we form 4 with two cards? The cards must be integers from -3 to 3. \n\n        We can use two cards: 3 and 1 -> 3+1=4. Or 2 and 2. So yes.\n\n    But note: the problem does not restrict the sign. We can use positive cards to achieve a positive target.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is negative? \n\n        Example: n=2, x=3, cards=[2,2] -> s=4, t=-4, abs_t=4 -> k= (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\n        We need two cards that sum to -4. Each card can be as low as -3. So two cards of -2: -2+-2=-4. Or one card of -3 and one card of -1: -3+-1=-4. So yes.\n\n    So the code is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if the target is positive and we use negative cards? We don't have to. We can use positive cards to form a positive target.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n    One more edge: n=0? But the problem states n>=1.\n\n    So the code is complete.\n\n    But wait: wait a minute, the problem statement says:\n\n        \"The first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers\"\n\n    So n>=1.\n\n    Therefore, we are safe.\n\n    Let me submit the code.\n\n    However, wait: I just saw the sample inputs in the problem:\n\n        Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n        Our code reads the first two tokens as n and x, then the next n tokens.\n\n        But the example input is given as two strings, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n    The code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            if not data:\n                return\n            n = int(data[0])\n            x = int(data[1])\n            # There should be at least two more numbers: the n integers\n            cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            s = sum(cards)\n            t = -s\n            if t == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_t = abs(t)\n                k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n    But wait: what if n=0? The problem says n>=1, so we don't worry.\n\n    However, there's a better way to read the input: \n\n        We know there are n integers after the first two. So we can read:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        n = int(data[0])\n        x = int(data[1])\n        # The next n integers are from index 2 to 2+n-1\n        cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    Let me test with the provided examples as command-line input.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        data = ['3','2','-1','1','2']\n        n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2, k=(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1 (in integer division) -> 1.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        data = ['2','3','-2','-2']\n        n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs_t=4, k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\n    Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n    But wait: wait, wait! There is a flaw.\n\n    Let me think again: the problem says that the found cards are n cards, and we can use any card from -x to x (any integer in that range). \n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that we use the minimal number of cards in the sense of forming the exact target? \n\n    But wait: the above reasoning is that the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    However, consider: we are allowed to use any integer in the range, so we can form any integer in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n    But note: the target T is fixed. We need to form exactly T. \n\n    The condition is: T must be in [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n    So k_min is the smallest k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if T is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\n    But wait, what if T is 0 and we use k=0? Then we don't add any card. The total sum remains S (which is 0). Correct.\n\n    But wait: what if T is not an integer? It is an integer because S is an integer (sum of integers).\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, wait: I just thought of an example that might break it.\n\n        Example: n=1, x=2, card=[1] -> total=1, target=-1, abs_target=1.\n        k = (1+2-1)//2 = (2)//2 = 1.\n\n        We can use a card of -1, which is in [-2,2]. So 1 card is enough.\n\n    Example: n=1, x=2, card=[2] -> total=2, target=-2, abs_target=2.\n        k = (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 (because 3//2=1 in integer floor division) -> but wait, 1*2=2, so we need k>=1, and k=1 is the minimal.\n\n        But wait: can we form -2 with one card? Yes, because we can use a card of -2.\n\n    Example: n=1, x=2, card=[0] -> total=0, target=0 -> k=0.\n\n    Example: n=1, x=2, card=[-1] -> total=-1, target=1 -> k=1.\n\n    All these examples are correct.\n\n    Therefore, I believe the code is correct.\n\n    But wait: wait a minute, consider the following example:\n\n        n=2, x=3, cards = [1,1] -> total=2, target=-2, abs_target=2.\n        k = (2+3-1)//3 = 4//3 = 1 (because 4//3=1 in integer floor division) -> 1.\n\n        But can we form -2 with one card? The card must be in [-3,3]. So we can use -2. Correct.\n\n    Another example: n=2, x=3, cards=[3,3] -> total=6, target=-6, abs_target=6.\n        k = (6+3-1)//3 = 8//3 = 2 (because 8//3=2 in integer floor division) -> 2.\n\n        With two cards, the maximum absolute value we can get is 6 (each card -3) -> so -6 is achievable.\n\n    But wait: is there a way to form -6 with one card? The one card must be between -3 and 3, so no.\n\n    So the minimal k is 2.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is 0? We output 0.\n\n    But wait: what if the target is negative and the minimal k is computed correctly?\n\n        Example: n=2, x=3, cards=[-3,-3] -> total=-6, target=6, abs_target=6, k=(6+3-1)//3=8//3=2.\n\n        We can form 6 with two cards: 3 and 3. Correct.\n\n    One last thing: what if the target is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            x = int(data[1])\n            cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            s = sum(cards)\n            t = -s\n            if t == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_t = abs(t)\n                k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n    Let me run the provided examples in the problem.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            Output: 1\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            Output: 2\n\n    So we output the expected answers.\n\n    However, wait: I see the example input format is provided as two separate strings in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n    But the problem says \"Input\" and then the example.\n\n    We assume that the input is given via stdin.\n\n    Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n    But wait: there's an alternative: sometimes the problem might have extra spaces? We are splitting by space, so that should be okay.\n\n    Final code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            x = int(data[1])\n            # The next n integers\n            cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            s = sum(cards)\n            t = -s\n            if t == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_t = abs(t)\n                # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n                k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n    However, wait: what if the target is very large? \n\n        Example: n=1, x=1, card=[1000] -> but wait, the input guarantee: \"It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero. If the current sum of the found cards is `S`, then the sum of the additional cards must be `-S`. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards (each with a value between -x and x) that can sum up to `-S`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the absolute value of the target sum (`T = -S`). The maximum absolute value that can be achieved with `k` cards is `k * x` (if all cards are either `x` or `-x`). Therefore, the smallest `k` such that `k * x >= |T|` is the answer. This is derived from the ceiling of the division of `|T|` by `x`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves calculating the current sum of the found cards, determining the target sum (`-S`), and then computing the minimal `k` using ceiling division. If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves reading `n` integers and summing them, which takes O(n) time. The subsequent calculations are constant time operations, making the overall complexity O(n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    s = sum(cards)\n    t = -s\n    if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `S` of the found cards is computed. The target sum `T` is `-S`, which must be achieved by adding new cards.\n3. **Target Check**: If `T` is zero, no additional cards are needed, and the answer is `0`.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For a non-zero `T`, the minimal number of cards `k` is calculated using ceiling division of `|T|` by `x`. This ensures that `k` is the smallest integer such that `k * x` can cover the absolute value of `T`.\n5. **Output**: The result `k` is printed, representing the minimum number of additional cards required to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insights to solve the problem with optimal performance.",
