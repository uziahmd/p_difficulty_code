The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to change at most one number in the subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n We can think of the problem as: find the longest contiguous subarray that has at most one \"break\" (i.e., a place where the strictly increasing condition fails) and then we can fix one element to fix that break.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute two arrays:\n    - left[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subarray ending exactly at i (with the last element being a[i])\n    - right[j]: the length of the strictly increasing subarray starting exactly at j\n\n 2. Then, we consider three cases for a subsegment [l, r]:\n    Case 1: The entire subsegment is already strictly increasing. Then we can have a segment without any break, so we don't even need to change anything. But note, we are allowed to change one, so this is acceptable.\n\n    Case 2: There is exactly one break. We can fix one element to fix the break.\n\n    However, note that sometimes the break might be fixed by changing an element that is not necessarily the one at the break. We can consider:\n\n    Let's define:\n        left[i] = length of increasing sequence ending at i (so left[0]=1, and for i>=1: if a[i] > a[i-1] then left[i] = left[i-1]+1 else 1)\n        right[i] = length of increasing sequence starting at i (so right[n-1]=1, and for i from n-2 down to 0: if a[i] < a[i+1] then right[i] = right[i+1]+1 else 1)\n\n    Then, the entire subsegment [l, r] is considered. Without any changes, the condition for being strictly increasing is that for every index from l+1 to r, we have a[i] > a[i-1]. So the breaks are the indices i (from l+1 to r) such that a[i] <= a[i-1].\n\n    We are allowed to change at most one number. So we can allow at most one break.\n\n    How to combine?\n    We can try to consider a candidate segment [i, j] and check how many breaks (non-increasing steps) are there. Then we want the maximum length with at most one break.\n\n    But note: if we change one element, we can fix one break. However, we must also ensure that the entire segment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n    Another idea: \n        We can consider that the broken segment might be fixed by modifying one element. There are two possibilities:\n\n        a) The break is at a particular position. For example, if we have [2, 3, 1, 5, 6], then the break is between index2 (3) and index3 (1). We can change the 3 to something? Actually, we can change the 1 to something? \n\n        Actually, we can break the segment into parts that are already increasing, and see if we can merge two increasing parts by fixing the element in the middle.\n\n        We can consider:\n          Option 1: The entire segment is increasing -> then we don't need to change anything, but we are allowed to change one so that's okay.\n\n          Option 2: There is exactly one break. Then we can fix that one break by changing one element.\n\n        How to handle the break?\n\n        Let the break occur between i-1 and i (so at index i). Then we can consider:\n\n          - Removing the break by changing a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and ...? But note: we are allowed to change only one number, and we can choose any integer.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the entire segment to be contiguous in the original array? Actually, the subsegment must be contiguous.\n\n        We can use the following approach:\n\n        We traverse the array and for each index i (from 1 to n-1) we consider:\n\n          Case 1: The entire segment is increasing (no break). Then the length is left[i] + right[i] - 1? Actually, no, because left[i] and right[i] are defined independently.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Let dp0[i] = the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i (without any changes).\n          Similarly, dp1[i] for the increasing subsegment ending at i, but we are allowed to have one change in the entire segment.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change only one number anywhere in the segment.\n\n        Another known solution for similar problems (like making non-decreasing with one change) is to use two pointers and precomputation of next smaller or next larger. However, here we require strictly increasing and at most one change.\n\n        Known similar problem: Codeforces \"DZY Loves Sequences\"\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking possible subsegments and determining if they meet the criteria with minimal computational overhead.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index `i` in the original array.\n   - **Right Array (`right_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index `i` in the original array.\n\n2. **Check for Single Break**:\n   - For each index `i` (from 1 to n-1), check if there is a single break in the strictly increasing sequence between `i-1` and `i`.\n   - If such a break exists, consider merging the left and right increasing subsegments around `i` by adjusting either the left or right element at the break. The merged length is calculated as `left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i+1]` if the left element is fixed, or `left_arr[i] + right_arr[i+1]` if the right element is fixed. However, ensure that the merged segments form a strictly increasing sequence after adjustment.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the entire array is already strictly increasing.\n   - Handle cases where the array has only one or two elements.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The maximum valid subsegment length is determined by considering all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one change, including those without any changes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    best = max(max(left_arr), max(right_arr))\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] <= a[i-1]:\n            candidate1 = left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i+1]\n            if i-2 >= 0 and a[i-2] < a[i] and left_arr[i-1] > 1:\n                candidate1 = left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i+1]\n            else:\n                candidate1 = 0\n                \n            candidate2 = left_arr[i] + right_arr[i+1]\n            if i-1 >= 0 and a[i-1] < a[i+1] and left_arr[i] > 1:\n                candidate2 = left_arr[i] + right_arr[i+1]\n            else:\n                candidate2 = 0\n                \n            candidate3 = left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i]\n            if i+1 < n and a[i] < a[i+1] and right_arr[i] > 1:\n                candidate3 = left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i]\n            else:\n                candidate3 = 0\n                \n            candidate = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    if best < 2:\n        best = 1\n        \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the size of the array `n` and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the array has only one element, the result is trivially 1 since no changes are needed.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays are computed to store the lengths of the longest strictly increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n4. **Initial Best Length**: The initial best length is set to the maximum value found in either the left or right arrays, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n5. **Checking for Breaks**: For each index `i`, if there is a break (non-increasing step) between `i-1` and `i`, the algorithm checks three possible scenarios to merge adjacent increasing subsegments by adjusting one element. The maximum valid segment length from these scenarios is considered.\n6. **Final Adjustment**: If no breaks are found, the result remains the longest existing strictly increasing subsegment. The final result is printed, ensuring it accounts for all edge cases where the array might be too short.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking segments around potential breaks, leveraging precomputed arrays to minimize redundant calculations and ensure optimal performance.",
