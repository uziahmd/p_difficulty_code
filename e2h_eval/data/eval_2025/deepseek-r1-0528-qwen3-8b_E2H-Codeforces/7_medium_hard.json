The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10^4 test cases, each with an integer n (from 1 to 10^18).\n We need to determine if there exists an integer k > 1 such that a snowflake graph with n vertices exists.\n\n According to the problem, the snowflake is constructed in layers (or steps). The construction is as follows:\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Start from the initial vertex and add k new vertices (each connected to the center). Now total vertices = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k outer vertices (which currently have degree 1) will be connected to k new vertices. So we add k * k vertices. Then total vertices = 1 + k + k*k.\n   Step 3: Then each of those k*k vertices (which now have degree 1) will be connected to k new vertices, so we add k * k * k. Then total vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n However, note that the problem says:\n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n   Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the minimal snowflake has at least two steps? Actually, the first step is mandatory, but then we must do the second step at least once? Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning after the first step we do at least one more step.\n\n But wait, the example for k=4 shows the smallest snowflake (with 4 branches extended one more time). So the minimal number of vertices for a given k is:\n\n   Step0: 1\n   Step1: 1 + k\n   Step2: 1 + k + k^2\n\n And we require at least two steps? Actually, the problem says: \"This step [adding k new vertices to each leaf] should be done at least once.\" So we must have at least one expansion from the leaves (the leaves being the ones from step1). Therefore, the minimal snowflake must have at least 1 + k + k^2 vertices.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the number of layers (steps) we take. We can take any number of layers (at least two: the center and then at least one layer of k^2). But note: the problem says \"then\" (after connecting the center to k new vertices) we do the step at least once. So the minimal is two layers.\n\n But also note: the problem does not say we stop at a particular layer. We can have:\n\n   Let m be the number of layers (starting from the center, so center is layer0, then layer1, layer2, ...). Then the total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (for m>=1, because the center is already there and then we do at least one expansion)\n\n However, wait: the problem says the initial step is connecting the center to k new vertices (so that's layer1). Then the next step (layer2) is done at least once. So m (number of layers) is at least 2? Actually, the center is layer0, then we have layer1 (k nodes) and then at least layer2 (k^2 nodes). So the minimal m is 2 (meaning we have two expansions: the center and then two layers beyond the center?).\n\n Alternatively, let me reindex: \n   Layer0: center -> 1 node.\n   Layer1: k nodes -> total 1+k.\n   Layer2: k*k nodes -> total 1+k+k^2.\n\n So the minimal number of layers (excluding the center) is two (layers 1 and 2). Therefore, we must have at least three layers (center, layer1, layer2) and the minimal n for a fixed k is 1+k+k^2.\n\n But note: the problem does not fix k. We are allowed to choose k>1 arbitrarily (and the number of layers m, which is at least 2, meaning the total layers including center is 3). However, we can also have more than two expansions (like three or more layers). So the general formula for a fixed k and m (number of expansions beyond the center) is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some m >= 1 (because we have at least the center and one expansion, i.e., m=1 gives 1+k, but wait: the problem says we must do the expansion step at least once. The expansion step is defined as adding k new vertices to each leaf. The first expansion (from the center) is the initial step (k new vertices) and then we must do the expansion at least once on the leaves (which are the k new vertices). \n\n Actually, reading the problem again: \n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" \n   Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the first expansion (from the center) is mandatory, and then we must do at least one more expansion (on the leaves). Therefore, the minimal expansion is two layers: the center and two layers of expansion (the first expansion and the second). So the minimal n for a given k is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use the same k throughout? Actually, k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n   Is there an integer k>1 and an integer m>=2 (meaning we have m+1 layers: center and m layers of expansion, but note: the initial expansion (first expansion) is the first step, and then we require at least one more expansion, so m>=2) such that:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the number of layers, so m can be any integer >= 2.\n\n However, note that the series is a geometric series:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n and m>=2 (so the exponent m+1 is at least 3).\n\n But note: we can also consider the case where we do only one expansion (m=1) if we interpret the problem differently? The problem states:\n\n   Step1: connect center to k new vertices (this is the first expansion, so now we have 1+k vertices).\n   Then, the step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So we must do at least one more expansion (m=2). Therefore, the minimal expansion is two expansions (so m=2, meaning two layers beyond the center? Actually, the center is the base, then the first expansion is layer1, and then the second expansion is layer2). Then the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we start with the center, then we do the first expansion (center to k) and then we do the step (expanding the leaves) at least once. So the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n But note: what if we do more than two layers? Then we can have:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)   for m>=2.\n\n However, there is another possibility: the problem does not specify the number of layers, so we are free to choose k and m (with m>=2). But note: k must be an integer greater than 1.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use the same k throughout? Actually, no, k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\n However, we can also consider that the process might not necessarily go to completion at the same k? Actually, no: the process is defined by a fixed k.\n\n But wait, is there an alternative way to get n? The problem does not say we have to use all layers. It just says that the process is done at least once (meaning the first expansion and then the expansion step at least once). However, the problem does not specify the total number of expansions. So we can have any number of expansions (at least two: the center expansion and one more).\n\n Therefore, the problem is: Does there exist an integer k>1 and an integer m>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n However, note: the series expansion is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n and m>=2 (so m is at least 2, meaning we have at least three terms: 1, k, k^2).\n\n But note: the problem also allows having more than two layers? Yes, so m can be 2, 3, 4, ... until the total n exceeds the given n.\n\n However, note that n can be as large as 10^18, so we cannot iterate over m for each test case (since m could be very large, but note that k must be at least 2, and the growth is exponential, so m won't be too large).\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n for some m>=2 and k>=2.\n\n But note: there is another representation: the entire snowflake can be built with different k for different layers? No, k is fixed.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that the entire graph is built by expanding from the center and the leaves. It is built by always using k. So k is fixed.\n\n But wait, is there a way to represent n without requiring the entire geometric series? \n\n Another idea: we know that the minimal representation is 1+k+k^2. Then we can also have 1+k+k^2+k^3, etc.\n\n However, note that n can be represented in multiple ways (different k and m). We need to check for any k>1 and m>=2.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire graph to be built by the above process. It only requires that the graph is built by the rules. And the rules require a fixed k and at least two expansions (so m>=2).\n\n So we are to check: Is n equal to the sum of a geometric series with base k (integer, k>=2) and at least 3 terms (so m>=2, hence exponent goes up to k^m, and the series has m+1 terms, so m+1>=3)? \n\n But note: the series has m+1 terms (from exponent 0 to m). Since m>=2, the series has at least 3 terms.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire graph is built by the above process. It only requires that the graph exists. The graph is defined by the process. So the condition is that n must be expressible as:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integers k>1 and m>=2.\n\n But note: there is one more possibility: what if we break the process in the middle? Actually, the process is defined to be done at least once (the expansion step after the center expansion). But we can stop at any expansion. However, the structure is fixed: the center, then k, then k^2, then k^3, etc.\n\n Therefore, the problem is to check if there exists an integer k>=2 and an integer m>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n However, note: we can also consider m=1 (which would give 1+k) but the problem requires at least one expansion (so m>=2). So we don't consider m=1.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", and the step is the expansion from the leaves. The leaves from the center expansion are the k nodes. So we must expand at least one leaf, meaning we must have at least two layers (the center, the first ring of k, and the second ring of k^2). So m (the highest exponent) must be at least 2.\n\n However, note: the formula for the geometric series is:\n\n        S = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n and m is the exponent of the last term. So when m=2, we have:\n\n        S = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2.\n\n So yes.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use the entire series. However, the process is defined to build the entire graph by these expansions. So we must use the entire series.\n\n How to check for a given n?\n\n We cannot iterate over k from 2 to ... (k can be as large as n^(1/2) or something) because n can be up to 10^18.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We note that the minimal value for a given k is 1+k+k^2. For k=2: 1+2+4=7; k=3: 1+3+9=13; k=4: 1+4+16=21; k=5: 1+5+25=31, etc.\n\n   Also, we can have more layers. For example, for k=2 and m=3: 1+2+4+8=15; for k=2 and m=4: 1+2+4+8+16=31.\n\n   We see that numbers like 15, 31, etc. are also triangular numbers (in base 2). \n\n   Observation: The equation is n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>=2 and m>=2.\n\n   We can also write: n = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... )) with m+1 terms.\n\n   Another observation: since m>=2, the minimal n for a fixed k is 1+k+k^2, and the next is 1+k+k^2+k^3, etc.\n\n   We can try to fix the base k. Note that k must be at least 2 and the exponent m+1 must be at least 3 (since m>=2, then m+1>=3). \n\n   How to relate n and k? We know that k^3 <= n (because the minimal for k is 1+k+k^2, which is less than k^3 for k>=2? Actually, 1+k+k^2 < k^3 for k>=3, but for k=2: 1+2+4=7 and 2^3=8 -> so 7<8. For k=3: 1+3+9=13, 3^3=27, so 13<27. So in general, the minimal n for k is about k^2 (if m=2) and for higher m, it is about k^m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider that the representation of n in base k is a string of (m+1) ones. For example:\n\n        In base k: n = 1...1 (m+1 ones)\n\n        Then, n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   So we can iterate over the possible bases k, but k can be as large as n^(1/3) (if m=2, then n ~ k^2, so k ~ sqrt(n); if m=3, then n ~ k^3, so k ~ n^(1/3)). However, note that n can be 10^18, so the maximum k we need to check for m=2 is about 1e9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n   We need a smarter way.\n\n   Another idea: note that the representation of n in base k is a sequence of (m+1) ones. Therefore, we can try to factorize n-1? Or consider the equation:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n        => n*(k-1) = k^(m+1)-1\n\n   So k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   We can also consider: for a fixed m (number of expansions, so m>=2, then exponent t=m+1>=3), we can solve for k:\n\n        k^t = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   Then, we can iterate over t from 3 up to ... (what is the maximum t? Since k>=2, then n>=2^t-1/(k-1) and k>=2, so n is at least 2^t - something. The maximum t is such that 2^t <= n*(k-1)+1. But k is at least 2, so n*(k-1)+1 >= 2*n. So t must be at most log2(n). Since n can be up to 10^18, log2(10^18) is about 60. So we can iterate t from 3 to about 60 (if we consider base 2, then the exponent t is at most 60). However, k can be larger than 2, so the exponent t might be even smaller.\n\n   Alternatively, we can fix t (the exponent, which is m+1, so t>=3) and then solve for k in the equation:\n\n        k^t = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   Rearranged:\n\n        k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   But note: the equation is:\n\n        k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n   We can solve for k by trying to find an integer root. But note: k must be an integer >=2.\n\n   However, note: the equation is:\n\n        k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   This is a polynomial equation in k. But t can be up to 60, and we cannot iterate k for each t because k might be very large.\n\n   Another idea: note that the representation in base k is a string of t ones (because the geometric series has t terms, from k^0 to k^(t-1)). Then, we have:\n\n        n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   So:\n\n        n*(k-1) = k^t - 1\n\n   Then, k^t = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   We can consider: for a fixed t (from 3 to about 60), we want to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n        k^t = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   Then, we can rearrange:\n\n        k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   We can solve for k by considering that k must be a divisor of (n-1) in the equation? Not exactly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider that k divides (n-1) in the following way? \n\n        From k^t = n*k - (n-1) + 1   -> wait, no.\n\n   But note: we can consider the equation modulo (k-1):\n\n        k ≡ 1 (mod k-1)\n        Then, k^t ≡ 1^t ≡ 1 (mod k-1)\n        and n*k - n + 1 = n*(k-1)+1 ≡ 0+1 ≡ 1 (mod k-1)\n\n        So it holds.\n\n   That doesn't help.\n\n   However, note that k is roughly n^(1/t) because if k is the base, then k^t is approximately n*(k) (if t is large, then k^t dominates). So k is roughly the t-th root of n*k, which is circular.\n\n   But we can bound k: \n\n        Since k^t = n*k - n + 1, then for k>=2, we have:\n\n        k^t < n*k   (because n*k - n + 1 < n*k)\n\n        => k^(t-1) < n\n\n        So k < n^(1/(t-1))\n\n   Similarly, from k^t = n*k - n + 1, we have:\n\n        k^t <= n*k   => k^(t-1) <= n\n\n        and also, k^t >= n*k - n + 1 >= n*k - n   (since n>=1)\n\n        => k^t + n >= n*k\n\n        => k^t >= n*k - n\n\n   But we can use the bound: k <= floor(n^(1/(t-1)))\n\n   Then, for each t from 3 to 60 (or until n^(1/(t-1)) < 2, we can try k from 2 to floor(n^(1/(t-1))) and check if k^t == n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   But note: the equation is k^t = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   However, the exponent t can be as large as 60, and n is up to 10^18. The t-th root of n is about (10^18)^(1/60) which is around 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ~ 2, so for t=60, k must be 2. Then we can check k=2 for t=60.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For a given test case with n:\n\n        If n==1: then we cannot have k>1 and at least two expansions? Actually, the minimal n for any k is at least 7 (for k=2). But note: the minimal n is 1+k+k^2, so for k=2:7, k=3:13, etc. So n=1 is not valid. Similarly, n=2,3,...,6 are not valid.\n\n        We can handle small n by checking: if n<7, then we can immediately output \"NO\".\n\n        But note: what if n=7? Then k=2 and m=2: 1+2+4=7 -> valid.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the expansion step must be done at least once. The expansion step is the second expansion (from the leaves). So the minimal n is 1+k+k^2. For k=2, n=7; k=3, n=13; k=4, n=21, etc.\n\n        But wait, what if we consider only two layers (m=2) then n=7 is valid.\n\n        However, note: we can also have more layers. For example, n=15: \n            k=2, m=3: 1+2+4+8=15 -> valid.\n            k=3, m=2: 1+3+9=13 (not 15); k=4, m=2: 1+4+16=21 -> not 15.\n\n        So n=15 is valid because of k=2 and m=3.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider all m>=2 (i.e., exponents t from 3 to ...).\n\n        Algorithm for one test case:\n\n        If n < 7: then output \"NO\"\n\n        Otherwise, we consider t from 3 to floor(log2(n))+1 (because the maximum t is when k=2, then 2^t = n*(2-1)+1 = n+1, so t <= log2(n+1)). But note: k might be larger than 2, so t can be smaller.\n\n        However, we can set t from 3 to 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18, so for k=2, t can be up to about 60). For each t:\n\n            We know k must be at least 2 and at most floor(n^(1/(t-1))). But we can also note that k must satisfy:\n\n                k^t = n*(k-1)+1\n\n            We can try to compute k by solving the equation. However, we can also note that k must be an integer, and the equation is:\n\n                k^t = n*k - n + 1\n\n            We can rearrange:\n\n                k^t - n*k + n - 1 = 0\n\n            But we can also consider: \n\n                k^t - n*k + n - 1 = 0\n\n            We can try to find k by binary search? But k is bounded by [2, floor(n^(1/(t-1)))].\n\n            However, note: k^t is at least 2^t (if k>=2) and we know n is at least 7, so t is at most 60. We can iterate k from 2 to min(10**6, n^(1/(t-1))) ? But n can be 10^18 and t=3, then k_max is about 1e6 (because (1e6)^3=1e18). So for t=3, we iterate k from 2 to 10^6? That is 10^6 iterations per test case, and t goes up to 60, so total iterations 60 * 10^6 per test case. But we have up to 10^4 test cases -> 10^4 * 60 * 10^6 = 6e12, which is too slow.\n\n        We need a better approach.\n\n        Let's change the perspective:\n\n        We note that n = (k^t - 1) / (k-1)\n\n        Then, n*(k-1) = k^t - 1.\n\n        Then, k^t = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can also write: k^t - 1 = n*(k-1)\n\n        Then, (k^t - 1) is divisible by (k-1). This is true because k^t - 1 = (k-1)*(k^(t-1) + k^(t-2)+...+1).\n\n        So we are looking for an integer k>=2 and an integer t>=3 such that:\n\n            k^t = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        We can iterate over t from 3 to 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18, and n<=10^18, so t cannot exceed 60). For each t, we want to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n            k^t = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        Rearranged:\n\n            k^t - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        This is a polynomial equation in k. We can use the fact that k is an integer and the equation is strictly increasing for k>=1 (for fixed t) to do a binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n^(1/(t-1)))].\n\n        However, note: n can be as large as 10^18, and t can be as large as 60, so the upper bound for k is about n^(1/(t-1)). For t=3, that's about 10^6, for t=4, about 10^4.5, and so on. The maximum t is 60, then k is at most about 2 (because 2^60 is 1e18, so for t=60, k can be at most about 2). \n\n        Steps for fixed t:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = min(10**7, int(round(n**(1/(t-1)))) + 1   # but careful: we don't want to set high too high.\n\n        However, note: k^t = n*k - n + 1. For k too large, k^t grows faster than n*k, so we can set an upper bound: k^t <= n*k (because the right side is n*k - n+1 < n*k for n>=2). Then k^(t-1) < n. So k < n**(1/(t-1)).\n\n        We can set:\n\n            high = int(n**(1/(t-1))) + 10   # but we must be cautious: n**(1/(t-1)) might not be integer.\n\n        But note: we are going to iterate k from 2 to high, and for each k, we check if k^t == n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        However, for t=3, the range [2, n^(1/2)] is [2, 1e9] for n=10^18, which is too many to iterate (1e9 per t, and t from 3 to 60 -> 1e9*58 ~ 58e9 iterations per test case, which is too slow for 10^4 test cases).\n\n        We need to avoid iterating over k for each t.\n\n        Alternative: for fixed t, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n**(1/(t-1)))] (but note: we have to compute k^t, which is an integer, and we have to compare with n*(k-1)+1. But the range for k might be very large for small t (like t=3: k from 2 to 1e9). We can use binary search to find k such that k^t = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        However, the equation is not linear. But we can use binary search because the function f(k)=k^t is increasing and g(k)=n*(k-1)+1 is increasing (for fixed n and t). So we can set:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = min(10**7, int(n**(1/(t-1)))+10   # but wait, for t=3, n=10^18, then high = 10^9, which is too big for binary search? Actually, we can set high = int(n**(1/(t-1)))+10, but for t=3, n=10^18, then high = 10^9+10, and then binary search runs in O(log(10^9)) which is about 30 steps. But wait, we are doing this for each t from 3 to 60. And for each t, we do about 30 iterations. Then for each iteration, we compute k^t and n*(k-1)+1. But k^t for k=10^9 and t=3 is (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is too big for Python integers? Actually, n is up to 10^18, so we are comparing 10^27 with 10^18 * (10^9-1)+1 -> which is about 10^27, so we can compute k^t, but note: k can be as large as 10^9 and t=3, so k^t is 10^27, which is acceptable in Python? But for t=4 and k=10^5, then k^t is 10^20, which is acceptable. For t=5 and k=10^4, then 10^20 again. But for t=60 and k=2, then 2^60 is about 1e18, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem is that the range for k (from 2 to n^(1/(t-1)) can be huge for small t (like t=3, then k from 2 to 10^9). But we are using binary search so we only do about 30 iterations per t. So for each t, we do 30 iterations, and each iteration we compute two things:\n\n            candidate1 = k**t\n            candidate2 = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        Then check if candidate1 == candidate2.\n\n        Then, we do this for t from 3 to 60 (about 58 values of t) and for each t we do 30 iterations, so 58*30 = 1740 iterations per test case.\n\n        Then, for 10^4 test cases, the total iterations would be 10^4 * 1740 = 17.4e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: we must be cautious because for large k (like 10^9) and t=3, we compute k**t which is (10^9)**3 = 10^27, which is a very big integer, but Python can handle integers of arbitrary size (though it might be slower). But 17.4e6 computations of exponentiation (even of big integers) might be heavy.\n\n        We can optimize by breaking early for t: if t is too large such that 2^t > n*(2-1)+1 (which is n+1) then we can break. But note: we are iterating t from 3 to 60, and 60 is fixed.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the t loop if the minimal k (which is 2) already produces a value for k^t that is greater than n*(2-1)+1 (i.e., n+1). But note: k^t for k=2 and t is increasing, and for fixed n, when t is too large, 2^t will exceed n+1. So we can set:\n\n            t_min = 3\n            t_max = min(60, floor(log(n+1, 2)) + 1)   [because 2^t <= n+1]\n\n        But note: the equation is k^t = n*(k-1)+1, and k>=2, so the left side is at least 2^t, so we require 2^t <= n+1.\n\n        So for a fixed n, we can set:\n\n            t_max = min(60, floor(log2(n+1))) + 1\n\n        Then, the number of t values is from 3 to t_max.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute t_max = min(60, floor(log2(n+1))) + 1   (if n+1>=2^3, then t_max at least 3)\n\n            Then, for t from 3 to t_max (inclusive):\n\n                low = 2\n                high = min(10**7, int(n**(1/(t-1))) + 10   # but wait, n**(1/(t-1)) might be fractional. We can set high = int(n**(1/(t-1))) + 10, but we must ensure that we don't miss the solution.\n\n                However, we know k must be <= n**(1/(t-1)) (because k^(t-1) <= n, from k^t <= n*k). But note: from the equation, k^t = n*(k-1)+1, and for k>=2, k^t <= n*k (since n*(k-1)+1 < n*k). Then k^(t-1) < n, so k < n**(1/(t-1)).\n\n                We can set:\n\n                    high = min(10**7, int(n**(1/(t-1))) + 10)\n\n                But wait: sometimes n**(1/(t-1)) might be fractional and we want to include the integer part. However, we are doing binary search, so we can set:\n\n                    low = 2\n                    high = 10**7   # but 10**7 is 10 million, and for t=3, n=10^18, then n**(1/2)=10^9, so we set high = min(10**7, ...) which caps high at 10 million. But wait, if n=10^18, then for t=3, the k we are looking for might be up to 10^9, and 10^9 is greater than 10^7. So we cannot cap at 10**7.\n\n                Instead, we can set:\n\n                    high = 10**7   # but then we might miss solutions for k > 10**7.\n\n                But note: if k is large (like 10^9) then t must be small (like 3) because for t=3, k^t = (10^9)^3 = 10^27, and n is 10^18, then n*(k-1)+1 is 10^18 * (10^9-1) + 1, which is about 10^27, so it matches. But if we set high=10**7, then we would miss k=10^9.\n\n                So we must set high to at least n**(1/(t-1)), but that value might be too high for small t.\n\n                However, note: we are only iterating t from 3 to t_max (which is at most 60). For each t, we set:\n\n                    high = min(10**18, int(n**(1/(t-1))) + 10)   # but",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a central vertex, and each subsequent layer adds vertices connected to the vertices in the previous layer. The key observation is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be the sum of a geometric series with base \\( k > 1 \\) and at least three terms (since the minimal snowflake requires at least two expansions beyond the central vertex).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph's vertex count \\( n \\) must satisfy \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\). This sum is equivalent to \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n2. **Key Insight**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that the equation holds. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we can limit our search by considering possible values of \\( m \\) (the exponent) from 3 to a maximum where \\( k^m \\) does not exceed \\( n \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, iterate over possible exponents \\( t \\) (where \\( t = m + 1 \\geq 3 \\)) up to a logarithmic bound (since \\( 2^t \\) must be less than or equal to \\( n \\)). For each \\( t \\), use binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( k^t = n \\times (k - 1) + 1 \\). The binary search range for \\( k \\) is from 2 to \\( n^{1/(t-1)} \\), ensuring we cover all potential solutions without excessive computation.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks each test case by leveraging binary search over a limited range of exponents and bases. The number of operations per test case is kept low by bounding the search space based on the logarithmic growth of \\( k^t \\) relative to \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import log2\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    tests = [int(x) for x in data[1:1+t]]\n    \n    results = []\n    for n in tests:\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        t_max_val = min(60, math.floor(log2(n + 1)) + 1)\n        found = False\n        \n        for t_exp in range(3, t_max_val + 1):\n            low = 2\n            high = None\n            \n            try:\n                root_bound = n ** (1 / (t_exp - 1))\n            except:\n                root_bound = 10**18\n                \n            if root_bound < 2:\n                high = 2\n            else:\n                high = int(root_bound) + 10\n                high = min(high, 10**7 + 10)\n            \n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                left_side = pow(mid, t_exp)\n                right_side = n * (mid - 1) + 1\n                \n                if left_side == right_side:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif left_side < right_side:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Handling Small \\( n \\)**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph (since the smallest valid \\( n \\) is 7 for \\( k = 2 \\)), so the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each test case, the algorithm checks possible exponents \\( t \\) (from 3 to a logarithmic bound).
