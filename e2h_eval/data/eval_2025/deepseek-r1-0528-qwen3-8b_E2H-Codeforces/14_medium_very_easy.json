    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The function for trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n We are given an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) and we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros function Z(n) is non-decreasing. But note: it is a step function that increases at multiples of 5.\n\n Observation:\n   For a fixed m, we are looking for n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: if Z(n) = m, then for n from a to b-1, the value might be m? Actually, the trailing zeros function stays constant over consecutive numbers until a multiple of 5 (or higher power) is reached.\n\n However, note that once the trailing zeros reach m, they will not decrease. So:\n\n   Let f(n) = trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   We are to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. First, we need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. This is the first n where the trailing zeros become at least m.\n\n    But actually, we are interested in the range [L, R] such that for all n in [L, R], f(n) = m, and then check if there is a contiguous block of numbers with the same m.\n\n However, note: the trailing zeros function only increases when n is a multiple of 5 (or higher powers). So:\n\n   Example: \n      m=1 -> n=5,6,7,8,9: because 5! has 1 zero, and 6!,7!,8!,9! also have 1 zero (since 10 hasn't been reached).\n\n  How to compute the smallest n such that f(n) >= m?\n\n    We can do a binary search for the minimal n0 such that f(n0) >= m.\n\n    Then, we also need to find the maximal n such that f(n) == m? Actually, the next jump (the next multiple of 5) will increase the trailing zeros.\n\n    Specifically, let L be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and then we must check if f(L) is indeed m. But note: the function f(n) jumps by more than one sometimes (e.g., when n is a multiple of 25, it jumps by 2). So we cannot assume that the entire block from L to L+4 has m trailing zeros.\n\n    Actually, the trailing zeros remain constant from n = L to n = the next multiple of 5 minus 1. But wait, what if the jump is more than 1?\n\n    Example: m=2. The smallest n such that f(n)>=2 is n=10 (because 10! has 2 zeros). But then at n=10, the trailing zeros jump from 1 (at n=9) to 2 (at n=10). Then at n=11,12,13,14,15: \n        n=15: f(15)=3 (because 15//5=3, 15//25=0 -> 3). So the numbers with exactly 2 trailing zeros are from 10 to 14.\n\n    So the idea:\n\n        Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this L.\n        Step 2: Check if f(L) == m. If not, then there is no solution? Actually, if m is not achieved, then the answer is 0.\n\n        But note: the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5, and by the amount of the highest power of 5 dividing (n+1) or something? Actually, the jump at n=k (when k is a multiple of 5) is the number of times 5 divides k (plus the contributions from other multiples).\n\n        However, note that we defined f(n) as the total number of 5s. So the jump from n-1 to n (if n is divisible by 5) is the exponent of 5 in n.\n\n        But wait, we don't need to break down the jump. We just need to know the set of n with f(n)=m.\n\n        Actually, the set of n with f(n)=m is the set of n such that:\n            f(n) = m and f(n+1) = m, unless n+1 causes a jump (then f(n+1) > m).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Let L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n            Then the upper bound R is the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then the numbers n with exactly m zeros are from L to R-1, but wait: we must ensure that at L the value is exactly m.\n\n        However, it is possible that f(L) > m? Then we must adjust.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n            L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n            Then, we want the largest n such that f(n) <= m? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n            Let R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then, the numbers n with exactly m zeros are from L to R-1.\n\n        Why? Because for n in [L, R-1], the trailing zeros are at least m (by definition of L) and less than m+1 (by definition of R). But note: the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing, so if we have L such that f(L)=m, then for all n from L to R-1, f(n)=m? Not necessarily: the function might jump from m to m+k (k>=1) at some point. However, note that R is defined as the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. So for n < R, f(n) < m+1. And since the function is non-decreasing, then for all n in [L, R-1], we have m <= f(n) < m+1. But since f(n) is an integer, then f(n)=m.\n\n        However, we must ensure that f(L) is at least m, and then the next jump (if any) happens at R, so from L to R-1, the trailing zeros are exactly m.\n\n        But wait: what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n        Therefore, the solution:\n\n            Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n            Step 2: Find R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n            Then, the numbers are all n in [L, R-1]. However, we must check: is it possible that L is already beyond R-1? Actually, no, because if m>=1 then R is defined and L<=R.\n\n        But note: we must verify that the entire interval [L, R-1] has exactly m zeros. Yes, because:\n            - At L, f(L) >= m, and since R is the first n with f(n)>=m+1, then for n in [L, R-1], f(n) is at least m and less than m+1, so exactly m.\n\n        However, what if there is no n such that f(n) >= m+1? That is, if m is the maximum? Then R would be infinity? But our m is at most 100000, and we can compute R for m+1 up to 100001.\n\n        But note: the problem says m between 1 and 100000, so we can safely compute for m+1.\n\n        However, we must design the function f(n) to handle large n. How to compute f(n) without causing overflow?\n\n        We know that the maximum n we might need to consider is around (m * 5) maybe? Actually, we can use binary search to find L and R, and the function f(n) is O(log_5 n).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Define a function count_trailing_zeros(n):\n              count = 0\n              divisor = 5\n              while divisor <= n:\n                  count += n // divisor\n                  divisor *= 5\n\n          Then, we do:\n\n          low, high = 0, 5*m  # we know that n! has at least m zeros when n>=5*m (actually, n needs to be around 5*m, but sometimes more because of higher powers)\n          Actually, we can set high to 5*m (but sometimes we might need more). Alternatively, we can set high to a very large number, but we are only going to do logarithmic steps.\n\n          To find L (smallest n with f(n) >= m):\n\n            low, high = 0, 5*m  # we know that at n=5*m, the trailing zeros are at least m (because floor(5*m/5)=m, and then more from higher powers, so yes).\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n                    high = mid\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n            L = low\n\n          Similarly, for R (smallest n with f(n) >= m+1):\n\n            low, high = 0, 5*(m+1)  # again, we know that at n=5*(m+1) we have at least m+1 zeros? Actually, floor((5*(m+1))/5)=m+1, so yes.\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m+1:\n                    high = mid\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n            R = low\n\n          Then, the numbers n with exactly m zeros are from L to R-1.\n\n          The count of such n is (R - L).\n\n          But note: the problem asks for the number of such n (which is k = R-L) and then the list of these n (if k>0) in increasing order.\n\n          However, if m is very large, then R might be very large, and we cannot output a list of all n from L to R-1 (if the range is huge). \n\n          But note the problem constraints: m is up to 100000. Then the numbers n we are talking about are in the range [L, R-1] which is at most 5 numbers? Actually, no: the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5, so the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros are at most 4 (from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5 minus one). \n\n          Wait, let me check:\n\n            Example: m=1 -> n from 5 to 9 (5 numbers)\n            Example: m=2 -> n from 10 to 14 (5 numbers)\n\n          Actually, the trailing zeros remain constant for 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n          But note: the jump in trailing zeros happens at multiples of 5. So the trailing zeros are constant from a multiple of 5 (say 5*k) to 5*k+4, and then at 5*k+5 (i.e., 5*(k+1)) the trailing zeros jump by the exponent of 5 in (k+1) (if k+1 is divisible by 5, then even more).\n\n          However, the length of the interval for a fixed m is always 5? \n\n          Actually, no. Consider m=3: \n            n=15: trailing zeros = 3 (floor(15/5)=3, floor(15/25)=0)\n            n=16: same, until n=24: \n            n=25: trailing zeros = floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6 -> so the numbers with 3 zeros are from 15 to 24? Actually, wait:\n\n            Let's compute:\n                n=15: 3\n                n=16: 3\n                n=17: 3\n                n=18: 3\n                n=19: 3\n                n=20: 4 (because 20//5=4, 20//25=0) -> so actually from 15 to 19, then 20 jumps to 4.\n\n            So the numbers for m=3 are 15,16,17,18,19 -> 5 numbers.\n\n          But wait, what about m=6?\n            The smallest n such that trailing zeros >=6: \n                n=25: 6, so L=25.\n            Then the next jump: at n=26,27,28,29,30: \n                n=30: trailing zeros = 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1=7 -> so the numbers with 6 zeros are from 25 to 29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n          However, what if m=0? (But m>=1, so skip) but note the example: m=100000, then the numbers are 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n          Actually, the trailing zeros function increases by the exponent of 5 in n (when n is a multiple of 5). So the jump at n=5*k is the exponent of 5 in k (plus the base jump). But the important thing is: the trailing zeros function is constant between multiples of 5. And the jump occurs at multiples of 5. Therefore, the set of n with exactly m trailing zeros is an interval [a, b] (if any) and the length of the interval is 5, except when the next jump is more than one (like at 25, 125, etc.) but note:\n\n            The jump at n=25: \n                f(24) = 4 (because 24//5=4, 24//25=0)\n                f(25) = 6 (because 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> 5+1=6)\n\n            So the numbers with 5 trailing zeros? \n                We need to check: \n                    Find L such that f(L)>=5: \n                        n=20: 4, n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so there is no n with 5 trailing zeros.\n\n            Therefore, for m=5, there is no solution.\n\n          So the algorithm above for finding L and R still holds, but we must note that the set of n with exactly m zeros might be empty (if there is no n with f(n)=m). \n\n          Example: m=5 -> we found L = 25 (because f(24)=4 <5, f(25)=6>=5), and then R = smallest n with f(n)>=6 -> which is 25. Then the interval is [25,25) i.e., empty.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            L = smallest n with f(n)>=m\n            R = smallest n with f(n)>=m+1\n\n            Then, if f(L) != m (which happens if the jump at L was more than needed, i.e., if f(L) > m) then the interval [L, R-1] is empty? Actually, no: because if f(L) >= m, and if f(L) > m, then there is no n with f(n)=m. Because the next jump is at R (and R is the first n with f(n)>=m+1, so from L to R-1, the trailing zeros are at least m and less than m+1, but if f(L) is already greater than m, then the condition fails).\n\n          Actually, the definition of L is the smallest n with f(n)>=m. Then the trailing zeros at L is at least m. But if at L the trailing zeros is greater than m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros. \n\n          However, note: the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5. So if we have a jump of more than one (say from 4 to 6, skipping 5) then we never hit 5. \n\n          Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is non-empty if and only if the smallest n with f(n)>=m satisfies f(n)==m.\n\n          But wait: our method using two binary searches does not require checking that. We can simply compute the interval [L, R-1] and then the numbers in that interval are the ones with exactly m zeros. However, if L is such that f(L) > m, then the interval [L, R-1] is non-empty (because R is defined and L<R) but the trailing zeros are at least f(L) which is >m, so they are not equal to m.\n\n          Actually, the definition of R is the smallest n such that f(n)>=m+1. Then for n in [L, R-1], we have m <= f(n) < m+1. But if f(L) > m, then the condition m<=f(n) is satisfied (so the interval is [L, R-1]), but the condition f(n) < m+1 is also satisfied. However, we want exactly m. But if f(L) is greater than m, then we don't have any n in [L, R-1] with f(n)=m.\n\n          Therefore, we must check that f(L)==m. Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing and only takes integer values. Then the set {n: f(n)=m} is either empty or an interval [L, R-1] and in that interval f(n)=m.\n\n          But wait, if the function jumps from below m to above m (without hitting m) then the set is empty.\n\n          So:\n\n            Step 1: Find L = smallest n with f(n)>=m.\n            Step 2: Find R = smallest n with f(n)>=m+1.\n\n            Now, if f(L) != m, then there is no n such that f(n)=m.\n\n          However, note that the function f(n) is computed by counting the factors of 5. It is non-decreasing and increases only at multiples of 5. The value at L is the first time we get at least m. So if f(L) > m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            Let L = smallest n with f(n)>=m\n            Let R = smallest n with f(n)>=m+1\n\n            If f(L) != m:\n                Then k = 0, and we output \"0\"\n\n            Else:\n                k = R - L\n                Then we output the list of numbers from L to R-1.\n\n          But note: the list of numbers from L to R-1 might be very large if the interval is long. However, we saw that the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5, so the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros are at most 4 numbers? Actually, no: the trailing zeros function is constant over a block of 5 numbers (from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5 minus one). So the maximum length of the interval [L, R-1] is 5? \n\n          However, wait: the jump at n=25: \n            f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so the numbers with 4 zeros are from 20 to 24 (5 numbers) and then 5 zeros? There is no n with 5 zeros. Similarly, the numbers with 6 zeros start at 25 and go until 29 (5 numbers).\n\n          But note: the jump at n=125 (which is 5^3) is even bigger: \n            f(124)=24 (because 124//5=24, 124//25=4, 124//125=0 -> 24+4=28? Let me compute properly:\n\n            Actually, the correct way: \n                f(124) = 124//5 + 124//25 + 124//125 + ... \n                124//5 = 24\n                124//25 = 4\n                124//125 = 0\n                so 24+4=28.\n\n            Then f(125) = 125//5 + 125//25 + 125//125 = 25+5+1=31.\n\n            So the jump from 124 to 125 is 3 (from 28 to 31). Then the numbers with 28 zeros are from 120 to 124? Let's check:\n\n            How many zeros in 120! to 124!?\n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n\n                n=120: \n                    120//5=24, 120//25=4, 120//125=0 -> 28.\n                n=121: same as 120? Actually, no: 121 is not divisible by 5, so no change. Similarly, 122,123,124: same.\n\n            Then n=125: 31.\n\n            So the numbers with 28 zeros are from 120 to 124 (5 numbers).\n\n          Therefore, the length of the interval [L, R-1] is always 5, unless the next jump is at the same n (which it isn't because R is defined as the first n with at least m+1, and if L is the first n with at least m, then the next jump is at R, so the numbers from L to R-1 are consecutive and the length is (R-L) which is the gap between two multiples of 5? \n\n          Actually, the gap between two consecutive multiples of 5 is 5. But note: L might not be a multiple of 5. However, the trailing zeros function only changes at multiples of 5. So the first n where the trailing zeros becomes m is a multiple of 5? Not necessarily. \n\n          Example: m=1 -> L=5 (multiple of 5). m=2 -> L=10 (multiple of 5). m=3 -> L=15 (multiple of 5). m=4 -> L=20 (multiple of 5). m=6 -> L=25 (multiple of 5). \n\n          But wait, what about m=0? We don't consider, but if m=0, then the smallest n with f(n)>=0 is 0, but then 0! is defined as 1, which has 0 zeros. Then the numbers with 0 zeros are from 0 to 4. But the problem says positive integers, so n>=1. However, m>=1.\n\n          Actually, the problem says positive integers n. So n>=1.\n\n          Therefore, we can conclude that the smallest n with f(n)>=m is always a multiple of 5? \n\n          Why? Because the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5. So if we haven't reached m at a multiple of 5, we keep going until the next multiple of 5. But note: the function f(n) is constant on intervals between multiples of 5. So the minimal n achieving at least m must be a multiple of 5.\n\n          Therefore, L is a multiple of 5, and then the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5) is R (if the jump at L gives at least m, then the next jump is at L+5). However, wait: the jump at L (if L is a multiple of 5) is the exponent of 5 in L. But the next jump is at L+5? Not necessarily, because the next jump is the next multiple of 5, which is L+5.\n\n          Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is [L, L+4] (if the jump at L is exactly m, then the next jump is at L+5, so the trailing zeros stay m until L+4). \n\n          But wait, what if the jump at L is more than m? Then the minimal n is L, and the next jump is at L (if L is a multiple of 25, then the jump is more than 1) but we already defined L as the minimal n with f(n)>=m. \n\n          Actually, the key is: the minimal n is L, and then the next jump (which increases the trailing zeros) is at the next multiple of 5 (which is L+5) unless L is the last multiple of 5 (but we are considering positive integers, and we are doing binary search). \n\n          However, note: the function f(n) is constant for n in [L, L+4] (if L is a multiple of 5). Then at L+5, the trailing zeros jump again (by the exponent of 5 in (L+5)). \n\n          Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is [L, L+4] (if f(L)==m) and then at L+5 the trailing zeros become f(L)+exponent_of_5_in(L+5) (which is >= m+1). \n\n          But wait, we defined R as the smallest n such that f(n)>=m+1. Is R always L+5? \n\n          Example: m=1 -> L=5, then R = smallest n with f(n)>=2: \n              f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2 -> so R=10, which is L+5.\n\n          Example: m=2 -> L=10, then R= smallest n with f(n)>=3: \n              f(10)=2, f(11)=2, f(12)=2, f(13)=2, f(14)=2, f(15)=3 -> R=15, which is L+5.\n\n          Example: m=5 -> no solution, but let's see: \n              We found L=25 (since f(24)=4, f(25)=6). Then R= smallest n with f(n)>=6 -> which is 25. Then the interval [25,24] is empty.\n\n          But wait, what if the jump is more than one? For example, if m=4: \n              L: smallest n with f(n)>=4 -> \n                n=20: f(20)=4 -> so L=20.\n              Then R= smallest n with f(n)>=5 -> \n                f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so R=25.\n\n          Then the numbers with exactly 4 zeros are from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). But wait, we said that the trailing zeros at 20 is 4, and then at 25 it becomes 6. So the numbers 20,21,22,23,24 have 4 zeros.\n\n          Now, note that the jump at 25 is from 4 to 6, so we skipped 5. But 4 is still present.\n\n          Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is always a contiguous block of 5 numbers (if it exists) unless the jump at the beginning of the block skips over m.\n\n          However, we must account for the fact that the minimal n (L) is a multiple of 5, and then the next jump is 5 units away (at L+5). But what if the minimal n is not a multiple of 5? \n\n          Actually, we proved that the minimal n must be a multiple of 5 because the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5, and the value before a multiple of 5 is the same as the previous one. Therefore, the minimal n is the first multiple of 5 that gives at least m.\n\n          But note: the trailing zeros function is constant in the interval [5*k, 5*k+4] for each k. So the minimal n must be a multiple of 5.\n\n          Therefore, we can say:\n\n            If there is a solution, then the numbers are: [L, L+4] (5 numbers) and L is a multiple of 5.\n\n          But wait, what if the minimal n is not a multiple of 5? \n\n          Example: m=3, L=15 (multiple of 5). \n\n          Another example: m=0 (not applicable). \n\n          Therefore, the solution:\n\n            Use binary search to find L (minimal n with f(n)>=m) and R (minimal n with f(n)>=m+1).\n\n            Then, if f(L) != m, output 0.\n\n            Else, output the numbers from L to min(R-1, L+4) ??? \n\n          Wait, no: because the trailing zeros function is constant from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one, and the next multiple of 5 is L+5 (since L is a multiple of 5). But note: we defined R as the minimal n with f(n)>=m+1, so the trailing zeros at R is at least m+1. However, the trailing zeros might jump more than one at L+5 (if L+5 is a multiple of 25, then the jump is more). But note: we are defining R as the minimal n with at least m+1. So R is the first n where the trailing zeros becomes at least m+1, which might be earlier than L+5 if the jump at L+5 is more than one? Actually, no: because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. So the next change is at L+5, and then the value becomes f(L) + (the exponent of 5 in (L+5)) [but note: the function f(n) is cumulative, so it's the total factors of 5 from 1 to n].\n\n          Actually, the value at L+5 is f(L) plus the exponent of 5 in (L+5). But note: L is a multiple of 5, so L+5 is the next multiple of 5. The exponent of 5 in (L+5) is at least 1. \n\n          However, we defined R as the smallest n with f(n)>=m+1. Since at L we have f(L)=m, and then the next change is at L+5, then at L+5 the value becomes f(L+5) = f(L) + (number of 5s in (L+5))? Actually, no: the function f(n) is defined as the sum_{k>=1} floor(n/5^k). \n\n          Example: L=20, then L+5=25. \n            f(20)=4, f(25)=6.\n\n          So the jump is 2. Then the minimal n with f(n)>=5 is 25? But wait, we defined R as the minimal n with f(n)>=5. Then R=25.\n\n          Then the numbers with 4 zeros are from 20 to 24, which is 5 numbers.\n\n          But then how do we know the upper bound? \n\n          Actually, the set of n with exactly m zeros is the set of n from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one, unless the next multiple of 5 causes the trailing zeros to jump above m+1 (but we defined R as the first n with at least m+1, so the upper bound is R-1). \n\n          However, note: the trailing zeros function is constant in the entire interval [L, R-1] (because R is the first n where it becomes at least m+1). And the length of the interval is (R - L). \n\n          But we know that the trailing zeros function increases only at multiples of 5, so the next multiple of 5 after L is L+5, and the trailing zeros at L+5 is f(L+5) = f(L) + (the exponent of 5 in (L+5))? Actually, no: the function f(n) is cumulative. The value at n=L+5 is:\n\n            f(L+5) = f(L) + (number of times 5 divides (L+5))? Actually, no: the function f(n) counts the factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to n. The numbers from 1 to L+5 include the numbers 1..L and then L+1 to L+5. The factor contributed by the numbers L+1 to L+5 is the same as the factor from the number L+5 (if we consider that the multiples of 5 are considered) but note: the function f(n) is not linear.\n\n          Actually, the function f(n) is defined by:\n\n            f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...\n\n          So the value at n=L+5 is:\n\n            f(L+5) = (L+5)//5 + (L+5)//25 + (L+5)//125 + ... \n\n          And note: L is a multiple of 5, so L = 5*k, then L+5 = 5*(k+1). Then:\n\n            (L+5)//5 = k+1, and then (L+5)//25 = (k+1)//5, etc.\n\n          This is the standard way to compute.\n\n          But note: we don't need to know the exact value of the interval, we only need to know the upper bound R (the minimal n with f(n)>=m+1). And then the numbers are from L to R-1.\n\n          However, the problem says that m is up to 100000, and the numbers we are dealing with (L and R) can be very large. But the interval [L, R-1] is contiguous, and the length is (R-L). \n\n          But note: the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing and increases only at multiples of 5, so the interval [L, R-1] might be very long? \n\n          Actually, no. Because the trailing zeros function increases by the exponent of 5 in n (at n being a multiple of 5). But the minimal n for which the trailing zeros becomes m+1 is the next multiple of 5 that pushes the total count to m+1. \n\n          However, the set of n with exactly m zeros is the entire block from L to the next multiple of 5 minus one, unless the jump at the next multiple of 5 is so large that it skips m+1? Actually, no: the function f(n) is non-decreasing and only increases at multiples of 5. Therefore, the next increase is at the next multiple of 5 (which is L+5). \n\n          But wait, what if the jump at L (which is a multiple of 5) is more than m? Then we don't have any n with m zeros. \n\n          Actually, we already check that f(L)==m.\n\n          And then the next jump is at L+5, and the value becomes f(L+5) = ?\n\n          Example: m=4, L=20 (which is 5*4). Then f(20)=4, then at 25 (the next multiple of 5) the value becomes 6. Then the minimal n for m+1=5 is 25. Then the numbers with 4 zeros are from 20 to 24 (5 numbers).\n\n          Another example: m=6, L=25 (5*5). Then f(25)=6. Then the next jump is at 30: \n            f(30)= 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1=7. \n            So the minimal n for m+1=7 is 30. Then the numbers with 6 zeros are from 25 to 29 (5 numbers).\n\n          But wait: what if the jump at L is more than one? \n\n          Example: m=5: \n            We need to find L: smallest n with f(n)>=5.\n            n=20: 4 -> not enough.\n            n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so L=25, and f(25)=6 !=5 -> no solution.\n\n          Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is either empty or a contiguous block of 5 numbers.\n\n          But wait: is it always 5? \n\n          Consider: \n            The trailing zeros function is constant from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5 minus",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\), we use binary search. Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( Z(L) = m \\).\n3. **Checking Validity**: If \\( Z(L) \\neq m \\), it means there are no \\( n \\) values that satisfy the condition, and the answer is 0. Otherwise, the valid \\( n \\) values are all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    L = low\n\n    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 2)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m + 1:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    R = low\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, R))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n2. **Binary Search for \\( L \\) and \\( R \\)**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\) and performs binary searches to find the smallest \\( n \\) (L) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) and the smallest \\( n \\) (R) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The binary search bounds are set initially to \\( 5 \\times (m + 1) \\) and \\( 5 \\times (m + 2) \\) respectively to ensure coverage.\n3. **Validation and Output**: After determining \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), the solution checks if \\( Z(L) = m \\). If not, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid \\( n \\) values (which is \\( R - L \\)) and lists them from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to provide the solution.",
