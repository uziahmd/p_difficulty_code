The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then two lists: one of n integers (a_i) for chests and one of m integers (b_j) for keys.\n\n Condition: a chest i can be opened by key j if and only if (a_i + b_j) is odd, i.e., \n   (a_i % 2 == 0 and b_j % 2 == 1) OR (a_i % 2 == 1 and b_j % 2 == 0)\n\n Since one key can open at most one chest and vice versa, we are to find the maximum matching between chests and keys that satisfy the condition.\n\n Observation:\n   The condition depends only on the parity (even/odd) of the numbers.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_count = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_count = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   For even chests: we need odd keys. The maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is min(even_count, odd_keys)\n   For odd chests: we need even keys. The maximum matching from odd chests to even keys is min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n However, wait: is that really independent? Because the same key cannot be used twice. But note: the two conditions are disjoint in terms of parity requirements.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use all keys or all chests, just as many as possible under the constraint that one key per chest.\n\n So the total maximum chests we can open is the sum of the two matchings? \n\n However, there is a catch: the same key cannot be used for both types. But in our breakdown, we are using:\n   - Odd keys for even chests (so we are using up some odd keys for even chests, and then the remaining odd keys are not available for odd chests, but odd chests require even keys).\n   - Even keys for odd chests.\n\n Since the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint, and the two sets of chests (even and odd) are disjoint, we can indeed compute independently.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n   total = min(even_count, odd_keys) + min(odd_count, even_keys)\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n        even: [14,6,2] -> count=3\n        odd: [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] ->\n        even: [8,4,20] -> count=3\n        odd: [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then: \n        even_chests (3) can use odd_keys (1) -> min(3,1)=1\n        odd_chests (2) can use even_keys (3) -> min(2,3)=2\n        total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_count=5, odd_count=0.\n   Keys: [5] -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0.\n\n   Then: \n        even_chests: min(5,1)=1\n        odd_chests: min(0,0)=0\n        total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_count=1, odd_count=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0.\n\n   Then: \n        even_chests: min(1,0)=0\n        odd_chests: min(0,4)=0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n So the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n and m.\n   Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count the number of even and odd in the chests and keys.\n\n   Then compute:\n        part1 = min(even_count, odd_keys)   # even chests matched with odd keys\n        part2 = min(odd_count, even_keys)    # odd chests matched with even keys\n\n   Print part1 + part2.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say n, m up to 10^5. This counting is O(n+m) which is acceptable.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to specific parity conditions: an even-numbered chest must be paired with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be paired with an even-numbered key.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity conditions. Each chest and key can be used at most once. The solution hinges on counting how many chests and keys are even or odd.\n2. **Intuition**: Even chests can only be opened by odd keys, and odd chests can only be opened by even keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    part1 = min(even_chest, odd_key)\n    part2 = min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    \n    result = part1 + part2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests have even and odd numbers, and similarly for the keys.\n3. **Matching Calculation**: The solution calculates the maximum number of even chests that can be opened using odd keys (min(even_chest, odd_key)) and the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened using even keys (min(odd_chest, even_key)).\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of these two values gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
