    "thought": "\n We are going to do the following:\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the list of n integers.\n 3. Sort the array.\n 4. The instability after removing an element is defined by the new max minus the new min.\n    Note: Removing an element can only change the max or the min (or both) if the element being removed is the current max or min.\n\n Observation:\n Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1].\n\n Without removal, the instability is b[n-1] - b[0].\n But we are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n After removal, the new min and max will be:\n   If we remove an element that is not the minimum, then the new min is still b[0].\n   Similarly, if we remove an element that is not the maximum, then the new max is still b[n-1].\n\n However, we have two cases for the removal:\n\n Case 1: Remove an element from the left part (including the current min). Then the new min might become the next smallest element.\n Case 2: Remove an element from the right part (including the current max). Then the new max might become the next largest element.\n\n Alternatively, note that the instability of the array without removal is b[n-1]-b[0]. After removal, we consider two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove the smallest element (b[0]). Then the new array's min is b[1] and the max is b[n-1]. Instability = b[n-1] - b[1].\n Possibility 2: Remove the largest element (b[n-1]). Then the new array's min is b[0] and the max is b[n-2]. Instability = b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n But note: There might be multiple copies of the minimum or maximum. In fact, we don't necessarily have to remove only the first occurrence of the minimum or the last occurrence of the maximum. However, note that removing any one element from the entire array.\n\n However, note: We cannot remove an element arbitrarily from the middle? Actually, we can, but what if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest?\n\n Consider: \n   Original: [b0, b1, ..., bn-1]\n   Removing an element in the middle doesn't change the min (if there are duplicates of the min) or the max (if there are duplicates of the max).\n\n But wait: what if we remove a duplicate of the min? Then the min remains the same (because there is still at least one min) and the max remains the same. So the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n Therefore, the only candidates for removal that can potentially reduce the instability are:\n\n   - Removing an occurrence of the global min (but note: if there are multiple mins, then removing one of them doesn't change the min, so the instability remains the same as original)\n   - Similarly, removing an occurrence of the global max doesn't change the max, so again the instability remains the same.\n\n However, we must consider that sometimes we have to remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max.\n\n Actually, the key is: \n\n The instability after removal is determined by the new min and max. The new min is the smallest element in the remaining array, and the new max is the largest element in the remaining array.\n\n Since the array is sorted, the new min is either the original min (if we didn't remove the only occurrence of the min) or the next smallest (if we removed the only occurrence of the min). Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the only removals that change the min or the max are:\n\n   - Removing an element that is the first element (the smallest) and there is no other element equal to the smallest? Then the new min becomes the next smallest.\n   - Similarly, for the largest.\n\n But note: even if there are duplicates, if we remove one occurrence of the smallest, and there is still a smallest (i.e., another occurrence), then the min doesn't change. Similarly for the largest.\n\n So the idea is:\n\n   We can consider all removals that might change the min or the max. However, note that the problem does not require us to know which element to remove, only the minimum possible instability.\n\n   We can consider two types of removals:\n\n   Type 1: Remove an element that is the min (and it's the only min, or even if not, but we are considering the effect on the boundaries). Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Let M = b[-1] - b[0] (original instability)\n\n   We want to minimize the instability.\n\n   Consider:\n\n     Option 1: Remove the first element (b[0]) -> then the instability is b[-1] - b[1] (if n>=2, then b[1] exists because n>=2)\n\n     Option 2: Remove the last element (b[-1]) -> then the instability is b[-2] - b[0]\n\n     Option 3: What about removing an element that is not the min or the max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is still M. So that removal doesn't help.\n\n   But wait: what if we remove an element that is in the middle, but the array has multiple mins and multiple maxes? Then the min and max don't change. So we are stuck with M.\n\n   However, what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min? Then the min becomes the next value, and the max remains the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. We are not forced to remove the min or the max. But if we don't remove the min or the max, then the min and max remain the same, and the instability remains M. So we must compare:\n\n     candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]   (removing the first element, assuming we remove one occurrence of the min and there are no duplicates? Actually, no: if there are duplicates, then after removal the min is still the same, so candidate1 would actually be b[-1] - b[0] (if duplicates exist) unless we remove the only min.\n\n   So we need to consider:\n\n     candidate1: remove the first occurrence of the min? Actually, no: we are allowed to remove any one. But note: if we remove one occurrence of the min, and there is at least two mins, then the min doesn't change, so the instability remains M.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider:\n\n     candidate1: remove the only min (if there is exactly one min) -> then the new min is the next distinct value (which is b[1] if the array is sorted). But if there are duplicates, then we have to remove until the min changes.\n\n   Actually, we can think differently:\n\n     The new min after removal is the smallest element in the array excluding the removed one. Similarly for the max.\n\n     The instability after removal is max(remaining) - min(remaining).\n\n     The candidate removals that can lead to a reduction are:\n\n        - Removing an occurrence of the min, but only if we remove the last occurrence of the min? Actually, no: if we remove one min and there is still a min, then the min doesn't change. So the only removal that reduces the min is when we remove the last occurrence of the min.\n\n     Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, note: the array is sorted. The min is b[0] and the max is b[-1]. \n\n   We can also consider:\n\n        candidate1: Remove the first element (then the new min is the next smallest, which is b[1] if the array has at least two elements, but note: if there are duplicates, then the min might still be b[0] if we don't remove the last occurrence of b[0]? Actually, if we remove one occurrence of b[0] and there is another b[0] then the min remains b[0]. So the instability remains M.\n\n   Therefore, the only removals that change the min are those that remove the last occurrence of the min. Similarly for the max.\n\n   But note: we don't know the frequency of the min and max.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n     Let the sorted array be b.\n\n     We can consider two types of removals that change the instability:\n\n        Type A: Remove an element that is the min (so that the min increases). This happens only if we remove all occurrences of the min? No, we can only remove one. So if there are k occurrences of the min, then we must remove k times to get rid of all mins. But we are only allowed one removal.\n\n        Actually, we are allowed to remove one element. So the min will change only if we remove the last occurrence of the min (i.e., if the first occurrence is at index i and the last occurrence is at index j, and we remove an occurrence that is the last one? Actually, no: the min is the smallest value. The smallest value is repeated, then removing one occurrence doesn't change the min.\n\n     So the key is: \n\n        The instability after removal is:\n\n          If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then instability = b[-1]-b[0] (same as original).\n\n          If we remove an element that is the min (and we remove the last occurrence of the min, i.e., the min appears only once at the beginning) then the new min is the next distinct number (which is b[1]) and the max remains b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n          Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max (and the max appears only once at the end) then the new max is b[-2] and the min remains b[0] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        But what if the min appears multiple times? Then even if we remove one occurrence of the min, the min remains the same. Similarly for the max.\n\n     Therefore, we must consider:\n\n        candidate1: If the first element appears only once (i.e., the first element is followed by a larger number) then removing the first element gives instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n        candidate2: If the last element appears only once (i.e., the last element is preceded by a smaller number) then removing the last element gives instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        candidate3: Also, what if we remove an element that is the min (but there are duplicates) but the array has more than one min? Then the min remains the same, so the instability remains M.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove one element. We are not forced to remove the first or last. But if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, the min doesn't change. Similarly for the max.\n\n     But wait: what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? That is, if the array has only two distinct numbers, say [1, 2, 2, 3] and we remove the 1 (min) and the array becomes [2,2,3] -> then the instability is 3-2=1. Alternatively, if we remove the 3 (max) then the array becomes [1,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1. But note: we can also remove a 2 (middle) then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n\n     However, note: the problem is to remove exactly one element.\n\n     But the above example: [1,2,2,3] -> n=4\n\n        candidate1: remove first element (1): then array = [2,2,3] -> instability = 3-2 = 1.\n        candidate2: remove last element (3): then array = [1,2,2] -> instability = 2-1 = 1.\n\n        candidate3: remove the middle element (one of the 2s): then array = [1,2,3] -> instability = 2.\n\n        candidate4: remove the other 2: same as above.\n\n     So the answer is min(1,1,2) = 1.\n\n     Now, how do we capture candidate1 and candidate2 in the sorted array?\n\n        candidate1: if we remove the first element, the new instability is b[-1] - b[1] (if n>=2, then b[1] exists). But wait: in the example, b = [1,2,2,3]. Then removing the first element: new array min is 2, max is 3 -> 3-2=1.\n\n        candidate2: removing the last element: new array min is 1, max is 2 -> 2-1=1.\n\n        But what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the instability is 3-1=2 (the original).\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is 1.\n\n     However, note: we are not limited to removing the first or last element. We can remove any one. But the above candidates cover the cases that change the min or the max.\n\n     But what if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first element)? For example, if the min is repeated, then removing a min that is not the first element (but the array is sorted, so all the min are consecutive at the beginning) then the min remains the same.\n\n     Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max (but not the last element) then the max remains the same.\n\n     Therefore, the only removals that can lower the instability are:\n\n        - Removing the first element (if the first element is the unique min, then the min increases; if not, then the min remains the same so the instability remains the same as the original) OR\n        - Removing the last element (if the last element is the unique max, then the max decreases; if not, then the max remains the same) OR\n        - Removing an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the instability remains the same.\n\n     However, note: the above example shows that sometimes removing the first element (even if there are duplicates) might be beneficial? Actually, in the example [1,2,2,3], the first element is the unique min (only one 1) so removing it changes the min. But if the array were [1,1,2,3], then removing the first element (a 1) leaves the min still 1, so the instability remains 3-1=2.\n\n     So the correct approach:\n\n        We must consider:\n\n          candidate1: Remove the first element (b[0])\n            Then the new min is the next element (if the first element is repeated, then the new min is still b[0] because there are more at the beginning) unless we remove the last occurrence of the min? Actually, the array is sorted so the first element is the min. After removing the first element, the new min is the smallest element in the rest. Since the array is sorted, the rest starts at b[1]. So the new min is b[1] (if we remove the first element, then the array becomes [b[1], b[2], ... , b[n-1]]). Then the instability is b[-1] - b[1].\n\n          candidate2: Remove the last element (b[-1])\n            Then the new max is b[-2], and the instability is b[-2] - b[0].\n\n          candidate3: Remove an element that is the min and the max? Actually, if the array has all same elements, then removing any element: the min and max remain the same, so instability is 0.\n\n        But note: the above two candidates (candidate1 and candidate2) might not be the only ones? Consider: \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,4] (all distinct)\n\n          candidate1: remove first -> instability = 4-2 = 2.\n          candidate2: remove last -> instability = 3-1 = 2.\n\n          But what if we remove the second element (2)? Then the array becomes [1,3,4] -> instability = 4-1=3 -> worse.\n\n          Similarly, removing the third (3): [1,2,4] -> instability=4-1=3.\n\n          So the best is 2.\n\n        However, consider a different example: [1,2,3,100] (with a big gap at the end)\n\n          candidate1: remove first -> [2,3,100] -> 100-2=98\n          candidate2: remove last -> [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2\n\n          So candidate2 gives 2.\n\n        But what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? In this case, removing the second or third element doesn't help.\n\n        Now, consider: [1, 100, 101, 102] (with a big gap at the beginning)\n\n          candidate1: remove first -> [100,101,102] -> 102-100=2\n          candidate2: remove last -> [1,100,101] -> 101-1=100\n\n        So the minimal instability is 2.\n\n        Another example: [10, 20, 30, 40] -> \n          candidate1: remove first -> 40-20=20\n          candidate2: remove last -> 30-10=20\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element from the middle? \n          Removing 20: [10,30,40] -> 40-10=30 -> worse.\n          Removing 30: [10,20,40] -> 40-10=30 -> worse.\n\n        So the answer is 20.\n\n     Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        ans = min( b[-1]-b[1], b[-2]-b[0] )\n\n     But wait, in the example [1,2,2,3] we had:\n          candidate1: b[-1]-b[1] = 3-2 = 1\n          candidate2: b[-2]-b[0] = 2-1 = 1\n          so ans = 1, which is correct.\n\n     However, what if the array has only two elements? [1,2]\n        candidate1: remove first -> [2] -> instability 2-2=0? Actually, the array becomes [2] so min=2, max=2 -> 0.\n        candidate2: remove last -> [1] -> 1-1=0.\n\n        But our formula: \n          candidate1: b[-1]-b[1] -> but n=2, then b[1] is the last element, so we need to check indexing.\n\n        In Python, for [1,2]:\n          b[0]=1, b[1]=2, b[-1]=2, b[-2]=1.\n\n        candidate1: 2 - b[1] = 2-2 = 0\n        candidate2: b[-2]-b[0] = 1-1=0\n\n        So it works.\n\n     However, what if the array has duplicates and the min and max are the same? \n\n        Example: [5,5,5,5] (n=4)\n        candidate1: remove first -> [5,5,5] -> instability 5-5=0\n        candidate2: remove last -> [5,5,5] -> 0\n\n        Formula: \n          candidate1: b[-1]-b[1] = 5 - 5 = 0\n          candidate2: b[-2]-b[0] = 5-5=0\n\n        So answer is 0.\n\n     But wait, is there a possibility that the minimal instability is achieved by removing an element that is not the first or last? \n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] -> we saw that removing the first or last gives 2, and removing others gives 3.\n\n     However, note: the above formula considers two candidates. But what if we remove an element that is the min (if the min is not at the beginning) or the max (if the max is not at the end)? \n\n        In a sorted array, the min is always at the beginning and the max at the end. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\n     But wait: what if the array is [2,1,3,4]? Then we sort it: [1,2,3,4] and then the above method applies.\n\n     Therefore, we should sort the array.\n\n     However, note: the problem says the array has n integers (from 1 to 10^5). So we can sort.\n\n     Algorithm:\n\n        Read n\n        Read list a of n integers.\n\n        Sort a.\n\n        If n==2: \n            Then we have two elements. Removing either one leaves one element, so the instability is 0.\n\n        But our formula for n>=2:\n\n            candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   (if n>=2, then a[1] exists)\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]   (if n>=2, then a[-2] exists)\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        However, wait: what if the array has more than two elements and we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the instability is the same as the original? But sometimes we can get a better result by removing an element that is not the first or last? \n\n        Let me think: \n\n          The instability is determined by the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n          The min is the smallest element and the max is the largest element.\n\n          Removing an element that is not the min or max doesn't change the min and max, so the instability remains the same.\n\n          Therefore, the only candidates for reducing the instability are removing the first element or the last element.\n\n        But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4,5] and we remove the middle element? The instability is still 5-1=4, same as the original.\n\n        However, what if the array is [1,100,101,102]? \n          candidate1: remove first -> [100,101,102] -> 102-100=2\n          candidate2: remove last -> [1,100,101] -> 101-1=100\n          candidate3: remove the element 100 -> [1,101,102] -> 102-1=101\n          candidate4: remove the element 101 -> [1,100,102] -> 102-1=101\n\n        So the best is candidate1.\n\n        But what if the array is [10, 20, 30, 40, 1000]?\n          candidate1: remove first -> [20,30,40,1000] -> 1000-20=980\n          candidate2: remove last -> [10,20,30,40] -> 40-10=30\n\n        So the answer is 30.\n\n        Now, is there a removal that gives less than 30? \n\n        Removing 20: [10,30,40,1000] -> 1000-10=990\n        Removing 30: [10,20,40,1000] -> 1000-10=990\n        Removing 40: [10,20,30,1000] -> 1000-10=990\n\n        So no.\n\n     Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Sort the array.\n\n        candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   # remove the first element (min)\n        candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]    # remove the last element (max)\n\n        Then, we must consider: is there a possibility that the minimal instability is even lower than these two? \n\n        But note: removing an element that is not the first or last doesn't change the min and max, so the instability is a[-1]-a[0] (the original) which is likely larger than both candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        However, wait: what if the array is [0,0,1,1] (n=4)?\n\n          Original instability: 1-0=1.\n\n          candidate1: remove first -> [0,1,1] -> instability 1-0=1.\n          candidate2: remove last -> [0,0,1] -> instability 1-0=1.\n\n          But what if we remove the element at index 1 (the first 0)? Then the array becomes [0,1,1] -> instability 1.\n          Same as above.\n\n        Now, what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? In an array with distinct min and max, that's not possible.\n\n        However, note: we are only removing one element.\n\n        But wait: what if the array is [0,1,2,3] (distinct) and we remove the element 1 (which is neither the min nor the max)? Then the array becomes [0,2,3] -> instability 3-0=3, which is worse.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to consider candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        However, there is a catch: \n\n          Consider [1,2,3,1000] (as above) and we remove the first element -> 1000-2=998, and remove the last element -> 3-1=2.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? That is, if the array has only two distinct values, and we remove one of the duplicates? \n\n        Example: [1,1,2,2] (n=4)\n\n          candidate1: remove first -> [1,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n          candidate2: remove last -> [1,1,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n\n          But what if we remove one of the 1's that is not the first? Then the array becomes [1,2,2] -> same as candidate1.\n\n          Similarly, removing one of the 2's that is not the last -> [1,1,2] -> same as candidate2.\n\n        So the above two candidates cover all possibilities.\n\n     However, wait: what if the array has more than two distinct numbers, but the min and max are fixed and the removal of an element in the middle might allow a different pairing?\n\n        Example: [1, 10, 11, 12, 20] \n          candidate1: remove first -> [10,11,12,20] -> 20-10=10\n          candidate2: remove last -> [1,10,11,12] -> 12-1=11\n\n          But what if we remove 10? Then the array becomes [1,11,12,20] -> 20-1=19 -> worse.\n          Remove 11: [1,10,12,20] -> 20-1=19 -> worse.\n          Remove 12: [1,10,11,20] -> 20-1=19 -> worse.\n\n        So the best is 10.\n\n     But wait, consider: [1, 2, 100, 101, 102] \n        candidate1: remove first -> [2,100,101,102] -> 102-2=100\n        candidate2: remove last -> [1,2,100,101] -> 101-1=100\n\n        But what if we remove 2? Then the array becomes [1,100,101,102] -> 102-1=101 -> worse.\n        Removing 100: [1,2,101,102] -> 102-1=101 -> worse.\n\n        So the best is 100.\n\n     Therefore, the solution is to consider candidate1 and candidate2 and take the minimum.\n\n     However, note: what if the array has three elements? [1,2,3] (n=3)\n\n        candidate1: remove first -> [2,3] -> 3-2=1\n        candidate2: remove last -> [1,2] -> 2-1=1\n\n        But wait, the original instability is 2 (3-1). And the minimal instability is 1.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove one element, and the resulting array has two elements.\n\n     But wait: what if we remove the middle element? [1,3] -> instability 3-1=2, which is worse.\n\n     So the answer is 1.\n\n     However, let's check with the formula:\n\n        candidate1 = a[-1]-a[1] = 3-2=1\n        candidate2 = a[-2]-a[0] = 2-1=1\n\n        So we take the min(1,1)=1.\n\n     Another example: [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5)\n\n        candidate1: 5-2=3\n        candidate2: 4-1=3\n\n        But what if we remove the element 3 (the middle)? Then the array becomes [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4 -> worse.\n\n        Or remove 2: [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4 -> worse.\n\n        So the answer is 3.\n\n     But wait: is there a way to get less than 3? \n\n        We have to remove one element. The original range is 4. After removal, the range is the difference between the largest and smallest.\n\n        Removing the first or last gives 3.\n\n        Removing an interior element doesn't help.\n\n     Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n        Step 2: Sort the list.\n        Step 3: \n            candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   (remove the first element)\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]    (remove the last element)\n\n        But wait: what if n==2? Then the array has two elements, and we remove one, leaving one element. The instability of a single element is 0.\n\n        Our candidate1: \n            a[-1] - a[1] -> if n==2, then a[1] is the last element (since indices 0 and 1). Then a[-1] is the last element, so a[-1]-a[1] = a[1]-a[1]=0.\n\n        Similarly, candidate2: a[-2]-a[0] = a[0]-a[0]=0.\n\n        So it works for n==2.\n\n     However, note: the above two candidates are valid for n>=2.\n\n     But wait: what if the array has more than two elements and the min and max are repeated? \n\n        Example: [1,1,2,2,3,3] (n=6)\n\n        candidate1: remove first -> [1,2,2,3,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 3-1=2.\n        candidate2: remove last -> [1,1,2,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 3-1=2.\n\n        But what if we remove a middle element? It doesn't help.\n\n        However, note: the original instability is 3-1=2. After removal, the instability remains 2.\n\n        So the minimal instability is 2.\n\n        Our candidates give 2.\n\n     But wait: what if the array is [1,1,1,2,2,2] (three 1's and three 2's)?\n\n        candidate1: remove first (a 1) -> [1,1,2,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> 1.\n        candidate2: remove last (a 2) -> [1,1,1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> 1.\n\n        But wait, the original instability is 2-1=1. So removing one element doesn't change the instability? \n\n        However, note: the original instability is 1. After removal, the instability is still 1.\n\n        But wait: candidate1 and candidate2 give 1? \n\n          candidate1: a[-1]-a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1.\n          candidate2: a[-2]-a[0] = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n        But the original instability is 1. So the answer is 1.\n\n        However, we are removing one element and the instability remains the same. So the minimal instability is 1.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimize instability\". The original instability is 1, and after removal the instability is still 1. So 1 is the minimal.\n\n     However, wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? \n\n        Example: remove a 1 that is not the first -> [1,1,2,2,2] -> still 2-1=1.\n        Similarly, remove a 2 that is not the last -> [1,1,1,2,2] -> still 2-1=1.\n\n        So no matter which element we remove, the instability is 1.\n\n     Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n     But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3] and we remove the first element: [2,3] -> instability 1, and remove the last element: [1,2] -> instability 1. But the original instability is 2, and the minimal instability is 1.\n\n     The algorithm returns 1.\n\n     However, note: the above examples work.\n\n     But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4] and we remove the first element: [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2, and remove the last element: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2. The original is 3. The answer is 2.\n\n     But wait, is there a removal that gives less than 2? \n\n        Removing the second element (2): [1,3,4] -> 4-1=3 -> worse.\n        Removing the third element (3): [1,2,4] -> 4-1=3 -> worse.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n     Therefore, the code:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If n==1, but the problem states n>=2, so we don't need to handle n==1.\n\n        # Consider two candidates: removing the first element and removing the last element.\n        candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   # Remove the first element (a[0])\n        candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]    # Remove the last element (a[-1])\n\n        # But wait: what if we remove an element that is the first occurrence of the min and the min is repeated? Then the min remains the same, so candidate1 might be the same as the original? \n\n        # Actually, we are not limited to only these two? \n\n        # Let me reexamine: \n\n        # The instability after removal is determined by the new min and max.\n\n        # The new min is the smallest element in the array after removal. The new max is the largest element.\n\n        # We have two ways to reduce the range:\n\n        #   Option 1: Remove the smallest element (if there is only one smallest, then the new min becomes the next smallest).\n        #   Option 2: Remove the largest element (if there is only one largest, then the new max becomes the next largest).\n\n        # But note: the array is sorted, so the smallest element is a[0] and the largest is a[-1].\n\n        # However, what if we remove an element that is not the smallest but the smallest is repeated? Then the smallest remains, so the instability doesn't change.\n\n        # Similarly, if we remove an element that is not the largest but the largest is repeated, the instability doesn't change.\n\n        # Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2, and we know that if we remove an element that is not the min or the max (or if we remove a duplicate min or max) then the instability remains the original (a[-1]-a[0]), which is likely larger.\n\n        # However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? (i.e., the array has only one distinct value) then the instability is 0, and candidate1 and candidate2 are 0.\n\n        # Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        ans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        But wait: what if the array has two distinct numbers, but the min and max are not the only ones? \n\n        Example: [1,2,2,3] -> \n            candidate1 = 3-2=1, candidate2=2-1=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can only potentially reduce the instability if the removed element is either the current minimum or the current maximum. If the removed element is neither, the instability remains unchanged. \n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the impact of removing the first (smallest) or last (largest) element. The new instability after removing the first element would be the difference between the last element and the second element. Similarly, removing the last element would result in the difference between the second last element and the first element.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves sorting the array and then computing two candidate values for the minimal instability: one by removing the first element and another by removing the last element. The minimal value between these two candidates is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 10^5. The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: Two candidates for the minimal instability are computed:\n   - **Candidate1**: The instability after removing the first element (smallest) is `a[-1] - a[1]`.\n   - **Candidate2**: The instability after removing the last element (largest) is `a[-2] - a[0]`.\n4. **Result**: The minimal value between the two candidates is printed, which represents the smallest possible instability achievable by removing exactly one element from the array.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two critical scenarios (removing the smallest or largest element) and leverages sorting to simplify the computation, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
