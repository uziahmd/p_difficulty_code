They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge (u, v) gives two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n Conditions for an edge (a, b):\n   Let x = number of mushrooms on lawn u, y = on lawn v.\n   Then, gcd(x,y) must equal the given gcd and lcm(x,y) must equal the given lcm.\n\n We know that for any two positive integers x and y:\n   gcd(x,y) * lcm(x,y) = x * y.\n\n Also, note that x and y must be multiples of gcd(x,y). So, we can write:\n   x = g * a, y = g * b, where g = gcd(x,y), and gcd(a,b)=1.\n   Then, lcm(x,y) = g * a * b (because then the product is g^2 * a * b, and the gcd is g, so the lcm is (g*a*b) / gcd(a,b) but since gcd(a,b)=1, it is g*a*b).\n\n Therefore, the condition becomes: \n   g * a * b = LCM.\n\n But note: a and b must be coprime.\n\n However, we have multiple edges and we need to assign numbers to all n nodes.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check consistency for each edge individually?\n    For an edge (u, v) with gcd = g and lcm = L:\n        - It must hold that g divides both x and y, and also that g divides L? Actually, from the equation: g * (x/g) * (y/g) = L, and since (x/g) and (y/g) are integers, then g must divide L as well (because x/g and y/g are integers and their product is L/g, so L must be divisible by g).\n        - Additionally, the product of the two numbers (x*y) must equal g*L. But note that x and y are determined by g and the ratio.\n\n 2. But note: we don't know the two numbers separately. However, we can set up constraints.\n\n 3. We can think of this as a system of equations per node (variable for the number of mushrooms) and constraints from edges.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n    For an edge (u, v): \n        Let d = gcd(g, L) ... wait, no. Actually, we have:\n            x * y = g * L\n            and gcd(x,y) = g.\n\n    Then, we can factorize the numbers? But note: the constraints say that GCD and LCM are at least 1 and at most 10^6, and n, m up to 200000.\n\n 5. Another approach: \n    From the equation: x = g * a, y = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1, and then L = g * a * b.\n\n    This implies that a * b = L // g.\n\n    And note that a and b must be divisors of L//g and they must be coprime.\n\n    Moreover, the value of the node u is g * a, and the value of node v is g * b.\n\n 6. But how do we assign numbers to all nodes?\n\n    We can try to use a union-find or DFS/BFS to traverse the graph and assign values.\n\n    However, note that the entire graph might not be connected. We must assign a value to every node.\n\n    Let's denote:\n        Let base[u] be the base divisor (the gcd part) and the cofactor (the part from the LCM) ?\n\n    Observation: In the entire graph, the value assigned to a node must be a multiple of the gcd from every incident edge? Not exactly, but consider:\n\n        For an edge (u, v) with gcd g1, then the value at u must be divisible by g1. Similarly for v.\n\n        So, the value at a node u must be divisible by the gcd of every edge incident to u? Actually, no: because the gcd of an edge is the gcd of the two numbers at the endpoints. But note: if we have two edges (u, v) and (u, w) with gcds g1 and g2, then the value at u must be divisible by both g1 and g2, and actually by the gcd of all the gcds of edges incident to u? Not necessarily: consider if an edge (u,v) has gcd g1, then u must be divisible by g1. Similarly for every edge incident to u, so u must be divisible by the least common multiple (actually the greatest common divisor? Wait, no: being divisible by each g_i, so u must be divisible by the least common multiple of the g_i? Actually, no: the condition is that for each edge (u,v) with gcd g, u must be divisible by g. The minimal requirement is that u is divisible by each g_i. But if we take the set {g1, g2, ...} then u must be divisible by the least common multiple of these g_i? Actually, no: consider two edges with g1 and g2. Then u must be divisible by g1 and by g2. The minimal such number is the least common multiple of g1 and g2? Actually, yes, because the set of divisors must include both g1 and g2. But note: we are free to choose any multiple, so we can set u to be a multiple of the LCM of all the gcds from edges incident to u.\n\n    However, let me reconsider: the condition for an edge (u,v) is that gcd(u, v) = g. This means that g divides u and g divides v. But note: the same node u must satisfy that for every edge (u, v_i) the gcd(u, v_i) is g_i. \n\n    There is a stronger condition: the value of u must be divisible by the gcd of the entire set of edges? Actually, no: the conditions are independent per edge. But note: the gcd of two numbers is the product of the primes raised to the minimum exponent in both. \n\n    Alternate plan:\n\n    Step 1: For each edge, check that g divides L. (Because from the equation: g * (some integer) = L, so g must divide L.)\n\n    Step 2: For each edge, we know that the product of the two numbers (x*y) must be g * L. Also, the two numbers must be multiples of g and their gcd must be g.\n\n    Now, we can assign a value to a node by considering the constraints from all edges.\n\n    Idea: \n        Let A[u] be the number of mushrooms at node u.\n\n        Then, for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, we have:\n            A[u] * A[v] = g * L\n            and gcd(A[u], A[v]) = g.\n\n        Write A[u] = g * a, A[v] = g * b, then a and b must be coprime and a * b = L // g.\n\n        Then, note that the entire graph must have the same assignment for a node from different edges.\n\n        However, the same node u might appear in multiple edges. Then, we must assign one value to u.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let base[u] be the gcd that we assume for node u. But note: the gcd for an edge is fixed, but the base for a node might be the gcd of several edges? \n\n        Actually, the value A[u] must be divisible by every g (from edges incident to u). So, we can set:\n\n            candidate_base[u] = LCM of all g (from edges incident to u)\n\n        Then, we can set A[u] = candidate_base[u] * k, and then for each edge (u, v) we have:\n\n            Let g0 = gcd(candidate_base[u], candidate_base[v])? Not exactly.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Let D[u] = the set of prime factors that must be present in A[u] with at least some exponent.\n\n        But note: the problem size is large (n, m up to 200000) and numbers up to 10^6.\n\n    Another idea from known problems (like restoring a graph from gcd and lcm):\n\n        We know that the value of A[u] must be divisible by the gcd of the edge, and the product A[u]*A[v] = g * L.\n\n        We can set up a system of equations. However, note that the graph may be disconnected.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. For each edge (u, v): \n                Condition 1: g divides L (if not, output \"NO\")\n                Condition 2: We can define the value of A[u] and A[v] as multiples of g, and their product is g*L, and their gcd is g.\n\n          2. How to assign? We can fix one node arbitrarily and then propagate.\n\n        But note: the entire graph might not be connected, so we have to handle each connected component separately.\n\n        Known fact: In a connected component, we can assign a value to one node and then derive the others.\n\n        However, the equations are multiplicative and involve divisibility.\n\n        Let's define for each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L:\n\n            Let M = L // g   (so we have a * b = M, and gcd(a, b)=1)\n\n            Then, we can factorize M and then look for pairs (a,b) that are coprime and a*b=M.\n\n        But note: there can be many factorizations. However, we are going to assign the same a (relative to g) to a node from different edges.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n            Consider: The entire graph must satisfy that for each edge (u, v): \n                A[u] * A[v] = g * L.\n\n            Also, note that if we define B[u] = A[u] / g, then for an edge (u, v): \n                B[u] * B[v] = L // g, and gcd(B[u], B[v]) = 1.\n\n            Then, the value B[u] must be a divisor of L//g (for each edge incident to u) and the product of the B[u] and B[v] must be L//g.\n\n        But note: the same node u appears in multiple edges. Then, the B[u] must be consistent across edges.\n\n        How? \n\n            In an edge (u, v): B[u] * B[v] = M, and gcd(B[u],B[v])=1.\n\n            Then, the value of B[u] must be a divisor of M (from the edge) and also from another edge (u, w) we have B[u] * B[w] = M' (another M) and gcd(B[u],B[w])=1.\n\n            Then, B[u] must divide both M and M'? Not necessarily, because the edges are independent. However, note that the product condition must hold.\n\n        Actually, we can assign the entire connected component by:\n\n            Let's pick a root node r, and set B[r] = 1 (then A[r] = g_r * 1, but wait, which g_r? Actually, we cannot set arbitrarily because the base gcd might vary.)\n\n        Another idea: \n\n            Since the value A[u] must be divisible by every g (from edges incident to u), we can set:\n\n                Let g_min[u] = the product of the primes that appear in any of the g's incident to u? Actually, no.\n\n            But note: the base divisor for a node u is not fixed until we assign. However, we can set:\n\n                Let base[u] = the least common multiple (LCM) of all the gcds from edges incident to u? \n\n            Then, we require that for an edge (u, v) with gcd g, base[u] must be divisible by g and base[v] must be divisible by g. \n\n            Then, we can set A[u] = base[u] * k, and similarly for v. Then the equation for the edge (u, v) becomes:\n\n                base[u] * k_u * base[v] * k_v = g * L\n\n            But note: we also have that the gcd of A[u] and A[v] is g. Since base[u] and base[v] are divisible by g, we can write:\n\n                base[u] = g * a, base[v] = g * b, so then A[u] = g * a * k_u, A[v] = g * b * k_v.\n\n                Then, gcd(A[u], A[v]) = g * gcd(a * k_u, b * k_v)\n\n                We want this to be exactly g, so gcd(a * k_u, b * k_v) must be 1.\n\n            Also, the product condition: \n                (g * a * k_u) * (g * b * k_v) = g * L   =>   g * a * b * k_u * k_v = g * L   =>   a * b * k_u * k_v = L/g.\n\n            But note: from the edge, we know that a * b must be the part of L that is not g? Actually, originally we defined for the edge: \n                A[u] * A[v] = g * L, and we set base[u] and base[v] as the LCM of the incident gcds, then we have:\n\n            However, we are overcomplicating.\n\n    After reading similar problems (like CodeForces problems about reconstructing from gcd and lcm), a known solution is:\n\n        For each edge, we require that g divides L and that L % g == 0.\n\n        Then, we define for each node u, let g0[u] be the product of the primes that must appear in the factorization of A[u]. But note: the condition that the gcd of two nodes is g and the product is g*L forces the prime factorizations.\n\n        Actually, we can factorize the gcd and the lcm for each edge and then combine.\n\n    Efficient solution:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute the prime factors for all the gcd and lcm values (but note: the gcd and lcm can be up to 10^6, and we have up to 200000 edges -> too many to factorize each).\n\n        Step 2: We note that the value of A[u] must be divisible by the gcd of the edge, and the product A[u] * A[v] must be g * L.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n            For an edge (u, v): \n                A[u] must be a divisor of (g * L) and also must be divisible by g.\n\n            But note: from the equation, A[u] * A[v] = g * L, so A[u] must divide g * L.\n\n            Moreover, the gcd of A[u] and A[v] is g.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            For each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, we know that A[u] must be a divisor of g * L and divisible by g, and similarly for A[v].\n\n        But the set of divisors of g * L can be large.\n\n    Another known method from competitive programming:\n\n        We can use the following necessary conditions:\n\n            Condition 1: For an edge (u, v): g divides L and L % g == 0.\n\n            Condition 2: For an edge (u, v): the value of A[u] must be divisible by g, and then A[u] must divide (g * L) / something? Actually, from the equation: A[u] divides (g * L) because A[u] * A[v] = g * L and A[v] is an integer.\n\n        But then, we have multiple edges. \n\n    Here's an alternative:\n\n        Let F(u) = the set of prime factors that must be included in A[u] (with exponents) based on the edges incident to u.\n\n        However, note that the same prime factor might appear in multiple edges.\n\n        But we can also note: \n\n            In an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, the exponents of a prime p in A[u] and A[v] must be:\n\n                Let e_u = exponent of p in A[u], e_v = exponent of p in A[v].\n                Then, min(e_u, e_v) = exponent of p in g, and max(e_u, e_v) = exponent of p in L.\n\n            Then, the entire graph must satisfy this for every prime.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: For each edge, factorize g and L (but note: we have up to 200000 edges, and factorizing each would be too slow).\n\n            Step 2: Instead, we can precompute the prime factorizations for all distinct numbers that appear (all gcd and lcm values). But note: the gcd and lcm values are given and up to 10^6, and we have up to 200000 edges, so we might see up to 200000 distinct numbers? That is too many for factorization (each factorization is O(sqrt(n)) and sqrt(10^6)=1000, so 200000*1000 = 200e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline? But note: we only need to factorize the distinct numbers that appear. However, worst-case distinct gcd and lcm values could be 200000, and factorizing 200000 distinct numbers (each up to 10^6) is acceptable in C++ but in Python we might need to optimize.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the numbers (gcd and lcm) are between 1 and 10^6. So, we can precompute the smallest prime factor (spf) for numbers up to 10^6.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not specify the total distinct numbers, but worst-case 200000 edges, so 400000 distinct numbers (each gcd and lcm). Precomputing spf for 10^6 is standard.\n\n        But then, we have to combine the information from all edges for a node.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following without factorization:\n\n            We know that for an edge (u, v): \n                A[u] * A[v] = g * L.\n\n            Then, we can set:\n\n                Let X[u] = A[u] / g (for an edge (u, v) with gcd g). Then, X[u] must be an integer (since g divides A[u]) and X[u] * X[v] = L / g, and gcd(X[u], X[v]) = 1.\n\n            Now, for node u, in different edges, we get different g's and hence different definitions of X[u]. \n\n            However, note: the value A[u] must be divisible by every g (from every edge incident to u). So, let G[u] = LCM of all the g's from edges incident to u.\n\n            Then, we can set A[u] = G[u] * t, and then for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L:\n\n                A[u] * A[v] = G[u] * t * G[v] * s = g * L.\n\n            But note: G[u] is divisible by g (by definition, since it's the LCM of the incident gcds and includes g). Similarly for G[v].\n\n            Then, we require that (G[u] * G[v]) divides (g * L) * (something)? Actually, we have:\n\n                G[u] * t * G[v] * s = g * L.\n\n            But note: the product condition must hold for the entire assignment.\n\n        This seems messy.\n\n    After reading known problems (like CodeForces 878D or similar), here is a known solution for a single connected component:\n\n        We can assign the value for a node by taking the product of the primes that appear in the factorizations of the gcd and lcm of the edges, but normalized.\n\n    Actually, I recall a problem where you are given a graph and for each edge (u, v) you are given (g, l) and you have to assign numbers to nodes such that for each edge, gcd(a[u], a[v]) = g and lcm(a[u], a[v]) = l.\n\n    Solution:\n\n        Step 1: Check that for each edge, g divides l, and that l % g == 0.\n\n        Step 2: For each edge, compute M = l // g. Then, the two numbers for the edge are g * a and g * b, with a * b = M and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n        Step 3: Now, we need to assign to each node a value that is the product of the base (which is the gcd) and a cofactor (which is the part that is coprime with the cofactors of adjacent nodes).\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n            Let base[u] be the product of the primes that appear in the factorizations of the gcd values of edges incident to u, raised to the maximum exponent they have in the gcd of any edge? Actually, no.\n\n        Known solution from a similar CodeForces problem (e.g., \"Array Restoration\" or \"Graph with GCD and LCM\"):\n\n            We can use the following:\n\n            For each node, let the value be the product of the primes that are forced by the edges.\n\n            Specifically, for each prime p:\n\n                Let exp_min[u] be the minimum exponent of p in the gcd of the edges incident to u? Actually, no.\n\n            Instead, consider:\n\n                For an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, for each prime p:\n\n                    Let e_g = exponent of p in g.\n                    Let e_l = exponent of p in L.\n\n                    Then, the exponents for p in A[u] and A[v] must be: one of them is e_g and the other is e_l, and the minimum is e_g and the maximum is e_l.\n\n                Then, for a node u, we can determine the exponent for p by looking at all edges incident to u:\n\n                    For each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, we have two possibilities for the exponent of p in A[u]: either e_g (the minimum) or e_l (the maximum). But note: the minimum must be the same for all edges? \n\n                Actually, for a fixed prime p, in each edge (u, v) the exponent of p in A[u] and A[v] must be either (e_g, e_l) or (e_l, e_g). Then, the entire graph must have a consistent assignment for the exponent of p in A[u].\n\n                Moreover, the exponent of p in A[u] must be at least the maximum of the e_g over all edges incident to u? No, because in an edge (u, v) the exponent of p in A[u] must be at least e_g (the minimum) and at most e_l (the maximum). But also, the exponent of p in A[u] must be the same for all edges? \n\n                Actually, we can determine the exponent for p in A[u] by:\n\n                    Let E[u] = the exponent of p in A[u].\n\n                    Then, for each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, we have:\n                        min(E[u], E[v]) = e_g   (exponent of p in g)\n                        max(E[u], E[v]) = e_l   (exponent of p in L)\n\n                    Now, if we consider all edges incident to u, then the exponent E[u] must be at least the maximum of the e_g over the edges, and at most the minimum of the e_l over the edges? \n\n                But wait: consider two edges (u, v) and (u, w). For (u, v): min(E[u], E[v]) = e_g1, max(E[u], E[v]) = e_l1.\n                For (u, w): min(E[u], E[w]) = e_g2, max(E[u], E[w]) = e_l2.\n\n                Then, E[u] must be at least max(e_g1, e_g2) and at most min(e_l1, e_l2)? Not necessarily: if in one edge E[u] is the minimum and in the other it is the maximum, then we cannot directly compare.\n\n                Example: \n                    Edge1: (u, v): g1 has p^2, L1 has p^3 -> then E[u] can be 2 or 3, and E[v] the other.\n                    Edge2: (u, w): g2 has p^1, L2 has p^4 -> then E[u] can be 1 or 4, and E[w] the other.\n\n                Then, E[u] must be a value that satisfies: \n                    Either E[u] = 2 and E[v]=3, and for edge2: if E[u]=2 then E[w] must be 4 (since min(2,?) must be 1 -> then 2>=1 and 2 is not the minimum? Actually, the condition for edge2: min(E[u], E[w]) = 1. If E[u]=2, then E[w] must be 1? But then max(E[u],E[w]) = 2, but L2 has exponent 4, so we require 4, which is not satisfied.\n\n                Therefore, E[u] must be 4 in the second edge? But then in the first edge: min(4, E[v]) = 2 -> then E[v] must be 2 or 3, but if E[v]=2 then max(4,2)=4, which matches L1's exponent 3? No, wait: L1 has exponent 3, so we require max(4, E[v]) = 3 -> impossible.\n\n                Hence, there is no solution.\n\n            So, for a fixed prime p, for node u, we can determine the exponent E[u] by:\n\n                Let:\n                    min_exp = maximum of the exponents of p in the gcd's of edges incident to u.\n                    max_exp = minimum of the exponents of p in the lcm's of edges incident to u.\n\n                Then, for each edge incident to u, we require that the exponent of p in the neighbor v is either min_exp or max_exp, and specifically, for edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, we have:\n\n                    min(E[u], E[v]) = exponent_p(g) and max(E[u], E[v]) = exponent_p(L).\n\n                Then, we must have:\n\n                    The exponent of p in A[u] must be at least min_exp and at most max_exp.\n\n                But also, for each edge (u, v): \n                    If the exponent_p(g) = a and exponent_p(L) = b, then the two exponents (E[u], E[v]) must be {a, b}. \n\n                Then, we can set:\n\n                    E[u] = max_exp   (the highest exponent available) and hope that for every edge (u, v) we have:\n\n                    min(E[u], E[v]) = exponent_p(g) and max(E[u], E[v]) = exponent_p(L)\n\n                But wait, what if we set E[u] to the maximum exponent available from all edges? Then for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, we have:\n\n                    E[u] = max_exp >= exponent_p(g) (since min_exp is the maximum of the exponents in the gcd, and max_exp is the minimum of the exponents in the lcm, and note that exponent_p(g) <= exponent_p(L) and also the min_exp is the maximum among the gcd exponents, so max_exp (being the minimum of the lcm exponents) must be at least the exponent_p(g) because for the edge (u, v) the lcm exponent is at least the gcd exponent, and the min_exp is the maximum gcd exponent, and the max_exp is the minimum lcm exponent, so we require that the gcd exponent for edge (u, v) is <= the lcm exponent for the same edge, and also the min_exp (max of gcd exponents) <= the max_exp (min of lcm exponents) for the node u.\n\n                Then, set E[u] = max_exp. Then, for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L:\n\n                    min(E[u], E[v]) = min(max_exp, E[v]) should be exponent_p(g) and max(E[u], E[v]) should be exponent_p(L).\n\n                But note: E[v] for the same prime p is computed similarly: \n                    Let min_exp_v = maximum of the exponents of p in the gcd's of edges incident to v.\n                    Let max_exp_v = minimum of the exponents of p in the lcm's of edges incident to v.\n\n                Then, E[v] = max_exp_v.\n\n                Then, we require:\n\n                    min(max_exp, max_exp_v) = exponent_p(g) and max(max_exp, max_exp_v) = exponent_p(L)\n\n                But also, note that for the edge (u, v) we know that the gcd g has exponent_p(g) and the lcm L has exponent_p(L). And we know that exponent_p(g) <= exponent_p(L). Moreover, the exponents for u and v must be exactly exponent_p(g) and exponent_p(L) (in some order). \n\n                Then, we must have:\n\n                    {max_exp, max_exp_v} = {exponent_p(g), exponent_p(L)}   as sets.\n\n                Why? Because the minimum of the two is exponent_p(g) and the maximum is exponent_p(L). And the two exponents are the ones that appear in the edge.\n\n                But note: the exponents for u (max_exp) and v (max_exp_v) are the minimum of the lcm exponents from their respective incident edges. And the maximum exponent from the lcm exponents for node u is the smallest lcm exponent for p that appears in any edge incident to u.\n\n                Then, we require that:\n\n                    max_exp = min(exponent_p(L), max_exp_v) ??? \n\n                Actually, we require that the two exponents (max_exp and max_exp_v) are exactly the two values: exponent_p(g) and exponent_p(L).\n\n                And note: from the edge, we know that the minimum of the two is exponent_p(g) and the maximum is exponent_p(L).\n\n                So, we must have:\n\n                    max_exp = exponent_p(L) and max_exp_v = exponent_p(g)   OR\n                    max_exp = exponent_p(g) and max_exp_v = exponent_p(L)\n\n                But wait, the definition of max_exp for u is the minimum of the exponents of p in the lcm's of edges incident to u. And similarly, max_exp_v for v is the minimum of the exponents of p in the lcm's of edges incident to v.\n\n                Now, consider: the edge (u, v) has lcm exponent = exponent_p(L). Then, the minimum of the lcm exponents for u (max_exp) must be at most exponent_p(L) (and similarly for v). But we require that the set {max_exp, max_exp_v} = {exponent_p(g), exponent_p(L)}.\n\n                However, note: the edge (u, v) is one of the edges incident to u, so max_exp (which is the minimum of the lcm exponents for u) is <= exponent_p(L). Similarly, max_exp_v <= exponent_p(L). \n\n                But we also have that the gcd exponent for the edge is exponent_p(g) which is <= exponent_p(L).\n\n                And the condition for the edge is that the minimum of (max_exp, max_exp_v) must be exponent_p(g). \n\n                Since max_exp and max_exp_v are both <= exponent_p(L), and the minimum is exponent_p(g), then one of them must be exponent_p(g) and the other must be exponent_p(L).\n\n                But note: we defined max_exp as the minimum of the lcm exponents (across edges incident to u) and similarly for v. \n\n                Then, we must have:\n\n                    max_exp = exponent_p(L) and max_exp_v = exponent_p(g)   OR   max_exp = exponent_p(g) and max_exp_v = exponent_p(L)\n\n                But wait, how can max_exp (the minimum of the lcm exponents for u) be exponent_p(L)? Only if all lcm exponents for u are exponent_p(L). Similarly, if max_exp = exponent_p(g), then the minimum of the lcm exponents for u is exponent_p(g). \n\n                However, note: the edge (u, v) is incident to u, so the lcm exponent for u in this edge is exponent_p(L). Then, the minimum of the lcm exponents for u (max_exp) is at most exponent_p(L). But if there is another edge incident to u that has a smaller lcm exponent for p, then max_exp would be that smaller one.\n\n                Therefore, the above condition fails.\n\n    After rethinking, a better way is:\n\n        For each prime p, consider the entire graph and the edges. The exponent of p in A[u] must be:\n\n            For an edge (u, v): \n                Let a = exponent_p(g), b = exponent_p(L).\n                Then, the exponents of p in A[u] and A[v] are a and b (in some order).\n\n        Then, we can set up a system: \n\n            For each edge (u, v) and prime p, we have two possibilities.\n\n        But note: the entire graph must be consistent. We can use a union-find or BFS/DFS to assign the exponents for each prime independently.\n\n        Steps for a fixed prime p:\n\n            Let the graph G_p have an edge (u, v) if the edge (u, v) has gcd containing p (i.e., exponent_p(g) > 0) or lcm containing p (exponent_p(L) > 0). But actually, we care about the exponents.\n\n            Then, for an edge (u, v) with exponent_p(g) = a and exponent_p(L)=b, we know that the exponents for u and v must be a and b.\n\n            Then, we can do a BFS/DFS on the graph (considering all nodes) and for each edge, we assign the exponents.\n\n            However, note: an edge might be used to set the exponent for one node and then the other node is determined. But if the graph is not connected, then we have to consider each connected component.\n\n        Algorithm for a fixed prime p:\n\n            Let E[u] be the exponent of p in A[u]. Initially, we don't know any.\n\n            For each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm L, let a = exponent_p(g), b = exponent_p(L). Then, we know that {E[u], E[v]} = {a, b}.\n\n            We can traverse the graph (for the edges that contain p) and assign:\n\n                If we know E[u] and see an edge (u, v), then E[v] must be the other value.\n\n            However, there might be multiple edges incident to a node. \n\n            Conditions:\n\n                For an edge (u, v) with a, b: \n                    If we already know E[u] and E[v] is not known, then set E[v] = b if E[u] == a, or a if E[u] == b? Actually, {E[u], E[v]} = {a, b}. So if E[u] is a, then E[v] must be b; if E[u] is b, then E[v] must be a.\n\n                But what if we know E[u] and E[v] is already set by another edge? Then we check consistency.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Build a graph for prime p: only edges that have a>0 or b>0 (but actually, if an edge has a=0 and b=0, then we skip? But note: if a prime p does not appear in the gcd or lcm, then the exponents for both nodes are 0. However, our condition for the edge requires that the gcd and lcm are given and we are factorizing them, so if p doesn't divide g or L, then a=b=0 and then {E[u], E[v]} = {0,0}. But then, the assignment is trivial.\n\n                However, we are iterating over primes that appear in at least one gcd or lcm.\n\n            Then, for each connected component in the graph for prime p:\n\n                Pick a starting node, and set its exponent arbitrarily to one of the two values from an incident edge? But wait, we don't know which value is which.\n\n            Actually, we can start by assigning a value to a node if there is at least one edge incident to it. But note: the node might not appear in any edge for this prime? Then we can leave it as 0.\n\n            However, the condition for an edge (u, v) with a, b (both >0) requires that the exponents are a and b. If a==0 or b==0, then we have a special case.\n\n            But note: our input says gcd and lcm are at least 1, so if p does not divide the gcd, then a=0, and similarly for lcm.\n\n            Then, the condition is: the exponents for u and v must be 0 and b (if a=0) or a and 0 (if b=0) or a and b (if both nonzero). \n\n            However, if a=0 and b>0, then one node must have exponent 0 and the other must have exponent b.\n\n            So, we can treat:\n\n                Case 1: a>0 and b>0: then the two exponents are a and b.\n                Case 2: a=0 and b>0: then the two exponents are 0 and b.\n                Case 3: a>0 and b=0: then the two exponents are a and 0.\n                Case 4: a=0 and b=0: then the two exponents are 0 and 0.\n\n            Then, we can build a graph for prime p and do a BFS/DFS for each connected component",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (node) in a forest map given some roads (edges) with their respective GCD and LCM values. The solution involves verifying the consistency of these values across all edges and nodes, ensuring that the GCD and LCM conditions are met for each edge.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prime Factorization Analysis**: For each edge, factorize the GCD and LCM into their prime factors. This helps in understanding the exponents of each prime in the numbers assigned to the connected nodes.\n2. **Exponent Assignment**: For each prime number, determine the exponents in the numbers assigned to the nodes. For an edge connecting nodes `u` and `v` with GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the exponents of each prime in `g` must be the minimum of the exponents in the numbers assigned to `u` and `v`, and the exponents in `l` must be the maximum.\n3. **Graph Traversal**: Using BFS or DFS, traverse the graph for each prime to ensure that the exponent assignments are consistent across all edges. If any inconsistency is found, the arrangement is impossible.\n4. **Validation**: After processing all primes, verify if the constructed numbers for each node satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions for all edges. If they do, output the numbers; otherwise, report impossibility.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\nimport math\n\ndef factorize(n):\n    factors

This helps in understanding the exponents of each prime in the numbers assigned to the connected nodes.\n2. **Graph Construction**: A graph is built where each node represents a lawn, and edges represent the roads with their GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Exponent Assignment**: For each prime number, the code traverses the graph to assign exponents to the nodes. The exponents must satisfy the condition that for each edge, the minimum exponent is from the GCD and the maximum from the LCM.\n4. **Validation**: After processing all primes, the code constructs the mushroom counts for each node by multiplying the primes raised to their assigned exponents. If the conditions are satisfied, it outputs \"YES\" followed by the mushroom counts; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of restoring the mushroom counts by leveraging prime factorization and graph traversal, ensuring correctness through consistent exponent assignments across all edges.",
