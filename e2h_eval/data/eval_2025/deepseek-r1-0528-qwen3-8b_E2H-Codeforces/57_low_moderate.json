His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n, x\n   list a of n integers (first tour points)\n   list b of n integers (second tour points)\n\n We know that Vasya is one of the participants, but we don't know which one. However, we know that there is at least one participant (Vasya) such that ai + bj >= x.\n\n The problem: find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that each participant has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second.\n    Since the input gives two lists (a for first tour, b for second tour), we must consider that the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n 2. We are to consider all possible pairings? Actually, we can assign the two lists arbitrarily (because the problem says the results are given in arbitrary order). \n    But note: the two lists are given as two separate lists of n numbers, and each participant is represented by one number from the first list and one from the second list.\n\n 3. However, we are not told which participant is which. So we can think of it as: we have two sets of numbers (the first tour and the second tour) and we form pairs (one from each set) for each participant.\n\n    But note: the problem states that \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so we are forming n pairs (each participant has one from the first and one from the second).\n\n 4. We are only concerned with the total score (sum of the two tours) for each participant.\n\n    Let S = [a_i + b_j] for the participant, but note: the assignment must be such that each a_i is used exactly once and each b_j is used exactly once? \n\n    Actually, no: the problem says the teacher has the results of the first and second tour (two lists of n numbers) but without names. So we can assign arbitrarily. \n\n    However, the catch: Vasya is one specific participant. But we don't know which one. But we know that there is at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n 5. How to approach?\n\n    We need to consider two things:\n\n    - Best place: we want to maximize Vasya's total (so we assign him the highest possible total) and then minimize the number of participants who have a higher total than his.\n\n    - Worst place: we want to minimize Vasya's total (but at least x? Actually, wait: the problem says \"at least x points for both tours\", meaning that Vasya's total is at least x. But note: the input condition says that there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x. However, we are free to assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n    However, note: the entire assignment must use each element of the first list and each element of the second list exactly once.\n\n    But wait: actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so the entire set of participants is defined by the multiset of pairs (a_i, b_j) for i from 0 to n-1 and j from 0 to n-1, but we are using each a_i and each b_j exactly once? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour (so two lists of n numbers). Then we form n pairs (each participant gets one from the first and one from the second) and we use each element exactly once. So it's a perfect matching between the two lists.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not specify that the same participant's two scores come from the same index. So we are allowed to assign arbitrarily.\n\n    Therefore, the entire set of participants' total scores is the set of sums from all pairs (a_i, b_j) for a fixed matching. But note: the matching is arbitrary. \n\n    But wait: the problem does not require that we use each a_i and each b_j exactly once? Actually, yes: because there are n participants and n scores in each list, and each participant gets one from the first and one from the second.\n\n    So we have to consider that the set of all participants' totals is the set of all possible sums from a pair (a_i, b_j) for the entire matching. However, we cannot try all matchings because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n 6. Alternative approach:\n\n    We are only concerned with Vasya's total and how many other participants have a total greater than or equal to Vasya's total (with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury).\n\n    For the best place:\n\n        We want to assign Vasya the highest possible total (so that as few as possible participants have a total >= his). \n\n        But note: we are constrained by the entire set of a and b",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on the given points from two tours. The key insight is that Vasya's total points must be at least `x`, and we need to consider all possible pairings of the participants' scores from the first and second tours to find the optimal scenarios for his placement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We have two lists of integers representing the points from the first and second tours.\n   - Each participant is assigned one score from each list, and their total is the sum of these two scores.\n   - The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) place Vasya can get, given that his total points are at least `x`.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Place**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we should assign him the highest possible total score (or the highest score that allows him to be ranked as high as possible). This involves pairing his score with the highest available score from the other list to maximize his total.\n   - **Worst Place**: To minimize his rank, we should assign him the lowest possible total score (but still at least `x`) and ensure as many other participants as possible have higher totals than him.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Binary Search**: For the best place scenario, we use binary search to find the minimal total score that ensures Vasya's rank is as high as possible.\n   - **Two Pointers**: For the worst place scenario, we use a two-pointer technique to count how many participants can have totals greater than Vasya's minimal valid total.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting the lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - Binary search and two-pointer operations are O(n) or O(log n), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    def count_greater_or_equal(tot):\n        count = 0\n        j = n - 1\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] > tot:\n                count += 1\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        return count\n\n    def best_place():\n        low, high = 0, 400000\n        ans = 400000\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if count_greater_or_equal(mid) >= n:\n                ans = mid\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        return ans\n\n    def worst_place():\n        low, high = 0, 400000\n        ans = 400000\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if count_greater_or_equal(mid) < n:\n                ans = mid\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        return ans\n\n    best_score = best_place()\n    worst_score = worst_place()\n\n    def find_rank(score):\n        count_stronger = 0\n        j = n - 1\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] > score:\n                count_stronger += 1\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        return count_stronger + 1\n\n    best_rank = find_rank(best_score)\n    worst_rank = find_rank(worst_score)\n\n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required points `x`, and the two lists of scores from the two tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing during the binary search and two-pointer operations.\n3. **Binary Search for Best Place**: The `best_place` function uses binary search to find the minimal total score such that when paired, Vasya's rank is as high as possible. The `count_greater_or_equal` function counts how many participants have totals greater than or equal to a given score.\n4. **Binary Search for Worst Place**: The `worst_place` function similarly uses binary search but aims to find the minimal total score ensuring Vasya's rank is as low as possible.\n5. **Rank Calculation**: The `find_rank` function determines Vasya's rank based on his total score by counting how many participants have higher totals.\n6. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible scenarios using sorting and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
