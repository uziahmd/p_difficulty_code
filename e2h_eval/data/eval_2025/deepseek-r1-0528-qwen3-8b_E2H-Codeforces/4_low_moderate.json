The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), Nikephoros uses the character at position (i mod len(A)) in A,\n and Polycarpus uses the character at position (i mod len(B)) in B.\n\n Then, according to the rules:\n   - If they choose the same, then no red spot.\n   - Otherwise, one loses and gets a red spot.\n\n However, simulating n rounds when n can be up to 2e9 is impossible by direct simulation.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B). The entire game will cycle with period LCM(m, k) because both sequences repeat.\n\n But note: the total rounds n might not be a multiple of LCM(m,k). However, we can break the problem into two steps:\n\n Step 1: Precompute the outcome for one full cycle (of length T = LCM(m, k)) and then multiply by the number of full cycles.\n Step 2: Then handle the remaining rounds (n % T).\n\n However, note that the sequences are independent and the outcomes depend on the pair (A[i], B[j]) for i+j? Actually, we index by round.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   For round r (0-indexed), we have:\n        a_r = A[r % m]\n        b_r = B[r % k]\n\n We are to count the number of rounds where:\n        (a_r, b_r) is a losing pair for Nikephoros (so that Polycarpus wins) OR for Polycarpus (so that Nikephoros wins).\n\n How do we define a losing pair for Nikephoros?\n   According to the rules:\n      Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n      Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n      Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n So if Nikephoros shows R and Polycarpus shows S -> Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n If Nikephoros shows R and Polycarpus shows P -> Polycarpus wins (because P beats R) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n Similarly, we can define the outcomes.\n\n Alternatively, we can define a function that, given two characters, returns 0 for draw, 1 if the first wins, -1 if the first loses.\n\n But note: we want to count the losses for each player.\n\n Actually, we want:\n   For each round, if the outcome is a win for Nikephoros, then Polycarpus gets a red spot (counted for Polycarpus) and vice versa.\n\n Let's map:\n\n   Outcome for round (x, y):\n        if x == y: draw -> no red spot for either.\n        else:\n            if (x, y) is one of the winning pairs for x, then x doesn't get a spot, but y does.\n            if (x, y) is one of the winning pairs for y, then y doesn't get a spot, but x does.\n\n How about defining a dictionary or function for the outcome?\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute a table for the 9 possible pairs:\n\n   For a pair (a, b):\n        if a == b: draw\n        else if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: then a wins (so a doesn't get a spot, b does)\n        else: then b wins (so b doesn't get a spot, a does)\n\n But note: the condition for a win is that the pair (a,b) is one of the three above. Otherwise, the other way.\n\n Alternatively, we can assign values:\n\n   Let:\n        R: 0, S: 1, P: 2\n\n   Then the winning condition: \n        (0,1): R vs S -> R wins? Actually, no: in our condition, R beats S, so (0,1) should be a win for the first (if first is R and second is S, then first wins) -> so (0,1) is win for first.\n\n   But let's check: \n        (0,1): R vs S -> R wins -> first wins -> so second loses (so first doesn't get a spot, second does).\n        (1,2): S vs P -> S wins? Actually, no: S vs P: S beats P? Yes, so (1,2) -> first wins.\n        (2,0): P vs R -> P wins? Yes, so (2,0) -> first wins.\n\n   Now, what about the other direction?\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The challenge lies in efficiently simulating the game without iterating through each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of rock, paper, or scissors. Each round's outcome depends on the current elements of their sequences. The goal is to count how many times each player loses (i.e., gets a red spot) over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined sequence repeats every `T = LCM(m, k)` rounds. This periodicity allows us to compute the outcomes for one full cycle and then multiply by the number of full cycles, handling the remaining rounds separately.\n3. **Efficiency**: Direct simulation for each round is infeasible for large `n`. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to reduce the problem size significantly. We precompute the outcomes for one full cycle (LCM of the sequence lengths) and then use these results to handle the entire game efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    B_str = data[2].strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n\n    T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    total_red_nike = 0\n    total_red_poly = 0\n\n    if full_cycles > 0:\n        for i in range(T):\n            a_char = A_str[i % m]\n            b_char = B_str[i % k]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n                total_red_poly += 1\n            else:\n                total_red_nike += 1\n\n        total_red_nike *= full_cycles\n        total_red_poly *= full_cycles\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            total_red_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_red_nike += 1\n\n    print(f\"{total_red_nike} {total_red_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The combined cycle length `T` is computed as the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B`.\n3. **Full Cycles Handling**: For each full cycle, we determine the number of times each player loses by comparing corresponding elements from `A` and `B`. The results are multiplied by the number of full cycles to get the total losses for these cycles.\n4. **Remaining Rounds**: The remaining rounds after processing full cycles are handled individually to account for any partial cycles.\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging periodicity, reducing the problem to manageable computations.",
