    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n 2. Since the string length is small (<=100), we can do nested loops.\n\n However, note: we want the longest one. So we can iterate from the longest possible substring (which is n-1) down to 1 until we find a duplicate.\n\n But note: if we start from the longest, then we can break early. However, we must check for every substring of that length.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a set for each length? But we are iterating from long to short, so we can:\n\n Approach 1:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   For L in range(n, 0, -1):   # L is the length of substring\n        seen = set()\n        found_duplicate = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                found_duplicate = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n        if found_duplicate:\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)\n\n   If no duplicate found for any L, then output 0.\n\n But wait, the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two or more. The above loop breaks at the first duplicate found for a given L, but that's okay because we are looking for the maximum L.\n\n However, what if there are two different substrings of the same length that are duplicates? Actually, we only need one duplicate to say that there is a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the above method will break as soon as we find one duplicate for a given L. Then we output L and exit.\n\n But what if there is a longer substring that also has a duplicate? We are iterating from the longest (n) down to 1, so we will find the longest one first.\n\n Example: \n   Input \"ababa\" -> expected output 3 (substring \"aba\" appears twice, overlapping).\n   Let's check with our method for L=5: substring \"ababa\" -> only one occurrence? \n        Actually, the entire string is one substring. Then for L=4: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicates?\n        Then for L=3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> found duplicate \"aba\".\n\n So that matches.\n\n However, we must note: the substring occurrences can overlap. Our method considers overlapping because we are taking consecutive substrings.\n\n But wait: what if the same substring appears non-overlapping? That's fine too.\n\n But note: the example \"zzz\": \n   Substrings of length 3: \"zzz\" (only one occurrence) -> no duplicate for L=3.\n   Then L=2: substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate found. So output 2.\n\n But the sample output for \"zzz\" is 2.\n\n However, the sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\n But wait, what about \"abcd\"? There are no duplicates, so we go down to L=1. \n   For L=1: each character is a substring. \n        'a' -> first occurrence, then 'b' -> new, then 'c', then 'd'. No duplicates.\n\n So we output 0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"longest substring that can be met at least twice\". In \"abcd\", no substring (even of length 1) is repeated, so the answer is 0.\n\n However, we must be cautious: what if the substring of length 0? But the problem states non-empty string and we are starting from n down to 1.\n\n But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n However, the above approach might be inefficient if we do set operations for every L from n down to 1, but since n<=100, the worst-case is when we have to check all lengths. \n\n The total number of substrings is O(n^2). We are iterating by length from n to 1, and for each length we iterate over n-L+1 substrings.\n\n Worst-case: \n   L = n: 1 substring\n   L = n-1: 2 substrings\n   ...\n   L = 1: n substrings\n\n So total operations is about n*(n+1)/2, which is around 5050 for n=100. This is acceptable.\n\n But note: we break as soon as we find a duplicate for a given L. However, worst-case (like a string",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that repeats at least once. The key observation here is that overlapping occurrences are allowed, which simplifies the problem compared to non-overlapping cases.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length to see if any appear more than once. The first length where a duplicate is found is our answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a nested loop approach. The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the string's length down to 1. For each length, the inner loop generates all substrings of that length and checks for duplicates using a set. If a duplicate is found, the current length is immediately returned as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the string length is at most 100, the worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to the triple nested loops (two for generating substrings and one for set operations). However, in practice, the solution is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The length of the string is stored in variable `n`.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the string is empty (though the problem guarantees it's non-empty), the solution outputs 0.\n3. **Outer Loop**: The loop starts from the string's length down to 1, checking for substrings of decreasing lengths.\n4. **Inner Loop**: For each substring length `L`, the loop generates all possible substrings of that length. Each substring is checked against a set of previously seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, the current length `L` is printed, and the program exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the program outputs 0, indicating no repeating substrings exist in the string.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging the fact that longer substrings are checked first, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
