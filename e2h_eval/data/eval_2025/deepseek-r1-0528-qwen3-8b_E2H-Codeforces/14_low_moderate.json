He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n However, note that the problem asks for the number of n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing. However, it does not increase at every step. For example, when n=5, Z(5)=1; then n=6,7,8,9: still Z(n)=1 until n=10, then Z(10)=2.\n\n So, for a given m, we are to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". So we are looking for n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But observe: \n   For example, m=1: \n        n from 5 to 9 -> because Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, and Z(10)=2.\n\n Therefore, the set of n with exactly m trailing zeros is an interval? Not necessarily one contiguous block? Actually, no. The function Z(n) is non-decreasing and increases in steps. But note: once Z(n) becomes m, it remains m until n reaches the next multiple of 5 (or higher power) that causes an additional zero.\n\n However, note that Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5. So between two consecutive multiples of 5, the value of Z(n) remains constant. Therefore, for a fixed m, the set of n with Z(n)=m will be a contiguous range of integers, unless there is no such n.\n\n But wait, what if m is very large? How do we find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m? Then we can find the lower bound and the upper bound.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the smallest integer n_low such that Z(n_low) >= m.\n    However, note: we want Z(n)=m. So we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, and then check if Z(n_low) == m? Actually, we need to find the minimal n0 such that Z(n0) = m. But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing, so the numbers n for which Z(n)=m form an interval [a, b] (if they exist) where:\n        a = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m and also Z(a) = m (but note: it might jump over m? Actually, no: Z(n) increases by the number of factors of 5 in n (when n is a multiple of 5). The increase is at least 1 (if n is divisible by 5 but not by 25, then we add 1; if divisible by 25 and not 125, then we add 2, etc.). \n\n  However, the function Z(n) is defined as the sum of the digits in base 5? No, but we can compute it.\n\n  Actually, we can use binary search to find the minimal n such that Z(n) >= m. Let's call this n_low.\n\n  Then, we need to check: what is Z(n_low)? It must be at least m. But we are looking for exactly m. However, note that Z(n) is non-decreasing and only increases by the number of factors of 5. So the minimal n0 such that Z(n0) = m is n_low, but wait: if Z(n_low) > m, then there is no n such that Z(n)=m? Because we skipped m.\n\n  Example: m=2. \n      n=5: Z(5)=1\n      n=10: Z(10)=2 -> so n_low for m=2 would be 10, and Z(10)=2 -> good.\n      m=3:\n          n=10: Z(10)=2\n          n=15: Z(15)= floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3 -> so n_low=15, and Z(15)=3.\n\n  But consider m=4:\n      n=20: Z(20)= floor(20/5)+floor(20/25)=4+0",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the number of 5s in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( Z(n) = \\lfloor n/5 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/25 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/125 \\rfloor + \\ldots \\) until the division yields zero. This formula counts the number of times 5 appears in the factorization of all numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). This \\( n \\) will be the lower bound of our answer. Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\), which gives us the upper bound. The valid range of \\( n \\) values where \\( Z(n) = m \\) lies between these two bounds.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., if the lower bound for \\( m+1 \\) is greater than the lower bound for \\( m \\)), then there are no solutions. Otherwise, all integers between the two bounds inclusive will satisfy \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    def binary_search_lower_bound(target):\n        low, high = 0, 5 * target\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if zeros < target:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n\n    low_bound = binary_search_lower_bound(m)\n    next_bound = binary_search_lower_bound(m + 1)\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low_bound) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = next_bound - low_bound\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(low_bound, next_bound))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **binary_search_lower_bound(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times \\text{target} \\), ensuring we cover all possible values of \\( n \\) efficiently.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the lower and upper bounds for \\( n \\) using binary search, checks if there exists any \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), and then prints the count of such \\( n \\) along with the values themselves if they exist.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of \\( Z(n) \\) to ensure correctness and optimal performance.",
