При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it is the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions for error:\n  - The two messages are identical and of length n (so the original transmission would have been s+s without error).\n  - There is an overlap: the last k characters of the first s match the first k characters of the second s, where 0 < k < n.\n  - The resulting string is then: s[0: n-k] + s[k: n] + s[0: n] ??? Actually, no. The entire first s is sent, then the second s is sent and overlapped by the first part of the second s.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"the two messages are overlapped, and the end of the first is merged with the beginning of the second by matching characters\"\n\n So, if we have two copies of s, and they are overlapped by k (with 0 < k < n), then the transmitted string becomes:\n\n   t = s + s[k:]   [but note: the first s is complete, then the second s is appended but the first k characters of the second s were already the last k of the first s?]\n\n Actually, the example: \n   s = \"abrakadabra\", then one possible t is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n How do we get that?\n   For overlap k=1: \n        First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Second s: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Overlap: the last 1 character of the first s is 'a', and the first 1 character of the second s is 'a'. So the merged string is:\n            s + s[1:] but wait, actually we are not repeating the entire second s? \n\n Let me re-read: \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\". So the second message's beginning (at least the overlapping part) is skipped because it was already provided by the end of the first.\n\n Therefore, the total string is: s + (s without the first k characters). But note: the first s is fully transmitted, and then the second s is transmitted but the first k characters of the second s are omitted because they are the same as the last k of the first.\n\n However, the problem also says that the entire two messages (each being s) are transmitted, but due to an error, the two messages become merged. The merging condition: the last k characters of the first must equal the first k of the second.\n\n Then the resulting string is: \n      t = s + s[k:]\n\n But note: the example: \n      s = \"abrakadabra\", k=4 -> then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" (without the first 4) -> so we get \"abrakadabra\" + s[4:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrakadabra\", which matches.\n\n But wait, the example also says: \n      t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" for k=1: \n          s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is correct.\n\n However, note that the entire string t has length n + (n - k) = 2*n - k.\n\n Conditions for the problem:\n   We are to decide if there exists a string s and an integer k (1<=k<n) such that:\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n Also note: the problem states that if the entire two messages are overlapped (i.e., k = n) then that is not considered an error. Similarly, if there is no overlap (k=0) then that is just concatenation without error.\n\n But note: the problem also says: \n        \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" -> meaning k=n is not allowed as an error? Actually, the condition is: the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text (so k from 1 to n-1). And also, if there is no overlap (k=0) then it's just the concatenation, which is not an error.\n\n However, note that the problem also says: \n        \"if the message t is not the result of an error, output 'NO'\"\n\n And an example: \n        Input: \"abcabc\" -> Output: \"NO\"\n\n Why? Because \"abcabc\" can be written as s = \"abc\", and then without any error we have s+s = \"abcabc\". But the problem says: \n        \"Analogically, simple concatenation without an error is not considered as an error.\"\n\n However, wait: the problem says that if there is an error, then the two messages are merged by overlapping. But note: the error condition requires that the two messages are identical and that the overlapping part exists. In the case of \"abcabc\", we can consider that there was no error, so we output \"NO\".\n\n But note: the problem also says: \n        \"if the message t is the result of an error, then output 'YES' and the string s\"\n\n However, the same string t might be interpreted in two ways: \n        Without error: t = s1 + s2, where s1 = s and s2 = s (so s1 and s2 are the same, but no overlap). \n        With error: t = s + s[k:] for some k (1<=k<n)\n\n But the problem says: we should output 'NO' only if it is not the result of an error. However, note that the same t might be explained by both? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"if it is possible that this message contains an error\"\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the error must be the only explanation. It says: \n        \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети\"\n\n So if there is at least one way to explain t by an error (with k in [1, n-1]), then we output YES and one possible s.\n\n However, what if t can be explained by an error and also by no error? Then we still output YES.\n\n But note: the problem says that the error condition requires that the two messages are identical. So the no-error case is two identical messages concatenated with no overlap. The error case is two identical messages concatenated with an overlap (and the overlapping part is positive and less than the length of the message).\n\n Now, note that the same t might be broken in multiple ways. We are allowed to output any s.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t). We are looking for an integer k (1 <= k < n) and a string s such that:\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n Also, note that s must be the same for the two parts. Moreover, the entire string t must be built from two copies of s, with the second copy overlapping the first by k.\n\n How to find s?\n        We know that the first part of t is s (of length n1) and the second part is s[k:] (of length n - n1 = n - (n - k) ? Let me clarify:\n\n        Actually, the entire string t has length = |s| + |s| - k = 2*n_s - k, where n_s = len(s).\n\n        But note: we don't know n_s. However, we can consider that the string t is composed of two copies of s, so the length of s must be such that: \n            Let n_s be the length of s, then we have: \n                t = s + s[k:]   => total length = n_s + (n_s - k) = 2*n_s - k.\n\n        Also, note that the entire t must satisfy that the first n_s characters are s, and then the next (n_s - k) characters are the rest of s (starting at index k). But wait, the second part is s[k:], which has length n_s - k.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the entire string t must be equal to s repeated twice, but with an overlap of k. Therefore, the total length of t must be 2*n_s - k, and we also have that k is between 1 and n_s-1.\n\n        However, we don't know n_s. But note: the string t is fixed. \n\n Another approach:\n\n        We are going to consider the possibility that t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap of k. Then the entire t must be a prefix of two copies of s. \n\n        Also, note that the string t must start with s (which is of length n_s) and then continue with the rest of s (without the first k characters). \n\n        But note: the entire t must also be consistent with two copies of s. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n        Let n = len(t). Then the length of s must be at least ceil(n/2) because we have two copies (with overlap) so the total length is 2*n_s - k, and k>=1 so n <= 2*n_s - 1, so n_s >= ceil((n+1)/2). But note: the entire t must be built from two copies of s, so the length of s must be at least floor((n+1)/2) or something else?\n\n        Actually, we can consider that the string t must have a period of n_s? Not exactly.\n\n        Let me reframe: \n            We have t = s + s[k:]   => which is equivalent to: \n            Let m = n_s (the length of s). Then t[0:m] = s, and t[m:] = s[k:].\n\n        But also, note that the second part of t (from index m to the end) must be the same as the substring of s starting at index k and of length (m - k). \n\n        Moreover, we know that the entire t is of length m + (m - k) = 2*m - k.\n\n        So we have: 2*m - k = n.\n\n        And k must be in [1, m-1].\n\n        Therefore, m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) (because k<=m-1, then 2*m - (m-1) = m+1 >= n, so m>=n-? Let me solve for m: \n            n = 2*m - k, and 1<=k<=m-1, so n = 2*m - k => k = 2*m - n, and 1 <= 2*m - n <= m-1.\n\n        From 1 <= 2*m - n <= m-1, we can derive:\n            Lower bound: 2*m - n >= 1  => m >= (n+1)/2\n            Upper bound: 2*m - n <= m-1 => m <= n-1\n\n        So m is in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1]. \n\n        But note: the entire string t must be built from two copies of s, and s is the first m characters of t? Not necessarily, because the problem says that the two messages are identical. \n\n        However, the first m characters are s, so we can let s = t[0:m]. Then the remaining part of t (from index m to the end) must equal s[k:] = t[m:][0: m-k] (because the length of the remaining part is (2*m - k) - m = m-k). \n\n        But wait, the length of t is 2*m - k, so the second part is of length (2*m - k) - m = m - k.\n\n        Condition: t[m: m + (m-k)] must equal s[k:].\n\n        But note: s = t[0:m], and s[k:] = t[k: m] (if we take the substring from index k to the end of s). However, the second part of t is from index m to m+(m-k)-1, and its length is m-k. \n\n        But we require that the second part of t is exactly s[k:]. So:\n\n            t[m: m + (m-k)] == t[k: k + (m-k)] = t[k: m]\n\n        However, wait: s[k:] is t[k: m] (if we assume s = t[0:m]). Then the condition is:\n\n            t[m: m + (m-k)] == t[k: m]\n\n        But note: the length of t[k: m] is (m - k). So we require:\n\n            t[m: m + (m-k)] == t[k: m]\n\n        And we also have that the total length of t is 2*m - k, so the last part goes from m to 2*m - k - 1, and the length is (2*m - k - m) = m - k, which is the same as the length of t[k: m].\n\n        Therefore, for a candidate m (with m in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1]), we can set:\n            s = t[0:m]\n            k = 2*m - n   (because n = 2*m - k, so k = 2*m - n)\n\n        Then we check that k is in the range [1, m-1] (which we ensured by our choice of m) and that the substring t[m: m+(m-k)] equals t[k: m].\n\n        However, note: k = 2*m - n must be an integer and we have defined m so that k is an integer.\n\n        But wait, we also need to ensure that the entire t is built from two copies of s with that specific k.\n\n        However, note: the condition above only checks the beginning of the second part. But note the entire t is built from two copies of s: the first copy is s, and the second copy is s[k:]. \n\n        Actually, the entire t is: \n            t = s + s[k:]\n\n        And s = t[0:m] and s[k:] = t[k: m] (if we take s as the first m characters). Then the second part of t (from index m) should be s[k:], which is t[k: m] (which is of length m-k). \n\n        But wait, the second part of t is from index m to the end, and we are only checking the first m-k characters of that part? Actually, the second part is exactly s[k:], so we only check the first m-k characters (because the length of s[k:] is m-k). \n\n        However, note: the entire t is of length 2*m - k, and we have checked the entire t by construction? \n\n        Actually, we have defined s from the first m characters, and then the rest of the string (from m to the end) must be exactly s[k:]. \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            t[m: m + (m-k)] == t[k: m]\n\n        But note: the entire t is built from two copies of s, and we have taken the first m characters as s. Then the second copy of s (with the first k characters omitted) is s[k:], and we are comparing the next (m-k) characters of t to s[k:]. \n\n        This condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n        However, note: the entire string t must be exactly of the form s + s[k:]. We have set s = t[0:m] and then the rest is s[k:]. But what about the rest beyond the first (m-k) characters? \n\n        Actually, the total length is 2*m - k, and we are only using the first (m) + (m-k) = 2*m - k, so we are using the entire string. \n\n        Therefore, the condition is only on the first m characters and the next (m-k) characters.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Let n = len(t)\n        If n == 0: then ... but the input is non-empty.\n\n        We consider m from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). \n\n        For each m in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1]:\n            k = 2*m - n   (must be an integer and in [1, m-1])\n            Then, check that t[m: m+(m-k)] == t[k: m]\n\n            If we find one m that satisfies, then we can output:\n                \"YES\"\n                s = t[0:m]\n\n        But note: there might be multiple m. We are allowed to output any.\n\n        However, what if we don't find any m? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait: what about the example \"abcabc\"? \n            t = \"abcabc\", n=6.\n            We consider m from ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(7/2)=4 to 5 (since m<=n-1=5).\n\n            m=4: k = 2*4-6 = 2. Then we require:\n                s = t[0:4] = \"abca\"\n                Check: t[4: 4+(4-2)] = t[4:6] = \"bc\" and t[2:4] = \"ca\" -> \"bc\" != \"ca\", so not.\n\n            m=5: k=2*5-6=4. Then:\n                s = t[0:5] = \"abcab\"\n                Check: t[5:5+(5-4)] = t[5:6] = \"c\" and t[4:5] = \"b\" -> \"c\" != \"b\", so not.\n\n            So we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        Example: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (n=21)\n            We need to find m such that m in [ceil((21+1)/2)=11, 20] and k=2*m-21 is in [1, m-1].\n\n            Example: m=11, then k=2*11-21=1. Then check:\n                s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabr\" (wait, let's count: \"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters? Actually, \"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters: \n                    a b r a k a d a b r a -> 11.\n\n                Then the second part: from index 11 to 11+(11-1)=21, so the whole string from 11 to 20 (because the string length is 21, so index 20 is the last) -> that's 10 characters: \"brakadabra\"\n\n                Now, s[k:] = s[1:] = \"brakadabra\", which is exactly the substring from index11 to the end.\n\n                So condition holds.\n\n            Therefore, we output \"YES\" and s=\"abrakadabra\".\n\n        Example: \"acacacaca\" (n=9)\n            We consider m from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n            m=5: k=2*5-9=1 -> s=t[0:5]=\"acaca\", then check: t[5:5+(5-1)]=t[5:9]=\"caca\", and s[1:5]=\"cac\" -> \"caca\" vs \"cac\": not the same.\n\n            m=6: k=2*6-9=3 -> s=t[0:6]=\"acacac\", then check: t[6:6+(6-3)]=t[6:9]=\"aca\", and s[3:6]=\"cac\" -> \"aca\" vs \"cac\": no.\n\n            m=7: k=2*7-9=5 -> s=t[0:7]=\"acacaca\", then check: t[7:7+(7-5)]=t[7:9]=\"ca\", and s[5:7]=\"ac\" -> no.\n\n            m=8: k=2*8-9=7 -> s=t[0:8]=\"acacacac\", then check: t[8:8+(8-7)]=t[8:9]=\"a\", and s[7:8]=\"c\" -> no.\n\n            But wait, the example output says YES for \"acacacaca\", so there must be another way.\n\n            Let me try a different s: maybe s is not the first m characters? \n\n            Wait, note: the problem says the two messages are identical. The first message is s, and the second message is s. So the entire t is built by having the first s and then the second s with an overlap. \n\n            However, note: the first s is the entire first part. Therefore, the first s must be a contiguous substring at the beginning of t.\n\n            But wait, what if the first s is not the entire first m characters? \n\n            Actually, the problem does not specify the exact way the two messages are split. But note: the error occurs during transmission. The two messages are sent consecutively. The first message is s and the second is s. The error causes the end of the first to merge with the beginning of the second. So the entire string t is the first s (without error) and then the second s without the overlapping part.\n\n            Therefore, the first s is the initial part of t. \n\n            However, let me read the example again: \n                Input: ['acacacaca', ...] and output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n            How did they get acaca? \n\n            If s = \"acaca\", then the two copies would be \"acaca\" and \"acaca\". The overlap k must be such that the last k of the first copy matches the first k of the second.\n\n            For s=\"acaca\", the last k characters must be the same as the first k of \"acaca\". \n\n            Let's try k=1: last 1 of \"acaca\" is 'a', first 1 of \"acaca\" is 'a' -> so k=1 is valid. Then the merged string is:\n                s + s[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"cac\" -> \"acacacac\" (length 8). But our t is \"acacacaca\" (length 9). \n\n            k=2: last 2 of \"acaca\" is \"ca\", first 2 of \"acaca\" is \"ac\" -> not equal.\n\n            k=3: last 3 is \"aca\", first 3 is \"aca\" -> valid. Then the merged string is s + s[3:] = \"acaca\" + \"ca\" -> \"acacaca\" (length 7).\n\n            k=4: last 4 is \"caca\", first 4 is \"acac\" -> not equal.\n\n            k=5: not allowed (k must be less than n=5).\n\n            So with s=\"acaca\", we cannot get a string of length 9.\n\n            But wait, the example output says \"acacaca\" (with 7 letters) is not the string t? The example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 9 letters.\n\n            Let me check the example output: \n                Input: ['acacacaca'] -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n            So they claim s=\"acaca\" (5 letters) is the answer, but then the merged string should be 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k, and k must be in [1,4]. Then the length of t would be 10-k, which is 9,8,7,6. \n\n            We want 9: so k=1 -> 9, then the merged string is \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" (wait, s[1:] is \"cacac\")? \n                s = \"acaca\", s[1:] = \"cacac\", so the merged string is \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"acacacacac\" (10 characters). That doesn't match.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example intended s=\"acaca\" and k=1, then the merged string is \"acaca\" + s[1:5] (which is \"cac\")? Then the total length is 5+3=8, but we have 9.\n\n            I see the confusion: the example input is \"acacacaca\", which is 9 characters. \n\n            Let me break down \"acacacaca\":\n                It can be broken as: \n                    Option 1: two copies of \"acaca\" (5 letters) with k=1: \n                        First copy: \"acaca\"\n                        Second copy: \"acaca\" but overlapped by 1: so we drop the first 'a' of the second copy? Then we get \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" -> \"acacacacac\" (10 letters) -> no.\n\n            Let me try with s=\"acacac\" (6 letters): \n                Then k must be from 1 to 5.\n                The merged string: s + s[k:] \n                We want the merged string to be 9 letters: 6 + (6-k)=9 -> k=3.\n\n                Check: last 3 of \"acacac\" is \"cac\", first 3 is \"aca\" -> not equal.\n\n            s=\"acacaca\" (7 letters): k=2 -> 7+5=12 -> too long.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the two messages are not of the same length? The problem says two identical messages.\n\n            Let me read the problem again: \"two identical messages\". So the two messages are the same.\n\n            Another possibility: the error condition is that the two messages are identical and the overlapping part is positive and less than the length. But note: the example output says YES for \"acacacaca\", and the string s is \"acaca\".\n\n            How can \"acacacaca\" be formed by two copies of \"acaca\" with an error?\n\n            Let me write the two copies of \"acaca\":\n                Copy1: \"acaca\"\n                Copy2: \"acaca\"\n\n            We want to merge them by overlapping. The condition is that the last k characters of copy1 must equal the first k of copy2.\n\n            k=1: last char of copy1 is 'a', first of copy2 is 'a' -> valid. Then we drop the first k of copy2 (which is 'a') so the second copy becomes \"caca\". Then the entire string is \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\" (which is 9 characters). \n\n            So the merged string is \"acacacaca\".\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: \n                s = \"acaca\", k=1, then the merged string is s + s[1:] -> \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\".\n\n            So the algorithm must consider that the second part is s[k:], which is from index k to the end of s. \n\n            But note: the length of s is 5, so s[1:] is \"caca\", which is 4 characters. Then the total length is 5+4=9.\n\n            How did we compute k earlier? We used k = 2*m - n. \n                Here, m=5, n=9, then k=10-9=1 -> correct.\n\n            So the algorithm already uses k=2*m-n. Then the condition is:\n\n                t[5:5+4] (because the second part is 4 characters) must equal s[1:5] (which is \"caca\").\n\n            Now, t[5:5+4] is \"caca\" (from index5 to index8: the 5th,6th,7th,8th characters of \"acacacaca\": \n                a c a c a c a c a\n                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n                indices 5 to 8: \"c a c a\" -> \"caca\", which matches.\n\n            So the algorithm should have found m=5.\n\n            Why didn't we check m=5? \n\n            We said m from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8. So we did check m=5.\n\n            Condition for m=5: \n                k = 2*5-9=1 -> valid (1<=1<5)\n                Then check: t[5:5+(5-1)] = t[5:9] = \"caca\", and s[1:5] = t[1:5] = \"caca\" -> wait, but s is defined as t[0:5] = \"acaca\", so s[1:5] is \"caca\". \n\n            So the condition is: t[5:9] == \"caca\", which is true.\n\n            Therefore, we output \"YES\" and s = \"acaca\".\n\n        But wait, in the example output we have: \n            Input: ['acacacaca', 'acacacaca'] -> Output: ['YES\\nacaca']\n\n        So the algorithm works.\n\n        However, note: the example input includes 'acacacaca' and the output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\n        But wait, the example input list is: \n            ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n        And the expected output is:\n            ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        Now, the fourth example: \"abababab\" (n=8)\n            We consider m from ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(4.5)=5 to 7.\n\n            m=5: k=2*5-8=2. Then s=t[0:5]=\"ababa\", and check: t[5:5+(5-2)]=t[5:8]=\"bab\", and s[2:5]=\"aba\" -> \"bab\" != \"aba\"\n\n            m=6: k=2*6-8=4. Then s=t[0:6]=\"ababab\", and check: t[6:6+(6-4)]=t[6:8]=\"ab\", and s[4:6]=\"ba\" -> \"ab\" != \"ba\"\n\n            m=7: k=2*7-8=6. Then s=t[0:7]=\"abababa\", and check: t[7:7+(7-6)]=t[7:8]=\"b\", and s[6:7]=\"a\" -> no.\n\n            So we output \"NO\", but the example output is \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n        Wait, there's a discrepancy. The example output says for \"abababab\": \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n        Let me analyze \"abababab\" with s=\"ababab\" (which is 6 letters). Then k must be 2*6 - 8 = 4. \n\n        Then the merged string should be: s + s[4:] = \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which is 8 letters.\n\n        Now, check the condition: \n            The first copy is \"ababab\", the second copy is \"ababab\". The overlap k=4: the last 4 of the first copy is \"abab\", and the first 4 of the second copy is \"abab\", so they match.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n        Why didn't we consider m=6? \n\n        In our algorithm, we iterate m from ceil((8+1)/2)=5 to 7 (n=8, so m from 5 to 7). We did consider m=6.\n\n        But wait, we defined k=2*m-n=2*6-8=4, then we checked: \n            s = t[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n            Then the second part of t is from index6 to 6+(6-4)=6+2=8 -> so from index6 to index7 (inclusive) -> \"ab\" (the 6th and 7th characters: 'a','b')\n            And s[4:] is \"ab\", so condition holds.\n\n        Why did I say above that we check t[6:8] and s[4:6]? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            t[6:6+(6-4)] = t[6:8] = \"ab\"\n            and s[4:6] = \"ab\"\n\n        So they are equal.\n\n        But in my previous calculation for m=6, I mistakenly wrote:\n            s[4:6] = \"ba\" -> that is wrong.\n\n        Let me break down s=\"ababab\":\n            index0: 'a'\n            index1: 'b'\n            index2: 'a'\n            index3: 'b'\n            index4: 'a'\n            index5: 'b'\n\n        So s[4:6] is from index4 to index5: \"a\" and \"b\" -> \"ab\".\n\n        Therefore, the condition holds for m=6.\n\n        So the algorithm should output \"YES\" and s=\"ababab\".\n\n        Why did I write \"ba\"? Because I thought s[4:6] would be the substring starting at index4 and taking 2 characters, but in Python, slicing is [start:stop] (stop is exclusive). \n\n        Correction: s[4:6] is from index4 to index5 (inclusive). \n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        Steps:\n          n = len(t)\n          found = False\n          for m in range(ceil((n+1)/2), n):   # m from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1\n              k = 2*m - n\n              if k < 1 or k >= m:   # k must be in [1, m-1] (so k>=1 and k < m) -> but note: k = 2*m - n, and we have m>=ceil((n+1)/2) so k>=1, and m<=n-1 so k = 2*m - n <= 2*(n-1)-n = n-2, and we require k < m. \n                  continue\n              # Now, we know k is in [1, m-1] (because our m is chosen so that k=2*m-n is at least 1 and at most m-1? Actually, we must check: from the equation, k = 2*m-n, and m in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] implies:\n              #   k_min = 2*ceil((n+1)/2) - n, and k_max = 2*(n-1)-n = n-2.\n              #   But we also require k < m, i.e., 2*m-n < m  => m < n, which is true because m<=n-1.\n\n              # Then, we check:\n              #   The first part of t is s = t[0:m]\n              #   The second part of t (from index m to the end) should be the substring of s starting at index k, and the length of that substring is (m-k). But note: the total length of t is 2*m - k, so the second part is from index m to m+(m-k)-1? Actually, the entire t is built from two copies: the first m characters (s) and then the next (m-k) characters (s[k:]).\n\n              # However, note: the second part is of length (m-k) and we are comparing with s[k:] which is of length m-k.\n\n              # Therefore, we require that the substring of t from index m to index m+(m-k)-1 equals s[k:].\n\n              # But note: the entire t has length n = 2*m - k, so the last index is n-1 = 2*m - k - 1, and we are checking from m to m+(m-k)-1, which is exactly the entire t? \n\n              # Actually, we are checking the entire t: the first m characters and then the next (m-k) characters.\n\n              # But wait, the total length is m + (m-k) = 2*m - k = n, so we are checking the entire string.\n\n              # However, the condition is: \n              #   t[m: m+(m-k)] == t[k: m+k] ??? \n\n              # Let me clarify: \n              #   The second copy is s[k:], which is of length (m-k). And we have taken s = t[0:m]. Then the second copy is stored in t from index m to the end. The end is at index m+(m-k)-1, and the entire t is from 0 to m+(m-k)-1.\n\n              # But note: the second copy s[k:] is exactly the substring of s from index k to the end (which is index m-1). \n\n              # Therefore, we need to check that the substring t[m: m+(m-k)] equals s[k:].\n\n              # However, s[k:] is t[k: m] (because s is t[0:m])?

And the second copy is placed at the position starting from m, so we are comparing t[m: m+(m-k)] with t[k: m].\n\n              # However, note: the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of `k` characters (where `0 < k < len(s)`). If such a string `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by two copies of `s` where the second copy starts immediately after the first `k` characters of the first copy. This means `t` can be split into three parts: the first `k` characters of `s`, the next `(len(s) - k)` characters of `s`, and then the remaining part of `s` (if any). However, since the entire `t` is constructed from two copies of `s` with an overlap, the total length of `t` must be `2 * len(s) - k`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `m` of `s` (from `ceil((n + 1)/2)` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `t`), we compute `k` as `2*m - n`. We then check if `k` is within the valid range `[1, m-1]`. If it is, we verify that the substring of `t` starting at position `m` matches the substring of `s` starting at position `k`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over all possible lengths `m` of `s` and checks the conditions mentioned above. If any valid `m` and `k` are found, it constructs `s` from the first `m` characters of `t` and verifies the overlap condition.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n^2) time in the worst case, where `n` is the length of `t`. This is because for each possible `m` (up to `n`), we perform a substring comparison of length up to `n`. Given the constraint `n ≤ 100`, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    found = False\n    start_m = (n + 1) // 2\n    for m in range(start_m, n):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= m:\n            continue\n            \n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n        end_index = m + (m - k)\n        if end_index > n:\n            continue\n            \n        part1 = t[m:m + (m - k)]\n        part2 = s_candidate[k:]\n        \n        if part1 == part2:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            return\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `t` is empty, the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `m` of `s` (from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n-1`), compute `k` as `2*m - n`.\n4. **Validation of `k`**: Ensure `k` is within the valid range `[1, m-1]`.\n5. **Substring Comparison**: Check if the substring of `t` starting at `m` matches the substring of `s` starting at `k`. If they match, print \"YES\" and `s`; otherwise, continue checking other lengths.\n6. **Output Result**: If no valid `s` is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by overlapping two identical strings `s`, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
