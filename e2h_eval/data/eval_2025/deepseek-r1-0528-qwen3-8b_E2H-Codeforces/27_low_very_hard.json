On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is about maximizing the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) by reversing exactly one contiguous interval in an array that only contains 1s and 2s.\n\n Since the array elements are only 1 and 2, a non-decreasing subsequence can be:\n   - Composed entirely of 1s.\n   - Composed entirely of 2s.\n   - A mix: starting with one or more 1s and then one or more 2s.\n\n Without any reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. But we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n Observation:\n The entire sequence is made of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in the final sequence can be:\n\n Option 1: We might have a long run of 1s, then a long run of 2s.\n\n However, note that reversing a part might change the order of 1s and 2s.\n\n Let's denote:\n   total_ones = total number of 1s in the entire array.\n   total_twos = n - total_ones\n\n Without reversal, the LNDS is:\n   max( total_ones, total_twos + (the contiguous ones of 1s that might be broken by the reversal? Actually, without reversal, the entire array is fixed.)\n\n But wait, without reversal, the LNDS is simply the maximum between:\n   (a) the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing? Actually, the array might not be sorted.\n\n However, because the array has only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is actually the entire set of 1s and then 2s, but we can also take all the 1s and then as many 2s as possible that appear after the last 1? Actually, no: the subsequence doesn't require contiguous elements, so we can interleave? But note: non-decreasing allows 1 then 2, but we cannot use a 2 that appears before a 1 if we are going for a mixed sequence? Actually, we can skip arbitrarily.\n\n Actually, in an array of 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire set of 1s and then all the 2s that occur after the last 1? Not exactly: we can also have a sequence that uses some 2s that are before the last 1 if they are at the beginning? Actually, no: the condition is non-decreasing, so if we have a 2 and then a 1, we cannot use both in the same increasing sequence.\n\n But note: the entire array might have multiple 1s and 2s. The standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for this binary array is:\n\n   We can take all the 1s and then all the 2s that are not interrupted by a 1 that comes after a 2? Actually, we can take:\n\n   Let's say we break the array into two parts: the 1s and the 2s. But the subsequence must be non-decreasing, so we can only take 1s and then 2s, but we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1 and then a 1 that appears later because that would break the non-decreasing condition.\n\n However, note: the subsequence does not require consecutive elements. So we can pick all the 1s and then all the 2s that occur after the last 1? Or can we interleave?\n\n Actually, since the values are only 1 and 2, the condition for a non-decreasing subsequence is that we cannot have a 2 followed by a 1. But we can have a 1 then a 2, and then another 2, etc.\n\n The standard method for longest non-decreasing subsequence on a binary array is:\n\n   Let x = number of 1s in the entire array.\n   Then, the LNDS must be at least x (if we take all 1s). Additionally, we can take some 2s that are located after the last 1 we took? Actually, we can take all the 2s that occur after the first occurrence of 2? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Let dp[i] be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n\n   But note: the array is only 1 and 2.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   For each position i, we can set:\n     dp[i] = 1 (at least the element itself)\n     If a[i] == 2, then we can append it to any non-decreasing subsequence ending at j (j < i) that has value <= 2. Since 1<=2, we can take any previous 1 or 2? Actually, the condition is non-decreasing, so if the previous element is 1 or 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary array (containing only 1s and 2s) by reversing exactly one contiguous interval. The key observation here is that the optimal solution will either be the entire array if it is already non-decreasing, or a combination of 1s followed by 2s after some manipulation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Analysis**: The array consists of only 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such an array can be derived by considering all 1s followed by all 2s. However, reversing a part of the array might help in achieving a sequence where more 1s are placed before 2s.\n2. **Key Insight**: The maximum possible LNDS after reversal will be the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s that appear after the last 1 in the modified array. To maximize this, we need to find the best segment to reverse so that as many 2s as possible are moved to the end of the array.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Step 1**: Calculate the total number of 1s and 2s in the array.\n   - **Step 2**: If the array is already non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s), the answer is simply the total number of elements.\n   - **Step 3**: Otherwise, for each possible starting index of the reversal, compute the potential LNDS by considering the 1s up to that point and the 2s from that point onwards.\n4. **Optimization**: By iterating through each possible reversal start and calculating the potential LNDS, we can determine the maximum value efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for num in arr if num == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if total_ones >= n:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    dp = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n                \n    ans = max(max(dp), total_ones + total_twos)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left_ones = 0\n        right_twos = 0\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] == 1:\n                left_ones += 1\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            if arr[j] == 2:\n                right_twos += 1\n        candidate = left_ones + right_twos\n        if candidate > ans:\n            ans = candidate\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the length of the array and the array elements.\n2. **Counting 1s and 2s**: The total number of 1s and 2s in the array is counted to understand the base case where the array might already be optimal.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index `i`.\n4. **DP Array Population**: The DP array is populated by checking each element against all previous elements. If the current element is greater than or equal to a previous element, the DP value is updated.\n5. **Reversal Simulation**: For each possible starting index of a reversal, the number of 1s to the left and 2s to the right of the reversal start is calculated. The sum of these counts gives a candidate value for the maximum LNDS.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value between the original LNDS (from the DP array) and the best candidate from the reversal simulation is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible reversal segments and leverages dynamic programming to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of the problem.",
