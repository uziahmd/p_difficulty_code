Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cancel per card is x.\n\n 5. We can think greedily:\n\n   Let target = -S (the amount we need to add)\n\n   Case 1: If target is 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n   Case 2: Otherwise, we need to cover the absolute value of the target by adding cards, but note that we can use both positive and negative.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to just positive or negative. But observe:\n\n     We can use multiple cards. Each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). But note: the sign matters.\n\n   Actually, we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So the problem reduces to: what is the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) such that their sum is target (which could be positive or negative)?\n\n   But wait: we are free to choose any integers in the range. So we can also use negative and positive arbitrarily.\n\n   However, note: we might have to consider the sign of the target.\n\n   Let T = abs(target)\n\n   How do we cover T?\n\n   We can use as many as we want of the same sign? But note: we can also use mixed signs. However, the goal is to minimize the number of cards.\n\n   Since we can use any integers in [-x, x], we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Consider if we use k cards, what is the maximum absolute value we can achieve? Actually, we are trying to achieve exactly T (if T is positive) or -T (if negative). But we can use positive and negative arbitrarily.\n\n   However, note: we can always use cards of the same sign to get the desired sum. For example, to get a positive T, we can use positive numbers only.\n\n   Then the problem becomes: what is the minimum k such that we can form the integer T (if T>=0) using k cards, each card being at most x?\n\n   This is similar to the classic coin change problem but with coins of value x (and also negative, but we don't need negative for positive T) and we are allowed to use any number of coins (but only positive ones for positive T). However, note that we can also use negative coins? Actually, we are free to use any integer in [-x, x]. But if we want to get T (positive), we would use positive cards only because using a negative card would require more positive cards to compensate.\n\n   So for positive T, we want to use as many positive x as possible? Not necessarily: because we can use any integer from 1 to x, not just x.\n\n   Actually, we can use any integer from 1 to x. So the problem is: represent T as a sum of k integers, each between 1 and x (for positive T) or between -x and -1 (for negative T, but we can flip the sign and then use positive). Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n     Let k be the number of cards. We need to assign integers a1, a2, ..., ak such that:\n        a1 + a2 + ... + ak = T   (if T is positive) OR = -T (if negative, then we can consider T = -target, so positive)\n\n   Without loss of generality, let T = abs(target). Then we want to form T (positive) with k cards, each card having an integer in [1, x] (if we are going to use positive) or [-x, -1] (negative). But note: we can use negative cards too, but for forming a positive T, negative cards would be counterproductive unless we use them to then use even more positive? Actually, no, because we are minimizing the number of cards. We want to achieve the sum as fast as possible.\n\n   However, note: we can use a mix. But consider: if we use a negative card",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target**: The target sum needed is the negative of the current sum (i.e., `-sum`).\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Handle Non-Zero Target**: For a non-zero target, we need to find the smallest number of cards whose values can sum up to the absolute value of the target. The key observation here is that each card can contribute at most `x` towards the target. \n   - **Single Card Check**: If the absolute value of the target is less than or equal to `x`, then one card is sufficient.\n   - **Multiple Cards**: For larger targets, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the target divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute up to `x` towards the target, so the number of cards needed is `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    target = -total\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        if abs_target <= x:\n            print(1)\n        else:\n            k = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on any card), followed by `n` integers representing the card values.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to reach a total sum of zero.\n3. **Target Determination**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum. If this target is zero, the answer is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Handling Non-Zero Targets**: \n   - If the absolute value of the target is within the range of a single card's value (i.e., ≤ `x`), then one card is sufficient.\n   - Otherwise, the minimum number of cards required is calculated by dividing the absolute target by `x` and rounding up. This is because each card can contribute up to `x` towards the target, and the ceiling of the division gives the minimal number of cards needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the minimal number of cards required by leveraging simple arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
