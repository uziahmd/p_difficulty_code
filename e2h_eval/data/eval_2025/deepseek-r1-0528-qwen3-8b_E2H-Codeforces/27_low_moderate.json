On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is: given a sequence of 1s and 2s, we can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. We want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the resulting sequence.\n\n Observations:\n Since the sequence only contains 1 and 2, the non-decreasing subsequence can be of two types:\n   Type 1: All 1s.\n   Type 2: All 2s.\n   Type 3: A mix of 1s and 2s (but note: 1 <= 2, so any sequence of 1s followed by 2s is non-decreasing).\n\n However, note that after reversing an interval, the entire sequence is fixed. The key is that we can reverse one contiguous part.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Without any reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is at least the maximum of the count of consecutive 1s and the count of consecutive 2s? Not exactly: because non-decreasing allows mixing? Actually, the entire sequence is either 1 or 2, so the LNDS is the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the sequence into contiguous segments of 1s and 2s.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. So we can try to fix the entire sequence to be non-decreasing by reversing an appropriate interval. However, note that the reversal might not fix the entire sequence, but we are allowed to choose the reversal arbitrarily.\n\n Let's think:\n\n In the final sequence, the condition for being non-decreasing is that we cannot have a 2 followed by a 1. So the goal is to minimize the number of \"2 then 1\" adjacent pairs (or more generally, to arrange the 1s and 2s as much as possible without having a drop from 2 to 1).\n\n However, note that the reversal operation is on one contiguous segment. So we can change the order of a contiguous segment arbitrarily (from increasing to decreasing or vice versa). But note: the reversal will flip the order of that segment.\n\n Since the numbers are only 1 and 2, the reversal of a contiguous segment of 1s and 2s will just swap the positions of 1s and 2s within that segment.\n\n What is the effect? We can try to bring all the 1s to the left and 2s to the right by reversing a segment that contains the transition from 1 to 2 and then back to 1?\n\n However, note: the entire sequence might have multiple transitions. The idea is to use the reversal to fix one or more transitions.\n\n Another approach:\n\n Consider that the reversal operation can be applied at most once. We can consider the original array and also what happens when we reverse different intervals.\n\n But note: n is up to 2000, so O(n^2) might be acceptable, but we need to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LDS) for many arrays (each reversal gives a new array). Computing LDS for an array of 2000 elements with standard O(n^2) algorithm (like the classical patience sorting) would lead to O(n^3) which is too slow for n=2000.\n\n Therefore, we need a smarter way.\n\n Observation: The sequence consists only of 1 and 2.\n\n The longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., no 2 followed by 1). Otherwise, it is broken by some \"2 then 1\" pattern.\n\n How to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a given arrangement of 1s and 2s?\n\n We can use dynamic programming, but note: the sequence is only 1 and 2. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be computed by:\n\n   Let dp[i] = length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index i.\n\n   Then, \n        dp[i] = max(1, \n                    dp[j] + 1 for j < i and a[j] <= a[i])\n\n   But since there are only two values, we can do:\n\n   We can precompute the last occurrence of 1 and 2? Actually, we can use:\n\n   For each position i, the value is either 1 or 2.\n\n   Then:\n      If a[i] == 1, then we can extend any non-decreasing subsequence that ended with 1 or 2 (because 1<=2) but wait: actually, we require the previous element to be <= current. So for 1, we can extend any subsequence that ends at an index j < i (regardless of whether the last element was 1 or 2). Similarly, for 2, we can only extend a subsequence that ended with 1 or ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The solution involves analyzing the original sequence and considering the effects of reversing different intervals to determine the optimal reversal that maximizes the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The LNDS can be the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing (i.e., no 2 is followed by a 1). Otherwise, the LNDS is broken by transitions from 2 to 1.\n2. **Key Insight**: Reversing a contiguous interval can help in aligning all 1s to the left and 2s to the right, thereby maximizing the LNDS. The optimal reversal will eliminate as many \"2 followed by 1\" transitions as possible.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Compute arrays `pref` and `suff` where `pref[i]` is the count of 1s from the start up to index `i`, and `suff[i]` is the count of 1s from index `i` to the end. This helps in quickly determining the number of 1s in any segment.\n   - **Transition Points**: Identify segments where the sequence transitions from 1 to 2 or vice versa. These points are crucial because reversing around them can potentially maximize the LNDS.\n   - **Maximization**: For each possible reversal interval, calculate the potential increase in the LNDS by considering the combined counts of 1s from the prefix and suffix of the reversal interval. The maximum value obtained from all possible intervals is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    pref = [0] * n\n    suff = [0] * n\n    \n    pref[0] = 1 if arr[0] == 1 else 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        pref[i] = pref[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    suff[n-1] = 1 if arr[n-1] == 1 else 0\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suff[i] = suff[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        \n    total_ones = sum(1 for num in arr if num == 1)\n    ans = max(total_ones, n - total_ones)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i < n-1 and arr[i] == 2 and arr[i+1] == 1:\n            left_ones = pref[i]\n            right_ones = suff[i+1]\n            candidate = left_ones + right_ones\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n                \n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        if i >= 1 and arr[i] == 1 and arr[i-1] == 2:\n            left_ones = pref[i-1]\n            right_ones = suff[i]\n            candidate = left_ones + right_ones\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n                \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the sequence length is 1, the LNDS is trivially 1.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays store the cumulative counts of 1s from the start (`pref`) and end (`suff`) of the sequence up to each index. This allows efficient calculation of 1s in any segment.\n3. **Total Ones**: The initial answer is set to the maximum between the total number of 1s and the number of 2s (since the LNDS of all 1s or all 2s is a candidate).\n4. **Transition Handling**: The algorithm checks for segments where the sequence transitions from 2 to 1 or vice versa. For each such transition, it calculates the combined count of 1s from the affected segments and updates the answer if this count is higher than the current maximum.\n5. **Output**: The maximum value found during the analysis is printed, representing the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence after any single reversal.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking critical segments (transition points) and leverages prefix and suffix sums for quick calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
