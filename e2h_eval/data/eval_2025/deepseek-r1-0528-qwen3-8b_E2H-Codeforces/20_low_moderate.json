For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n, k, f (with n from 1 to 15, and k, f up to 200000)\n\n The problem requires counting the number of ways to assign integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n (so there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1)-2 strings) such that:\n\n   The maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\n Observation:\n\n In the beautiful multiset condition, note that a multiset is built from strings of length exactly n. However, the condition applies to every prefix s (from length 1 to n). \n\n How does the multiset relate to the conditions? For a string t in the multiset (which is of length n), it must satisfy that for every prefix s of t (of length from 1 to n-1) the count of strings in the multiset that have s as prefix is at most c_s.\n\n But note: the condition for a string s (prefix) is about the entire multiset. Moreover, the condition for the full string (length n) is also considered.\n\n What is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset?\n\n Consider building the multiset. We can think of the multiset as being built by adding strings of length n. However, the condition for a prefix s (say of length i) is that the total number of strings in the multiset that start with s cannot exceed c_s.\n\n Now, note that any string t of length n has 2^(n - i) continuations from its prefix s (if we consider all binary choices for the remaining n-i bits). But the condition is on the total count of strings in the multiset that have s as prefix.\n\n Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n   We have a complete binary tree of depth n (leaves are the strings of length n). Each node (at depth i) has a capacity c_s (for the string s, which is the path from root to that node). The multiset is a multiset of leaves. However, the condition for a node (with string s) is that the total number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s (which is the set of strings with prefix s) is at most c_s.\n\n But note: the condition must hold for every node (every prefix). \n\n However, the problem does not require to build the multiset but to choose the capacities c_s for every node (from length 1 to n) so that the maximum multiset size is exactly f.\n\n What is the maximum multiset size? \n\n Note: The entire multiset must satisfy for every node s: (# of leaves in the multiset that are in the subtree of s) <= c_s.\n\n This is similar to the concept of \"independent set\" but with capacities. However, note that the same leaf may be counted in multiple nodes.\n\n Another perspective: The multiset is a multiset of leaves. The condition for a node s is that the number of copies of the leaves in the subtree of s (which are the leaves that start with s) is at most c_s.\n\n But note: the same leaf is a string of length n, and if it is included multiple times, then each time it contributes to every node that is an ancestor of that leaf.\n\n How to maximize the multiset? \n\n We can use a greedy approach from the bottom up. The entire multiset is constrained by the capacities of the prefixes. \n\n Let F(s) be the total number of copies of the leaves in the subtree of s (that is, the entire multiset, but only the copies that are in the subtree of s). Then we require for every node s: F(s) <= c_s.\n\n How do we compute the maximum total multiset size? \n\n Consider the root: the entire multiset must satisfy F(root) <= c_root.\n\n Now, note that the multiset is composed of copies of the leaves. Each leaf is associated with a path (a binary string of length n). \n\n However, the constraints are independent for each node. The maximum multiset size is the maximum number of leaves (counting multiplicities) such that for every node, the sum over the copies of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n This is a system of linear constraints. But note: the leaves are the base elements. However, we can also consider that the entire multiset is built from the leaves.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a flow or tree DP? But note: n is up to 15, but the number of nodes is 2^(n+1)-1, which is about 32767 (for n=15). However, the capacities are given and we are not building the multiset but assigning capacities.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the number of assignments (c_s for every string s of length 1 to n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The solution involves understanding the constraints and leveraging dynamic programming to count valid assignments efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting the number of ways to assign capacities \\( c_s \\) to all binary strings of length 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum multiset size (beautiful multiset) is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset must satisfy the condition that for every prefix \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset starting with \\( s \\) does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The maximum multiset size is constrained by the capacities assigned to all prefixes. The root node (empty string) imposes the broadest constraint, as it must include all strings in the multiset. The solution involves calculating the number of valid capacity assignments where the maximum multiset size is \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to assign capacities to all nodes at depth \\( i \\) such that the total number of copies of leaves (strings of length \\( n \\)) is \\( j \\). The DP transitions consider whether each node's capacity allows the inclusion of its subtree's leaves.\n\n4. **Generating Function**: The solution involves computing a generating function that counts the number of valid capacity assignments. The generating function is built using DP and then convolved to find the coefficient corresponding to the maximum multiset size \\( f \\).\n\n5. **Modulo Handling**: Given the large constraints (up to \\( 2 \\times 10^5 \\)), the solution uses modular arithmetic (modulo \\( 998244353 \\)) to handle large numbers and ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k_val = int(input[1])\n    f_val = int(input[2])\n    \n    total_nodes = 2**(n+1) - 1\n    num_leaves = 1 << n\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1 if f_val == 0 else 0)\n        return\n        \n    max_depth = n\n    \n    dp = [0] * (k_val + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for depth in range(1, max_depth + 1):\n        new_dp = [0] * (k_val + 1)\n        num_nodes_at_depth = 1 << depth\n        for cap in range(k_val + 1):\n            ways = dp[cap]\n            if ways == 0:\n                continue\n            base = cap\n            remainder = base % num_nodes_at_depth\n            if remainder == 0:\n                new_dp[cap] = (new_dp[cap] + ways) % MOD\n            else:\n                q = base // num_nodes_at_depth\n                r = base % num_nodes_at_depth\n                if q >= 0:\n                    new_dp[q] = (new_dp[q] + ways) % MOD\n                if r < k_val:\n                    new_dp[r] = (new_dp[r] + ways) % MOD\n        dp = new_dp\n        \n    max_size = 0\n    for cap in range(k_val + 1):\n        if dp[cap] != 0:\n            max_size = max(max_size, cap)\n            \n    if max_size != f_val:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    poly = [0] * (f_val + 1)\n    poly[0] = 1\n    \n    for depth in range(1, max_depth + 1):\n        num_nodes = 1 << depth\n        new_poly = [0] * (f_val + 1)\n        for j in range(f_val + 1):\n            if poly[j] == 0:\n                continue\n            for i in range(num_nodes):\n                new_j = j + i\n                if new_j <= f_val:\n                    new_poly[new_j] = (new_poly[new_j] + poly[j]) % MOD\n        poly = new_poly\n        \n    total_ways = 0\n    for cap in range(k_val + 1):\n        if cap < f_val:\n            total_ways = (total_ways + dp[cap]) % MOD\n            \n    total_ways = total_ways * pow(poly[f_val], 1, MOD) % MOD\n    print(total_ways)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading input values \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and \\( f \\). It checks for edge cases where \\( n = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to keep track of the number of ways to assign capacities at each depth. The loop processes each depth from 1 to \\( n \\), updating the DP array based on the current depth's node count and capacity constraints.\n\n3. **Generating Function Calculation**: The code computes a polynomial `poly` where each term represents the number of ways to achieve a certain multiset size. This involves iterating over each depth and updating the polynomial coefficients.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The total number of valid capacity assignments is computed by multiplying the number of ways to have capacities less than \\( f \\) with the number of ways to achieve exactly \\( f \\) multiset size. The result is printed modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and leverages dynamic programming to count valid assignments, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( k \\) and \\( f \\).",
