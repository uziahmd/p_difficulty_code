In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, s).\n We have to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that there is at least one mentsu (which can be a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that initially there are 3 tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (each one any tile) until we have a set that contains at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note: We don't necessarily need to use all the drawn tiles. We just need to have at least one mentsu (three tiles) in the entire hand.\n\n Since we can draw any tiles, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Already have a mentsu (0 draws)\n   - Check for koutsu: three identical tiles? (same digit and same suit)\n   - Check for shuntsu: three consecutive numbers (differing by 1) in the same suit? Note: the numbers must be consecutive, but order doesn't matter. Also, note that the consecutive numbers must be in the same suit and the digits must be from '1' to '9'. So [1,2,3] is valid, [2,3,4] is valid, but [9,1,2] is not because 9,1,2 are not consecutive in the usual sense (we cannot wrap around).\n\n But note: the example says [5p, 4p, 6p] is a shuntsu. That is because 4,5,6 are consecutive. So we require three distinct numbers that form an arithmetic progression of difference 1.\n\n However, what about duplicates? For example, if we have [1m,1m,1m] then we have a koutsu, but also note that [1m,1m,1m] is not a shuntsu. But in the hand, we might have multiple copies. However, the problem states: we have three tiles initially. Then we can draw more.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 0: With 0 draws, we have three tiles. We check:\n   - If there is a koutsu: three identical (same digit and same suit) -> then answer 0.\n   - Else, if there is a shuntsu: three tiles with same suit and the three digits are consecutive when sorted. But note: what if we have duplicate numbers? For example, [1m,2m,2m] -> not consecutive. Or [1m,2m,3m] -> valid.\n\n However, wait: the hand has exactly three tiles. So we can only have one type of mentsu.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least one mentsu\". So if we have three tiles, we can form a mentsu if they are either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n However, there's a catch: sometimes we might have two possibilities? Actually, we are checking the entire hand.\n\n But note: the hand is three tiles. So we can only form one mentsu if they are arranged as a triplet or a sequence.\n\n However, consider: [1m,1m,1m] -> koutsu. [1m,2m,3m] -> shuntsu. [1m,1m,2m] -> no mentsu. [1m,1m,4m] -> no.\n\n Now, what if we have two pairs? For example, [1m,1m,2m,2m] would be four tiles, but we start with three.\n\n So for three tiles:\n\n   Option 1: Check for koutsu: \n        if all three are the same: then 0.\n\n   Option 2: Check for shuntsu: \n        The three tiles must be of the same suit. Then, take the numbers, sort them, and check if they form a consecutive sequence (like [a, a+1, a+2]).\n\n But wait: what if we have [1m, 3m, 2m]? Then sorting gives [1,2,3] -> valid.\n\n However, what if we have [9m,8m,7m]? Then sorted: [7,8,9] -> valid.\n\n But note: the problem says [9m,1m,2m] is invalid. Why? Because 9,1,2 is not consecutive. The consecutive condition requires that the numbers are consecutive without wrapping.\n\n So algorithm for three tiles:\n\n   Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n   Step 1: Check koutsu.\n        if len(set(tiles)) == 1: then 0.\n\n   Step 2: Check shuntsu.\n        Condition 1: All three tiles have the same suit.\n        Condition 2: The three numbers (digits) are distinct and form a consecutive sequence.\n\n        However, note: if there are duplicates, then we cannot form a shuntsu because the numbers must be distinct (since consecutive numbers are distinct). So if there is any duplicate, then we skip.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n          suits = [tile[1] for tile in tiles]\n          numbers = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles]\n\n        Then, if all suits are the same and the set of numbers has size 3 and the max - min == 2 (so the numbers are consecutive from min to max, which is min, min+1, min+2), then it's a shuntsu.\n\n   But wait: what if the three numbers are [1,2,3] then max-min=2, and set size=3 -> valid.\n        [2,3,4]: max-min=2, set size=3 -> valid.\n        [7,8,9]: max-min=2, set size=3 -> valid.\n\n   However, what if the numbers are [1,2,4]? Then max-min=3, so invalid.\n\n   So for three tiles, if we have a shuntsu, then 0.\n\n   But what if we don't have a mentsu with three tiles? Then we need to consider drawing some tiles.\n\n   We can draw 1, 2, or 3 tiles. However, note that the goal is to have at least one mentsu (three tiles) in the hand. After drawing, the hand will have more than three tiles. But note: we don't need to use all the drawn ones. We just need one mentsu.\n\n   However, we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose to draw the minimal number such that we complete one mentsu.\n\n   Let's think about possibilities:\n\n   We start with 3 tiles. We can draw 1, 2, or 3 (or more) tiles. But we want the minimum.\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n   Case 0: Already have a mentsu (0 draws) -> return 0.\n\n   Case 1: Draw 1 tile. Then we have 4 tiles. We need to form a mentsu (three tiles) from these 4.\n\n        How can one drawn tile help?\n\n        Option A: Complete a koutsu. For example, if we have two of the same tile, then we can draw the third to complete a triplet.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> draw one '1m' to get three '1m's.\n\n        Option B: Complete a shuntsu. \n\n            In a shuntsu, we need three consecutive numbers. \n\n            There are two ways:\n\n            a) We have two tiles of the same number and suit, and we need a third to complete a triplet? No, triplet is different.\n\n            But wait: for shuntsu, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n            Example: We have [1m,2m,?] and we draw a 3m -> then [1m,2m,3m] is a shuntsu.\n\n            Example: We have [1m,3m,?] and we draw a 2m -> then [1m,2m,3m] is a shuntsu.\n\n            Example: We have [1m,1m,2m] and we draw a 3m -> then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m]. In this hand, we can form a shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] (even though we have an extra 1m). But note: we don't need to use the duplicate. So one draw can complete a shuntsu.\n\n            However, note: we can also complete a koutsu by drawing one tile.\n\n            So with one draw, we can complete either:\n\n                - A koutsu: if there exists a tile that appears at least two times (so that drawing one more makes three). But note: if we have two of the same, then drawing one more of that tile completes a koutsu.\n\n                - A shuntsu: if there exists a way to form a consecutive sequence by adding one tile.\n\n            But note: we might have multiple ways. We want the minimum draws.\n\n   However, we are asked the minimum number of draws. So we should consider:\n\n        d=0: already done -> 0.\n\n        d=1: if we can complete a mentsu by drawing one tile, then 1.\n\n        d=2: if we can complete by drawing two.\n\n        d=3: if we can complete by drawing three.\n\n        But note: sometimes we might need to draw three? Actually, we can always form a mentsu by drawing three tiles of the same kind (if we have any tile, we can draw three copies of one of our existing tiles to form a triplet). However, let's see:\n\n        Actually, we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles? \n\n        Example: [1m,4m,?] -> we can draw 2m and 3m? But wait, we only need one mentsu. So if we have [1m,4m] and we can form a shuntsu by having [1m,2m,3m] but we don't have 2m and 3m. Alternatively, we can form two separate sequences? Actually, no, we need three consecutive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can form a triplet by drawing three copies of an existing tile.\n\n        However, note: we start with three tiles. We can draw up to three tiles. But the minimal might be 1 or 2.\n\n   Let me consider:\n\n        We have three tiles. We can consider:\n\n        Possibility 1: Drawing one tile.\n\n            - For koutsu: if there is a tile that appears at least twice, then we can draw one more to complete a triplet. But note: if we have two of the same, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one. However, if we have three of the same, then we already have a triplet (so d=0). So if there are two of one kind, then d=1 for koutsu.\n\n            - For shuntsu: We need to form a consecutive sequence. We have three tiles. We can try to form a shuntsu by adding one tile.\n\n                Conditions for one draw to form a shuntsu:\n\n                We need to have two tiles that are part of a potential shuntsu. For example, if we have two tiles that are consecutive (say [1m,2m]), then we can draw a 3m to complete the sequence.\n\n                But also, we might have two tiles that are separated by one (like [1m,3m]) and then we can draw a 2m to complete.\n\n                However, note: we can also use the same tile for two different sequences? Actually, we can only use each tile once.\n\n                But wait: the hand after drawing one tile will have four tiles. We need to check if there exists any three tiles that form a mentsu.\n\n                However, note: the problem does not require to use all the tiles. So we can form a mentsu from three of the four.\n\n                So for shuntsu with one draw:\n\n                    We can look at the entire hand (three original + one drawn) and check if there is a consecutive triplet in the same suit.\n\n                How can we check that?\n\n                Since we are drawing one tile, we can consider the possibility that we complete a sequence by adding one tile.\n\n                Steps for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n                    Group the tiles by suit.\n\n                    For each suit, look at the distinct numbers present (but note: duplicates are allowed, but for shuntsu we need distinct consecutive numbers). However, we can have duplicates, but we only need one copy of each.\n\n                    Actually, we can have multiple copies, but the mentsu uses three distinct tiles (each distinct in the sense of being one copy). \n\n                    Example: [1m,1m,2m] and we draw 3m: then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m]. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using one of the 1m, the 2m, and the 3m). But we cannot use two 1m's for the same sequence.\n\n                    So for a given suit, we can extract the set of distinct numbers that we have (because duplicates don't help in forming a consecutive sequence, except that we might use one copy for the sequence and ignore the others).\n\n                    Then, for each consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) that is entirely contained in the set (for that suit) and we have drawn one tile that provides the missing number, then we can form a shuntsu.\n\n                    But note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can choose the tile that completes a consecutive triplet.\n\n                    However, we must check: for each suit, and for each possible consecutive triplet that we can form by adding one number, does that number not already exist in that suit?\n\n                    But wait: we might have two different suits and we can choose which suit to complete.\n\n                    Example: We have [1m, 1p, 1s]. Then we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile? Actually, no, because we need three consecutive in the same suit.\n\n                    So for shuntsu, we must have at least two tiles in the same suit, and then we can complete the sequence by adding one tile.\n\n                    Alternatively, we might have two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive or separated by one, then we can complete by adding the missing one.\n\n                    However, note: we might have two tiles that are the same? Then we cannot use two same tiles for a sequence. So we consider the set of numbers per suit.\n\n                    Steps for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n                      For each suit (m, p, s):\n\n                          Let S be the set of distinct numbers in that suit from the initial three tiles.\n\n                          Then, we can consider:\n\n                            Case A: We have two numbers in S, say a and b, and the gap between a and b is 1 (so |a-b|=1). Then we can complete the sequence by adding the number a-1 or a+2 (depending on which side) or b-1 or b+2? Actually, we need to check for consecutive triplets that include two of the numbers we have.\n\n                            Actually, we can iterate over the possible starting points for a consecutive triplet that includes at least two numbers from S.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can think: what consecutive triplets can we form by adding one number?\n\n                    The consecutive triplets are from 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ... up to 7-8-9 (so 7 possible triplets).\n\n                    For a given triplet (x, x+1, x+2), we can check:\n\n                        How many of these numbers are in the current hand (in that suit)? \n\n                        We have the initial three tiles. We can break down by suit.\n\n                    For a fixed triplet (x, x+1, x+2) and a fixed suit, we require that:\n\n                        - The triplet is in that suit.\n\n                        - In the initial hand, for that suit, we have at least two of the three numbers (or one and we can draw the other two? no, we are only drawing one tile). Actually, we are allowed to draw one tile. So we need to have at least two of the three numbers already (so that by drawing one we complete the triplet). Or, we have one number, and then we draw one, and then we have two numbers? That doesn't complete the triplet.\n\n                    Actually, to complete a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) in a suit, we need to have at least two of the three numbers in that suit. Then, we can draw the missing one.\n\n                    But wait: what if we have two numbers that are not adjacent? For example, we have x and x+2 in the suit. Then we need to draw x+1. Then we have the triplet.\n\n                    So condition for one-draw shuntsu for a specific triplet and suit:\n\n                        Count, for that suit, the numbers in {x, x+1, x+2}. Let the count be c.\n\n                        Then, if c == 2, then we can complete the triplet by drawing the missing number.\n\n                        However, note: we can also complete a triplet that is not necessarily the one we are thinking about? Actually, we are allowed to choose any triplet. So we need to check for any triplet (any x from 1 to 7) and for any suit, whether the condition holds.\n\n                    But note: the drawn tile must be of that suit. So we must have the suit available.\n\n                    However, we can draw a tile of any suit. But the consecutive triplet must be in one suit.\n\n                    So algorithm for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n                        For each suit in ['m','p','s']:\n                            Let T = set of numbers (from the initial three tiles) that are in this suit.\n\n                            For each x in range(1, 8): # from 1 to 7 (so that x+2 <=9)\n                                Let triplet = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n                                Count how many numbers in triplet are in T.\n\n                                If the count is 2, then we can complete this triplet by drawing the missing number (which is the one in triplet minus T) and that missing number must be between 1 and 9 (it is, because x>=1 and x<=7, so x+2<=9) and the tile drawn is [str(missing_number) + suit].\n\n                                Then, we can form a shuntsu with one draw.\n\n                        Therefore, if we find at least one such triplet and suit, then one draw suffices.\n\n        Possibility 2: Drawing two tiles.\n\n            We might not be able to complete with one, but we can with two.\n\n            How?\n\n            Option A: Complete a koutsu: if we have two of the same tile, then we need two more to complete a triplet? Actually, no: we have two, then we draw two more? But wait, we can draw two copies of the same tile and then we have four copies, but we only need three. Actually, to complete a triplet we need one more. So that was covered in one-draw.\n\n            Wait, let me correct: for koutsu, if we have two of a tile, then one draw completes the triplet. So two-draw for koutsu is not minimal.\n\n            Option B: Complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                Example: We have [1m, 4m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to complete [1m,2m,3m] and [4m] is left. But wait, we need only one mentsu. So we can form [1m,2m,3m] (the first three). However, we drew two tiles.\n\n                But note: we start with three tiles. What if the hand is [1m,4m,5m]? Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (and leave 4m and 5m). So two draws.\n\n                However, we might complete a koutsu by drawing two? Actually, no, because if we have one tile, then we need two draws to complete a triplet (but that's worse than one-draw shuntsu). \n\n                But wait: if we have one tile, then we can draw two copies to complete a triplet (so two draws for koutsu). However, if we have two tiles, then one draw suffices for koutsu.\n\n                So for koutsu, the minimal is 0, 1, or 2 (if we have one copy, then we need two draws). But note: we start with three tiles. The maximum frequency of a tile is at most 3? \n\n                Actually, the hand has three tiles. The frequencies can be:\n\n                  [3] -> 0 draws\n                  [2,1] -> 1 draw (to complete the triplet)\n                  [1,1,1] -> 0 draws? Actually, [1,1,1] is three identical, so 0 draws.\n\n                Actually, the hand [a,a,a] is koutsu.\n\n                So the frequencies: \n                  Let counts = {}\n                  For each tile, update counts.\n\n                  If any tile has count>=3, then we have a koutsu (actually, if we have three of the same, then yes). But note: the representation: tiles are strings. Two tiles are identical if the string is the same.\n\n                However, the input is three strings. So we can have:\n\n                  ['1m','1m','1m'] -> koutsu.\n\n                  ['1m','1m','2m'] -> two '1m', one '2m'\n\n                So for koutsu, we can complete by drawing (3 - count) tiles for a tile that has count>=1. But we want the minimal over all possibilities.\n\n                Actually, for koutsu, the minimal draws for a particular tile is (3 - count) if count>=1. But if we have multiple tiles, we can choose the one that requires the fewest draws.\n\n                However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can also complete a koutsu by drawing three copies of a tile that is not even present? Actually, no: we can only complete a koutsu if we have at least one copy of the tile. But wait, we can draw any tile arbitrarily. So we can choose a tile that we don't have at all? Then we would have to draw three copies. \n\n                But then, why not complete a shuntsu? Because we are looking for the minimum.\n\n                So we have two types of mentsu: koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n                We must consider both.\n\n            Therefore, we can consider:\n\n                d=0: 0 draws.\n\n                d=1: \n                    - koutsu: if there exists a tile (string) that appears at least two times (so we can complete to three by drawing one). OR \n                    - shuntsu: if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) in one suit such that in that suit we have at least two distinct numbers (and the two numbers are adjacent or with a gap of two, and we can complete by drawing one).\n\n                d=2:\n                    - koutsu: if there exists a tile (string) that appears at least once (so we can draw two more to complete a triplet). But wait, we can also complete a shuntsu by drawing two.\n\n                    - shuntsu: we can complete a consecutive triplet by drawing two tiles (for example, we have one number, then we need two more to complete the sequence).\n\n                d=3:\n                    - koutsu: we can complete a triplet by drawing three copies of a tile that we have at least one of. But note: we can also complete a triplet by drawing three copies of a tile that we don't have? Then it would be three draws, but that's worse than using a tile we have.\n\n                    However, note: we can also form a shuntsu by drawing three tiles? Actually, we don't need to. The minimal is at most 2.\n\n                But wait: is there a possibility that we cannot form a mentsu until we draw three tiles? \n\n                Example: hand = ['1m','2p','3s'] (three different, different suits)\n\n                Then:\n\n                  koutsu: no tile repeated -> so we need to draw at least one copy of one of them to get two, then another to get three. So two draws for koutsu (if we choose to complete a koutsu) OR\n\n                  shuntsu: we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles? \n\n                    For example, we can choose to complete a shuntsu in m: we have '1m'? No, we have '1m' only if the tile is '1m'. Actually, we have '1m'? No, we have '1m' if the tile is '1m'. But our hand is ['1m','2p','3s'] -> wait, actually the example I wrote is ['1m','2p','3s'].\n\n                    Actually, we have one tile per suit. So we can complete a shuntsu in m: we have '1m'. Then we can draw '2m' and '3m' to form [1m,2m,3m]. So two draws.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can complete a koutsu by drawing two copies of one of the tiles, then we have a triplet. So two draws.\n\n                However, note: we can also consider forming a shuntsu in a new suit? For example, we don't have any tile in suit 'p' except '2p'. Then we can draw one '1p' and one '3p' to form a shuntsu in p. So two draws.\n\n                But wait: we can draw any tile. So we can choose to complete a shuntsu in any suit.\n\n                However, there is a better way: we can also mix and match? Actually, no, because shuntsu must be in one suit.\n\n                Another example: hand = ['1m','1m','2p'].\n\n                Then, for koutsu: we have two '1m', so we can complete with one draw (draw one '1m').\n\n                But wait, we have three tiles: ['1m','1m','2p'] -> we can complete a triplet of '1m' with one draw.\n\n                Now, what if hand = ['1m','2m','4m'] (all same suit, but not consecutive and no duplicates)?\n\n                Then:\n\n                  koutsu: no duplicates -> so we need at least two draws for koutsu (if we choose to complete a triplet) OR\n\n                  shuntsu: we have three tiles in the same suit. They are not consecutive. We can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles? \n\n                    Possibilities:\n\n                    Option 1: Form a sequence that includes 1m,2m, and then we need 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m] and leave 4m. So we draw one tile: 3m. Then we have a shuntsu [1m,2m,3m]. So one draw.\n\n                    But wait: we have three tiles: [1m,2m,4m]. We can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m. So one draw.\n\n                    How did I miss that? Actually, we have two tiles that are consecutive (1m and 2m). Then we can complete the sequence by adding 3m. So we don't require having two numbers from the same consecutive triplet. We only require that two of the three numbers are present and they are consecutive (then we can complete the lower end) or separated by one (then we complete the middle).\n\n                Correction: In the example [1m,2m,4m], we have the numbers 1,2,4. We can form the triplet (1,2,3) because we have 1 and 2, and we draw 3. This is one draw.\n\n                But wait, in my earlier algorithm for one-draw shuntsu, I considered for each consecutive triplet (x,x+1,x+2) and checked how many of the three numbers we have. For the triplet (1,2,3): we have two numbers (1 and 2). So we can complete by drawing 3. \n\n                Therefore, the one-draw shuntsu condition holds.\n\n                So the example [1m,2m,4m] can be solved by one draw.\n\n                Now, what about [1m,3m,5m]?\n\n                Then, we check consecutive triplets:\n\n                    Triplet (1,2,3): we have 1 and 3 -> so two numbers. Then we can complete by drawing 2. So one draw.\n\n                Similarly, [1m,4m,7m] -> we can complete (1,2,3) by drawing 2 and 3 (two draws) OR (4,5,6) by drawing 5 and 6 (two draws) OR (7,8,9) by drawing 8 and 9 (two draws). But wait, we can complete one triplet with two draws. \n\n                However, we can also complete a triplet that is not centered at one of the existing numbers? Actually, we can complete any triplet. \n\n                But note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can choose to complete (1,2,3) by drawing two tiles (2 and 3). So two draws.\n\n                But wait: we don't need to complete a triplet that is entirely new. We can also use two of the existing numbers to form a triplet with the drawn tile.\n\n                However, we have only one draw: we can only draw one tile. Then we can only complete one triplet. So for [1m,4m,7m], one draw cannot complete a consecutive triplet because no consecutive triplet has two of the numbers {1,4,7}. \n\n                Therefore, for [1m,4m,7m]:\n\n                    koutsu: no duplicates -> so not by koutsu.\n\n                    shuntsu: one draw: no consecutive triplet with two of {1,4,7} (because the gaps are too big). \n\n                    Then we consider two draws.\n\n                    With two draws, we can complete a consecutive triplet by drawing two tiles. For example, for the triplet (1,2,3): we have 1, then we need 2 and 3. So two draws.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can complete a triplet that uses two of the existing numbers? \n\n                    Example: We have 1 and 4. Then the triplet (1,2,3) requires 2,3; triplet (3,4,5) requires 3,5; triplet (4,5,6) requires 5,6. \n\n                    But wait, we can also form a triplet that uses two existing numbers and the drawn tile. \n\n                    However, the two existing numbers must be consecutive or separated by one. \n\n                    In [1m,4m,7m]: \n                        1 and 4: gap of 3 -> no consecutive triplet can be formed with these two by adding one tile (we need two tiles to bridge the gap). \n\n                    Actually, we can form a triplet that uses two of the existing numbers if they are consecutive or one apart. But here, they are not.\n\n                    So we have to form a triplet that uses only one of the existing numbers and then add two more. \n\n                    Therefore, two draws is needed.\n\n                However, wait: is there a way to complete a triplet with two draws that is not necessarily using two existing numbers? \n\n                Yes, we can choose any two tiles. So we can complete (1,2,3) by drawing 2 and 3. \n\n                Therefore, the minimal for [1m,4m,7m] is 2.\n\n                But note: we can also complete a koutsu? We have three distinct tiles. To complete a koutsu, we need two draws (for one of the tiles, we have one copy, so we need two more). So two draws for koutsu.\n\n                So the minimal is 2.\n\n                Now, what about drawing three tiles? \n\n                Actually, we can always form a mentsu by drawing three tiles: for example, draw three copies of one of the tiles (if we have at least one) then we have a koutsu. Or we can form a shuntsu by drawing three tiles (for example, [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m if we have 1m, but wait we have 1m already, so we draw two). \n\n                But note: the minimal is at most 2, because we can complete a koutsu by drawing two copies (if we have one) or one copy (if we have two). \n\n                However, what if we have no duplicates and all three tiles are in different suits? \n\n                Example: ['1m','2p','3s']\n\n                Then:\n\n                  koutsu: we have one of each. So for koutsu, we can choose one tile and draw two copies to complete a triplet. So two draws.\n\n                  shuntsu: we can complete a shuntsu in m: we have 1m, so we can draw 2m and 3m (two draws). Similarly for p and s.\n\n                So minimal is 2.\n\n                But wait, can we complete a shuntsu in a mixed way? No, because shuntsu must be same suit.\n\n                However, note: we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles in one suit, but we can also complete a koutsu by drawing two tiles (same tile twice). \n\n                So two draws is sufficient.\n\n                Therefore, the answer for any hand is at most 2.\n\n                Why? Because:\n\n                  - If we have a mentsu, 0.\n\n                  - Else, if we can complete a mentsu by drawing one tile, then 1.\n\n                  - Else, 2.\n\n                But wait: is that always true?\n\n                Consider: hand = ['1m','1m','1m'] -> 0.\n\n                hand = ['1m','1m','2m'] -> 1 (koutsu).\n\n                hand = ['1m','2m','3m'] -> 0.\n\n                hand = ['1m','1m','3m'] -> \n                    koutsu: two '1m', so one draw -> 1.\n                    shuntsu: we have 1m and 3m. We can complete the triplet (1,2,3) by drawing 2m. So 1.\n\n                hand = ['1m','4m','7m'] -> 2.\n\n                hand = ['1m','2m','4m'] -> 1 (shuntsu: by drawing 3m).\n\n                hand = ['1m','2p','3s'] -> 2.\n\n                hand = ['1m','1p','1s'] -> \n                    koutsu: we have three different tiles, each appearing once. So we can complete a koutsu by drawing two copies of one of them. For example, draw two '1m' -> then we have [1m,1m,1m] (but wait, we started with ['1m','1p','1s']). Actually, if we draw two '1m', then we have two '1m' and one '1p' and one '1s'. Then we have a koutsu (the three '1m'). So two draws.\n\n                    But can we complete a shuntsu? We have one tile per suit. We can complete a shuntsu in m: we have 1m, then we need to draw 2m and 3m -> two draws. Similarly for p and s.\n\n                So the minimal is 2.\n\n                Now, is there any hand that requires three draws? \n\n                Example: hand = ['1m','2m','3p'] (two tiles in one suit, one in another)\n\n                Then, we can complete a shuntsu in m: we have 1m and 2m, so we can draw 3m -> one draw.\n\n                So minimal is 1.\n\n                Another example: hand = ['1m','2m','4p'] (no duplicates, two in one suit but not consecutive)\n\n                Then:\n\n                  koutsu: no duplicates -> so we need two draws for koutsu (by drawing two copies of one tile).\n\n                  shuntsu: in m: we have 1m and 2m, so we can draw 3m -> one draw.\n\n                So minimal is 1.\n\n                Therefore, the minimal number of draws is either 0, 1, or 2.\n\n                Algorithm:\n\n                Step 1: Check if already have a mentsu (0 draws).\n\n                    Check for koutsu: \n                        Count the frequency of each tile (each string). If any tile appears 3 times, then 0.\n\n                    Check for shuntsu:\n                        Group by suit. For each suit, extract the distinct numbers (if there are duplicates, we only need one copy for the purpose of forming a consecutive sequence). Then, for the set of numbers in that suit, check if there exists a consecutive triplet (three consecutive numbers) in that set.\n\n                    However, note: the hand has exactly three tiles. So if we have three tiles of the same suit and the numbers form a consecutive triplet (i.e., sorted numbers are [a, a+1, a+2]), then it's a shuntsu.\n\n                Step 2: If not, check for one-draw:\n\n                    a) koutsu: \n                         There exists a tile (string) that appears at least two times. Then we can draw one more of that tile to complete the triplet.\n\n                    b) shuntsu:\n                         For each suit, consider the set of distinct numbers (ignoring duplicates). Then, for each consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: If any three tiles are identical (same digit and suit), then no draws are needed.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: If the three tiles are of the same suit and their digits form a consecutive sequence (like 1m, 2m, 3m), then no draws are needed.\n\n2. **Check for One-Draw Mentsu**:\n   - **Koutsu**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu**: For each suit, check if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) where at least two of the numbers are present in the initial hand. The missing number can be drawn to complete the sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two-Draw Mentsu**:\n   - If neither zero nor one draw suffices, then two draws are needed.

If so, it immediately returns 0.\n2. **One-Draw Check**: The code then checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This is done by verifying if there are two identical tiles (for a triplet) or if two numbers from a consecutive sequence are present in the same suit (for a sequence).\n3. **Two-Draw Check**: If no one-draw solution is found, the code checks if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This involves either completing a triplet by drawing two more of an existing tile or completing a sequence by drawing two tiles to fill a consecutive sequence.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed based on the earliest condition met (0, 1, or 2 draws).
