Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n\n The game: two players take turns (each exactly n moves) by removing the leftmost digit and appending it to their own number.\n\n We want to output a string of length 2n consisting of 'H' and 'M' (for Homer and Marge) that indicates the sequence of moves.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the first player gets S1 dollars and the second gets S2 dollars. The total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n But note: the two players are making moves in an interleaved way. However, the problem does not specify the order of moves (i.e., whether the first move is by Homer or Marge). \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"On its turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si.\" and both make exactly n moves.\n\n And the example input:\n   Input: ['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n   Output: ['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\n In the first example, if we output 'HHMM', then:\n   Initially A = \"1234\"\n   Move 1: H takes the first digit '1' -> S1 becomes \"1\", A becomes \"234\"\n   Move 2: H takes the next first digit '2' -> S1 becomes \"12\", A becomes \"34\"\n   Move 3: M takes the first digit '3' -> S2 becomes \"3\", A becomes \"4\"\n   Move 4: M takes the first digit '4' -> S2 becomes \"34\"\n\n Then the total prize is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n Alternatively, with 'HMHM':\n   Move1: H takes '1' -> S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n   Move2: M takes '2' -> S2=\"2\", A=\"34\"\n   Move3: H takes '3' -> S1=\"13\", A=\"4\"\n   Move4: M takes '4' -> S2=\"24\", A=\"\"\n   Total prize: 13+24 = 37.\n\n So why is the first example output 'HHMM'? Because 12+34=46 is greater than 37.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize.\"\n\n The catch: the total prize is the sum of the two numbers. But note that the two numbers are built from the digits of A, but in a fixed order (the order of removal). However, the assignment of digits to Homer and Marge can be chosen arbitrarily as long as each gets n digits.\n\n But wait: the sequence of moves is fixed in the sense that at each step we remove the leftmost digit, so the order of digits in the original number A is fixed. The only choice is when to assign a particular digit to Homer and when to Marge.\n\n However, note: the two players are taking turns. There are two possibilities for the starting player: either Homer goes first or Marge goes first.\n\n But the problem does not specify who starts. However, the output must be a string of length 2n containing exactly n 'H' and n 'M'. The example outputs:\n\n   For A=\"1234\" (n=2) they output \"HHMM\".\n\n How do we decide?\n\n Let's denote the entire sequence of removals (the digits in the order they are removed) as d1, d2, d3, ... , d_{2n}.\n\n We have to assign each digit to either Homer or Marge, such that there are exactly n for each.\n\n However, the catch is that the moves are interleaved: the first move must be by one of the players, then the second by the other, then the first again, etc.\n\n So the assignment is forced by the positions: the first digit must be assigned to the starting player, the second to the other, the third to the starting, the fourth to the other, etc.\n\n But wait: the problem does not fix the starting player? Actually, the output is a string of length 2n of 'H' and 'M'. The problem says: \"output any of them\".\n\n However, we have to maximize the total prize (which is the numerical value of the number formed by Homer's digits plus the numerical value of the number formed by Marge's digits).\n\n How do we assign the digits to the two players?\n\n Let the sequence of digits be d0, d1, d2, ..., d_{2n-1} (from left to right).\n\n We have to assign each digit to a player, but the assignment must follow a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns removing digits from the leftmost side of a given number A. Each player makes exactly n moves, and the total prize is the sum of the numerical values of the numbers formed by each player's digits. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of moves (comprising 'H' and 'M') that maximizes this sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves distributing digits from the left end of the number A into two sequences (one for each player) such that each player ends up with exactly n digits. The key observation is that the order in which digits are assigned affects the numerical value of each player's number. To maximize the sum, we should prioritize assigning higher-value digits to the most significant positions (leftmost) in both numbers.\n\n2. **Insight**: The optimal strategy involves comparing digits at corresponding positions in the two numbers. For each pair of digits (from left to right), assign the larger digit to the player whose turn it is to play next, but only if doing so maintains the possibility of forming valid numbers for both players. This ensures that both players benefit from higher digits in their respective numbers.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses a greedy approach. We iterate over the digits of A, comparing adjacent digits (for Homer and Marge's turns). If one digit is larger than the other, we assign it to the current player's turn. However, we must ensure that both players receive exactly n digits. This is managed by tracking the remaining moves each player has and adjusting the assignment accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit in the number A exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(2n) = O(n), which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    \n    total_length = 2 * n\n    h_moves = n\n    m_moves = n\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    \n    while i < total_length:\n        if h_moves > 0 and m_moves > 0:\n            if A[i] > A[i+1]:\n                result.append('H')\n                h_moves -= 1\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n                m_moves -= 1\n                i += 1\n        else:\n            if h_moves > 0:\n                result.append('H')\n                h_moves -= 1\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n                m_moves -= 1\n        i += 1\n\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the integer n and the string A, which consists of 2n digits.\n2. **Tracking Moves**: Two counters, `h_moves` and `m_moves`, keep track of the remaining moves each player can make.\n3. **Greedy Assignment**: The loop processes each digit in A. At each step, it compares the current digit with the next one. The larger digit is assigned to the current player's turn (indicated by 'H' or 'M'). This ensures that each player gets higher-value digits in their numbers.\n4. **Handling Remaining Moves**: If one player has no more moves left, the remaining digits are assigned to the other player.\n5. **Output**: The resulting sequence of 'H' and 'M' characters is printed, representing the optimal move sequence for maximizing the total prize.\n\nThis approach efficiently distributes digits between the two players to maximize their combined numerical values, adhering to the constraints and ensuring optimal performance.",
