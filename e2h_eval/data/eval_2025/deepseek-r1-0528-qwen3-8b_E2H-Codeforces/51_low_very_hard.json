Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings combined, and nothing extra.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings and count the frequency of each letter.\n 3. Count the frequency of each letter in the third string.\n 4. Compare the two frequency counts. If they match exactly, then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile might have been shuffled, so we just need to check if the multiset (count) of the pile is exactly the multiset of the combined names.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> but wait, actually the example input is given as a string with newlines, so we read each line separately.\n\n But note: the example input is provided as a single string in the example, but the problem says three lines.\n\n Let me break down the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n Actually, let's combine the guest and host: \n   \"SANTACLAUS\" + \"DEDMOROZ\" = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n But wait, if we sort both the combined string and the pile string, do they match?\n\n Alternatively, we can use a frequency counter.\n\n Let's count the letters for the combined string:\n\n   S: 3, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n Wait, let me write the combined string: \n   SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n   S: appears in SANTA (2) and then in CLAUS? No, CLAUS has no S? Actually, SANTA has 2 S's, then CLAUS has one S? Let's count:\n\n   SANTACLAUS: \n     S: 2 (from SANTA: S,A,N,T,A -> wait, actually SANTA has 2 S's? Actually, SANTA: S, A, N, T, A -> only one S? Let me spell: S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S -> that's two S's at the beginning and one at the end? \n        Actually: \n          S (1), then after T and A, then C, then L, then A, then U, then S -> so two S's? \n        Let me count: \n          SANTACLAUS: \n            S: at index0 and index9 -> 2\n            A: index1, index5, index7 -> 3\n            N: index2 -> 1\n            T: index3 -> 1\n            C: index4 -> 1\n            L: index6 -> 1\n            U: index8 -> 1\n\n   Then DEDMOROZ: \n        D: 2 (from DED)\n        E: 1\n        M: 1\n        O: 1\n        R: 1\n        Z: 1\n\n   So total combined: \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let's break down the pile: \n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Let me count:\n        S: appears at the beginning (1) and then again at the end (in CLAUS: the last letter is S) -> 2\n        A: SANTA has two A's (positions 1 and 4) and then ... \n            SANTA: A at index1 and index4 -> two A's, then MOROZ has no A, DED has none, CLAUS has one A (at position 3 of CLAUS? Actually, CLAUS: C,L,A,U,S -> one A) -> total A: 2+1 = 3\n        N: SANTA has one N, MOROZ has none, DED has none, CLA",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the pile matches the combined frequency of letters from both names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Count:** Count the occurrences of each letter in the combined string and in the pile.\n4. **Comparison:** If the frequency counts of all letters in the combined string match exactly those in the pile, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three strings: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters. Each string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string called `combined`.\n3. **Frequency Counting:** The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the `combined` string and the pile string.\n4. **Comparison:** The code checks if the frequency counts of the letters in the `combined` string and the pile string are identical. If they are, it prints \"YES\", indicating that the pile can be rearranged to form the names. Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter frequencies using a straightforward method, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
