    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We are to find a non-negative integer k such that the LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized, and if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n Observation:\n Let d = (a+k, b+k) be the greatest common divisor. Then note that d divides (b - a) because:\n   (a+k) - (b+k) = a - b.\n\n So, d must be a divisor of |a-b| (unless a==b, then d can be any divisor of (a+k) but note that the LCM will be (a+k)^2 / gcd(a+k, a+k) = (a+k)^2, so we want the smallest (a+k)^2, which is when k=0).\n\n But note: k must be chosen such that d divides both a+k and b+k. Also, note that we can write:\n   Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then g divides (a-b). Moreover, we have:\n        (a+k) * (b+k) / g = LCM(a+k, b+k)\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all divisors of |a-b| for very large |a-b| (up to 10^9) and then check for each divisor d (which would be a candidate for g) what k might be? But note: we are not iterating over k, but over divisors.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that the condition on k is: \n   Let t = k + min(a,b). Then we require that g divides (a-b). Actually, we can set:\n        Let d be a divisor of |a-b|. Then we require that d divides both a+k and b+k.\n\n But note: d divides (a-b) and also d divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then we can set:\n        k ≡ -a (mod d) and k ≡ -b (mod d). But since d divides (a-b), the congruence conditions are consistent: because a ≡ b (mod d) so -a ≡ -b (mod d).\n\n Therefore, for each divisor d of |a-b| (if a != b; if a == b, then we only consider k=0? But actually we can use the same reasoning: then the divisors of 0? Actually, if a==b, then the problem reduces to minimizing LCM(a+k, a+k) = (a+k)^2. The smallest value is achieved at k=0. But note: k must be non-negative. So for a==b, answer is 0.\n\n However, note: the LCM formula: LCM(x,y) = x*y / GCD(x,y). For x=y, it's x^2.\n\n But wait: how do we relate k and the divisor d? We have that d must divide (a-b) and also d must divide (a+k) and (b+k). Since d divides (a-b), we can write: \n        k ≡ (-a) mod d   [and similarly k ≡ (-b) mod d]\n\n So, for a fixed divisor d (that divides |a-b|), the smallest non-negative k that satisfies k ≡ (-a) mod d is:\n        k0 = (-a) % d   [but note: if (-a) % d is negative? Actually, we can compute: k0 = (d - a % d) % d, but wait: we want k0 such that (a+k0) % d == 0. Alternatively, we can set k0 = (-a) % d, but in Python the modulus is non-negative. However, note: we can also consider k0 = (d - (a % d)) % d, which is the same as (-a) % d.\n\n But note: if a % d == 0, then k0 = 0. Otherwise, k0 = d - (a % d).\n\n However, we must ensure that k0 is non-negative and minimal.\n\n But note: we are iterating over divisors d of |a-b|. Then for each divisor d, we can compute a candidate k0. Then we can compute the LCM for (a+k0, b+k0). However, note: the divisor d we are considering is the gcd(a+k0, b+k0) only if k0 is chosen appropriately. Actually, by construction, d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). But is d necessarily the gcd? Not exactly: the gcd might be a multiple of d? Actually, no: because we set k0 so that d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). However, the gcd could be a multiple of d (if there is a larger common divisor). But note: we are iterating over divisors of |a-b|, and the gcd must divide |a-b|. However, the candidate k0 we get from a divisor d may yield an actual gcd that is a divisor of |a-b|, but possibly larger than d? Actually, no: because we are not forcing that d is the greatest. But wait, we are going to consider every divisor. However, the minimal LCM might come from a k that gives a particular gcd, say g, which is a divisor of |a-b|. Then we can let d=g and then k0 = (-a) % g.\n\n But note: the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k) / g. Since g divides |a-b|, and we are iterating over all divisors, we can compute the LCM for each divisor and then choose the minimal one.\n\n However, there is a catch: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors? But we are going to consider each divisor and then take the minimal k that satisfies the condition for that divisor? Actually, for each divisor d, we get a candidate k0. Then we can compute the LCM for (a+k0, b+k0) and compare.\n\n But note: the LCM is (a+k0)*(b+k0) / d? Not exactly: the gcd might be a multiple of d. Actually, we set d to be a divisor of |a-b|, and we set k0 so that d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) is at least d. However, the actual gcd might be larger. Then the LCM would be (a+k0)*(b+k0) / gcd_value, and gcd_value >= d.\n\n How can we be sure that we are capturing the minimal LCM?\n\n Alternative Insight:\n\n We know that the LCM is minimized when the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized, but note: LCM = (a+k)*(b+k) / gcd(a+k, b+k). The gcd is at least d, so the LCM is at most (a+k)*(b+k)/d. However, we are not guaranteed that the minimal LCM comes from a divisor d that is the gcd. \n\n But note: we can also consider that the gcd of (a+k, b+k) must divide (a-b). Therefore, we can iterate over the divisors of |a-b| (if a != b) and for each divisor d, we can set k0 to be the smallest non-negative integer such that d divides (a+k0) (which is k0 = (-a) % d). Then, the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) might be greater than d, but note: we are allowed to consider any divisor. However, the minimal LCM might be achieved by a k that does not necessarily correspond to a divisor being the gcd? \n\n Actually, the key is: the gcd must divide (a-b). So the set of divisors of (a-b) is the set of candidates for the gcd. And we are free to choose k. But note: for a fixed divisor d, we can set k0 so that d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the actual gcd, say g, is the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) and g divides d? Actually, no: g divides (a-b) and also g divides d? Actually, d divides (a-b) and g divides (a-b). But our k0 was set so that d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the gcd g must divide d? Because g divides (a+k0) and d divides (a+k0), so g divides d? Actually, no: the gcd g must divide (a-b) and also divides (a+k0). But note: d divides (a+k0) and d divides (a-b). There is no direct relation between g and d.\n\n Let me reframe: We are iterating over divisors d of |a-b|. Then for each divisor d, we set k0 to the smallest non-negative integer such that d divides (a+k0). Then the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) is at least d (since d divides both). But note: the gcd must divide (a-b) and d divides (a-b). However, the gcd might be any divisor of (a-b) that divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). \n\n But wait, we want to minimize the LCM. The LCM is (a+k0)*(b+k0) / g, where g is the gcd. Since g >= d, the denominator is at least d. Then the LCM is at most (a+k0)*(b+k0)/d. However, we don't know g. But note: if we consider a divisor d, then we can set k0 = (-a) % d, and then the gcd g might be a divisor of d (because g divides (a+k0) and d divides (a+k0) and g divides (a-b) and d divides (a-b))? Actually, no: the gcd g must divide (a+k0) and (b+k0). Since d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0), then g must divide d? Not necessarily: for example, if d is 4 and the numbers are 6 and 10, then gcd(6,10)=2, which divides 4. But what if we set k0 for d=2? Then we get the same k0? Actually, k0 for d=2 would be (-a)%2, and for a=6: (6+0)%2=0, so k0=0. Then the gcd is 2, which is d. But if we set d=4, then k0 = (-6)%4 = (4-6%4) %4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then we get 8 and 12, and gcd(8,12)=4, which is d. So in these examples, the gcd is exactly d.\n\n Why? Because we set k0 so that d divides (a+k0). Then the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) must be at least d. But also, the gcd must divide (a-b). However, note that (a+k0) and (b+k0) are both divisible by d, so their gcd must be divisible by d? Actually, no: the gcd is divisible by d? Wait, if d divides both, then the gcd must be divisible by d? No: the gcd is a common divisor, and d is a common divisor, so the gcd is at least d? Actually, the gcd is at least d because d divides both. But the gcd might be larger. However, note: we are iterating over divisors d of (a-b). The gcd must be a divisor of (a-b) and also divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). But we are setting k0 so that d divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the gcd g must be a divisor of (a-b) and also g must be a divisor of (a+k0). But note: d is arbitrary. \n\n However, observe: the gcd g must divide (a-b) and also g must divide (a+k0). But we set k0 so that d divides (a+k0). Then g must divide (a+k0) and (b+k0). Since g divides (a-b) and (a+k0), then g divides (a+k0) - (a-b) = b+k0 - (something)? Actually, we don't have a direct relation.\n\n But note: the condition for k0 is that d divides (a+k0). Then the gcd g must divide (a+k0) and (b+k0). But also, g divides (a-b). So g divides d? Not necessarily. \n\n However, here is an important fact: the set of divisors we are iterating over is the divisors of |a-b|. Then the gcd g must be one of the divisors of |a-b|. But we are iterating over every divisor. Then, for a candidate divisor d, we are computing a k0 that makes d divide (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the actual gcd g is the gcd of (a+k0, b+k0) and g is a divisor of |a-b| (so we can also consider d=g). \n\n So, if we iterate over all divisors d of |a-b|, then we will cover all possible g. However, we are not forced to use d as the gcd. But note: we can also consider the candidate k0 corresponding to d (the divisor) and then the gcd g might be a divisor of |a-b|, and we are already going to consider d' = g in our iteration.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. But we are trying to minimize the LCM. The LCM is (a+k0)*(b+k0)/g. And we know g divides |a-b|. \n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: If a == b, then we output 0.\n\n Step 2: Let n = |a-b|, and factorize n to get all divisors? But n can be up to 10^9, so we need to factorize and generate divisors efficiently.\n\n Step 3: For each divisor d of n (including 1 and n), do:\n        k0 = (-a) % d   [this gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k0) % d == 0]\n        Then, compute the gcd of (a+k0) and (b+k0). But wait, we don't need to compute the gcd from scratch because we know that the gcd must divide n and also we know that d divides both, but the gcd might be larger than d. However, we don't know the gcd, but we can compute it using Euclidean algorithm.\n\n        Then, LCM_candidate = (a+k0) * (b+k0) // gcd_value\n\n        Then, we compare this candidate LCM with the current best.\n\n However, note: we are iterating over divisors d, but the candidate k0 we get from d might be the same for different divisors? We need to avoid duplicate k0? Actually, we are asked for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So we can record for each k0 the minimal LCM we found.\n\n But wait: the number of divisors is O(sqrt(n)), which for n up to 10^9 is around 1000 or 10000, so we can do that.\n\n However, note: we are also including negative divisors? No, divisors are positive. But note: if a-b is negative, then we take absolute value.\n\n But wait: what if a < b? Then we set n = b - a. Then we iterate over divisors of n.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let a, b = map(int, input().split())\n   if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   n = abs(a-b)\n   Find all divisors of n.\n\n   Then for each divisor d (positive divisor) of n:\n        k0 = (-a) % d   [This gives a value in [0, d-1]]\n        Then we have two numbers: x = a+k0, y = b+k0.\n        Compute g = gcd(x, y)   [using Euclidean algorithm]\n\n        Then LCM = x * y // g\n\n        Then update:\n            best_LCM = min(best_LCM, LCM)\n            and record the k0 that gives this best_LCM (if we get the same LCM, we want the smallest k0)\n\n   But note: we must consider k0=0 as well? Actually, k0=0 is included because d=1 is always a divisor.\n\n   However, what if the minimal LCM occurs at a k that is not generated by any divisor of |a-b|? \n        But note: the gcd must divide |a-b|, so the k must be such that the gcd divides |a-b|. And we set k0 for each divisor d so that d divides (a+k0). Then we are covering every possibility for the gcd (because every divisor d is considered). But note: the gcd might be a divisor that is not d? Then we are also going to consider that divisor in the loop.\n\n   However, we are iterating over all divisors. So we are safe.\n\n   But wait: is k0 uniquely determined by d? Yes, because we are taking the smallest non-negative solution. And we are iterating over all divisors, so we will get at least one k0 for each divisor.\n\n   But note: there might be a k that is smaller than any k0 we get from the divisors? Actually, we are iterating over divisors and getting k0 from them. But note: k0 is defined as (-a) % d, so k0 is at most d-1. And d is a divisor of n, and n can be large, but we are only iterating over divisors. However, the minimal k overall might be 0, which is included because d=1 gives k0=0.\n\n   However, note: the divisors d can be very large, and k0 = (-a) % d might be large (if d is large and a is positive, then (-a) % d = d - (a % d) if a % d !=0, which can be up to d-1). But we are iterating over all divisors, so we are considering all possibilities.\n\n   But note: the problem says k>=0. We are generating non-negative k0.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the LCM is defined for positive integers. Our a+k0 and b+k0 are positive because a>=1, k0>=0, so a+k0>=1.\n\n   But wait: what if we consider divisors that are not the gcd? Then we might compute an LCM that is not minimal? Actually, no: because the LCM is (a+k0)*(b+k0)/gcd_value, and we are computing the correct gcd_value (by Euclidean algorithm). So we are correctly computing the LCM.\n\n   However, the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(n)), which is acceptable for n up to 10^9 (at most a few hundred divisors).\n\n   But wait: worst-case for divisor generation is when n is highly composite. The maximum number of divisors for n up to 10^9 is about 1344 (for example, 963761198400 has 1344 divisors, but our n is |a-b| and a,b up to 1e9, so n up to 1e9, and the maximum number of divisors for a number up to 1e9 is about 1344). So we can generate the divisors.\n\n   Steps for divisor generation:\n\n        divisors = set()\n        i = 1\n        while i*i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n            i += 1\n\n   Then iterate over divisors.\n\n   But note: what if n=0? Then a==b, but we handled that.\n\n   Example: \"6 10\" -> n=4, divisors: {1,2,4}\n\n        d=1: k0 = (-6)%1 = 0 (since any number mod 1 is 0). Then numbers: 6,10 -> gcd(6,10)=2, LCM= (6*10)//2 = 30.\n        d=2: k0 = (-6)%2 = 0 (because 6 mod2=0, so k0=0). Then same as above? Actually, wait: (-6)%2: in Python, (-6)%2 gives 0. Then the numbers are 6,10 again. But wait, we are using the same k0=0 for two divisors? Then we are computing the same candidate twice.\n\n        d=4: k0 = (-6)%4 = 2 (because 6 mod4=2, so k0=4-2=2). Then numbers: 8,12 -> gcd(8,12)=4, LCM=(8*12)//4=24.\n\n        Then we have two candidates: k0=0 (LCM=30) and k0=2 (LCM=24). So we choose k0=2.\n\n        But wait: why did d=1 and d=2 give the same k0=0? That's because the condition for d=1 and d=2 is the same: k0 must be 0 to make both numbers divisible by 1 and 2 respectively? Actually, 0 satisfies both. \n\n        However, we are iterating over divisors and we might get duplicate k0. Then we are computing the same (a+k0, b+k0) multiple times. This is inefficient and we might miss a candidate k0 that is smaller? Actually, no: we are generating all divisors, and we are computing the LCM for (a+k0, b+k0) for each distinct k0? Actually, the same k0 might appear multiple times, but we can use a dictionary to record the minimal LCM for each k0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates by storing the k0 and then the LCM, and then choose the best k0.\n\n   However, note: the problem asks for the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So if we find two different k (say k1 and k2) that yield the same minimal LCM, then we choose the smallest k.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        best_k = None\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for d in divisors:\n            k0 = (-a) % d\n            # But note: we are using d as a divisor of |a-b|, but if d is 0? no, divisors are positive and n>0 so d>=1.\n\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g = math.gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = x * y // g\n\n            Then compare current_lcm with best_lcm.\n\n            But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. We want to record the minimal LCM for each k0? Or just the minimal LCM overall and then the minimal k that achieves that?\n\n        However, we are iterating over divisors, and the same k0 might appear multiple times. So we can do:\n\n            We don't care about duplicate k0s: we are updating the best LCM and then if we find a better LCM we reset the k, or if we find the same LCM we choose the smallest k.\n\n        But note: we are required to output the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So we can do:\n\n            Let best_k = 0 (at least k=0 is considered) and best_lcm = ?\n\n            Alternatively, we can store a dictionary: lcm_by_k = {} mapping k to LCM, and then after the loop, we find the minimal LCM and the minimal k that achieves that.\n\n        However, the number of divisors is small, so we can do:\n\n            candidates = {}   # k0 -> LCM\n\n            for d in divisors:\n                k0 = (-a) % d\n                # But note: k0 might be 0, but we can have multiple d giving the same k0.\n\n                x = a + k0\n                y = b + k0\n                g = math.gcd(x, y)\n                current_lcm = x * y // g\n\n                # Now, if we have seen k0 before, we don't need to update because we are going to compare the LCM values anyway.\n\n                # But wait: we are iterating and we want the minimal LCM and then the smallest k. However, the same k0 might appear again and the LCM might be the same or different? Actually, the LCM for a fixed k0 is fixed.\n\n                # So we can simply record for each k0 the LCM, and then at the end, we look for the minimal LCM and then the minimal k0 that achieves it.\n\n            However, note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, so we can skip duplicates by storing k0 and then the LCM only once.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            best_k = 0\n            best_lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)   # but wait, k=0: we have to consider k=0 separately? Actually, we are generating k0 from divisors, and d=1 gives k0=0.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over divisors, and we are getting k0=0 for divisors that divide a. Then we are computing the LCM for k0=0. Then we are good.\n\n        However, we must consider k0 that are generated by divisors that are divisors of |a-b|. But what if there is a k that is not generated by any divisor? Then we would miss it. But note: the gcd of (a+k, b+k) must divide |a-b|. Then the condition for k is that the gcd divides |a-b|, so k must satisfy: there exists a divisor d (of |a-b|) such that d divides (a+k) and (b+k). Then k must be congruent to (-a) mod d for some divisor d. Therefore, the set of k we are considering is complete.\n\n   But note: there is another way to get k: by solving the equation that the gcd is a divisor d, and k ≡ -a (mod d). Then k0 is the smallest non-negative solution. Then we are covering all k that make the gcd a divisor of |a-b|.\n\n   However, note: the minimal k might be obtained from a divisor d that is not the gcd, but that's okay because we are computing the actual LCM (with the true gcd) for the candidate k0.\n\n   But wait: the candidate k0 we get from divisor d might not be the minimal k that achieves the true gcd (which is a divisor of |a-b|). However, we are required to choose the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. And we are generating k0 for every divisor d. It is possible that for two divisors d1 and d2, we get two different k0, and one of them yields a lower LCM, and we are capturing that.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the divisor d we use is the gcd. We are just using d to define k0 so that d divides (a+k0). Then the actual gcd might be larger. But we are computing the LCM correctly.\n\n   Example: a=6, b=10, divisor d=1: k0=0 -> LCM=30\n            divisor d=2: k0=0 -> same as above, LCM=30\n            divisor d=4: k0=2 -> LCM=24\n\n        Then we choose k0=2.\n\n   But note: what if we consider k=1?\n        k=1: numbers 7 and 11 -> gcd(7,11)=1, LCM=77 -> worse.\n\n   What about k=3?\n        k=3: numbers 9 and 13 -> gcd=1, LCM=117.\n\n   k=4: 10 and 14 -> gcd=2, LCM=70.\n\n   k=5: 11 and 15 -> gcd=1, LCM=165.\n\n   k=6: 12 and 16 -> gcd=4, LCM=48 -> wait, 48 is less than 24? No, wait: 12 and 16: LCM(12,16)=48, which is more than 24.\n\n   Actually, we found that k=2 gives 24, which is the minimal.\n\n   But note: k0=2 is generated by divisor d=4. \n\n   However, wait: is k=2 generated by divisor d=4? \n        Condition: (6+2) % 4 = 8 %4 =0, and (10+2)%4=12%4=0. So yes.\n\n   But note: the divisor d=4 is a divisor of 4 (n=4). \n\n   Another example: \"21 31\", output 9.\n\n        n = 10, divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\n        d=1: k0=0 -> numbers 21,31 -> gcd=1, LCM=21*31=651.\n        d=2: k0= (-21)%2 = 1 (since 21 is odd, then k0=1) -> numbers 22,32 -> gcd(22,32)=2, LCM= (22*32)//2=352.\n        d=5: k0= (-21)%5 = (5-21%5)= (5-1)=4 -> numbers 25,35 -> gcd(25,35)=5, LCM= (25*35)//5=175.\n        d=10: k0= (-21)%10 = (10-21%10)= (10-1)=9 -> numbers 30,40 -> gcd(30,40)=10, LCM= (30*40)//10=120.\n\n        Then the minimal LCM is 120 at k0=9.\n\n        But wait, is there a k between 0 and 9 that gives a lower LCM?\n        k=0: 651\n        k=1: 22,32 -> 352\n        k=2: 23,33 -> gcd(23,33)=1 -> LCM=759\n        k=3: 24,34 -> gcd=2 -> LCM= (24*34)//2=408\n        k=4: 25,35 -> 175\n        k=5: 26,36 -> gcd(26,36)=2 -> LCM= (26*36)//2=468\n        k=6: 27,37 -> gcd=1 -> LCM=999\n        k=7: 28,38 -> gcd=2 -> LCM= (28*38)//2=532\n        k=8: 29,39 -> gcd=1 -> LCM=1131\n        k=9: 30,40 -> 120\n\n        So indeed, 120 is the minimal.\n\n   However, note: the example \"5 10\": \n        Input: \"5 10\" -> Output: \"0\"\n\n        n = 5, divisors: 1,5.\n\n        d=1: k0=0 -> numbers 5,10 -> gcd=5, LCM=(5*10)//5=10.\n        d=5: k0= (-5)%5=0 -> same as above.\n\n        Then we get k0=0 and LCM=10.\n\n        Is that minimal? Let's check other k:\n\n        k=0: 5,10 -> LCM=10\n        k=1: 6,11 -> gcd=1 -> LCM=66\n        k=2: 7,12 -> gcd=1 -> LCM=84\n        k=3: 8,13 -> gcd=1 -> LCM=104\n        k=4: 9,14 -> gcd=1 -> LCM=126\n        k=5: 10,15 -> gcd=5 -> LCM= (10*15)//5=30\n\n        So k=0 gives 10, which is the minimal.\n\n   But wait: the example output is '0'. So our method returns k0=0.\n\n   However, note: the example input \"5 10\" is provided and expected output is \"0\".\n\n   But wait: why in the example \"5 10\" the divisor d=5 gives the same k0=0? Because (-5)%5=0. Then we are considering k0=0 twice. Then we compute the same LCM twice. Then we update best_lcm to 10 and best_k to 0.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        import math\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n\n        if a == b:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n = abs(a-b)\n        # Generate all divisors of n\n        divisors = set()\n        i = 1\n        # We can optimize the square root part\n        while i*i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n            i += 1\n\n        best_k = 0\n        best_lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)   # for k=0, but note: we are going to iterate and update.\n\n        # But wait, we don't know if k=0 is the best? We are going to iterate over divisors and update.\n\n        # Instead, we can initialize best_lcm to a very large number.\n\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for d in divisors:\n            # d is positive\n            k0 = (-a) % d   # This is the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k0) % d == 0\n\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g = math.gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = x * y // g\n\n            if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm:\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k0\n            elif best_lcm == current_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n                best_k = k0\n\n        print(best_k)\n\n   But wait: the above code uses the Euclidean algorithm for each divisor. The Euclidean algorithm runs in O(log(min(x,y))), which is acceptable because we have at most 1344 divisors.\n\n   However, note: the same k0 might appear multiple times. Then we are updating the best_lcm and best_k for the same k0? That's okay because we are comparing the LCM for the same k0: if we get the same LCM again, then we update best_k to the smallest k0 that gives that LCM. But note: the same k0 will always yield the same LCM. So if we get the same k0 again, we are effectively doing:\n\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm: then update\n        elif current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k: then update\n\n   But wait: if the same k0 appears twice, then the LCM is the same, and we are updating best_k to the smallest k0 that gives that LCM. However, the same k0 is the same value, so the second time we see the same k0, we won't update (unless we have a lower LCM, but the LCM is fixed for k0). \n\n   But note: the same k0 is generated by multiple divisors, so we are computing the same LCM multiple times. This is redundant. We can avoid by storing the LCM for each k0.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, he needs to choose the smallest one.\" \n\n   But note: the same k0 is the same k, so if we see the same k0 again, we don't need to update. \n\n   But wait: what if two different divisors lead to the same k0? Then we are computing the same LCM. Then the update condition for the same k0 is: if we have the same LCM, then we don't update because k0 is the same. So we are safe.\n\n   However, we can improve by storing the minimal LCM for each k0. But the problem is that we are iterating by divisors, and the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, and we are updating best_k even if the LCM is the same and k0 is the same? Actually, no: the same k0 will have the same LCM. So we can break the update into:\n\n        We want to consider each distinct k0 only once? Actually, no: because two different divisors might lead to the same k0, but we are going to compute the LCM for that k0 multiple times. We can",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), denoted as \\( n = |a - b| \\). This is because the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is \\( a - b \\), and any common divisor of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide this difference.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\), we can compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( d \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( k = (-a) \\% d \\). Once we have \\( k \\), we can compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) using their GCD.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Divisor Generation**: Generate all divisors of \\( n \\) efficiently by iterating up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n   - **LCM Calculation**: For each divisor \\( d \\), compute the corresponding \\( k \\) and then the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - **Optimal \\( k \\) Selection**: Track the minimal LCM encountered and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves this LCM.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( O(\\sqrt{n}) \\), which is feasible since \\( n \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\). Each divisor requires a GCD calculation, which is \\( O(\\log(\\min(a + k, b + k))) \\), making the overall complexity manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        k0 = (-a) % d\n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        g = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = x * y // g\n        \n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n        elif current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n            best_k = k0\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). If they are equal, it immediately outputs \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of two identical numbers is minimized at \\( k = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Divisor Generation**: The absolute difference \\( n = |a - b| \\) is computed, and all divisors of \\( n \\) are found by checking each integer up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**:\n   - For each divisor \\( d \\), the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) is calculated such that \\( d \\) divides both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - The LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is computed using their GCD.\n   - The minimal LCM and the corresponding smallest \\( k \\) are tracked throughout the iteration over all divisors.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing all divisors, the smallest \\( k \\) that minimizes the LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the candidates for \\( k \\) by leveraging the divisors of the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
