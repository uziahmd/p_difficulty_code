Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour.\n   - After burning, each candle becomes a burned candle.\n   - Then, we can take 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n We can simulate the process until we don't have enough burned candles to make a new one.\n\n However, note that the problem is small (a and b between 1 and 1000) so we can use a while loop.\n\n But let's think step by step:\n\n Let:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a   (these are the new candles we have initially)\n   burned = 0\n\n However, we can also think in terms of:\n   Each time we burn candles, we get as many hours as the number of candles we burn at that step.\n   And then we collect the burned ones and convert some of them into new candles.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   leftover = 0   # This will track how many burned candles we have left over from previous steps\n\n   But actually, we can consider:\n\n   Step 1: Burn all the candles we have (candles). This gives us 'candles' hours.\n   Then, we add the same number to the burned count, and then we can form new candles from the burned ones.\n\n   However, we need to keep track of the burned candles and the new ones.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   But wait, we start with 'a' candles. We burn them, so we get 'a' hours, then we have 'a' burned candles.\n\n   Then we can make floor(burned / b) new candles and leave (burned % b) burned candles.\n\n   Then the next round: we have the new candles (from recycling) and we can burn them too.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   burned_count = 0\n\n   But actually, we can accumulate the hours by the initial candles and then the recycled ones.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let total = 0\n   Let remaining = a   # the current available candles (both new and recycled ones)\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_new = a\n   current_burned = 0\n\n   Then while current_new > 0:\n        total_hours += current_new   # burning all current_new candles\n        current_burned += current_new   # because they become burned after burning\n        # Now, from the burned ones, we can make new candles\n        new_candles = current_burned // b\n        current_burned = current_burned % b   # leftover burned candles\n        current_new = new_candles\n\n   But wait: the above simulation does not account for the fact that the burned candles from the previous step are used to make new candles, and then we burn those new ones.\n\n   However, note: when we burn the new candles, they become burned and then we can use all the burned ones again (including leftovers from previous recycling).\n\n   But let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n   Step 1: \n        current_new = 4\n        total_hours = 4\n        current_burned = 4\n        new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2, current_burned = 0\n        current_new becomes 2\n\n   Step 2:\n        total_hours = 4 + 2 = 6\n        current_burned = 2\n        new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1, current_burned = 0\n        current_new becomes 1\n\n   Step 3:\n        total_hours = 6 + 1 = 7\n        current_burned = 1\n        new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0, current_burned = 1 -> then current_new becomes 0, so we break.\n\n   So total_hours = 7, which matches the sample.\n\n   However, consider the second sample: \"6 3\"\n\n   Step 1:\n        current_new = 6\n        total_hours = 6\n        current_burned = 6\n        new_candles = 6 // 3 = 2, current_burned = 0\n        current_new = 2\n\n   Step 2:\n        total_hours = 8\n        current_burned = 2\n        new_candles = 2 // 3 = 0, current_burned = 2 -> then break.\n\n   So total_hours = 8, which matches.\n\n   But wait,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be recycled to form new candles, provided there are enough of them. The recycling process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (a) and the number of burned candles needed to make a new one (b).\n2. **Simulate Burning Process**: \n   - Burn all available candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n   - The burned candles from this step are collected and used to create new candles. The number of new candles is calculated by dividing the total burned candles by b (using integer division), and any leftover burned candles are kept for future steps.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when there are not enough burned candles left to form even one new candle (i.e., when the number of burned candles is less than b).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring optimal usage of all available candles and their burned remnants.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_new_candles = a\n    current_burned = 0\n\n    while current_new_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_new_candles\n        current_burned += current_new_candles\n        new_candles = current_burned // b\n        current_burned = current_burned % b\n        current_new_candles = new_candles\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The program reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (burned candles needed per new candle).\n- **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn (`current_new_candles > 0`).\n  - **Burning Phase**: Each iteration adds the number of current new candles to `total_hours`, representing the hours they will burn.\n  - **Recycling Phase**: The burned candles from the current step are added to `current_burned`. The number of new candles that can be made is determined by dividing `current_burned` by `b` (using integer division). The remainder after division is stored back in `current_burned` for potential use in future steps.\n  - **Update**: `current_new_candles` is set to the newly created candles, and the loop repeats if there are still candles to burn.\n- **Output**: After the loop terminates, the total hours accumulated (`total_hours`) is printed.\n\nThis method efficiently calculates the total burning time by leveraging the recycling of burned candles, ensuring optimal usage at each step. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of candles, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
