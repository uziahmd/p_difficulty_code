The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. The president wants to remove k districts (so we keep n-k districts) such that the remaining graph is connected (i.e., forms a connected tree) and the total fan count (which is 2^district_number) is maximized.\n\n Observation:\n Since the graph is a tree, the remaining set of districts must form a connected subgraph. In a tree, a connected subgraph is just a subtree (or a set of nodes that includes all the edges between them). However, note that we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily, but the condition is that the remaining nodes must be connected.\n\n We wish to maximize the total fan count = sum(2^i) for the remaining districts i.\n\n Note: The value 2^i grows exponentially with i. So higher-numbered districts have more fans.\n\n Therefore, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, and remove as few as possible from the lower-numbered ones, but we must ensure connectivity.\n\n However, note: Removing a high-numbered district might break the connectivity of the entire graph, so we cannot simply remove the k smallest districts.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's consider: We are going to keep n-k districts. The best districts in terms of fan count are the largest ones (since 2^i is increasing with i). So we would prefer to keep the largest n-k districts.\n\n But is that always possible? Not necessarily, because if the largest n-k districts do not form a connected subgraph (in the original tree), then we cannot do that.\n\n However, note: The entire country is a tree. The problem then reduces to: Find the largest set of districts (with the largest numbers) that form a connected subtree.\n\n Actually, we can reframe the problem: We want to remove k districts (the smallest k by fan count? but note: we want to maximize the total fan count, so we want to remove the least valuable ones? However, wait: we are forced to keep the graph connected.\n\n Another way: The problem is equivalent to: Find a connected subgraph (spanning some n-k nodes) with the maximum total fan count.\n\n Since the fan counts are increasing with the district number, we want to include the highest numbered nodes. However, we must have connectivity.\n\n How about: We try to keep the largest (n-k) nodes. Then check if they form a connected subgraph? But note: the entire graph is a tree, so the induced subgraph of a set of nodes in a tree is connected if and only if the set is connected (i.e., the entire set lies on a single path or forms a connected component). However, we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily. We don't have to remove contiguous ones.\n\n But note: The entire graph is a tree. The connectedness condition is that the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\n However, there is a known fact: In a tree, the minimal connected subgraph containing a set of nodes is the union of the simple paths between every pair of nodes. But we don't need to compute that.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: What is the maximum total fan count? It must be the sum of 2^i for the largest n-k districts, but if we cannot form a connected subgraph with those, then we must drop some of the high-value nodes and take some lower ones to maintain connectivity.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we keep the largest n-k nodes. But because the fan count is increasing, we would never want to keep a lower-numbered node and remove a higher-numbered one if we can avoid it. So the goal is to find the largest set of nodes (by node index) that is connected and has size n-k.\n\n But wait: the problem says we remove exactly k districts. And we wish to maximize the total fan count. The fan count is 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i. So we definitely want to keep the largest (n-k) nodes if they form a connected subgraph. Otherwise, we have to drop some of the high-value nodes and keep lower ones to maintain connectivity.\n\n However, note: the set of the largest n-k nodes might not be connected. Then we must choose a connected set of n-k nodes that has the maximum sum. Since the fan count is increasing, the maximum sum must be achieved by including as many large nodes as possible.\n\n This problem is similar to: Given a tree, remove k nodes such that the remaining set is connected and the sum of 2^i is maximized. But note: we are removing k nodes, so we are keeping n-k nodes.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know we want to keep the largest n-k nodes if they are connected. But how do we check if the set S (the largest n-k nodes) is connected?\n\n 2. However, note: the entire graph is a tree. The set",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts to remove from a tree-structured graph such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected subgraph and the total fan count (sum of 2^i for each remaining district i) is maximized. The key insight here is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the fan count due to the exponential nature of the values, so we prioritize keeping the largest possible districts while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node (district) has a fan count of 2^i. The goal is to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected subgraph and the sum of their fan counts is maximized. Since the fan counts grow exponentially with the district number, we should aim to keep the highest-numbered nodes possible.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal solution involves keeping the largest (n-k) nodes if they form a connected subgraph. If not, we need to adjust by replacing some high-numbered nodes with lower-numbered ones to maintain connectivity, but this adjustment should minimize the loss in fan count.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Step 1**: Sort the districts in descending order of their numbers to prioritize higher-numbered districts.\n   - **Step 2**: Use a union-find (disjoint set) data structure to check connectivity among the top m districts (where m starts at n-k and decreases until a connected subgraph is found).\n   - **Step 3**: Once the largest connected subgraph of size (n-k) is found, the removed districts are the smallest k districts not included in this subgraph.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the districts takes O(n log n) time. The union-find operations for connectivity checks take nearly O(n α(n)) time, where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000000)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    k = int(next(it))\n    \n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(next(it))\n        b = int(next(it))\n        edges.append((a, b))\n        \n    sorted_nodes = sorted(range(1, n+1), reverse=True)\n    \n    parent = list(range(n+1))\n    rank = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    def find(x):\n        if parent[x] != x:\n            parent[x] = find(parent[x])\n        return parent[x]\n    \n    def union(x, y):\n        rx = find(x)\n        ry = find(y)\n        if rx == ry:\n            return False\n        if rank[rx] < rank[ry]:\n            parent[rx] = ry\n        elif rank[rx] > rank[ry]:\n            parent[ry] = rx\n        else:\n            parent[ry] = rx\n            rank[rx] += 1\n        return True\n\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for a, b in edges:\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n        \n    m = n - k\n    current_set_size = 0\n    selected_nodes = set()\n    pointer = 0\n    while current_set_size < m and pointer < n:\n        node = sorted_nodes[pointer]\n        selected_nodes.add(node)\n        current_set_size += 1\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor in selected_nodes:\n                continue\n            if find(node) != find(neighbor):\n                union(node, neighbor)\n                \n        root = find(node)\n        component_size = sum(1 for i in range(1, n+1) if find(i) == root)\n        if component_size != current_set_size:\n            for i in range(pointer):\n                selected_nodes.remove(sorted_nodes[i])\n            break\n            \n        pointer += 1\n        \n    if len(selected_nodes) == m:\n        removed_nodes = sorted(set(range(1, n+1)) - selected_nodes)\n    else:\n        target_set = set()\n        for i in range(pointer):\n            target_set.add(sorted_nodes[i])\n            \n        removed_nodes = sorted(set(range(1, n+1)) - target_set)\n        \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, removed_nodes[:k])))\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k), followed by the edges of the tree.\n2. **Sorting Nodes**: Districts are sorted in descending order to prioritize higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: This structure helps efficiently manage and check the connectivity of subsets of nodes.\n4. **Connectivity Check**: Starting from the highest-numbered district, we incrementally add districts to a set and use union-find to ensure the added districts maintain connectivity. If the current set of districts does not form a connected subgraph, we backtrack and adjust the set.\n5. **Output**: The districts not included in the largest connected subgraph of size (n-k) are the ones to be removed, and they are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph while maximizing the total fan count by leveraging sorting and union-find operations.",
