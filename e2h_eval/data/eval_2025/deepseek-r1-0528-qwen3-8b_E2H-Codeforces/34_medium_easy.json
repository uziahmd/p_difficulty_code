And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we calculate the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of sleep times in all weeks (each week is a contiguous k days).\n Then, the average is S / (number of weeks) = S / (n - k + 1).\n\n But note: Each week is defined by k consecutive days. How to compute S?\n We can precompute the prefix sum array for the list `a` so that we can quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Precompute the prefix sum array `prefix` where:\n      prefix[0] = 0\n      prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n    Then the sum of a contiguous segment from i to j (0-indexed) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\n 3. The total sum S for all weeks is the sum of the sums of each contiguous segment of length k.\n    That is, for i from 0 to n-k:\n        week_sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n    So, S = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n 4. The number of weeks is w = n - k + 1.\n 5. Then the average = S / w.\n\n However, note: We can also compute S without iterating over each week if we use the prefix sum array more efficiently.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute S by:\n   S = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n But note: This is the same as (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) minus (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   S = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n But wait, is there a simpler way?\n\n Actually, we can compute the entire S by:\n\n   S = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n But note: The prefix array is built from the input, and we can compute the sum of the first (n-k+1) terms of the prefix array (from index 0 to n-k) and the next (n - (n-k)) = k terms? \n\n Alternatively, we can iterate from i=0 to i=n-k and add (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]). That is straightforward.\n\n However, note the constraints: n up to 200,000. Iterating over (n-k+1) which can be up to 200,000 is acceptable.\n\n But let's think: we can avoid iterating twice by just using a single loop for the prefix sum.\n\n Another idea: we can precompute the prefix sum and then use two slices of the prefix array.\n\n Since we have the prefix array, we can compute:\n\n   S = 0\n   for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n        S += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n Then divide by (n-k+1).\n\n However, note: the prefix array has length n+1, so we can only go from 0 to n-k (inclusive) for the starting index, and the last segment starts at n-k and goes to n-1, so i+k <= n.\n\n But wait, the above loop runs (n-k+1) times, and each step is O(1). Total operations O(n), which is acceptable.\n\n But note: we can also use a different approach: \n\n   S = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[n-k])\n\n   = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n Now, how to compute the sum of the prefix array from index k to n? And from 0 to n-k?\n\n We can precompute the entire prefix array, then:\n\n   part1 = sum(prefix[k:n+1])\n   part2 = sum(prefix[0:n-k+1])\n   S = part1 - part2\n\n But note: the prefix array is of length n+1, and indices from 0 to n.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   S = (sum of prefix from index k to n) - (sum of prefix from index 0 to n-k)\n\n But building the entire prefix array already takes O(n). Then summing two slices of the prefix array (which is an array of n+1 numbers) would take O(n). So total O(n) anyway.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the prefix array is cumulative, but that doesn't help.\n\n However, we can compute the entire S without building the prefix array in two steps, but we need the prefix array anyway.\n\n Let me write the code with the iterative method:\n\n Steps:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n   prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(total_weeks):\n        # Each week starting at i, ending at i+k-1\n        total_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   Then format the output to have 10 decimal places or until the error is within 1e-6.\n\n But note: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives 9.0.\n\n Let's check: \n     n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n     prefix = [0, 3, 7, 14]\n\n     total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n     i=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n     i=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 14 - 3 = 11\n     total_sum = 7+11 = 18\n     average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> correct.\n\n However, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait, the example input \"1 1\\n10\" gives 10.0.\n\n     n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n     prefix = [0,10]\n     total_weeks = 1\n     i=0: prefix[1]-prefix[0]=10\n     average=10/1=10.0\n\n And the third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n     n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n     total_weeks = 7\n     We have to compute the sum of 7 weeks, each week is two consecutive days.\n\n     Week1: 1+2 = 3\n     Week2: 2+4 = 6\n     Week3: 4+100000=100004\n     Week4: 100000+123=100123\n     Week5: 123+456=579\n     Week6: 456+789=1245\n     Week7: 789+1=790\n\n     Total_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n         3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201960; 201960+790=202750.\n\n     average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n     The example output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n     However, let me check: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... indeed.\n\n But wait, the example input says: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        Output: '28964.2857142857'\n\n However, our calculation: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... is correct.\n\n But note: the example output string is given as '28964.2857142857'. \n\n However, let me recalc the total_sum from the prefix array:\n\n     prefix = [0, 1, 3, 7, 100007, 100130, 100586, 200375, 201164]\n\n     Wait, let me build the prefix array correctly:\n\n        prefix[0]=0\n        prefix[1]=a0=1\n        prefix[2]=a0+a1=1+2=3\n        prefix[3]=3+4=7\n        prefix[4]=7+100000=100007\n        prefix[5]=100007+123=100130\n        prefix[6]=100130+456=100586\n        prefix[7]=100586+789=101375\n        prefix[8]=101375+1=101376\n\n     Now, we have 7 weeks (i from 0 to 6):\n\n        i=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 3-0=3\n        i=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 7-1=6\n        i=2: prefix[4]-prefix[2] = 100007-3=100004\n        i=3: prefix[5]-prefix[3] = 100130-7=100123\n        i=4: prefix[6]-prefix[4] = 100586-100007=579\n        i=5: prefix[7]-prefix[5] = 101375-100130=1245\n        i=6: prefix[8]-prefix[6] = 101376-100586=790\n\n     Sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n        3+6=9\n        9+100004=100013\n        100013+100123=200136\n        200136+579=200715\n        200715+1245=201960\n        201960+790=202750\n\n     So the calculation is correct.\n\n However, note: the example input provided was: \n        ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n But wait, the example output for the third one is '28964.2857142857' which is 202750/7.\n\n However, in the problem statement, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n        Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n But note: the example output in the problem statement is written as:\n\n        Output: ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n So we must output the same.\n\n However, we must be cautious about floating point precision. But since the numbers are integers and we are dividing by an integer (n-k+1), the result might be a float. Python floats have enough precision for this.\n\n But note: the problem constraints say that n and k can be up to 200,000 and a_i up to 10^5. The maximum total_sum could be 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which is within the range of Python integers and floats (but for floats, 20e9 is exactly representable).\n\n However, we are asked to output with absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. Using float division and formatting to 10 decimal places should be safe.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n, k and the list a.\n\n   If k == 0? but n>=k and k>=1, so no.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Build prefix sum array\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0.0\n        for i in range(num_weeks):\n            # Each week starting at i, ending at i+k-1, so the sum is from index i to i+k-1 (0-indexed)\n            # This is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n            total_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n        # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n But note: the example outputs have trailing zeros. The formatting {:.10f} will output 9.0000000000, etc.\n\n However, we can also use formatting that ensures 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n But wait, what if the average is an integer? We want it to show as integer part and then 10 zeros.\n\n The formatting {:.10f} does that.\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: 9.0 -> 9.0000000000\n Example 2: 10.0 -> 10.0000000000\n Example 3: 202750/7 -> 28964.2857142857...\n\n However, note: the example output for the third one is given as 28964.2857142857 (with 10 digits) but the example output string in the problem is written as '28964.2857142857'. \n\n But note: the sample output in the problem statement is:\n\n        Output: ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n However, the third number has 10 digits after the decimal? Let me count: 28964.2857142857 -> \n        28964 . 2857142857 -> 10 digits: 2857142857 (that's 10 digits)\n\n But wait, the example output string in the problem has 10 digits? Actually, the example output string is written as:\n\n        '28964.2857142857'\n\n That is 10 digits after the decimal? Actually, let's break down:\n\n        '28964.2857142857'\n        Integer part: 28964\n        Decimal part: 2857142857 -> that's 10 digits.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point\", but we are outputting 10.\n\n However, the problem also says: \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.\"\n\n But note: the example outputs 10 decimal places. We can output 10 decimal places to be safe.\n\n However, there is an alternative: we can use formatting that removes trailing zeros? But the problem says at least 6, but the example outputs 10.\n\n But the problem example outputs are with 10 decimal places. So we output 10.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least 6\", meaning we can output more. It doesn't specify maximum. However, the example output is 10.\n\n So we output 10.\n\n But wait, the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" outputs 9.0000000000 (which is 10 zeros). \n\n However, the problem says: \"In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\"\n\n But the sample outputs are given with 10. So we follow the sample output style.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\n But note: the problem expects the output exactly as in the example.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes the number of digits might be less than 10, but we are formatting to 10. This is acceptable.\n\n But what if the average is an integer? Then we get an integer and then 10 zeros. That's acceptable.\n\n Let me run the code with the examples.\n\n Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> average=9.0 -> formatted to \"9.0000000000\"\n\n Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> average=10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n Example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> average=28964.2857142857 -> formatted to \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n But wait: when I printed 28964.2857142857, the formatting might round the last digit? \n\n However, we are using floating point. The total_sum is an integer, and then we divide by an integer (num_weeks). But note: 202750 divided by 7 is 28964.285714285714... (repeating). \n\n The formatting {:.10f} rounds to the nearest 10th. Since 202750/7 is approximately 28964.285714285714..., the 11th digit is 2, so rounding to 10 digits: 28964.2857142857.\n\n But wait, actually the exact value is 28964.285714285714... and the 10th digit is 7 and the 11th is 1 (because 285714 repeats). \n\n Actually, 202750 / 7 = 28964.285714285714... (period 6). \n\n So the decimal representation is: 28964.285714285714...\n\n Formatting to 10 decimal places: we look at the 11th digit to round the 10th.\n\n The 10th digit is the 7 (from 2857142857) and the 11th is 1 (from the next 285714...), so we don't round up.\n\n Therefore, we get 28964.2857142857.\n\n However, note: the example output is given as '28964.2857142857'. \n\n But wait, the example output in the problem is written as:\n\n        Output: ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n However, there is a potential performance issue: building the prefix array and then iterating over n-k+1 elements. Since n can be up to 200,000, the prefix array is built in O(n) and the loop is O(n). This is acceptable.\n\n But note: we can also compute the total_sum without building the prefix array? \n\n Actually, we can compute the total_sum by:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(k, n+1):   # i from k to n, but note: we are going to subtract the prefix[i] by prefix[i-k]? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to compute the sum of all windows of length k, but that is essentially the same as the prefix sum method.\n\n However, let me consider:\n\n        Let b[i] = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i] for i from 0 to n-k.\n\n        Then total_sum = sum(b[i] for i in range(0, n-k+1))\n\n        But note: prefix[i+k] is the sum of a[0..i+k-1] and prefix[i] is the sum of a[0..i-1]. So the difference is the sum of a[i..i+k-1].\n\n        This is the standard way to compute the sum of a sliding window.\n\n        We can also compute the entire total_sum by:\n\n            total_sum = 0\n            current = sum(a[0:k])   # first window\n            total_sum += current\n            for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n                current = current - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total_sum += current\n\n        This is also O(n) and avoids building the prefix array. However, we have to read the list a.\n\n        But note: we already read the list a. \n\n        Which method is faster? The prefix sum method uses an extra array and then a loop. The sliding window uses a single pass for the window sum.\n\n        However, the problem constraints are 200,000, so both are acceptable.\n\n        But the problem says: n up to 200,000. The sliding window method:\n\n            Step 1: read n,k and list a (O(n))\n            Step 2: compute the first window (O(k))\n            Step 3: for i from 1 to n-k (n-k steps) update the window (O(1) per step)\n\n        So total O(n). Similarly, the prefix sum method is O(n). \n\n        However, the prefix sum method uses O(n) memory, while the sliding window uses O(1) memory (except storing the list a).\n\n        But the problem doesn't specify memory constraints, so either is acceptable.\n\n        Let me choose the sliding window for efficiency and to avoid building an extra array.\n\n        Steps for sliding window:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            if k == 0:\n                # but k>=1, so skip\n                num_weeks = n + 1   # not needed, k>=1\n            else:\n                num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n            # If there are no weeks, then num_weeks==0, but k<=n so n-k+1>=1.\n\n            # Compute the sum of the first window (from index0 to index k-1)\n            total_sum = 0\n            current = sum(a[:k])   # first window\n            total_sum += current\n\n            # Then for the next windows, starting from i=k (so the window from k to 2k-1, then 2k to 3k-1, etc.)\n            # But wait, the window moves one element at a time.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can start from the second window (starting at index1) to the last (starting at index n-k)\n\n            # The number of windows is num_weeks, so we have to do num_weeks-1 additional windows.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            #   for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n            #       current = current - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            #       total_sum += current\n\n            # But note: when i=1, we remove a[0] and add a[k] (because the window goes from index1 to index1+k-1 = k)\n\n            # Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n            #   First window: i=0, current = 3+4=7, total_sum=7.\n            #   Then i=1: current = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7 - 3 + a[2] = 7-3+7=11, total_sum=18.\n\n            # Correct.\n\n            # However, what if k==1? Then we are removing the first element and adding the next, but the window size is 1. Then:\n\n            #   n=3, k=1, a=[3,4,7]\n            #   First window: current = 3, total_sum=3.\n            #   Then i=1: current = 3 - a[0] + a[1] = 3-3+4=4 -> then add 4, total_sum=7.\n            #   Then i=2: current = 4 - a[1] + a[2] = 4-4+7=7 -> total_sum=14.\n\n            # Number of windows: 3, so average=14/3≈4.666...\n\n            # But wait: the weeks are [3],[4],[7] -> total_sum=3+4+7=14, yes.\n\n            # So the sliding window works for k=1.\n\n            # We can use this method.\n\n        But note: the problem says k>=1, so k=1 is allowed.\n\n        However, the problem states: \"the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days.\" and then \"consider k consecutive days as a week\".\n\n        This method is efficient.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" becomes:\n\n            n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n            num_weeks=1\n            current = sum(a[0:1]) = 10\n            total_sum = 10\n            Then no loop (since num_weeks-1=0)\n\n            average=10/1=10.0 -> correct.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n            if num_weeks == 0:\n                # According to constraints, n>=k so this won't happen, but still.\n                print(0.0)\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Compute the first window\n            current = sum(a[:k])\n            total_sum = current\n\n            # Then for the next windows: from i=1 to i=num_weeks-1 (total num_weeks-1 windows)\n            for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n                # Remove the element that is leaving the window: a[i-1]\n                # Add the new element: a[i+k-1]\n                current = current - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total_sum += current\n\n            average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        But wait, what if k==0? The problem states k>=1, so we don't handle k==0.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"The first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105)\", so k>=1.\n\n        But note: the above loop for i in range(1, num_weeks) runs from 1 to num_weeks-1. \n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, num_weeks=2, then i in [1] -> one iteration.\n\n        Example: n=1, k=1, num_weeks=1, then the loop runs from 1 to 0 (so no iteration). Correct.\n\n        Example: n=2, k=2, a=[10,20]\n            num_weeks=1\n            current = sum(a[0:2]) = 30\n            total_sum=30\n            average=30/1=30.0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=4, k=2, a=[10,20,30,40]\n            num_weeks=3\n            current = 10+20=30, total_sum=30\n            i=1: current = 30 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 30-10+a[2] = 20+30=50, total_sum=30+50=80\n            i=2: current = 50 - a[1] + a[3] = 50-20+40=70, total_sum=80+70=150\n            average=150/3=50.0\n\n            The three weeks: [10,20]=30, [20,30]=50, [30,40]=70 -> total=150, average=50.0 -> correct.\n\n        This method is correct.\n\n        However, note: the initial window is from index0 to indexk-1, then the next window is from index1 to indexk, etc.\n\n        This is standard.\n\n        But note: the example input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" with sliding window:\n\n            a = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n            k=2, so first window: 1+2=3, total_sum=3\n            Then i=1: current = 3 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 3-1+a[2] = 2+4=6 -> total_sum=9\n            Then i=2: current = 6 - a[1] + a[3] = 6-2+100000=100004 -> total_sum=9+100004=100013\n            Then i=3: current = 100004 - a[2] + a[4] = 100004-4+123=100123 -> total_sum=100013+100123=200136\n            Then i=4: current = 100123 - a[3] + a[5] = 100123-100000+456=579 -> total_sum=200136+579=200715\n            Then i=5: current = 579 - a[4] + a[6] = 579-123+456=912? -> wait, 579-123=456, 456+456=912? -> but wait, a[6] is 789.\n\n            Correction: \n                i=5: current = 579 (from previous) - a[4] (which is 123) + a[5+2-1] = a[6] (which is 789) -> 579-123+789 = 579-123=456, 456+789=1245.\n\n            Then i=6: current = 1245 - a[5] + a[7] = 1245-456+1=790.\n\n            Then total_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 202750.\n\n            So the above step-by-step matches.\n\n        But wait, why did I get 912 in the calculation above? I made a mistake: the index for the new element is i+k-1, and i=5, then k=2, so index=5+2-1=6 -> a[6]=789.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n            if num_weeks == 0:\n                print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            else:\n                # Calculate the sum of the first window\n                current = sum(a[:k])\n                total_sum = current\n\n                # Iterate for the next windows\n                for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n                    # Subtract the element that is leaving the window (at index i-1) and add the new element (at index i+k-1)\n                    current = current - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                    total_sum += current\n\n                average = total_sum / num_weeks\n                print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        This is efficient and uses O(1) extra space (apart from the input list).\n\n        However, note: the first window is from 0 to k-1, and the next window from 1 to k, then 2 to k+1, etc.\n\n        But wait, the problem considers contiguous segments. The segment from 0 to k-1 is the first window, then from 1 to k, then from 2 to k+1, etc. This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"k consecutive days\", and the days are in order. Our method uses the natural order.\n\n        Therefore, we can use this sliding window method.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say n and k can be up to 200000. The initial sum(a[:k]) is O(k), and then the loop runs (n-k) times, each O(1). So total time O(n). This is acceptable.\n\n        But wait",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible weeks in his sleep records. A week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks in the given `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous segments of length `k` in a sequence of `n` days. The challenge is to do this efficiently without recalculating the sum for each segment from scratch, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n2. **Intuition**: The key insight is to use a sliding window technique to compute the sum of each segment (week) in constant time after the initial window. This involves:\n   - Calculating the sum of the first `k` elements (the initial window).\n   - For each subsequent window, subtract the element that exits the window and add the new element entering the window.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The sliding window approach is chosen for its efficiency, reducing the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n), which is optimal for large inputs (up to 200,000 elements).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element once during the initial window sum and once during the sliding phase, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is O(n) due to the input storage, but no additional significant space is used.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    if num_weeks <= 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    current = total_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n        current = current - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum += current\n        \n    average = total_sum / num_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), followed by the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The number of weeks (`num_weeks`) is calculated as `n - k + 1`. If there are no weeks (though constraints prevent this), the output is set to 0.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed initially. For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. This adjustment is done in constant time.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all week sums is divided by the number of weeks to get the average. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
