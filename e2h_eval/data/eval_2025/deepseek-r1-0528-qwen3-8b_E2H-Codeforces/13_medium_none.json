For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string with three notes. The notes are in a circular list of 12: \n ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']? Wait, note: the example says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n But wait, let me check: \n   C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H -> that's 12 notes.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\"\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11). For example:\n    C -> 0, C# -> 1, D -> 2, D# -> 3, E -> 4, F -> 5, F# -> 6, G -> 7, G# -> 8, A -> 9, B -> 10, H -> 11.\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we have three distinct notes. We need to check if they form a major or minor triad.\n\n Conditions for major: \n   There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n      distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones (so 4 steps from X to Y)\n      distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones (so 3 steps from Y to Z)\n\n Conditions for minor:\n   There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n      distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones\n      distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones\n\n However, note: the distance is measured in a circle. But the problem states: \"the distance between two consecutive notes is 0.5 tone\", so 4 semitones is 4 * 0.5 = 2 tones.\n\n But wait, how to compute the distance? The problem says: from the lowest tone to the uppest one. However, because the notes are cyclic, we might have to consider wrapping?\n\n Actually, the example: between E and C is 8 semitones. Why?\n   Let's map: \n        E -> 4\n        C -> 0\n   If we go from E to C, we can go: E (4), then 5,6,...,11,0 -> that's 8 steps (from 4 to 0: 0 - 4 + 12 = 8).\n\n So the distance from note i to note j (in the circular 12-note system) is defined as the minimum of the two ways? But note: the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we take the increasing direction? \n\n However, the example says: \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". But wait, if we consider the chord, the ordering must be such that the entire chord is contained in the circle and the distances are taken in the natural order (without wrapping). \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale\" meaning we are allowed to arrange the notes in a linear sequence (and then the distance from the first to the second is 4, and from the second to the third is 3) but what if the third note is not the next one in the circle? \n\n However, note: the chord is a set of three distinct notes. We can arrange them in increasing order (by their note numbers) and then check the intervals.\n\n But wait: the example \"C# B F\": \n   Mapping: \n        C# -> 1, B -> 10, F -> 5.\n   Then we have to reorder: [5, 1, 10] -> actually, we should sort the notes by their circular order? \n\n The problem says: the notes are repeated cyclically. So we can also consider the circle. How do we order? \n\n Important: the chord definition requires that when ordered (in the circle) we get the specified intervals. But note: the ordering for the chord is arbitrary. We can start at any note and then move by the circle until we hit the next note.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have three distinct notes. We can generate all 6 permutations of the three notes and check the two conditions for each permutation.\n\n However, note: the condition for a major triad is: \n   Condition1: (distance from first to second) == 4 and (distance from second to third) == 3.\n   Condition2: (distance from first to third) == 7? Actually, the entire span from first to third is 7, but the condition is broken into two parts.\n\n But wait: the entire span from first to third is 7 semitones, and that is equivalent to 4+3=7. So we don't need to check the entire span separately.\n\n However, note: the circle has 12 notes. When we compute the distance from first to second, we are going from a lower note to a higher note without crossing the boundary? Or do we allow wrapping?\n\n The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So we must arrange the notes in increasing order (without wrapping) for the chord progression? \n\n But wait, the example \"C# B F\": they ordered as \"B C# F\". \n   B (which is 10) to C# (1): if we go from B (10) to C# (1), we have to wrap: from 10 to 0, then to 1. That is 2 semitones? But wait, the example says: between B and C# is 3 semitones.\n\n Let me recompute: \n   In the example: \"C# B F\" becomes \"B C# F\": \n        B to C#: \n            B (10) -> C (0) -> C# (1): that's 3 semitones? \n            Actually, from B to C is 1 semitone (because B is 10, then next is C at 0, which is 12-10+0 = 2? Wait no, the distance from B to C is 1 semitone (since they are adjacent). Then from C to C# is another semitone. So total from B to C# is 2 semitones? \n\n But wait, the example says: between B and C# is 3 semitones. \n\n Alternatively, the example says: \"if we order the notes as 'B C# F'\", then the distance between B and C# is 3 semitones. \n\n How? \n\n Let me map the notes again. The 12-note circle:\n\n 0: C\n 1: C#\n 2: D\n 3: D#\n 4: E\n 5: F\n 6: F#\n 7: G\n 8: G#\n 9: A\n10: B\n11: H   ??? Wait, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n But wait, the example input is \"C# B F\", and the output is minor. \n\n And the example says: \"C# B F\" is minor because of the ordering \"B C# F\".\n\n Now, the problem says: the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. \n\n How do we compute the distance from B to C#? \n\n The note B is at position 10, and C# is at position 1. \n\n The direct way without wrapping: from 10 to 1, we can go two ways: \n   Forward: 10 -> 11 -> 0 -> 1: that's 3 steps (each step is 1 semitone) -> so 3 semitones.\n   Backward: 10 down to 1: that would be 9 semitones (but the problem says \"from the lowest to the uppest\", so we take the forward direction? \n\n But note: the example says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". In the ordering \"B C# F\", we are considering B as the starting note, then C#, then F. \n\n However, in the circle, after B (which is the highest note in the circle? because after B comes C (which is lower than B?)) wait, no: the circle goes: ... A, B, then C, ... so B is followed by C. \n\n Actually, the circle is cyclic and we can break it at any point. The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we consider the notes arranged in ascending order (without wrapping). \n\n But wait, the example \"B C# F\": \n   The note B (10) is the lowest? Then C# (1) is the next? Then F (5) is the highest? \n\n However, if we break the circle and lay out the notes in ascending order, we might have to consider wrapping.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we have three distinct notes. We can arrange them in sorted order (in the circle). \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Map the input notes to numbers (0-11).\n 2. Sort the list of three numbers. But note: because it's a circle, sometimes we might need to adjust for wrapping. \n\n Example: [10, 1, 5] -> if we sort normally: [1,5,10]. Then the distances would be:\n    from 1 to 5: 4 semitones (because 5-1=4)\n    from 5 to 10: 5 semitones (10-5=5) -> so 4+5=9, which is not 7.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the circle and break the circle so that the three notes are in a contiguous segment. \n\n Actually, the standard way to handle circular lists for such problems is to consider the distances in the circle. But the condition for a chord is defined by the consecutive intervals in the ordering (without wrapping) and then the entire chord must form an interval of 7 semitones from the first to the third.\n\n However, note the example: \"C E G\" is major: \n    C(0), E(4), G(7)\n    Ordering: [0,4,7]: \n        0->4: 4 semitones, 4->7: 3 semitones -> major.\n\n Another example: \"C# B F\" is minor: \n    Notes: C#(1), B(10), F(5). \n    We need to order them so that the first two are 3 semitones apart and the next two are 4 semitones apart.\n\n How did they order? They said: B, C#, F -> [10,1,5]\n\n Now, if we break the circle at B (10) and then continue from 0 to 11, we can represent the notes as [10,1,5] and then arrange them in a linear way that starts at the smallest and goes up, but then we have to consider the wrap.\n\n Alternatively, we can normalize the circle by duplicating the array (to avoid wrap-around issues) and then take the three notes and consider all possible contiguous segments that cover the three notes.\n\n But note: the condition for a chord requires that the three notes are consecutive in the circle with specific intervals. \n\n However, the problem does not require the entire chord to be contiguous in the circle without gaps. It just requires that when ordered (in the circle) we get the two intervals.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers). We can consider all six permutations and for each permutation, compute the distances from a to b and from b to c (in the circle) by taking the forward path (without wrapping backward) or by taking the minimal distance? \n\n But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n   In the ordering [B, C#, F] = [10,1,5]. \n   From 10 to 1: \n        We can go from 10 to 1 by adding 3: 10 -> 11 (which is the same as 0) then 0->1: 3 steps (semitones). \n        Alternatively, we can go backwards: 10 down to 1: 9 steps. \n   The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are moving from a lower tone to a higher tone. \n\n So the distance from 10 to 1 is 3 semitones (because we are moving from 10 to 1 by going through 0, which is the next note). \n\n Similarly, from 1 to 5: 5-1=4 semitones.\n\n So the condition for minor is satisfied: 3 and 4.\n\n How do we compute the distance from note x to note y in the circle (in the forward direction only)? \n\n We want the distance from x to y when going forward (without wrapping backward) and if y is behind x (i.e., we have to wrap) then we compute: (y + 12 - x) % 12, but wait, that gives the minimal circular distance? \n\n Actually, the problem says: the distance is from the lowest to the uppest. So we are always moving forward (increasing). \n\n But note: the example \"E to C\": the distance is 8. How did they get that? \n   E is 4, then the next notes are 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,0,1,... until we get to C (0). So from 4 to 0: 0 - 4 + 12 = 8.\n\n So the distance from x to y (forward) is: (y - x) % 12, but if y < x then we add 12: so (y - x + 12) % 12. But wait, that gives the minimal circular distance? \n\n Actually, the minimal circular distance would be the minimum between (y-x) mod 12 and (x-y) mod 12. But the problem doesn't say minimal, it says from the lowest to the uppest. \n\n However, the example \"E to C\" is 8, which is the non-minimal one (because the minimal distance from E to C is 8? Actually, the minimal circular distance is min(|4-0|, 12-|4-0|) = min(4, 8)=4? \n\n But wait, the problem defines the distance from E to C as 8. \n\n So the problem's distance is defined as: \n   If we break the circle at the lowest note and go to the uppest note, then we are forced to go around the circle. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n Therefore, the distance from note x to note y is defined as: \n   Let d1 = (y - x) % 12, but if negative then add 12 and then mod 12, but wait: \n   Actually, we want the positive forward distance. \n\n We can define:\n   distance(x, y) = (y - x) % 12   if y >= x, then (y-x) but if y < x, then (y - x + 12) \n\n However, note: \n   For E (4) to C (0): 0 < 4 -> (0-4+12) = 8.\n   For C (0) to E (4): (4-0) = 4.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones\", and between E and C is 8.\n\n So the distance is directional: from x to y.\n\n Now, for the chord, we are given three notes. We need to check if there is an ordering (x,y,z) such that:\n   Condition for major: \n        d1 = distance(x,y) = 4\n        d2 = distance(y,z) = 3\n\n   Condition for minor:\n        d1 = distance(x,y) = 3\n        d2 = distance(y,z) = 4\n\n But note: the entire chord must be considered in the circle. The distance function we defined above (forward) is the key.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the chord must be played in root position. In fact, the example \"C# B F\" is minor and they rearranged the notes to B, C#, F.\n\n So we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily (any order). \n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. Map the input string to three numbers (0-11).\n 2. Generate all 6 permutations of these three numbers.\n 3. For each permutation (a,b,c):\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12   [but if negative, adjust by adding 12 and then mod? Actually, we can use: (b - a) if b>=a then b-a else (b - a + 12) -> but wait, we can do: (b - a) % 12 might give negative. Instead, we can do: (b - a) if b>=a then (b-a) else (b - a + 12). Alternatively, we can use modulo arithmetic: (b - a) % 12, but note: in Python, negative modulo is handled by adding multiples of 12 until positive.\n\n    Actually, we can define a function:\n\n        def dist(x, y):\n            # returns the forward distance from x to y (without wrapping backward)\n            d = (y - x) % 12\n            # But wait: if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, and (y-x)%12 gives a positive value? \n            # Example: x=4, y=0: (0-4)%12 = (-4)%12 = 8 (in Python, because -4 % 12 = 8). So that matches.\n\n            However, note: the forward distance from x to y is defined as the minimal positive steps to go from x to y without going backward? \n            But wait, the problem's example: from E to C is 8, which is the same as (0-4)%12=8. So we can use modulo 12.\n\n            But wait: if we have x=10, y=1: (1-10)%12 = (-9)%12 = 3. That matches.\n\n            So we can define: \n                d(x,y) = (y - x) % 12   [if negative, modulo gives the positive equivalent]\n\n            However, note: the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n                (a - b) % 12 = (a - b + 12) % 12, but if a-b is negative, then (a-b+12) is positive and then mod 12.\n\n            But wait, we don't want the minimal circular distance, we want the forward distance (which might be more than 6). \n\n            Actually, the forward distance is exactly the one we defined: (y-x) mod 12, but if we get a negative, we add 12 until positive. The modulo operation does that.\n\n            However, note: the modulo operation for positive numbers: (y-x) % 12 is the same as (y-x) if (y-x) is between 0 and 11, and if (y-x) is negative, it adds 12 until positive and then mod.\n\n            Example: \n                x=0, y=4: (4-0)%12=4.\n                x=4, y=0: (0-4)%12=-4%12=8.\n\n            So that matches.\n\n 4. Then, for the permutation (a,b,c):\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12   [this gives the forward distance from a to b]\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12   [forward distance from b to c]\n\n        Then, check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) for major, or (3,4) for minor.\n\n 5. But wait: the entire chord must be three distinct notes, and we are using distinct notes, so no duplicates.\n\n 6. However, note: the forward distance from a to b is 4, and from b to c is 3, then the entire chord spans 4+3=7 semitones. The third note from a is then (a + 7) % 12. But wait, the three notes are a, a+4, a+7 (mod 12). \n\n    Example: a=0 -> then notes: 0,4,7 -> C,E,G -> major.\n\n    Similarly, minor: a, a+3, a+7 (because 3+4=7). Example: a=0 -> 0,3,7 -> C,F,G? That's not a minor chord. \n\n    Actually, the minor chord is defined by: \n        d1 = 3, d2 = 4 -> so the entire chord is a, a+3, a+7. \n        Example: a=0: [0,3,7] -> C, D#, G -> is that a minor chord? \n\n    Let me check: \n        Major: root, major third (4 semitones above root), perfect fifth (7 semitones above root).\n        Minor: root, minor third (3 semitones above root), perfect fifth (7 semitones above root).\n\n    So the third note is always the fifth, which is 7 semitones above the root.\n\n    Then the three notes are: \n        root, root+3, root+7.\n\n    But wait: in the example \"C# B F\": \n        They used the ordering B, C#, F. \n        Let the root be B (10). Then the minor third would be 10+3=13 -> 13%12=1 -> C#. Then the fifth is 10+7=17%12=5 -> F. So that matches.\n\n    So the condition is: \n        There exists a permutation (x,y,z) such that (y-x)%12==3 and (z-y)%12==4, and note that (z-x)%12==(z-y+y-x)%12 = (4+3)%12=7.\n\n 7. Algorithm:\n\n    notes_map = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n    Read the input string and split.\n\n    Convert each note to a number.\n\n    Let the three numbers be a, b, c.\n\n    Create a list [a,b,c] and generate all permutations.\n\n    For each permutation (x,y,z):\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12   [if negative, modulo makes it positive]\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n        If d1==4 and d2==3: then we found a major triad -> print \"major\" and break.\n        Else if d1==3 and d2==4: then we found a minor triad -> print \"minor\" and break.\n\n    If none of the permutations satisfy either, then print \"strange\".\n\n 8. But wait: what if the same chord can be represented in multiple ways? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry about both conditions being true.\n\n 9. However, note: the entire set of three notes must be used. We are generating all permutations, so we are covering all orders.\n\n 10. Let me test with the examples:\n\n     Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7]\n        Permutation (0,4,7): \n            d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n        Other permutations might not match, but we break at the first major.\n\n     Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5] -> but wait, we have to map: \n        C# -> 1, B->10, F->5.\n\n        We need to check the permutation (10,1,5): \n            d1 = (1-10)%12 = (-9)%12=3\n            d2 = (5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n        So that works.\n\n     Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11]\n        Check: \n          Permutation (9,10,11): \n            d1 = (10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 -> not 3 or 4.\n          Permutation (9,11,10): \n            d1 = (11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)= (10-11+12)%12=11 -> 2 and 11 -> no.\n          Permutation (10,9,11): \n            d1 = (9-10)%12 = -1%12=11, d2=(11-9)=2 -> no.\n          Permutation (10,11,9): \n            d1 = (11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)= -2%12=10 -> no.\n          Permutation (11,9,10): \n            d1 = (9-11)%12=-2%12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n          Permutation (11,10,9): \n            d1 = (10-11)%12=-1%12=11, d2=(9-10)%12=-1%12=11 -> no.\n\n        So we output \"strange\".\n\n 11. However, wait: the example input is \"A B H\", which maps to [9,10,11]. \n\n 12. But note: the problem says the chord must have at least three notes. This is three, so we are good.\n\n 13. But wait, is there a possibility that the chord is neither? \n\n 14. Implementation:\n\n     We'll create a mapping dictionary.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        mapping = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1,\n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n        s = input().split()\n        nums = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n        perms = permutations(nums)\n\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n\n        for p in perms:\n            x, y, z = p\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n            # But wait: the problem says the distance from x to y is (y-x) mod 12, and from y to z is (z-y) mod 12.\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        if found_major:\n            print(\"major\")\n        elif found_minor:\n            print(\"minor\")\n        else:\n            print(\"strange\")\n\n 15. However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. Our method checks all permutations so that is correct.\n\n 16. But wait: what if there is a chord that satisfies both? The problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", so we don't have to worry.\n\n 17. However, wait: what if the chord is major and also minor? For example, if the same three notes can be arranged in two different ways? \n\n     Example: Is there a chord that is both major and minor? \n\n     Conditions:\n        Major: exists an ordering (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12=4 and (c-b)%12=3 -> then the entire chord is (a, a+4, a+7) mod 12.\n\n        Minor: exists an ordering (d,e,f) such that (e-d)%12=3 and (f-e)%12=4 -> then the entire chord is (d, d+3, d+7) mod 12.\n\n     So we have two sets: \n        Set1: {a, a+4, a+7}\n        Set2: {d, d+3, d+7}\n\n     And we require that {a, a+4, a+7} = {d, d+3, d+7}. \n\n     Then, the sets must be equal. \n\n        Case 1: a = d, then {a, a+4, a+7} = {a, a+3, a+7} -> then a+3 = a+4? -> no.\n\n        Case 2: a = d+3, then {d+3, d+7, d+11} = {d, d+3, d+7} -> then d+11 must be d, which is impossible because 11 != 0 mod12.\n\n        Case 3: a = d+7, then {d+7, d+11, (d+7)+7 = d+14 mod12 = d+2} = {d, d+3, d+7} -> then we have d+2, d+7, d+11. Not matching.\n\n        Case 4: a = d+4, then {d+4, d+8, d+11} = {d, d+3, d+7} -> not matching.\n\n        Case 5: a = d+ something else.\n\n     Actually, the sets must have the same three elements. The only way is if the two sets are identical. \n\n     Let me try: \n        {a, a+4, a+7} = {b, b+3, b+7}\n\n        Without loss of generality, assume a = b. Then we have {a, a+4, a+7} = {a, a+3, a+7} -> then a+3 must be a+4 -> 3=4 mod12 -> false.\n\n        Assume a = b+3: then set1 = {b+3, b+7, b+10}; set2 = {b, b+3, b+7}. Then we have b+10 must be b -> 10=0 -> no.\n\n        Assume a = b+4: set1 = {b+4, b+8, b+11}; set2 = {b, b+3, b+7}. Then we need to match: \n            b+4 = b -> no, b+4=b+3 -> 4=3 -> no, etc.\n\n        Similarly, no solution. \n\n     So no chord is both major and minor.\n\n 18. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\n However, note: the above code uses modulo arithmetic. But wait, the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers is defined to return a result in [0,11]. \n\n Let me test with negative: \n        (0-4) % 12 -> (-4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\n 19. But wait, the definition of the distance: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. \n\n 20. However, in our chord condition, we are checking the forward distance from x to y. \n\n 21. One more example: \n        \"F C E\": \n            F->5, C->0, E->4.\n            Permutation (5,0,4): \n                d1 = (0-5)%12 = -5%12=7, d2=(4-0)%12=4 -> not 3 or 4.\n            Permutation (5,4,0): \n                d1 = (4-5)%12=-1%12=11, d2=(0-4)%12=-4%12=8 -> no.\n\n        But wait, we must consider the ordering that makes sense: \n            We know that \"F C E\" is the same as \"C E F\", which is a major chord? \n            Actually, the root is C, then E is 4 semitones above, and F is 3 semitones above E? No, wait: \n                In a major chord, the intervals are 4 and 3 from the root. \n                Here, if we take root C (0), then E (4) is 4 semitones, then F (5) is only 1 semitone above E -> that is not a major chord.\n\n        But wait, the chord \"C E F\" is not a major chord? \n\n        Actually, the major chord is defined by the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth. \n        The perfect fifth is 7 semitones above the root. \n        Here, from C to E: 4 semitones (correct for major third) but from E to F: 1 semitone, so the entire chord is missing the fifth.\n\n        So this chord is not a major chord.\n\n        But wait, the example input was \"F C E\", which is the same set as \"C E F\". \n\n        How should we represent it? \n\n        The condition requires three notes. The set {C, E, F} does not form a major or minor triad. \n\n        But wait, let me check minor: \n            Minor triad: root, minor third, perfect fifth.\n\n        Root: C (0), minor third: 3 semitones -> Eb (3), perfect fifth: 7 -> G (7). \n\n        So the set {C, Eb, G} is minor.\n\n        Our set is {C, E, F}. \n\n        Let me check: \n            We need to see if there is an ordering (x,y,z) such that the forward distances are (3,4) or (4,3). \n\n        Possibilities:\n\n            Ordering: (C, E, F): [0,4,5]\n                d1 = (4-0)=4, d2=(5-4)=1 -> no.\n\n            Ordering: (C, F, E): [0,5,4]\n                d1 = (5-0)=5, d2=(4-5)= -1%12=11 -> no.\n\n            Ordering: (E, C, F): [4,0,5]\n                d1 = (0-4)=8, d2=(5-0)=5 -> no.\n\n            Ordering: (E, F, C): [4,5,0]\n                d1 = (5-4)=1, d2=(0-5)=7 -> no.\n\n            Ordering: (F, C, E): [5,0,4]\n                d1 = (0-5)=7, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n\n            Ordering: (F, E, C): [5,4,0]\n                d1 = (4-5)=11, d2=(0-4)=8 -> no.\n\n        So indeed, \"F C E\" is strange.\n\n 22. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: there is an alternative way to compute the distances. Some people might use the minimal circular distance, but the problem specifies the forward distance (from the lowest to the uppest). \n\n But note: the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", which is the forward distance (wrapping). \n\n So our use of modulo 12 for the forward distance is correct.\n\n Code:\n\n    We'll use the mapping and permutations.\n\n    Note: the input may have sharps and naturals. We have defined the mapping for the 12 notes.\n\n    Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n 23. Edge: if the input has a note not in the mapping? The problem says the input is three space-separated notes in the given notation.\n\n    We assume the input is always valid.\n\n 24. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 25. However, note: the example input \"A B H\" is provided, and we mapped H to 11.\n\n 26. Final code:\n\n    import itertools\n\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each musical note is mapped to a number from 0 to 11 based on its position in the 12-note chromatic scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations to consider every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the forward distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale. \n   - A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second interval to be 3 semitones.\n   - A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second interval to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    s = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n    \n    perms = itertools.permutations(nums)\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for p in perms:\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique integer from 0 to 11, representing their positions in the chromatic scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their corresponding numerical values using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: The `itertools.permutations` function generates all possible orderings of the three input notes.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the forward distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to ensure correct handling of the circular nature of the musical scale.\n5. **Chord Condition Check**: The code checks if any permutation meets the interval requirements for a major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord.\n6. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" indicating the type of chord formed by the input notes or that no recognized chord was found.",
