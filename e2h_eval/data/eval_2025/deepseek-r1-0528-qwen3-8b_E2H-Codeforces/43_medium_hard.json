He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The string is built in three steps:\n    - Step 1: A has a string of one or more 'a's.\n    - Step 2: B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's to the end.\n    - Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's (equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' OR both) to the end.\n\n Important constraints:\n   - The entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, note that step 3 appends 'c's, so if there's no 'c' then it's invalid? But wait: the condition says that C appends some number of 'c' (so at least one). So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n However, note: the example input \"bbacc\" is invalid because the order is not correct. Also, the example \"aabc\" is valid.\n\n Steps:\n\n Observation on the structure:\n   - The original string from A is all 'a's (at least one).\n   - Then B appends all 'b's (at least one) to the end.\n   - Then C appends all 'c's (at least one) to the end.\n\n So the entire string should be non-decreasing in terms of characters: first one or more 'a's, then one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's.\n\n But note: what if the string does not contain all three letters? Then it's invalid because we must have at least one of each.\n\n However, note the process: \n   - Step 1: at least one 'a'\n   - Step 2: append at least one 'b', so now we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n   - Step 3: append at least one 'c', so now we have at least one of each.\n\n Therefore, the string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n But also, the order must be non-decreasing: the string must start with 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. \n\n However, there is an exception: what if there are no 'b's? Then the condition fails because B must have appended at least one 'b'. Similarly, the problem states that after B's step, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n Note: when C appends, the string already includes the 'a's and 'b's. So the total counts at the time of C's step:\n   Let:\n     n_a = number of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the original from A)\n     n_b = number of 'b' in the entire string (from B's appending)\n     n_c = number of 'c' appended by C\n\n Condition for C: n_c must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n However, note: the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed (because the process doesn't change them). So the condition is that the count of 'c' must equal either the total count of 'a' or the total count of 'b'.\n\n But note: the string might not be in the correct order. We must check two things:\n   1. The string is divided into three contiguous segments: [a's], [b's], [c's] (possibly empty? but note: at least one of each exists, so none can be empty).\n   2. The counts of 'c' must be equal to either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n However, the example \"aabc\" is valid. Let's check:\n\n   S = \"aabc\"\n   Count: \n        a: 2, b: 1, c: 1 -> then condition: c_count (1) must equal a_count (2) OR b_count (1). It equals b_count, so condition holds.\n\n   Now, the order: \n        The string is \"aabc\": \n        - The first part: starts with 'a's until a non-'a' is found. Then we see a 'b', then a 'c'. \n        - But wait, after the initial 'a's, we have \"ab\" which breaks the contiguous segment? Actually, the string is \"aabc\": \n            a, a, then b, then c. \n\n   How do we check the order?\n        We can traverse and make sure that we never see an 'a' after a non-'a', and similarly for 'b' and 'c'.\n\n   Steps for checking the order:\n\n        Let i = 0\n        While i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++ (this gives the segment of a's)\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < len(S) and S[i]=='c': i++\n\n        And then we must have traversed the entire string.\n\n   But note: what if there is no 'b' in the middle? Then we would have broken the condition that B appended at least one 'b'. Similarly, we must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n        Step 2: Check that the string is non-decreasing in the sense of having contiguous groups of 'a', then 'b', then 'c'. That is, if we split the string by the changes in consecutive characters, we should get exactly three distinct groups (unless the string doesn't have one of the letters, but we already checked that).\n\n        However, note: the problem says that B appends some number of 'b's to the end, and C appends some number of 'c's to the end. So the order must be: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n        Step 3: Let:\n            n_a = count of 'a'\n            n_b = count of 'b'\n            n_c = count of 'c'\n\n        Then, we require that n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n        However, note: the counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed at the time when C appends, which is the entire string without the 'c's? Actually, no: the entire string at the time of C's step includes the original 'a's and 'b's, and then C appends 'c's. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' do not change. Therefore, the condition is about the entire string's counts.\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\": \n            a: 3, b: 1, c: 3 -> condition: 3==3 (for a) or 3==1 (for b) -> yes, because 3==3.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\":\n            a: 2, b: 1, c: 1 -> condition: 1==2? no, but 1==1 -> yes.\n\n        Example: \"bbacc\": \n            This string has: \n                'b','b','a','c','c'\n            The order is broken: we have 'b's then an 'a'. So it fails the contiguous condition.\n\n        Therefore, we must check the contiguous condition first.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n          2. Check that the string is composed of a contiguous block of 'a's (possibly empty, but we know there's at least one), then a contiguous block of 'b's (at least one), then a contiguous block of 'c's (at least one). \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          - Traverse the string and check that once we leave 'a' we don't see 'a' again, and similarly for 'b' and 'c'.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          s = input_string\n\n          # Check that the set of characters is {'a','b','c'} (since we have at least one of each)\n          if set(s) != {'a','b','c'}:\n              # Actually, it might be a subset? But the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. But we must have at least one of each. So if the set is not exactly {'a','b','c'}, then it's missing one or more.\n              print(\"NO\")\n              return\n\n          But wait: what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then set(s) is {'a'} -> invalid. Similarly, \"aabbcc\" is valid? Actually, the problem requires that after A and B there is at least one 'a' and one 'b', then C appends at least one 'c'. So we must have all three.\n\n          However, the example \"aabc\" is given and valid, so we must have all three.\n\n          Alternatively, we can check the presence:\n\n          if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              return\n\n          Then, check the order:\n\n          i = 0\n          # Read all a's\n          while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n              i += 1\n          # Then read all b's\n          while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n              i += 1\n          # Then read all c's\n          while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n              i += 1\n\n          If i != len(s): then there are other characters, so invalid.\n\n          Then, we check the condition on the counts:\n\n          n_a = s.count('a')\n          n_b = s.count('b')\n          n_c = s.count('c')\n\n          if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"aaaccc\"? \n            Then we have:\n                a: 3, b: 0, c: 3 -> wait, but the problem says that after B's step there is at least one 'b'. So the string must have at least one 'b'. Therefore, we already checked that the string has at least one 'b'. \n\n        However, note: the condition above checks that the set is {'a','b','c'}, so \"aaaccc\" would be rejected because it doesn't have 'b'. \n\n        Another example: \"aabbbccc\" -> valid if the condition holds.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aabbccc\", then condition: \n            n_a = 2, n_b = 2, n_c = 3 -> condition: 3==2? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the example input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        Let's check \"bbacc\": \n            First, check if it has 'a','b','c': yes.\n            Then, traverse:\n                Start with 'b': so the first character is 'b', but we expected to start with 'a'. So the while loop for a's will do nothing (i remains 0). Then we try to read b's: we read the first two 'b's? Then we try to read c's: but the next character is 'a' (at index 2) which is not 'b' and not 'c'. Then the while loop for b's stops, then we try to read c's: we see an 'a' -> so we break. Then i=2 (we read two characters). Then we try to read c's: we look at index2: 'a' -> skip. Then i remains 2, and then we break. Then we haven't traversed the entire string.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check the order by:\n\n          - The string must start with 'a' (if there's an 'a')? Actually, the first character must be 'a'. Because A's part is at the beginning.\n\n          - Then, after the a's, we must have a non-empty b's part (so the next character after the last 'a' must be 'b').\n\n          - Then, after the b's, we must have a non-empty c's part (so the next character after the last 'b' must be 'c').\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if s[0] != 'a' or s[-1] != 'c': \n              # But note: what if the string is just \"abc\"? Then s[0]=='a' and s[-1]=='c'. \n              # However, consider \"aac\": valid? \n              # But wait, the process: \n              #   A gives \"aa\", then B appends one 'b' -> \"aab\", then C appends one 'c' (because the condition: the number of 'c' must be the number of 'a' (which is 2) OR the number of 'b' (which is 1). One is not 2 nor 1? Then condition fails. So \"aac\" is not valid by count condition. But the order is correct.\n\n          Actually, the above check for the first and last character is not sufficient. We need contiguous groups.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n          Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n          Step 2: Check that the string is in the form of a non-decreasing sequence of characters (meaning: you can only move from 'a' to 'b' to 'c', and once you leave a letter you cannot come back). \n\n          We can do:\n\n            i = 0\n            # Traverse the string and group the same consecutive characters\n            groups = []\n            j = 0\n            while j < len(s):\n                groups.append(s[j])\n                j += 1\n                while j < len(s) and s[j] == groups[-1][-1]:\n                    pass # Actually, we want to collapse consecutive same characters.\n\n            Actually, we don't need to collapse, we can just traverse and check the order.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            current_char = 'a'\n            for char in s:\n                if char < current_char:\n                    # This means we saw a character that is less than the current one, but since we are going from a to b to c, we should only have increasing order.\n                    # But wait, the string is supposed to be a's then b's then c's, so the characters should be non-decreasing. \n                    # However, if we see a 'b' then an 'a', that is decreasing. So we can break.\n                    # Actually, we can check that the sequence is non-decreasing in the sense that we never go back to a previous letter.\n\n                    # But note: we are allowed to have multiple runs? Actually, no: the process says A gives a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's. So the entire string is one contiguous block of a's, then one contiguous block of b's, then one contiguous block of c's.\n\n                    # So we can check:\n\n                    # Let the string be split into three parts: [a's] [b's] [c's]. Then the entire string is non-decreasing.\n\n                    # We can check:\n\n                    #   For k from 0 to len(s)-2: \n                    #       if s[k] > s[k+1]: then invalid.\n\n            Actually, the condition for the entire string to be in non-decreasing order (each character is >= the previous) is:\n\n                for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                        # This is a decrease, so invalid.\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n\n            However, this would allow repeated letters arbitrarily. But our string must have exactly three contiguous segments. But wait, what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? Then we have:\n\n                'a','a','b','b','c','c' -> non-decreasing.\n\n            But what if the string is \"aabbcc\" and then we have the condition on counts?\n\n                n_a = 2, n_b = 2, n_c = 2 -> condition: 2==2 (for a) OR 2==2 (for b) -> yes.\n\n            However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbcccc\"? Then condition: n_c = 4, which must equal n_a (4) or n_b (3) -> 4==4 -> yes.\n\n            But wait, the condition says the number of 'c's appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the entire string (after B's step). After B's step, the entire string (without the c's) has n_a and n_b. Then C appends n_c (which is either n_a or n_b) so the final string has:\n\n                n_a (same as before) and n_b (same as before) and n_c (which is either n_a or n_b).\n\n            So the condition is on the final counts? Actually, the problem says:\n\n                \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\"\n\n            Here, \"the string\" at the time of C's step is the entire string so far (which includes the a's and b's) and then he appends the c's. But note: the condition does not specify whether it's the count of the entire string including the c's or excluding. Actually, the problem says \"in the string\", meaning the entire string at that moment? Or the current state?\n\n            Let me reread: \n\n                \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n            At the moment C is appending, the string is the one from A and B (so without the c's). Then he appends n_c (which is either the count of 'a' (which hasn't changed) or the count of 'b' (which hasn't changed)).\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: n_c (appended) = n_a (original) or n_c = n_b (original).\n\n            And then the entire string has:\n                total_a = n_a\n                total_b = n_b\n                total_c = n_c\n\n            So the condition is: total_c (which is n_c) must be equal to n_a or n_b (the counts before appending the c's). \n\n            However, note: the counts of 'a' and 'b' do not change during C's step. So the condition is based on the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the string that C sees, which is the entire string before appending the c's.\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: \n                n_c == (number of 'a' in the entire string without the c's) OR n_c == (number of 'b' in the entire string without the c's)\n\n            But wait, the entire string without the c's is just the a's and b's. And the counts of 'a' and 'b' are the same as in the final string.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"the string\" at the time of C's step is the string that A and B have built. So the condition is:\n\n                Let x = number of 'a' in the string (which is the same as the one from A, and doesn't change)\n                Let y = number of 'b' in the string (from B, doesn't change)\n                Then C appends z such that z = x or z = y.\n\n            Then the final string has x a's, y b's, and z c's.\n\n            But note: the condition is on the string that C sees (without the c's) so we are comparing the appended c's (z) to x and y (the counts of a and b in the string without the c's). \n\n            However, the problem says \"in the string\", meaning the string at that moment (without the c's). \n\n            Therefore, the condition is: the number of c's appended (let that be z) must be either the number of a's (x) or the number of b's (y) in the string that C sees (which is the string without the c's). \n\n            But note: the entire string we have is the one with the c's. How do we extract the counts of a and b from the entire string? \n\n            In the entire string, the counts of 'a' and 'b' are the same as in the string without the c's. Because the c's are appended and don't change the a's and b's.\n\n            So we can use the entire string's count for 'a' and 'b' to check the condition.\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: \n                count_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b\n\n            And the entire string must be in the form: a's (at least one), then b's (at least one), then c's (at least one).\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n            Step 2: Check that the string is non-decreasing (each character is >= the previous).\n\n            Step 3: Check that the count of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n        However, note: the non-decreasing condition is necessary to ensure the order (contiguous blocks). But is that sufficient?\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\" -> non-decreasing and condition holds (count_c=2, which equals count_a=2 and count_b=2).\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\": \n            non-decreasing: \n                'a','a','a','b','c','c','c' -> yes.\n            condition: count_c=3, count_a=3 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\": \n            non-decreasing: \n                'a','a','b','c' -> yes.\n            condition: count_c=1, count_a=2, count_b=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"bbacc\": \n            Check: \n                'b','b','a','c','c' -> \n                First two: 'b','b' -> okay (non-decreasing so far). Then 'a' is less than 'b' -> violates non-decreasing. So Step 2 fails.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aba\"? \n            'a','b','a': \n                'a' to 'b' is okay, but then 'b' to 'a' is decreasing -> invalid.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that B appends 'b's to the end, and C appends 'c's to the end. So the entire string must be in increasing order (by letter). \n\n        Therefore, the non-decreasing condition is necessary and sufficient for the order.\n\n        Code:\n\n          s = input().strip()\n\n          # Check for at least one of each\n          if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          # Check non-decreasing\n          for i in range(1, len(s)):\n              if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  exit(0)\n\n          # Now check the condition on counts\n          count_a = s.count('a')\n          count_b = s.count('b')\n          count_c = s.count('c')\n\n          if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            has a,b,c -> yes.\n            non-decreasing: \n                a,a,a,b,c,c,c -> yes.\n            condition: count_c=3, count_a=3 -> YES.\n\n          Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            has a,b,c -> yes.\n            non-decreasing: \n                b,b -> okay; then b to a: 'a' < 'b' -> fails. Print \"NO\". Correct.\n\n          Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n            has a,b,c -> yes.\n            non-decreasing: \n                a,a -> okay; then a to b: okay; then b to c: okay. -> yes.\n            condition: count_c=1, count_a=2, count_b=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        But wait, there is an example that might be tricky: \n\n          Example: \"aabbc\" -> \n            Condition: count_c=1, count_a=2, count_b=2 -> condition: 1==2 or 1==2 -> no -> NO.\n\n          However, is \"aabbc\" built according to the process?\n\n            Step1: A gives \"aa\"\n            Step2: B appends \"bb\" -> \"aabb\"\n            Step3: C appends 'c' -> but the condition: the number of c's (1) must equal the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (2). It does not. So NO is correct.\n\n        Another example: \"aabbcc\" -> \n            Condition: count_c=2, count_a=2, count_b=2 -> 2==2 (for a) or 2==2 (for b) -> YES.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aabbccc\"? \n            Condition: count_c=3, count_a=2, count_b=2 -> 3==2? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        However, how was \"aabbccc\" built?\n            Step1: A gives \"aa\"\n            Step2: B appends \"bb\" -> \"aabb\"\n            Step3: C appends 3 c's. But the condition: the number of c's must be 2 (a's) or 2 (b's). 3 is not 2. So it is not valid.\n\n        Another example: \"aaabbbccc\": \n            Condition: count_c=3, count_a=3, count_b=3 -> YES.\n\n        What if the string is \"aaabbbcccccc\"? \n            Condition: count_c=6, count_a=3, count_b=3 -> 6==3? no -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the condition is that the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's (3) OR the number of b's (3). The appended c's is 6, which is not 3. So condition fails.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'. In this case, the number of 'a' is 3 and the number of 'b' is 3, so he must append either 3 or 3. He appended 6, which is neither. So condition fails.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\": \n            Condition: count_c=3, count_a=4, count_b=3 -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbcccc\": \n            Condition: count_c=4, count_a=4, count_b=3 -> 4==4 -> YES.\n\n        But wait, how was that built?\n            Step1: A gives 4 a's.\n            Step2: B appends 3 b's.\n            Step3: C appends 4 c's. Condition: 4 must be equal to the number of a's (4) OR the number of b's (3). Since 4==4, it's valid.\n\n        So the code seems to work.\n\n        However, note: the non-decreasing condition is necessary for the order. \n\n        But what if the string is \"accc\"? \n            This string has no 'b'. We already check for the presence of 'b', so we would print \"NO\" at the first step.\n\n        Similarly, \"abbbccc\": \n            Check for presence: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n            Non-decreasing: \n                'a','b','b','b','c','c','c' -> yes.\n            Condition: count_c=3, count_a=1, count_b=3 -> 3==1? no, 3==3 -> yes. So \"abbbccc\" is YES.\n\n        But wait, the process: \n            Step1: A gives one 'a'\n            Step2: B appends three 'b's -> \"abbb\"\n            Step3: C appends 3 c's (because 3 == count_b=3). So the string is \"abbbccc\". \n\n        However, our example is \"abbbccc\", which is 7 characters. But the example I wrote was \"abbbccc\", which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example above was \"aaaabbbccc\", which is 9 characters. \n\n        There's one more corner: what if the string is \"abc\"?\n            Condition: \n                count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        But wait, the process:\n\n            Step1: A gives \"a\"\n            Step2: B appends \"b\" -> \"ab\"\n            Step3: C appends 1 c (because 1==count_a=1 or 1==count_b=1). So condition holds.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that B appends some number of 'b' (at least one). Then C appends some number of 'c' (at least one). So \"abc\" is valid.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"ab\"? \n            We check: \n                has a and b, but no c -> so we print \"NO\" at the first condition.\n\n        Similarly, \"ac\": no b -> NO.\n\n        \"a\": no b and c -> NO.\n\n        \"b\": no a and c -> NO.\n\n        \"c\": no a and b -> NO.\n\n        \"aa\": no b and c -> NO.\n\n        \"bb\": no a and c -> NO.\n\n        \"cc\": no a and b -> NO.\n\n        \"aaa\": no b and c -> NO.\n\n        \"bbb\": no a and c -> NO.\n\n        \"ccc\": no a and b -> NO.\n\n        \"aabb\": no c -> NO.\n\n        \"aabc\": valid.\n\n        \"abbc\": \n            Check: has a, b, c -> yes.\n            Non-decreasing: \n                'a','b','b','c' -> yes.\n            Condition: count_c=1, count_a=1, count_b=2 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        But wait, how is \"abbc\" built?\n            Step1: A gives \"a\"\n            Step2: B appends \"bb\" -> \"abb\"\n            Step3: C appends 1 c (because 1==count_a=1). So the string is \"abbc\". \n\n        However, note: the condition says the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. In the string that C sees (without the c's) there is 1 a and 2 b's. So C can choose to append either 1 or 2. He chose 1, so it's valid.\n\n        But wait, the example \"abbc\" has one 'c', so that matches.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"abbcc\": \n            Condition: count_c=2, count_a=1, count_b=2 -> 2==1? no, 2==2? yes -> YES.\n\n        But note: the condition says the number of c's appended is 2, which equals the number of b's (which is 2). \n\n        However, note: the entire string without the c's is \"abb\", which has 1 a and 2 b's. So C appends 2 c's, which is the number of b's. Valid.\n\n        But wait, the string \"abbcc\" is non-decreasing and has all three, so condition holds.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"abbccc\": \n            Condition: count_c=3, count_a=1, count_b=2 -> 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        This is because the condition requires the appended c's to be 1 or 2 (the counts of a and b in the string without the c's). He appended 3, which is not 1 nor 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the non-decreasing condition is very strict. What if the string is \"aabbcc\" but with a different order? The problem states that the string is built by appending to the end. So the order must be a's then b's then c's.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"acb\"? \n            This is not non-decreasing because 'a' then 'c' (okay) then 'b' (decrease) -> fails.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n            Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] -> Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n        Our code:\n\n            \"aaabccc\": \n                has a,b,c -> yes.\n                non-decreasing: \n                    'a','a','a','b','c','c','c' -> yes.\n                condition: count_c=3, count_a=3 -> YES.\n\n            \"bbacc\":\n                has a,b,c -> yes.\n                non-decreasing: \n                    'b','b','a' -> here, 'a' is less than 'b' -> breaks -> NO.\n\n            \"aabc\":\n                has a,b,c -> yes.\n                non-decreasing: \n                    'a','a','b','c' -> yes.\n                condition: count_c=1, count_b=1 -> YES.\n\n        Therefore, the code produces the expected output.\n\n        However, note: the problem statement says that the string is built by:\n\n            A: a string of 'a's (at least one)\n            B: appends some 'b's (at least one) to the end.\n            C: appends some 'c's (at least one) to the end, and the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b' in the string (at the time of C's step).\n\n        The condition we are using is the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' (which is the same as the counts at the time of C's step). And the non-decreasing condition.\n\n        We assume that the entire string must be non-decreasing (each character >= the previous). \n\n        But note: the problem does not explicitly say that the entire string must be non-decreasing, but the process enforces that the a's are at the beginning, then b's, then c's. So the string must be non-decreasing.\n\n        We'll submit the code.\n\n        However, note the constraints: |S| up to 5000. The counting and the non-decreasing check (which is a linear scan) are efficient.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Note: We must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        Edge: empty string? The problem says |S|>=1.\n\n        Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        # Check for at least one of each letter\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-decreasing\n        for i in range(1, len(s)):\n            if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"abc\" (which is valid) and the non-decreasing condition passes, and condition on counts: \n            count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1 -> YES.\n\n        What if the string is \"abbccc\": \n            count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=3 -> 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the example \"abbccc\" is built as:\n            A: \"a\"\n            B: appends \"bb\" -> \"abb\"\n            Then C appends 3 c's. But the condition is that the number of c's must be",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints. The solution involves checking three main conditions: the presence of all three characters, the non-decreasing order of characters, and the count condition for the number of 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any character is missing, the string cannot meet the problem's requirements.\n2. **Non-decreasing Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order, meaning each subsequent character is greater than or equal to the previous one. This ensures the string follows the sequence of appending 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n3. **Count Condition**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This condition ensures that the 'c's were appended according to the specified rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the string contains all three required characters ('a', 'b', and 'c'). If any character is missing, it immediately outputs \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Non-decreasing Order Check**: The code then verifies that the string is in non-decreasing order by comparing each character with the next one. If any character is found to be smaller than the next, it outputs \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Count Condition Check**: Finally, the code counts the occurrences of each character. If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, it outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string can be constructed according to the specified process, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
