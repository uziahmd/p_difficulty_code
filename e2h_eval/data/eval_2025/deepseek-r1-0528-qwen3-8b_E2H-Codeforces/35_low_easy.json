Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   a list of n integers a0, a1, ..., an-1\n   a string s of length n (the binary representation of m, but note: the example input for the second sample is '11010' for n=5, which means m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0? \n   However, note the problem says: \"the binary representation of number m\" is given as a string of n digits (from most significant to least significant?).\n\n But wait: the example input for the second sample is:\n     5\n     17 0 10 2 1\n     11010\n\n And note: the example says m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 1+2+8 = 11? Actually, the example says: \"m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\", so the binary representation is for the bits that are set. However, the string provided is \"11010\", which has 5 characters.\n\n Important: the problem states that the binary representation is given as s0 s1 ... sn-1, and m equals sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_i * 2^(n-1-i) ? \n Let me check the example: \n   For the first sample: n=2, m is given by \"10\", so m = 1*2^(2-1-0) + 0*2^(2-1-1) = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n   Then x can be from 0 to 2. The function f(x) is defined for x in [0, 2n-1] (which is 0 to 3 in this case) but the constraint is x<=m, so x in [0,2].\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \n        2\n        3 8\n        10\n\n   Output: 3\n\n   Explanation: f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3, f(2)=a0+a1? But wait, the function f(x) is defined as: \n        f(x) = sum_{i: bit(i) is set in x} a_i\n\n   But note: the indices in the array a are from 0 to n-1, and the bit positions in x are from 0 to n-1? Actually, the problem says: \n        bit(i) is 1 if the binary representation of x has a 1 at the i-th position.\n\n   However, note: the example says for n=4 and x=11, then the binary representation of 11 is '1011' (if we consider 4 bits) but wait, the example says: \n        x = 11 (binary: 1011) -> bits: \n            bit0 (least significant) is set? Actually, they say: \n            x = 11 (11 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3) -> so the bits are numbered from 0 (LSB) to 3 (MSB)? \n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\". Typically, the i-th bit is the bit at 2^i. \n\n   However, in the example: \n        x = 11 = 1011 (in binary, 4 bits). The bits set are at positions 0, 1, and 3 (counting from 0 as the least significant). \n\n   But note the array a has indices from 0 to n-1. In the example with n=4, the array has 4 elements. The function f(x) uses the bits in x to index the array.\n\n   Now, how is the binary representation of x represented? The problem says that the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (with i from 0 to n-1) to decide whether to include a_i.\n\n   However, the input gives the binary representation of m as a string of length n. The example: \n        n=5, m's binary representation is \"11010\"\n\n   How is m computed from this string? \n        The problem says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n   This implies that the string is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Representation Handling**: The input provides the binary representation of \\( m \\) as a string of length \\( n \\). This string represents the bits from most significant to least significant. Each bit in \\( m \\)'s binary string corresponds to a position in the array \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Greedy Selection**: The key insight is to process each bit position from the least significant to the most significant (right to left in the binary string). For each bit position, if setting the bit in \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\), we include the corresponding element from array \\( a \\) in the sum. However, if setting the bit might exceed \\( m \\), we consider whether excluding it allows us to include more beneficial bits in higher positions.\n\n3. **Bitwise Comparison**: For each bit position, compare the current bit of \\( m \\) with the bits we have already set in \\( x \\). If the current bit in \\( m \\) is 0 and we have already set some bits in lower positions, then setting the current bit would make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\), so we must exclude it. Otherwise, we can set the bit if it increases the sum.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation**: Accumulate the sum by including elements from \\( a \\) only when their corresponding bit can be set without violating the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    power = 1 << (n - 1)\n    limit = int(bin_str, 2)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        bit_val = (limit & (1 << (n - 1 - i)))\n        if bit_val:\n            total += a[i]\n        else:\n            if limit == 0:\n                break\n            if (total & (1 << (n - 1 - i))) != 0:\n                continue\n            total += a[i]\n                \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to accumulate the sum of elements from \\( a \\). The variable `power` is used to handle bit positions correctly, starting from the most significant bit (leftmost) of the binary string.\n\n3. **Bit Processing**: For each bit position from left to right (most significant to least significant):\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is set (1), include the element from \\( a \\) in the sum.\n   - If the bit in \\( m \\) is not set (0), check if setting this bit in \\( x \\) would not exceed \\( m \\). If it has already been set in lower positions, skip; otherwise, include the element.\n\n4. **Output**: The accumulated sum `total` is printed, which represents the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each bit position once, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\). The solution leverages bitwise operations to determine valid bit settings without explicitly iterating through all possible values of \\( x \\), making it both time and space efficient.",
