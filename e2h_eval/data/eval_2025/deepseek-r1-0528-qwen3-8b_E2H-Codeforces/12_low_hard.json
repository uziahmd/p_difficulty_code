The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can think of the ring as:\n   The clockwise movement: from house i to house j (if j>=i) is (j-i) steps.\n   But if j < i, then we have to go through the ring: (n - i + j) steps.\n\n However, note that after completing a task, Xenia must complete all tasks with numbers less than i (but the problem says she completes the tasks in order, so we do them in increasing index order).\n\n But note: the condition \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" doesn't change the order? Actually, the problem states: \n   \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\n So the tasks must be done in the given order (from first to last). Therefore, we process the tasks in the order they are given.\n\n However, the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n Explanation: \n   Start at house 1.\n   Then go to house 3: \n        Option 1: 1->2->3: 2 steps.\n        Then from house 3 to house 2: \n            Since we are in a ring, we can go clockwise: 3->4->1->2: 3 steps, but wait, note that the ring is one-way clockwise. \n            However, the example says the sequence is: 1->2->3->4->1->2->3.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the example does not necessarily require to use the direct clockwise path for every move because the entire road is circular and we can only move clockwise.\n\n   Important: In a one-way clockwise ringroad, the distance from a current house i to a target house j is:\n        If j >= i: then distance = j - i.\n        If j < i: then we have to go from i to n and then wrap to j: so distance = (n - i) + j.\n\n   But wait, let's compute the example:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task at 3: \n            Since 3>=1 -> distance = 3-1 = 2.\n\n        Now we are at 3.\n        Second task at 2: \n            Since 2<3 -> distance = (4-3) + 2 = 1+2 = 3.\n\n        Now we are at 2.\n        Third task at 3: \n            Since 3>=2 -> distance = 3-2 = 1.\n\n        Total time = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        Output: 2\n\n        Steps:\n          Start at 1.\n          First task at 2: distance = 2-1 = 1. (Now at 2)\n          Second task at 3: distance = 3-2 = 1. (Now at 3)\n          Third task at 3: distance = 0.\n\n          Total time = 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n   However, wait: the example input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", which gives output 2.\n\n   But note: the example output is 2. So our calculation matches.\n\n   However, consider an alternative for the first example: \n        After the first task (at house 3), we are at house 3. Then we need to go to house 2. \n        Since we can only move clockwise, we cannot go backwards. So we must go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2: 3 steps.\n\n   Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem states that the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So we cannot move counterclockwise.\n\n   Approach:\n\n   We are given a list of m integers (a1, a2, ..., am). We start at house 1 (position 1) and then we update our current position to the next task's house.\n\n   However, we don't need to simulate each step, we can calculate the total time by summing up the distances between consecutive tasks (including the start to the first task).\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let current_position = 1.\n   total_time = 0\n\n   For each task_location in the list of tasks:\n        if task_location >= current_position:\n            distance = task_location - current_position\n        else:\n            distance = (n - current_position) + task_location\n\n        total_time += distance\n        current_position = task_location\n\n   Then print",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a one-way clockwise ringroad. The key observation here is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete each task in the given order, moving only clockwise. The movement from one house to another can be either direct if the target house is ahead in the clockwise direction or via the ring if the target house is behind.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial position at house 1.\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task location in the sequence:\n   - **Direct Path Calculation**: If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between the task location and the current position.\n   - **Ring Path Calculation**: If the task location is less than the current position, the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then from house `n` to the task location.\n3. **Update Position and Time**: After calculating the distance to the next task, update the current position to the task's location and add the distance to the total time.\n4. **Output Total Time**: After processing all tasks, the total time accumulated is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the properties of the ring road and processing each task in sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for loc in tasks:\n        if loc >= current:\n            total_time += loc - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current) + loc\n        current = loc\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location, it checks if the location is ahead of or behind the current position. If it's ahead, the distance is straightforward. If it's behind, the distance involves wrapping around the ring.\n- **Updating Position**: After each task, the current position is updated to the task's location, ensuring subsequent calculations are based on the correct starting point.\n- **Output**: The total time taken to complete all tasks is printed, which is the sum of all individual movement distances.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal performance by processing each task in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem.",
