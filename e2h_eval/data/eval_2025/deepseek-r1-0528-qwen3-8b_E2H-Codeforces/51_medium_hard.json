Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the target string (since we need to form both names).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the third string.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"there won't be any extra letters\", meaning the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names (with the same frequency).\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Here, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". But note the example output says YES because the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" which is an anagram.\n\n However, wait: the example input is given as a single string in an array? Actually, the example input format is three lines.\n\n Let me break down the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n But note: the example input is provided as:\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n Actually, the sample input provided in the problem is given as a multi-line string. So we should read three lines.\n\n Approach:\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   target = s1 + s2\n   pile = s3\n\n   Then, we can check if sorted(target) == sorted(pile)\n\n But wait: what if there are spaces? The problem states that the lines contain only uppercase Latin letters and no empty line. So we can use strip to remove any extraneous whitespace.\n\n However, the example does not have spaces.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string with '\\n' but when reading from stdin, we'll get three separate lines.\n\n Example 2 and 3 are also provided.\n\n Let's test with example 2:\n\n   Input:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Combined target = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Are these the same multiset?\n\n   Count the letters:\n\n   target: \n        P: 3, A: 2, I: 1, N: 1, O: 2, E: 1, L: 1, J: 1, U: 3, K: 1\n\n   Wait, let me count:\n\n   PAPAINOEL: \n        P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1 -> actually P appears twice? Let me check: \n        P A P A I N O E L -> P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n\n   JOULUPUKKI:\n        J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, U:1, K:2, I:1 -> wait, let's break down:\n        J O U L U P U K K I -> \n            J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1\n\n   So total for target: \n        P: 2+1 = 3, A:2, I:1+1=2, N:1, O:1+1=2, E:1, L:1+1=2, J:1, U:3, K:2\n\n   Now the pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Let me count the pile: \n        J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, K:2, E:1\n\n   The target requires: \n        P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:3, K:2\n\n   Pile has P:2 (but target requires 3) -> so it's missing one 'P'. Also, the pile has an extra 'L'? Actually, the target requires L:2, and the pile has L:2? \n\n   Let me recount the pile: \n        J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, K:2, E:1\n\n   But wait, the target requires P:3, and we have only 2 in the pile. So that's why it's NO.\n\n   However, the example output is \"NO\".\n\n   But note: the example input was given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   Actually, the second example input is:\n\n        Line1: 'PAPAINOEL'\n        Line2: 'JOULUPUKKI'\n        Line3: 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\n   And the example output is \"NO\".\n\n   So our method of comparing sorted strings would fail because the lengths must be the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can:\n\n   - Check if the length of the pile is equal to the length of the combined string (target). If not, then NO.\n   - Then, check if the sorted target is equal to the sorted pile.\n\n   However, if the lengths are different, we can immediately say NO.\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Combined target = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Let's count the letters:\n\n        Target: \n            B: ? \n            Break down target: \n                BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\n            B: appears 3 times? (BABBONATALE -> B at start, then two more Bs in BAB? Actually: \n            B A B B O N A T A L E F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S\n\n            Let me count B: \n                B, then in BAB: two Bs, then in B? Actually, the word is BABBONATALE -> so the first word: \n                B A B B O N A T A L E -> that's 4 Bs? \n\n            Actually, let's do by code:\n\n            target = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Length of target: 25, length of pile: 26 -> so they are different. Therefore, NO.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        target = s1 + s2\n        if len(target) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(target) == sorted(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, is the length check necessary? Because if the lengths are different, we know it's NO. It's an optimization.\n\n   However, the problem says the length of each line doesn't exceed 100, so even sorting two strings of up to 200 characters is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can just do:\n\n        if sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> length 17+9 = 26\n        s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> length 26\n\n        Now, sort target and s3.\n\n        They are anagrams.\n\n   Example 2:\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        target = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" -> length 9+11 = 20\n        s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> length 20? \n\n        Let me count: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> \n        J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I -> 20 characters.\n\n        But wait, the example says NO because the letters don't match. \n\n        So we must compare the sorted version.\n\n        target_sorted = sorted(\"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\")\n        pile_sorted = sorted(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\")\n\n        They are not the same because the target has 3 P's and the pile has 2 P's.\n\n        So the sorted comparison will catch that.\n\n   Example 3:\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        target = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> length 25\n        s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> length 26\n\n        So the sorted comparison will be between two strings of different lengths, but the sorted function will still work. However, the sorted arrays will have different lengths, so they won't be equal.\n\n   So we can simply do:\n\n        if sorted(s1 + s2) == sorted(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is straightforward.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset of letters in the pile matches exactly with the multiset of letters from the combined names, without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The input consists of three lines: the first line is the guest's name, the second line is the host's name, and the third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names:** Combine the guest's name and the host's name into a single target string.\n3. **Check Letter Counts:** Compare the sorted list of characters from the target string with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, just possibly in a different order. Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter counts by leveraging sorting, which ensures that the order of letters does not matter, only their frequency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    target = s1 + s2\n    if sorted(target) == sorted(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's name (`s1`) and the host's name (`s2`) are concatenated to form the `target` string.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison:** The `sorted` function is used to sort the characters of both the `target` string and the pile (`s3`). If the sorted lists are identical, it confirms that the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, leading to the output \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently checks for an exact match in letter counts by utilizing sorting, ensuring correctness while maintaining simplicity. The solution handles all edge cases, including varying lengths of input strings and different permutations of letters.",
