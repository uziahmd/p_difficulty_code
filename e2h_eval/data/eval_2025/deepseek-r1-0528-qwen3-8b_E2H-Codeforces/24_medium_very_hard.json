She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\n There are two main parts to consider:\n 1. The initial state: n tabs, cursor at `pos`.\n 2. We want to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive.\n\n We can perform three types of operations each second (but note: closing an operation doesn't move the cursor, but it changes the boundaries a and b for future moves).\n\n However, note that the problem is about leaving only [l, r]. We must close all tabs not in [l, r]. We can close:\n   - All tabs to the left of the cursor (if any) -> sets new a = current cursor's left boundary? Actually, after closing, the minimum index becomes the cursor's current position (because we remove everything left of the cursor). Similarly, closing right sets the maximum index to the cursor's position.\n\n But note: the problem says that the state is defined by:\n   a = minimum index of unclosed tab, initially 1.\n   b = maximum index of unclosed tab, initially n.\n\n After some operations, we want to have a = l and b = r.\n\n We can also move the cursor, but the movement is bounded by the current a and b (which change as we close tabs).\n\n However, note: the example input \"6 3 2 4\" leads to output 5.\n\n Steps for example 1:\n   Initially: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n   Operation 1: move left to tab 2 (1 second). Now cursor is at 2.\n   Operation 2: close all tabs to the left (so now the smallest tab index becomes 2). This operation doesn't move the cursor, so cursor remains at 2. Now the remaining tabs are from 2 to 6, but then we will close the ones outside [2,4] (which are 5 and 6). However, note that we are allowed to do two kinds of closing: left and right.\n\n   Then she moves the cursor to tab 4 (from 2 to 3 to 4: two more seconds) and then closes the right side (so removes 5 and 6). Total 5 seconds.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n We need to close:\n   - All tabs with indices < l (left part)\n   - All tabs with indices > r (right part)\n\n We can do this by:\n   Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n   Option 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n\n But note: we might be able to combine movements and closings in a smarter way.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We are at `pos`. We need to get the cursor to the left boundary (l) and/or the right boundary (r) to perform the closing.\n\n However, note: we don't necessarily need to be at the very edge to close the opposite side? Actually, when we close the left, we set the left boundary to the cursor's position (so we can close the left part if the cursor is at l or beyond, but wait: the operation \"close all tabs to the left\" requires that the cursor is at a tab and then it closes from the current minimum (a) up to the cursor-1. But note: the problem says the cursor is at i, then we can close [a, i-1]. So to close the left part (all tabs < l), we must have the cursor at least at l (so that the tabs from a to l-1 are closed). Similarly, to close the right part, the cursor must be at most at r.\n\n Therefore, we must move the cursor to at least l to close the left, and to at most r to close the right.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then we don't need to do anything.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we must close either the left part and/or the right part.\n\n We have two independent parts to close. We can do:\n\n   Case 1: If the current cursor is already within [l, r], then we can potentially close both sides without moving the cursor? Not exactly: because to close the left part we must be at a position >= l (and similarly for the right). But if we are at a position in [l, r], then we can choose to close one side without moving? Actually, we can only close one side at a time and the operation doesn't require being at the very edge. However, to close the left part, we must have the cursor at a position that is greater than the left boundary we want to close (so we must be at l or beyond). Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at r or below.\n\n However, note: the problem allows multiple operations. We can:\n\n   - Move the cursor to the left until we reach l, then close the left part (if there are tabs to the left of l, then we close them). Then move the cursor to the right to r (if needed) and close the right part.\n\n But we can also close the right part first and then the left part.\n\n Alternatively, we can close one side without having to go to the very edge if we are already beyond the segment? Actually, no: because the closing operation removes all tabs to the left (or right) of the cursor. So to remove all tabs < l, we must close the left side from a tab that is at least l (so that we remove everything from the current a to l-1). Similarly, to remove all tabs > r, we must close the right side from a tab that is at most r.\n\n Therefore, we must have the cursor at least at l to close the left side (if we haven't closed the left part already, then the current a is 1, so we must be at l or beyond to remove [1, l-1]). Similarly, to close the right side, we must be at r or below.\n\n How do we close the left side?\n   - We must move the cursor to the left until we are at a tab >= l. But note: we might not need to go all the way to l if we are already beyond l? Actually, if we are at a tab x (>= l) then we can close the left part (which removes all tabs from a to x-1). But if we are at a tab x (>= l) then we have already removed all tabs to the left of x. However, we are only concerned with removing up to l-1. So if we are at l, then we remove [a, l-1]. But what if we are at a tab greater than l? Then we remove [a, x-1] which includes [a, l-1] and more (from l to x-1). That is acceptable because we don't mind closing tabs that are in [l, r]? Actually, we don't want to close the tabs in [l, r]. But note: the problem says we are going to close all tabs that are not in [l, r]. So we must not close the ones in [l, r]. \n\n However, observe: the operation \"close all tabs to the left\" does not specify which ones we are allowed to close arbitrarily. It closes all the tabs to the left of the cursor that are still open. But note: we are allowed to do multiple operations. The key is that we are going to close the entire set of tabs not in [l, r]. And we can do so by two separate operations: one for the left part and one for the right part.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we leave the tabs [l, r] untouched. In fact, we are going to close the ones outside [l, r]. However, the operations are defined in terms of the current state.\n\n Important: The problem says we start with n tabs, and we can close either the left part or the right part. After closing, the remaining tabs are the ones that were not closed, and the cursor remains at the same tab.\n\n The catch: we cannot close a tab that has already been closed. So we must close the left part and the right part separately.\n\n However, note: the example input \"6 3 2 4\": \n   Initially, the tabs are 1..6, cursor at 3.\n   Step1: move left to 2 (now at 2). Then close the left part: this removes tabs 1. Now the tabs are 2,3,4,5,6 and the cursor is still at 2. Then we need to remove 5 and 6. But to remove the right part, we must move the cursor to 4 (because we are at 2, and we can move to 3 and then 4). Then close the right part: removes 5 and 6.\n\n Why did we not just close the left part from the initial cursor? Because initially the cursor was at 3, and if we close the left part from 3, we remove [1,2]. But then we would leave tabs 3,4,5,6. Then we have to remove 5 and 6. But then we must move the cursor to 4 (from 3, we move right to 4) and close the right part. That is 1 (move left from 3 to 2 is not necessary if we can close from 3? Actually, let me check:\n\n   Option 1 (as in example): \n      Move left from 3 to 2 (1 sec), then close left (now tabs are 2..6) -> then move from 2 to 4 (2 moves: 2->3 and 3->4, so 2 sec) and then close right (1 sec). Total 4? But the example says 5.\n\n   Wait, the example says 5. Let me recount:\n\n      Input: 6 3 2 4\n\n      Steps:\n        Start: cursor at 3, tabs 1..6.\n        Operation 1: shift left to 2 (1 sec)\n        Operation 2: close left (now tabs 2..6) (this operation doesn't move the cursor, so still at 2) (total 2 sec)\n        Operation 3: shift right to 3 (1 sec) -> total 3\n        Operation 4: shift right to 4 (1 sec) -> total 4\n        Operation 5: close right (now tabs 2..4) (total 5)\n\n      Alternatively, the example solution described: \"shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\" -> 5 seconds.\n\n      But wait, why didn't they close the left part from the initial 3? Because if they closed the left part from 3, they would remove [1,2] and leave tabs [3,4,5,6]. Then they would have to close the right part (from 3: close right would remove [4,5,6] -> but wait, that leaves only 3, which is not [2,4]. So they must not close the right part from 3 because that would remove too much.\n\n      Alternatively, if they close the left part from 3, then they must close the right part from 4 (which is the next step). But then they must move from 3 to 4 (to close the right part from 4). Then they remove [5,6]. So:\n\n        Operation 1: close left from 3: removes [1,2] (tabs become [3,4,5,6]), cursor at 3 (1 sec for the close? But wait, the problem says each second we can do one operation. The operations are either moving or closing.\n\n        Actually, the example counts the moves and the closings separately.\n\n        We can break down:\n\n          Option A (closing left from 3 and then right from 4):\n            Step1: Close left (at 3): removes [1,2] -> 1 sec (if we count the close operation as 1 second)\n            Then we are at 3, and we want to close the right part from 4. So we must move from 3 to 4 (1 sec for the move).\n            Step2: Close right (at 4): removes [5,6] -> 1 sec.\n            Total: 3 seconds.\n\n          But wait, the example output is 5 for the first test. Why?\n\n        Let me re-read the example: \n          \"shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\"\n\n        This is 5 seconds.\n\n        The problem statement says: \"each second Luba can either try moving the cursor ... or closing ...\". So each operation (whether moving or closing) takes one second.\n\n        So if we do:\n\n          Operation 1: move left (from 3 to 2) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 2: close left (removes [1]) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 3: move right (from 2 to 3) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 4: move right (from 3 to 4) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 5: close right (removes [5,6]) -> 1 sec\n\n        Total 5.\n\n        Alternatively, we could do:\n\n          Operation 1: move left (from 3 to 2) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 2: close left (removes [1]) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 3: move right (from 2 to 4) -> 2 moves (from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4) -> 2 sec (two operations) -> then close right (1 sec) -> total 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n        Or, if we do:\n\n          Operation 1: move left (from 3 to 2) -> 1 sec\n          Operation 2: move left again? But then we are at 1, but we don't want to close from 1 because then we remove nothing on the left (if we are at 1, we cannot close left because there's no tab to the left). So we stop at 2.\n\n        Now, why didn't the example use the alternative method that I thought (closing left from 3 and then moving to 4 and closing right)? \n\n        Because if we close left from 3, we remove [1,2] (the entire left part we wanted to remove). Then we have to remove [5,6]. But note: the problem requires leaving [2,4]. After closing left from 3, we have [3,4,5,6]. Then we must remove [5,6]. To remove [5,6], we must be at a tab <=4 (and we are at 3). So we move from 3 to 4 (one move) and then close the right part. Then we have [3,4] (we removed [5,6]), but wait: we still have tab 3 and 4, which are in [2,4]. However, we also had to remove the left part [1,2] (which we did). So the result is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input is \"6 3 2 4\", and the desired result is [2,4]. After closing left from 3, we removed [1,2] and then we removed [5,6] from 4, so we are left with [3,4]. But we wanted [2,4]. So we are missing tab 2.\n\n        Correction: When we close the left part from 3, we remove [a, 2] (because the current a is 1, and we are at 3, so we remove [1,2]). Then we are left with [3,4,5,6]. Then we remove [5,6] from 4, so we are left with [3,4]. But we wanted [2,4]. So we must have left tab 2 open.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot close the left part from 3 because that would remove tab 2. So the example's method of going to 2 first is necessary.\n\n        So the issue: to remove the left part (all tabs < l) we must be at a tab >= l (so that we don't remove the tab l). Similarly, to remove the right part (all tabs > r) we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n        Therefore, to remove the left part (tabs < l) we must be at a tab that is at least l (so we don't remove the tab l). Similarly, to remove the right part (tabs > r) we must be at a tab that is at most r.\n\n        Now, in the example: l=2, so we must be at least at 2 to close the left part. Similarly, r=4, so we must be at most at 4 to close the right part.\n\n        How do we break down the problem?\n\n        We have two independent tasks: remove the left part and remove the right part.\n\n        Conditions:\n          - To remove the left part (if needed): we must move the cursor to at least l (if we are not already there). The cost for moving from the current pos to l is (current position - l) if we are to the right of l, but we might be to the left or right.\n\n        Actually, we start at `pos`. The left part removal requires that we are at a tab >= l. The right part removal requires that we are at a tab <= r.\n\n        We can choose the order: either remove left first or right first, or even interlace the movements.\n\n        However, note: once we remove a part, the cursor remains at the same place. Also, the boundaries change, so the movement in the next part might be affected.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let left_required = (l is not 1) and we are not already having the left part removed (meaning the left boundary is not l). Similarly for the right.\n\n        But note: the problem is that we are allowed to close the left part only if the cursor is at a tab that is >= l (so we don't close the tab l). Similarly for the right.\n\n        Actually, the operation \"close left\" from a tab i removes all tabs from the current a to i-1. We want to remove all tabs < l. So we must have i-1 >= l-1, i.e., i>=l. Similarly, to remove all tabs > r, we must have i<=r.\n\n        So:\n\n          Condition to remove left part: we must be at a tab i such that i>=l (then we remove [a, i-1] which includes [a, l-1] if our current a is <= l-1). But note: initially a=1, so we must be at least l to remove [1, l-1] (if we are at l, we remove [1, l-1]; if we are at l+1, we remove [1, l] which is too much because we don't want to remove l). \n\n        Wait, no: if we are at l, then we remove [a, l-1] (which is [1, l-1]) and leave l (and above). Then we don't remove l. Similarly, if we are at l+1, then we remove [a, l] (because i-1 = l) and that removes l (which we don't want). So we must be exactly at l to remove the left part without affecting the segment [l, r].\n\n        Similarly, to remove the right part, we must be exactly at r? Because if we are at r, we remove [r+1, b]; if we are at r-1, we remove [r, b] (which is too much). So we must be at r to remove the right part.\n\n        Therefore, we must move the cursor to l to remove the left part, and to r to remove the right part.\n\n        Now, the problem becomes:\n\n          We have two fixed positions: l and r.\n\n          We start at `pos`.\n\n          We must visit (at least) l and r (if the respective part exists) to perform the closing.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Option 1: First go to l (if needed) and close the left part, then go to r (if needed) and close the right part.\n\n            Option 2: First go to r (if needed) and close the right part, then go to l (if needed) and close the left part.\n\n          But note: we might not need to do both.\n\n          Conditions:\n\n            - If l == 1, then there's no left part to remove (so we don't need to go to l).\n            - If r == n, then there's no right part to remove (so we don't need to go to r).\n\n          However, wait: if l==1, then the left part is empty (there are no tabs <1). Similarly, if r==n, then the right part is empty.\n\n        So the steps:\n\n          Let left_needed = (l > 1)\n          Let right_needed = (r < n)\n\n        Then, if both are needed, we have two possibilities:\n\n          Possibility 1: Go to l first, then to r.\n\n          Possibility 2: Go to r first, then to l.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to be at the same place for both? For example, if we are at l and then we go to r, then we have covered both.\n\n        However, we can also consider that we don't necessarily have to traverse the entire segment. We just need to be at l (to close the left) and at r (to close the right). \n\n        The minimal path to cover both l and r from the starting point pos:\n\n          Case 1: If we need to go to l and r, then the minimal distance is:\n\n            Option A: Go from pos to l, then from l to r.\n            Option B: Go from pos to r, then from r to l.\n\n          But note: we might also go beyond one of them? Actually, no, because we must be exactly at l to close the left and exactly at r to close the right.\n\n        However, wait: what if we are already at l or r? Then we don't need to move for that part.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We must account for:\n\n            - The cost of moving to the required positions (l and/or r) and then the cost of closing (which is 1 second per closing operation).\n\n          Since we have two closing operations (if both are needed) and we must be at the respective positions, we can break down:\n\n          Total cost = (seconds for moving) + (number of closing operations)\n\n          The closing operations: 0, 1, or 2.\n\n          The movement: we have to get from the start to the set of required positions (which are the ones that are not covered by the other closing). \n\n        Let me define:\n\n          left_close_cost = 0 if not left_needed, else 1 (for the close operation) plus the movement cost to get to l (if we are not already at l) and then back? Actually, no: we are going to do the operations in an optimal order.\n\n        Actually, we have two independent operations and we can interleave moves and operations. But note: the problem allows us to do any operation (move or close) each second.\n\n        We can plan:\n\n          Scenario 1: Only left needed (left_needed and not right_needed)\n\n            Steps:\n              If we are at pos, we must move to l (if we are not already at l) and then close the left part.\n\n            Cost = |pos - l| (seconds to move to l) + 1 (for the close operation)\n\n          Scenario 2: Only right needed (not left_needed and right_needed)\n\n            Cost = |pos - r| + 1\n\n          Scenario 3: Both needed.\n\n            We have two orders:\n\n            Order 1: Go to l first, then to r.\n\n                Steps:\n                  Move from pos to l: |pos - l|\n                  Close left: 1\n                  Move from l to r: |l - r|\n                  Close right: 1\n\n                Total cost = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2\n\n            Order 2: Go to r first, then to l.\n\n                Steps:\n                  Move from pos to r: |pos - r|\n                  Close right: 1\n                  Move from r to l: |r - l|\n                  Close left: 1\n\n                Total cost = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\n            But note: |l - r| is the same as |r - l|, so the two orders are symmetric.\n\n            However, we must consider: maybe we don't need to go back from l to r if we are done? Actually, after closing the left part, we are at l. Then we have to go to r (which is to the right of l, assuming l<=r). Similarly, if we close the right first, we are at r and then we go to l (which is to the left of r).\n\n            But wait: what if the starting position is between l and r? Then:\n\n                Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\n                Order1: \n                    Move from 5 to 3: 2 steps, then close left (cost 1), then move from 3 to 7: 4 steps, then close right (cost 1) -> total 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n                Order2:\n                    Move from 5 to 7: 2 steps, then close right (cost 1), then move from 7 to 3: 4 steps, then close left (cost 1) -> total 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n            What if the starting position is not between l and r?\n\n            Example: n=10, pos=10, l=3, r=7.\n\n                Order1:\n                    Move from 10 to 3: 7 steps, then close left (1), then move from 3 to 7: 4 steps, then close right (1) -> 7+1+4+1 = 13.\n\n                Order2:\n                    Move from 10 to 7: 3 steps, then close right (1), then move from 7 to 3: 4 steps, then close left (1) -> 3+1+4+1 = 9.\n\n            So we choose the minimum of the two orders.\n\n            But wait: is there a better way? What if we do:\n\n                Option: First move to the closer of l or r, then the farther one?\n\n            Actually, we have two distinct operations (left and right) and we must be at the exact positions. The movement is linear and the absolute differences are independent.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal cost for the two orders is:\n\n                cost1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n                cost2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2   # which is the same as cost1 because abs(l-r)=abs(r-l)\n\n            So actually, the two orders yield the same total movement? \n\n            Let me check:\n\n                Order1: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n                Order2: |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n            But |l-r| = |r-l|, so the movement part is:\n\n                Order1: |pos-l| + |l-r|\n                Order2: |pos-r| + |r-l|\n\n            And these are not the same.\n\n            However, note: the movement from l to r is |l-r|, and from r to l is also |l-r|. So the total movement is:\n\n                In Order1: |pos-l| + |l-r|\n                In Order2: |pos-r| + |l-r|\n\n            So the difference is in the first leg.\n\n            Therefore, we should choose the order that minimizes the first leg.\n\n            Actually, we have two independent legs: from the start to the first target (either l or r) and then from the first target to the second target.\n\n            But note: we can also consider that after the first closing, the boundaries change. However, the movement is always along the line of tab indices (from 1 to n) and the absolute differences remain the same.\n\n            Therefore, the total movement for the two orders is:\n\n                Option A: go to l first: |pos-l| + |l-r|\n                Option B: go to r first: |pos-r| + |r-l|   (which is |pos-r| + |l-r|, same as above)\n\n            So we choose the minimum between:\n\n                Option A: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n                Option B: |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2\n\n            But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second leg is fixed (|l-r|). So we choose the order that minimizes the first leg: \n\n                min(|pos-l|, |pos-r|) ?\n\n            Actually, we are adding the entire |l-r| for both. But the first leg is |pos-l| for option A and |pos-r| for option B.\n\n            So the total movement for option A is |pos-l| + |l-r|, and for option B is |pos-r| + |l-r|.\n\n            Then the minimal total movement is |l-r| + min(|pos-l|, |pos-r|) ?\n\n            Let me test with the example: n=10, pos=10, l=3, r=7.\n\n                Option A: |10-3| + |3-7| = 7+4 = 11, then +2 -> 13.\n                Option B: |10-7| + |7-3| = 3+4 = 7, then +2 -> 9.\n\n            So we choose the minimum of the two: 9.\n\n            But wait, how did we get 9? \n\n                Option B: \n                    Move from 10 to 7: 3 seconds (operations) -> then close right (1 second) -> then move from 7 to 3: 4 seconds -> then close left (1 second). Total 3+1+4+1 = 9.\n\n            So the formula for both needed is:\n\n                total_seconds = min( abs(pos-l) + abs(l-r) + 2, abs(pos-r) + abs(l-r) + 2 ) \n\n            But note: we can also consider that we don't necessarily have to go from l to r or from r to l if we are already at the other end? Actually, no: because we have to close both sides, and we must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right. So we must visit both l and r.\n\n            However, there is a possibility: if we are already at l or r, then we don't have to move for that one.\n\n            But wait, the above formula for the two orders still holds.\n\n        However, there's a catch: what if the starting position is between l and r?\n\n            Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\n            Option A: |5-3| + |3-7| + 2 = 2+4+2 = 8.\n            Option B: |5-7| + |7-3| + 2 = 2+4+2 = 8.\n\n            So it's the same.\n\n        But wait, is there a possibility that we can avoid going from l to r (or vice versa) if we can use the same path for both? Actually, no: because the closing operations require being at the specific positions.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require that we do the closing operations in sequence. We can do:\n\n            Move to l, then move to r (without closing in between) and then close the left and the right? But that would be inefficient.\n\n        Actually, we must do the closing operations at the respective positions. So we have to be at l to close the left and at r to close the right.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal seconds for the case when both are needed is:\n\n            movement = min( abs(pos-l) + abs(l-r), abs(pos-r) + abs(l-r) )\n            total_seconds = movement + 2\n\n        But wait, is that correct? \n\n            Example: n=10, pos=10, l=3, r=7: \n                movement = min(7+4, 3+4) = min(11,7) = 7, then +2 -> 9. Correct.\n\n            Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7:\n                movement = min(2+4, 2+4) = 6, then +2 -> 8. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we don't have to go from the first target to the second target? Actually, we do: because we have to close both, and we are at the first target (say l) and then we must go to r to close the right. Similarly for the other order.\n\n        But note: we can also consider that we might not need to traverse the entire segment. For example, if we are at l and then we go to r, we are traversing from l to r. Similarly, if we are at r and go to l, we traverse from r to l.\n\n        There is no way to skip the entire segment traversal because we must be at both ends.\n\n        However, wait: what if we are at a position that is both l and r? Then we don't need to move. But l and r are different (unless l==r). \n\n        Another corner: l==r. Then we only need to close the sides (if any) but the segment [l, r] is a single tab.\n\n        Conditions:\n\n            left_needed = (l > 1)   -> if l==r and l>1, then we need to close left and right? Actually, no: we need to close the left part (all < l) and the right part (all > l). But note: the segment is [l, r] = [l, l]. So we must remove all tabs not equal to l. \n\n            How to remove the left part? We must be at l (so we are at the tab l) and then close the left part (which removes [a, l-1]). Then we must be at l (again) to close the right part (which removes [l+1, b]). \n\n            But note: we are already at l. So we can do:\n\n                Operation 1: Close left (if needed) -> 1 sec\n                Operation 2: Close right (if needed) -> 1 sec\n\n            And we don't need to move.\n\n            So if l==r:\n\n                if l==1 and r==n: 0\n                else if l==1: then only right part (if r != n) -> but wait, if l==r and l==1, then r=1, so we only need to remove the right part (if 1<n). Similarly, if l==r and l==n, then we only need to remove the left part.\n\n            Actually, if l==r:\n\n                left_needed = (l>1)   -> true if l>1, false if l==1.\n                right_needed = (r<n)   -> true if r<n, false if r==n.\n\n            So:\n\n                if l>1 and r<n: then we need to do two closings, but we are already at l (which is the same as r). So we can do:\n\n                    Operation 1: close left (1 sec)\n                    Operation 2: close right (1 sec)\n\n                    Total seconds = 2.\n\n                But wait: we are at l (which is the same as r). So we don't need to move.\n\n                However, what if we are not at l initially? Then we must move to l (which is the same as r) first, then close left and right.\n\n                Example: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=2.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  We need to remove left (if any) and right (if any). \n                  Since l=2, so left_needed: 2>1 -> True.\n                  right_needed: 2<5 -> True.\n\n                  We are at 3. We must move to 2 (1 sec), then close left (1 sec) and then close right (1 sec). But wait, after closing left, the remaining tabs are [2,3,4,5] (if we started with 1..5). Then we close the right part: from 2, we remove [3,4,5]. Then we are left with [2]. \n\n                  However, we were at 2, then we closed the left part (removed [1]), then we are still at 2, then we close the right part (removed [3,4,5]). So the order is: move to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec), close right (1 sec). Total 3.\n\n                But wait, we don't have to move twice? We are at 2 after the move, and then we do two closings.\n\n                Therefore, the cost for l==r is:\n\n                    If the starting position is not l: then we need to move to l (abs(pos-l)) and then 2 closings.\n\n                    If the starting position is l: then 0 moves and 2 closings.\n\n                So:\n\n                    if left_needed and right_needed and l==r:\n                        if pos == l:\n                           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves analyzing the initial positions and the required segment, then calculating the optimal sequence of operations (movements and closings) to achieve the desired result efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba starts with `n` tabs, the cursor at position `pos`, and needs to leave only tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive.\n   - Operations include moving the cursor left or right (within bounds) and closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n   - The key observation is that to close tabs outside [l, r], the cursor must be positioned at `l` to close the left part and at `r` to close the right part.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - If the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r] (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n   - Otherwise, we need to move the cursor to `l` and/or `r` to perform the closing operations.\n   - The minimal time is derived by considering the movement cost to reach the necessary positions and the fixed cost for each closing operation.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Single Operation Needed**: If only one side (left or right) needs closing, the time is the movement to that side plus one second for the closing operation.\n   - **Both Sides Needed**: The time is the minimal path to either `l` or `r` first, then to the other, plus two seconds for the two closing operations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l_val > 1)\n    right_needed = (r_val < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - l_val)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if right_needed and not left_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - r_val)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + abs(l_val - r_val) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + abs(r_val - l_val) + 2\n        total_seconds = min(option1, option2)\n        print(total_seconds)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), the answer is 0 since no operations are needed.\n- **Left/Right Check**: Determines if closing the left or right part (or both) is necessary based on the values of `l` and `r`.\n- **Single Operation Handling**: If only one side needs closing, the time is the movement to that side plus one second for the closing operation.\n- **Dual Operation Handling**: If both sides need closing, the minimal time is calculated by considering the path to either `l` or `r` first, then moving to the other, plus two seconds for the two closing operations. The minimal path between these options is chosen for efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, providing the optimal solution with minimal computational overhead.",
