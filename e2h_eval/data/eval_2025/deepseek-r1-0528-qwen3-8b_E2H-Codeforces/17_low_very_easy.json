He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one prefix and one suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the set of given strings is the set of all improper prefixes and suffixes (so two strings per length from 1 to n-1). But the input order is arbitrary.\n\n We are to output a string of length (2n-2) containing 'P' for each input string that is a prefix and 'S' for those that are suffixes. The number of 'P' and 'S' should be equal (i.e., n-1 each).\n\n Important: It is guaranteed that there is at least one string consistent with the given set.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since we know the total length of the string is n, and the prefixes and suffixes are of lengths 1 to n-1, we can use the following:\n\n Observation:\n  - For a string of length n, the prefix of length k must end at position k (if we index from 0 to n-1, then the prefix of length k is s[0:k]).\n  - Similarly, the suffix of length k starts at position n-k to n-1.\n\n But note: the problem does not tell us which is which. However, we have two strings for each length.\n\n How can we assign?\n\n Another observation: the entire string s must be such that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must share the first k-1 characters of the prefix and the last k-1 characters of the suffix? Actually, the overlap condition might help.\n\n However, note the guarantee: these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n Let's consider the example: \n   Input: n=5, and the strings: ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'] \n   But wait, there are duplicates? Actually, the example input representation is a bit confusing.\n\n Let me re-read the example: \n   Input: \n        5\n        ba\n        a\n        abab\n        a\n        aba\n        baba\n        ab\n        aba\n\n Wait, there are two 'a' and three 'aba'? Actually, the problem says: \"They can be given in arbitrary order\", but also \"It is guaranteed that there are exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\".\n\n So actually, for n=5, we have lengths 1,2,3,4. Each length has two strings.\n\n But the example input has:\n   length 1: ['a', 'a'] -> two 'a'\n   length 2: ['ba', 'ab'] -> two: 'ba' and 'ab'\n   length 3: ['aba', 'aba'] -> two 'aba'? Actually, wait: the third string is 'abab' (length 4) and the fifth is 'aba' (length 3) and then the sixth is 'baba' (length 4). \n\n Let me break down by length:\n\n   n=5: lengths from 1 to 4.\n\n   The input strings: \n        'ba' -> length 2\n        'a' -> length 1\n        'abab' -> length 4\n        'a' -> length 1\n        'aba' -> length 3\n        'baba' -> length 4\n        'ab' -> length 2\n        'aba' -> length 3\n\n So indeed: \n   length1: two 'a'\n   length2: two strings: 'ba' and 'ab'\n   length3: two 'aba'\n   length4: two strings: 'abab' and 'baba'\n\n Now, what is the original string? According to the example: \"ababa\".\n\n Let me check:\n\n   Prefixes of \"ababa\" of length 1 to 4:\n      len1: \"a\"\n      len2: \"ab\"\n      len3: \"aba\"\n      len4: \"abab\"\n\n   Suffixes of \"ababa\" of length 1 to 4:\n      len1: \"a\"\n      len2: \"ba\"\n      len3: \"aba\"\n      len4: \"baba\"\n\n So we have two 'a' (one prefix and one suffix) and two 'aba' (one prefix and one suffix) and two for the others.\n\n How to assign?\n\n Idea: We know that the entire string is of length n. Consider the two strings of length n-1: they must be the two longest proper prefix and suffix. Then, we can try to match the two strings of length n-1: one must be the prefix and the other",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`. The solution involves analyzing these strings to identify the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we can process each group separately.\n2. **Identify Overlapping Conditions**: For each length `k`, the two strings must satisfy certain conditions when combined with strings of other lengths. Specifically, the entire string of length `n` must be consistent with all given prefixes and suffixes. \n3. **Check Compatibility**: For each length `k`, check which of the two strings can be part of a valid string of length `n`. The key insight is that the prefix and suffix of length `k` must align with the overlapping parts of the entire string. \n4. **Determine Assignment**: Once compatible strings are identified, assign 'P' or 'S' based on which string fits as a prefix or suffix. The remaining string will naturally be the opposite.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for i in range(total_strings):\n        strings.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n        \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        k = len(s)\n        if k not in groups:\n            groups[k] = []\n        groups[k].append(s)\n        \n    result_chars = []\n    \n    for k in range(1, n):\n        list_k = groups[k]\n        if len(list_k) != 2:\n            continue\n            \n        p_candidate = None\n        s_candidate = None\n        \n        for cand1 in list_k:\n            for cand2 in list_k:\n                if cand1 == cand2:\n                    continue\n                found = True\n                for other_len in range(k+1, n):\n                    other_list = groups.get(other_len, [])\n                    if len(other_list) < 2:\n                        continue\n                    for other_str in other_list:\n                        if cand1[:k] == other_str[-k:]:\n                            pass\n                        else:\n                            found = False\n                            break\n                    if not found:\n                        break\n                if found:\n                    p_candidate = cand1\n                    break\n            if p_candidate is not None:\n                break\n                \n        if p_candidate is None:\n            for cand1 in list_k:\n                for cand2 in list_k:\n                    if cand1 == cand2:\n                        continue\n                    found = True\n                    for other_len in range(k+1, n):\n                        other_list = groups.get(other_len, [])\n                        if len(other_list) < 2:\n                            continue\n                        for other_str in other_list:\n                            if cand1[-k:] == other_str[:-k]:\n                                pass\n                            else:\n                                found = False\n                                break\n                        if not found:\n                            break\n                    if found:\n                        s_candidate = cand1\n                        break\n                if s_candidate is not None:\n                    break\n                    \n        if p_candidate is None and s_candidate is None:\n            p_candidate = list_k[0]\n        else:\n            if p_candidate is not None:\n                result_chars.append('P')\n                other_str = list_k[1] if list_k[0] == p_candidate else list_k[0]\n                result_chars.append('S')\n            else:\n                result_chars.append('S')\n                other_str = list_k[1] if list_k[0] == s_candidate else list_k[0]\n                result_chars.append('P')\n                \n    output_line = ''.join(result_chars)\n    print(output_line)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the integer `n` (length of the string), followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Finding Prefixes and Suffixes**: For each length from 1 to `n-1`, the algorithm checks which of the two strings can be a prefix or a suffix. This is done by verifying if the string can align with strings of longer lengths (from `k+1` to `n-1`). \n4. **Assigning Labels**: Based on the compatibility checks, each string is labeled as 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix). The labels are collected into a result string which is printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for each length by leveraging the constraints that the entire string must be consistent with all given prefixes and suffixes. The solution ensures correctness by systematically checking each string's compatibility across all relevant lengths.",
