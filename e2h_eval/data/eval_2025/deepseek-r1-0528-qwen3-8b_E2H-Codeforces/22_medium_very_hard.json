After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each of m characters (without spaces)\n We have a list of strings, each string is a row of m characters (each char is a digit from '1' to '9')\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines to form a grid (list of strings) of size n x m.\n\n For each subject (column), we can find the maximum mark. Then, for each student (row), check if there exists at least one subject where:\n   - The student's mark in that subject is equal to the maximum mark for that subject.\n\n However, note: there could be multiple students with the same maximum mark? \n According to the problem: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n So, if the maximum mark is 9, then all students with 9 are best in that subject.\n\n Therefore, for a given subject j:\n   max_mark = maximum character (digit) in column j.\n\n For a student i, he is successful if there exists at least one subject j such that grid[i][j] == max_mark (for that j).\n\n But note: it's possible that the same student is best in multiple subjects, but we only need one.\n\n Approach:\n  Step 1: Precompute for each subject j the maximum mark (as an integer or as a character, but we'll keep as character since input is string).\n\n  Step 2: For each student i, check for any subject j: grid[i][j] == max_marks[j] (character-wise)\n\n  However, note: the grid is given as list of strings. Each string is of length m.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n   We have 3 students and 3 subjects.\n\n   Grid:\n        student0: '2','2','3'\n        student1: '2','3','2'\n        student2: '1','1','2'\n\n   For subject0 (index0): max_mark is '3'? Actually, wait: let's check the first column: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2' (because '2'>'1')? But wait, actually we compare by the character's numeric value? Actually, in Python, comparing characters that are digits from '1' to '9' is lexicographical which is same as numeric because they are single digits.\n\n   Alternatively, we can convert to int, but the problem says marks are from 1 to 9, so we can also compare as characters.\n\n   However, note: the example output is 2, meaning two successful students.\n\n   Let's compute for each subject:\n\n   Subject0: [2,2,1] -> max is '2'\n   Subject1: [2,3,1] -> max is '3'\n   Subject2: [3,2,2] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for each student:\n\n   Student0: \n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> True (so successful)\n        subject1: '2' != '3'\n        subject2: '3' == '3' -> True (but we only need one, but already found one)\n\n   Student1:\n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> True\n\n   Student2:\n        subject0: '1' != '2'\n        subject1: '1' != '3'\n        subject2: '2' != '3'\n\n   So student2 fails.\n\n   Therefore, successful students are student0 and student1 -> count=2.\n\n   But wait, the example says: \n        \"student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3\" -> note: the example indexes from 1, so our subject0 is their subject1? \n\n   Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order. But note: the example input is given as:\n\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   And the example says:\n        student1 (the first student) is best at subjects 1 and 3.\n\n   In our grid, the first student is row0. The subjects are columns. So:\n\n        subject1 (first column): [2,2,1] -> best marks are 2, so student0 and student1 are best in subject1 (which is our subject0). \n        subject3 (third column): [3,2,2] -> best mark is 3, so only student0 is best in subject3 (our subject2).\n\n   But wait, the example says student1 (meaning the second student? because they count from 1) is best at subjects 1 and 2.\n\n   Let me clarify the indexing:\n\n   The problem says: \n        \"the student number 1\" -> meaning the first student (if we count from 1) is the one with the first row.\n\n   However, the example says: \n        student number 1 (first student) is best at subjects 1 and 3.\n\n   But in our grid, the first student is row0, and we see:\n        row0: ['2','2','3']\n        row1: ['2','3','2']\n\n   The example says student1 (row0) is best at subjects 1 and 3.\n\n   Our subjects (columns) are indexed 0,1,2. The example subjects are numbered 1,2,3.\n\n   So subject1 (in example) is our column0, and subject3 (example) is our column2.\n\n   Now, student1 (row1) is best at subjects 1 and 2: \n        subject1 (column0): mark '2' is best (max is '2') -> so yes.\n        subject2 (column1): mark '3' is best (max is '3') -> so yes.\n\n   But wait, the example says student1 (the first student) is best at subjects 1 and 3, and student2 (the second student) is best at subjects 1 and 2.\n\n   Actually, the example says:\n        \"student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2\"\n\n   This means:\n        student0 (number1) is best in subject0 (which is their subject1) and subject2 (their subject3).\n        student1 (number2) is best in subject0 (subject1) and subject1 (subject2).\n\n   So our method is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input string is provided as:\n\n        \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   And the example output is 2.\n\n   Now, the second sample test:\n\n        Input: \n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n   n=3, m=5.\n\n   Grid:\n        row0: '91728'\n        row1: '11828'\n        row2: '11111'\n\n   For each subject (column):\n\n        col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max is '9'\n        col1: ['1','1','1'] -> max is '1'\n        col2: ['7','8','1'] -> max is '8'\n        col3: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        col4: ['8','8','1'] -> max is '8'\n\n   Now, check each student:\n\n   Student0 (row0):\n        col0: '9' == '9' -> True -> successful.\n\n   Student1 (row1):\n        col0: '1' != '9'\n        col1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n   Student2 (row2):\n        col0: '1' != '9'\n        col1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n   So all three are successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the next n lines.\n\n   Step 3: For each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum character in that column.\n\n   Step 4: For each student i (from 0 to n-1), check if for any j (from 0 to m-1) the character grid[i][j] equals the max for column j.\n\n   Step 5: Count the number of students for which the condition holds.\n\n   However, note: the grid has n rows and m columns. We can also transpose the grid to make columns easier.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate by columns without transposing.\n\n   Option 1: Without transposing (using nested loops for columns and then rows)\n\n        max_marks = [None] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks[j] = max(col)\n\n   Then, for each student i, we check:\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count += 1\n                break   # break inner loop, but we don't need to check further for this student\n\n   But wait, we don't need to break the outer loop, but we can break the inner loop for that student once we found one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n   However, note: what if we don't break? Then we might count a student multiple times (once per subject) but we only need one. So breaking is good.\n\n   But what if the student is best in multiple subjects? We still count him only once.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   Edge cases: \n        n=0 or m=0 -> then we return 0.\n\n   Since n, m >= 1, we don't need to worry about zero.\n\n   Example: n=1, m=1: \n        grid = [\"5\"]\n        max_marks[0] = '5'\n        Then for the only student: grid[0][0]=='5' -> True, so count=1.\n\n   Another edge: all students have the same marks and the same maximum? Then every student is best in every subject? But wait, the definition: best if there's no higher. So if two students have the same maximum, then both are best in that subject.\n\n   Example: \n        n=2, m=1\n        grid = [\"5\",\"5\"]\n        max_marks[0] = '5'\n\n        Student0: '5'=='5' -> True -> successful.\n        Student1: '5'=='5' -> True -> successful.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n   That matches the requirement.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   max_marks = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n   But wait, the above list comprehension for max_marks: \n        for j in range(m): we want to take the j-th character of each row.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n   Then, we traverse each student and check.\n\n   However, we can use zip to transpose the grid:\n\n        transposed = zip(*grid)\n        max_marks = [max(column) for column in transposed]\n\n   Then, for each student i (each row), we can check:\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count += 1\n                break\n\n   But note: the grid is stored as list of strings, so grid[i][j] is a character.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n   Or even more concise:\n\n        count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if any(grid[i][j] == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)))\n\n   But note: the any() function will stop at the first True, so that's efficient.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n, m\n        Read grid\n\n        If n==0 or m==0: print(0) and exit? But n,m>=1.\n\n        Compute max_marks for each column.\n\n        Then, for each row i, check if there exists a column j such that grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n        Count the number of rows that satisfy the condition.\n\n   Example: first sample\n\n        n=3, m=3, grid = ['223','232','112']\n\n        max_marks = [ max(['2','2','1']) , max(['2','3','1']), max(['3','2','2']) ]\n                   = ['2', '3', '3']\n\n        Then for row0: '2','2','3' -> check: \n            j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful.\n        row1: '2','3','2' -> j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful.\n        row2: '1','1','2' -> j0: '1'!='2'; j1: '1'!='3'; j2: '2'!='3' -> not successful.\n\n        Count = 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We assume that the input is given exactly as described.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there's only one row and one column, then we have to handle.\n\n        # Transpose to get columns? Or use list comprehensions for each column.\n\n        # Using zip to transpose the grid (each element is a string of length n, but we want to compare by character)\n        # But note: grid is list of strings, and each string has length m.\n\n        # We can do:\n        #   max_marks = [max(column) for column in zip(*grid)]\n\n        max_marks = [max(column) for column in zip(*grid)]\n\n        # Now, count the successful students.\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # For student i, we look at each column j\n            # But note: the grid[i] is a string of length m. And max_marks is a list of m characters (the max for each column).\n            # We can do:\n            #   if any(grid[i][j] == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            #       count += 1\n            #\n            # However, we can also break early if we find one.\n\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Alternatively, using a more compact way:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But note: the above counts a student as soon as one subject makes him successful, and then moves to the next student.\n\n   However, the problem requires to count the student only once.\n\n   The above compact way uses a break in the inner loop, but then we break out of the inner loop and continue with the next student.\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we don't break? Then we would count the same student multiple times (if he is best in multiple subjects). But we don't want that. So we must break.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if any(grid[i][j] == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)))\n\n   This is more efficient and clear.\n\n   Let me write that version.\n\n   However, note: the any() function will break at the first occurrence, so it's efficient.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If the grid is empty, but n>=1 so not empty.\n        # Get the maximum for each column\n        # Transpose the grid: zip(*grid) gives an iterator of tuples, each tuple is a column.\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Check if for student i, there is at least one j such that grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n            if any(grid[i][j] == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        max_marks = [max('2','2','1'), max('2','3','1'), max('3','2','2')] \n        But wait, zip(*grid) for grid = ['223','232','112']:\n\n            zip(*['223','232','112']) gives:\n                [('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')]\n\n            Then max_marks = [max(('2','2','1')), max(('2','3','1')), max(('3','2','2'))] \n            = ['2','3','3'] (because '3' is the largest in the third tuple)\n\n        Then for each row i:\n\n            i=0: '223' -> check j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> count becomes 1.\n            i=1: '232' -> j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> count becomes 2.\n            i=2: '112' -> j0: '1'<'2' -> no; j1: '1'<'3' -> no; j2: '2'<'3' -> no -> skip.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   Example2:\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        max_marks = [max('9','1','1'), max('1','1','1'), max('7','8','1'), max('2','2','1'), max('8','8','1')]\n        = ['9','1','8','2','8']\n\n        Then check each row:\n\n            row0: '91728'\n                j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful.\n\n            row1: '11828'\n                j0: '1'!='9'\n                j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n            row2: '11111'\n                j0: '1'!='9'\n                j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input was given as a string that includes the newline. But we are using input().strip() so that should be okay.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a string in the example: \n        Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But in the problem, the input is provided as two integers and then n lines.\n\n   Our code reads the first line, splits to get n and m, then reads n lines.\n\n   It should work.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   I think we are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a grid of marks where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. For each subject, we identify the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if, for at least one subject, their mark matches the highest mark in that subject.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution requires checking each student's performance across all subjects. For each subject, the highest mark is determined. Then, for each student, we check if they have the highest mark in any subject.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Step 1**: Read the input values, including the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the grid of marks.\n   - **Step 2**: Transpose the grid to process columns (subjects) separately. For each subject, find the highest mark.\n   - **Step 3**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If so, count them as successful.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element in the grid twice: once to determine the maximum marks per subject and once to check each student's marks against these maxima. The time complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m are up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nif n == 0 or m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if any(grid[i][j] == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent n lines contain the marks for each student, with each line being a string of m characters.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: The grid is transposed using `zip(*grid)` to process each subject (column) separately. The maximum mark for each subject is stored in a list `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance by leveraging the highest marks per subject, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
