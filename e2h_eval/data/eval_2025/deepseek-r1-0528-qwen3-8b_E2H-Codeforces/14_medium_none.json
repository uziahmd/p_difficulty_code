He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n But note: we are not directly solving for n given m, but rather for a given m, we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function Z(n) is non-decreasing. Also, note that sometimes consecutive n's have the same number of trailing zeros (like from 5 to 9, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, etc).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n 2. Then, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n    Then, the numbers n for which Z(n) = m are the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n But wait: what if there is no n with Z(n) = m? Then the set is empty.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros increase in steps. For example, for m=0, then n from 1 to 4 have 0 zeros. Then n=5 gives 1.\n\n But the problem states m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n However, what if m is very large? We must be careful.\n\n How to compute Z(n)? We can write a helper function:\n\n   def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n\n But note: m can be up to 100000, and n might be very large. However, the number of trailing zeros in n! increases as n increases, and we are looking for n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n But note: the problem says that m is at least 1 and at most 100000.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over n from 1 upwards until we get to the required m because n might be very large (the n that gives m trailing zeros might be around 5*m, but actually it's more because of the powers: e.g., to get 100000 zeros, n is roughly 400000 or something?).\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can use binary search to find the minimal n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Call this n_low.\n   Step 2: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Call this n_high.\n\n   Then, the numbers n such that Z(n)=m are the integers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n   However, note: if there is no n such that Z(n)=m, then n_high might be the same as n_low (if n_low already has more than m zeros) but wait, our first step finds the smallest n with at least m zeros, and the second step the smallest n with at least m+1 zeros. So the condition is that n_low has exactly m zeros or more? Actually, we want the set of n for which Z(n)=m.\n\n   But note: Z(n) is non-decreasing and increases in steps. So if we find:\n\n        n_low = smallest n with Z(n) >= m\n        n_high = smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then, for any n in [n_low, n_high-1], we have Z(n) = m? Not exactly: because if m is achieved at a certain n, then for the next few n, the trailing zeros remain the same until the next multiple of 5. However, note that n_low is the first n where we reach at least m zeros, and then we stop at the next jump (which is when we get m+1 zeros). Therefore, the condition is satisfied for all n from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n   But what if m is not achieved? Actually, the trailing zeros function Z(n) is defined for every integer n, and it only increases at multiples of 5. However, we are guaranteed that for m>=1, there exists an n such that Z(n)=m? Actually, no: consider m=0, but m>=1. What about gaps? Actually, the function Z(n) increases by the number of 5s in the factorization of n. Sometimes the increase is more than 1 (for example, at 25, Z(25)=6, but Z(24)=4, so from 24 to 25, it increases by 2). So we might skip some m values.\n\n   Example: \n        m=5: does there exist n such that Z(n)=5?\n        Let's compute:\n          n=20: Z(20)=4\n          n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so no n with Z(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, the set of n might be empty for some m.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. (n_low)\n        Step 2: Use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. (n_high)\n\n        Then, the answer is the integers from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive.\n\n        But if n_low is already having Z(n_low) > m, then actually we skipped m. However, note that we found n_low as the smallest n with at least m zeros. So if Z(n_low) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m. Then the set would be empty.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the set being non-empty is that the smallest n with Z(n) >= m has Z(n_low) == m? Not necessarily, because we might have:\n\n            m=5: \n                n_low = 25 (because at 24, Z(24)=4 <5, so n_low=25) and Z(25)=6.\n\n            Then, n_high: smallest n with Z(n)>=6 -> which is 25. Then the set is [25, 24] (empty) because n_high-1 = 24, and n_low=25, so the interval [25,24] is empty.\n\n        So we can check: if n_low is the smallest n with Z(n)>=m, and if Z(n_low) != m, then there is no solution. Alternatively, we can check the length of the interval: if n_high - n_low == 0, then no n satisfies.\n\n        Actually, the definition: \n            We want n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n        The set of n for which Z(n)=m is the set of integers n from n_low to n_high-1, but only if Z(n_low) == m and Z(n_high-1)==m. However, note that Z(n) is non-decreasing and the jumps occur at multiples of 5. \n\n        But note: it's possible that Z(n_low) > m, meaning that we skipped m. In that case, the set is empty.\n\n        However, the way we found n_low is the smallest n with Z(n)>=m. Then, if Z(n_low) == m, then we have n_low in the set. But if Z(n_low) > m, then we never had an n with Z(n)=m.\n\n        Therefore, we must check: if Z(n_low) != m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the set of n with Z(n)=m is non-empty if and only if there exists an n such that Z(n)=m. This happens if and only if the minimal n for which Z(n)>=m has Z(n)=m and the next jump (to m+1) is after that.\n\n        Actually, we can also check: the set is [n_low, n_high-1] and we require that Z(n_low) = m and Z(n_high-1) = m. But note, by the definition of n_high, Z(n_high) >= m+1, and since Z is non-decreasing, for n in [n_low, n_high-1] we have Z(n) <= m (because if we had Z(n) >= m+1, then n would be at least n_high). And also, Z(n_low) >= m, so actually the condition is that Z(n_low) = m and Z(n_high-1)=m.\n\n        But wait, how do we know Z(n_low) is exactly m? We don't, unless we compute it. Similarly, we don't know if the entire interval [n_low, n_high-1] has Z(n)=m.\n\n        Actually, we can rely on the binary searches:\n\n            n_low is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n            Then, if Z(n_low) == m, then the set of n with Z(n)=m starts at n_low.\n\n            Then, we find n_high as the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n            Then, the set is {n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1}.\n\n        But if Z(n_low) != m, then we skipped m. So we must check:\n\n            If Z(n_low) != m, then output 0 and nothing.\n\n        However, note: the problem requires to output k (the number of values) and then the list of these k integers.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Find n_low by binary search (lower bound for m).\n            Step 2: Check if Z(n_low) == m. If not, then there's no solution. But wait, what if m is skipped? Then n_low is the smallest n with Z(n)>=m, but Z(n_low) might be greater than m. Then we cannot have Z(n)=m for any n.\n\n            Step 3: Then, find n_high by binary search (lower bound for m+1).\n\n            Then, the set of n is the integers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n        However, note: if m is skipped, then n_low is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m, and then Z(n_low) > m. Then the set [n_low, n_high-1] is still defined, but note: n_high is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1, which might be the same as n_low (if Z(n_low)>=m+1) or higher. But then the set [n_low, n_high-1] would be empty because n_high-1 < n_low? No, because n_high>=n_low. Actually, if Z(n_low)>=m+1, then n_high = n_low, and the set is empty.\n\n        So we can simply:\n\n            Let low_bound = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n            Let high_bound = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n            Then, if Z(low_bound) != m, then the set is empty. But wait, actually we don't need to compute Z(low_bound) separately because the condition for having Z(n)=m is that the next jump (to m+1) occurs at a number greater than low_bound. However, if Z(low_bound) > m, then we skipped m, and the set is empty.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note: the set of n with Z(n)=m is non-empty if and only if there is no n' < low_bound with Z(n')>=m (which is true by definition) and the value at low_bound is exactly m. But actually, the value at low_bound could be more than m.\n\n        Actually, the standard method to solve such problems is:\n\n            Let f(n) = Z(n) (trailing zeros in n!)\n\n            We want the set S = {n | f(n) = m}\n\n            This set is contiguous in the sense that if n0 is the smallest n such that f(n)>=m, and n1 is the smallest n such that f(n)>=m+1, then S = [n0, n1-1] if f(n0)==m, and empty otherwise.\n\n        However, note: it is possible that f(n0) > m, then S is empty.\n\n        So:\n\n            Step 1: Binary search for n_low: smallest n with f(n) >= m.\n            Step 2: Check if f(n_low) == m. If not, then output 0 and return.\n            Step 3: Then, binary search for n_high: smallest n with f(n) >= m+1.\n            Step 4: Then, the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n        But wait, what if m is 0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\n        However, let's test with m=5 (which is skipped):\n\n            Step 1: Find n_low for m=5.\n                We start with n=0, but we consider positive integers. We can set low=0, high= something like 5*10^5? Actually, we can set high to a sufficiently large number.\n\n            How to set the high bound for binary search?\n\n                We know that Z(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... <= n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/4 (geometric series). So n >= 4*m.\n\n                Actually, to be safe, we can set high = 5 * m * 5? Or we can use a while loop to set high until Z(high) >= m.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set high to 5*m (which is a safe upper bound? Let me check: for m=1, 5*1=5, then Z(5)=1, so okay. But for m=100000, 5*m=500000, then Z(500000) is about 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... which is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + ... = 124992, which is >100000, so 500000 is too low? Actually, we need a higher bound.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set high to 5*m (but then for m=100000, 5*m=500000, but Z(500000)=124992, so we need to set high to something that gives Z(high) >= m.\n\n            We can set:\n\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * m   # but wait, for m=100000, 5*m=500000, and Z(500000)=124992 which is >100000, but then we are searching for n such that Z(n)>=m, so we can set high to 5*m.\n\n            However, sometimes we might need a larger n. Consider m=100000, then the minimal n such that Z(n)>=100000 is less than 5*m? Actually, the minimal n is approximately 4*m (because without the higher powers, n/5 ~ m, so n~5*m, but with higher powers, n might be a bit less). But 5*m is safe because Z(5*m) is about m (actually more).\n\n            Actually, we can set high = 5*m (if m>0). But wait, if m=100000, then 5*m=500000, and Z(500000)=124992, which is greater than 100000, so we are safe.\n\n            But what if m=0? We don't have to handle m=0.\n\n            However, note: m>=1.\n\n            Algorithm for binary search for a given target t (either m or m+1):\n\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * t   # because we know that Z(5*t) >= t (since Z(5*t) >= 5*t/5 = t)\n\n            But wait, for t=m, we set high=5*m, and for t=m+1, we set high=5*(m+1). Then we do:\n\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low+high)//2\n                    if Z(mid) < t:\n                        low = mid+1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid\n\n            Then, low is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=t.\n\n        Now, what if the set is empty? Then we output 0.\n\n        Example: m=5.\n\n            Step 1: t=5, we find n_low = smallest n such that Z(n)>=5.\n                We know that Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6 -> so n_low=25.\n\n            Step 2: Check if Z(25)==5? -> 6 !=5, so the set is empty.\n\n            Then, we output 0.\n\n        Example: m=6.\n\n            Step 1: n_low = smallest n such that Z(n)>=6 -> n=25 (Z(25)=6).\n            Step 2: Check: Z(25)==6 -> yes.\n            Step 3: n_high = smallest n such that Z(n)>=7 -> we need to find the next jump. The next jump is at n=26? But Z(26)=6, then n=27,28,29,30: Z(30)= floor(30/5)+floor(30/25)=6+1=7 -> so n_high=30.\n\n            Then, the set is [25,29] -> numbers 25,26,27,28,29.\n\n        However, wait: \n            n=25: Z=6\n            n=26: Z=6 (because 26 doesn't add a new factor of 5? Actually, 26 has no factor of 5, so yes, same as 25.\n            n=27: same\n            n=28: same\n            n=29: same\n            n=30: adds one more factor of 5 (from 30) and also note that 30 is divisible by 5 once -> so Z(30)=6+1=7.\n\n        So the set for m=6 is [25,29].\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            m = int(input().strip())\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                if n < 5:\n                    return 0\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n            # Function to find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= target\n            def find_lower_bound(target):\n                if target == 0:\n                    return 0   # because 0! has 0 zeros, but the problem is for positive n, so n>=1, but note: we are looking for positive n, so we can start from 0 and then adjust? Actually, the problem says positive integers n. But note: the smallest positive integer is 1. However, our function Z(0) is 0, but we are considering positive integers. But the problem says positive integers n. So we should consider n>=1.\n\n                low = 0\n                # We set high to 5 * target, but note: we are looking for positive integers, so we can start low=0, high=5*target (which is safe because Z(5*target) >= target)\n                high = 5 * target\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if trailing_zeros(mid) < target:\n                        low = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid\n                return low\n\n            n_low = find_lower_bound(m)\n            # Now, we must check if Z(n_low) == m. But note: our function returns the smallest n with Z(n)>=m. Then, if Z(n_low) == m, then we have n_low in the set. Otherwise, we don't.\n\n            if trailing_zeros(n_low) != m:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                n_high = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n                # The numbers are from n_low to n_high-1 (inclusive)\n                k = n_high - n_low\n                # But note: the set is [n_low, n_high-1] which has k numbers.\n\n                # However, what if n_high-1 is less than n_low? Then k=0, but then we wouldn't be in the else branch because then Z(n_low) would be >=m+1, so then Z(n_low) != m. So we are safe.\n\n                # Output the answer: first the count k, then the k numbers.\n\n                # But note: k can be large (up to 5*m? but m<=100000, so k can be up to 25? Actually, the maximum consecutive n with the same number of trailing zeros is 4 (from 5 to 9, 10 numbers? Actually, from 5 to 9: 5 numbers). The maximum consecutive numbers is 4? Actually, between two multiples of 5, the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros is 4 (because when you hit the next multiple of 5, the trailing zeros increase). But wait, sometimes the jump is more than 1. Actually, the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, and the change is by the number of factors of 5 in that number. So the consecutive same trailing zeros can be 4 (if the next multiple is 5 away). But wait, consider 25: \n                #   n=25: trailing zeros jump by 2 (from 4 to 6). Then the numbers with 5 trailing zeros? There are none. Then the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros (4) are from 21 to 24 (4 numbers). Similarly, from 26 to 29: 4 numbers with 6 zeros.\n\n                # Therefore, the maximum consecutive same trailing zeros is 4.\n\n                # But note: our set [n_low, n_high-1] has length = n_high - n_low, which is the gap until the next jump. This gap is at most 4? Actually, no: if we have a jump of 2, then the gap for the previous value is 4 (because the jump happens at a multiple of 25, so the next multiple is 5 away, but the jump is more than 1). However, note: we are only concerned with the current m.\n\n                # Since k = n_high - n_low, and k is at most 5 (because the next jump is at most 5 numbers away, but actually, the next jump happens at the next multiple of 5, which is at most 5 numbers away, but if the jump is more, then the next jump might be further? Actually, no: the trailing zeros only increase at multiples of 5, so the next jump is the next multiple of 5. However, if the next multiple of 5 is 5 away, then the gap is 4 (because we include the starting point and then 4 more). Actually, the gap is the distance to the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5) minus one? Not exactly: the trailing zeros increase at the next multiple of 5, but if the next multiple of 5 is 5 away, then from n_low to n_low+4, the trailing zeros remain the same.\n\n                # But note: n_low might not be a multiple of 5. However, the trailing zeros function only changes at multiples of 5. So the next jump is the smallest multiple of 5 that is >= n_low. Then the gap is (next_jump - n_low) numbers? Actually, the next jump is the next n such that Z(n) > Z(n_low) (if any). But note, we defined n_high as the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. So if n_low is 25 and m=6, then n_high=30, so the gap is 5 (from 25 to 29, inclusive, which is 5 numbers). \n\n                # Actually, the set is [n_low, n_high-1]. The length is n_high - n_low.\n\n                # We must output the numbers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n                # But note: if k is large (like 100000 numbers) then we cannot output them one by one. However, the problem says m>=1 and m<=100000, and the consecutive numbers with the same trailing zeros is at most 5 (because the next jump is at the next multiple of 5, and the gap is at most 5). Actually, the gap is the difference between consecutive multiples of 5? No, the gap is the number of consecutive n that don't add a factor of 5 until the next multiple of 5. But note: sometimes the next jump is due to a number that is a multiple of 25 (or higher) and then the jump is more, but the gap (the consecutive n with the same trailing zeros) is still the same: from the current n_low (which is a multiple of 5) until the next multiple of 5 (which is n_low+5) but then at n_low+5, we might jump by more than 1, but the gap for the current m is the numbers from n_low to n_high-1, and n_high is the next jump (which might be a multiple of 5, but not necessarily the immediate next multiple). \n\n                # Actually, n_high is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. It could be that the next jump is at n_low+1? No, because trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. So the next jump must be a multiple of 5. Therefore, the gap (n_high - n_low) is the distance from the current n_low to the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase in trailing zeros (which might be more than one factor). But note: the next jump (the next n where trailing zeros increases) is the next multiple of 5 that has at least one factor of 5? Actually, it's the next time we multiply by a number that has at least one factor of 5. But that is the next multiple of 5.\n\n                # However, consider: n_low=25 (which is 5^2). Then Z(25)=6. The next jump is at 30 (which is the next multiple of 5) and Z(30)=7. But 30 has one factor of 5, so the jump is 1. Then the gap is 30-25=5, so the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\n                # Now, consider n_low=24 (if m=4): then Z(24)=4, and the next jump is at 25 (which is the next multiple of 5) and Z(25)=6. Then n_high=25, so the set is [24,24] (only 24). Then the gap is 1.\n\n                # But wait, n_low=24 is not a multiple of 5. Our function find_lower_bound(m) for m=4:\n\n                    We are looking for the smallest n>=1 such that Z(n)>=4.\n\n                    n=0:0, n=1:0, n=2:0, n=3:0, n=4:0, n=5:1, n=6:1, n=7:1, n=8:1, n=9:1, n=10:2, n=11:2, n=12:2, n=13:2, n=14:2, n=15:3, n=16:3, n=17:3, n=18:3, n=19:3, n=20:4 -> so n_low=20.\n\n                # Correction: I thought n_low for m=4 is 20. Then the set is [20,24] (because the next jump is at 25, which gives Z=6, so n_high=25). Then the set is 20,21,22,23,24.\n\n                # Why did I say 24 earlier? Actually, the set for m=4 is n=20 to 24. Then the gap is 5.\n\n                # Therefore, the gap is the next jump (which is the next multiple of 5) minus the current n_low.\n\n                # But note: the next jump is not necessarily the next multiple of 5 if the current n_low is a multiple of a higher power? Actually, the trailing zeros function only increases at multiples of 5, so the next jump is the next multiple of 5 (which is n_low + (5 - n_low % 5) if n_low %5 !=0, but if n_low is a multiple of 5, then the next jump is n_low+5? Not necessarily: because if we are at a multiple of 25, then the jump at n_low+5 might be smaller? Actually, the jump is determined by the factors of 5 in the number. \n\n                # However, note: our definition of n_high is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. That n_high might be a multiple of 5, but not necessarily the immediate next multiple if the current n_low is a multiple of 5. Actually, the next jump (the next time the trailing zeros increases) is the next multiple of 5. Because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5.\n\n                # Therefore, the gap is (next multiple of 5) - n_low, but wait: if n_low is not a multiple of 5, then the next jump is the next multiple of 5 (which is n_low + (5 - n_low%5)), but if n_low is a multiple of 5, then the next jump is n_low+5.\n\n                # However, note: we defined n_high as the smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1. It might be that the next jump is not just the next multiple of 5 because sometimes the jump is more than one. But wait, the jump is determined by the factors of 5 in the number. For example, at 25 (which is 5^2), the jump is 2 (from 4 to 6). But the next jump (for m=4) is at 25, and then Z(25)=6, so for m=5, we would have n_low=25 (because Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6, so for m=5, the smallest n is 25, but then we check Z(25)=6 !=5, so no solution). \n\n                # So the gap (n_high - n_low) is the number of consecutive n that have the same trailing zeros (m). And the gap is at most 5 (because the next jump is at most 5 numbers away). Actually, the gap is the distance from n_low to the next jump (exclusive). The next jump is the next multiple of 5 (if n_low is a multiple of 5, then the next jump is n_low+5; if n_low is not a multiple of 5, then the next jump is the next multiple of 5, which is <= n_low+5). Therefore, the gap is at most 5.\n\n                # But note: the gap is (n_high - n_low) and n_high is the next jump (the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1). Since the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, and the next jump must be a multiple of 5, then n_high is a multiple of 5. And the gap is (n_high - n_low) which is at most 5.\n\n                # Therefore, the set has at most 5 numbers. So we can safely output them.\n\n                # However, what if m=0? Then we don't use this, but m>=1.\n\n                # Now, we output:\n\n                #   First line: k = n_high - n_low\n                #   Second line: the k numbers from n_low to n_high-1, each separated by space.\n\n                numbers = [str(i) for i in range(n_low, n_high)]\n                print(str(k))\n                if k > 0:\n                    print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\n        But wait: what if k==0? Then we output \"0\" and that's it. We don't output the second line.\n\n        However, note: we are in the else branch only if Z(n_low)==m, and then we compute n_high. Then k = n_high - n_low. But k could be 0? Only if n_high==n_low, meaning that even at n_low the trailing zeros is already m+1? But wait, we checked that Z(n_low)==m, so then n_high must be > n_low. Therefore, k>=1.\n\n        But wait: if Z(n_low)==m, then n_high is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. Since Z(n_low)==m, then Z(n_low) < m+1, so n_high must be > n_low. Therefore, k>=1.\n\n        However, let me test with m=0: but m>=1.\n\n        But wait, what if m is very large and the next jump is the same n_low? That cannot happen because Z(n_low)==m, so to get m+1 we need a larger n.\n\n        Therefore, we can assume k>=1 in the else branch.\n\n        However, wait: what if the next jump is at n_low itself? Then n_high = n_low, and k=0. But if Z(n_low)==m, then Z(n_low) < m+1, so the next jump must occur at a number >= n_low+1. Therefore, n_high>=n_low+1, so k>=1.\n\n        But wait, the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing and only changes at multiples of 5. Therefore, if n_low is not a multiple of 5, then the next jump is at the next multiple of 5, which is >= n_low+1. If n_low is a multiple of 5, then the next jump is at n_low+5 (if the jump at n_low was by more than 1, then the next jump is still n_low+5 because the trailing zeros don't change until then). But wait, no: the next jump is the next n where the trailing zeros increases, which is the next multiple of 5. However, if n_low is a multiple of 5, then the trailing zeros at n_low was computed including n_low, and the next jump is at n_low+5? Actually, no: the trailing zeros increases at every multiple of 5. But if n_low is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple of 5 is n_low+5, and that is where the trailing zeros will increase (unless n_low is a multiple of 25, then at n_low the trailing zeros increased by 2, but the next jump (at n_low+5) will only increase by 1, so the trailing zeros at n_low+5 is Z(n_low) + 1 (if n_low is 25, then Z(25)=6, then Z(26)=6, ..., Z(30)=7). So the next jump is at n_low+5.\n\n        Therefore, the gap (n_high - n_low) is the distance to the next multiple of 5 (if n_low is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple is n_low+5; if not, then the next multiple is the next multiple of 5 after n_low). But note: we defined n_high as the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1. Since Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5, then n_high must be the next multiple of 5 (if the next jump is exactly one trailing zero) or a later multiple of 5 (if the jump is more than one). However, we are not sure. But our binary search for m+1 will find the correct n_high.\n\n        Example: m=1, n_low=5, then Z(5)=1, then we need to find n_high: smallest n with Z(n)>=2. That is n=10. Then the set is [5,9] (5 numbers).\n\n        Example: m=2, n_low=10, Z(10)=2, then n_high=15 (because Z(15)=3). Then set [10,14] (5 numbers).\n\n        Example: m=3, n_low=15, Z(15)=3, then n_high=20 (Z(20)=4). Then set [15,19] (5 numbers).\n\n        Example: m=4, n_low=20, Z(",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find all \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), we first determine the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\)) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). Then, we find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n_{\\text{high}} \\)) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie in the interval \\([n_{\\text{low}}, n_{\\text{high}} - 1]\\), provided \\( Z(n_{\\text{low}}) = m \\). If \\( Z(n_{\\text{low}}) > m \\), no such \\( n \\) exists.\n3. **Efficiency**: The binary search approach efficiently locates \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) and \\( n_{\\text{high}} \\) without exhaustive checks, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of \\( Z(n) \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    if n < 5:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    def find_lower_bound(target):\n        low = 0\n        high = 5 * target\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if trailing_zeros(mid) < target:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n    \n    n_low = find_lower_bound(m)\n    if trailing_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n_high = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    \n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by counting the factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n2. **find_lower_bound(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is from 0 to \\( 5 \\times \\text{target} \\), ensuring we cover all potential \\( n \\) values efficiently.\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - Read the input value \\( m \\).\n   - Use `find_lower_bound` to locate \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\)).\n   - Check if \\( Z(n_{\\text{low}}) = m \\). If not, output 0 as no solution exists.\n   - Otherwise, find \\( n_{\\text{high}} \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\)).\n   - The valid \\( n \\) values are from \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) to \\( n_{\\text{high}} - 1 \\).
