A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\nWe are given one line of input containing 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nWhere:\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes\n- d: number of slices per lime\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast (per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But wait, let me read carefully.)\n\nActually, the problem says: \n  \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nBut then, they want to make as many toasts as they can, with all friends drinking the same amount.\n\nEach toast is for one friend? Or is it that when making a toast, each friend gets one toast?\n\nWait, the example: \n  Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\nExplanation:\n  - They have 3 friends.\n  - Each bottle has 5 ml, 4 bottles -> 20 ml total.\n  - Each toast requires 3 ml (nl) per friend? Actually, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" \n\nBut wait, if there are 3 friends and they are making toasts, then one toast might be for the entire group? Or per friend?\n\nLet me read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\nThis suggests that for one toast, each friend must have their own portion. So one toast requires:\n  - For each friend: nl ml of drink, one lime slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nBut wait, that would mean for one toast, the drink needed is n * nl, the lime slices needed is n, and the salt needed is n * np.\n\nBut the example calculation was:\n  Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / (3 ml per friend per toast) but then multiplied by the number of friends? \n\nActually, in the example, the drink calculation is: 20 ml / 3 ml (nl) = 6 toasts? But wait, the example says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so for one toast, each friend needs 3 ml. Since there are 3 friends, one toast actually uses 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Then why 20 / 3 = 6?\n\nWait, the example says: \"The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nAnd the example input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nBreaking down:\n- Total drink: 4 * 5 = 20 ml.\n- Each toast requires: for each friend, 3 ml. So one toast requires 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml? But then 20 / 9 is about 2 toasts.\n\nBut the example says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nSo what are the 6, 80, 100?\n\n- The drink: 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 ml (per friend) for one friend? Then wait, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". \n\nBut note: the problem states that each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. However, the example does not multiply by the number of friends when calculating the number of toasts from the drink.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nThis means that for one toast, the requirement per friend is nl ml, one slice, and np grams. But note: the toast is being made for the entire group? Or per person?\n\nBut the example calculation for drink: 20 / 3 = 6. This 3 is nl (which is 3). And they are dividing the total drink by nl, which is the amount per friend per toast.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. That implies that if we are making t toasts, then each friend will have t * nl ml of drink? And the total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\nBut wait, the example: n=3, nl=3, so for t toasts, each friend gets t*3 ml",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then determine how many toasts can be made per friend based on these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the constraints of drink volume, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts is limited by the most scarce resource. We calculate the maximum possible toasts from each resource and then take the minimum of these values. Since each friend must have the same number of toasts, we divide the total toasts by the number of friends.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Drink Calculation**: Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` ml per toast). Thus, the maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) / (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices Calculation**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend). Thus, the maximum toasts from limes is `(c * d) / n`.\n   - **Salt Calculation**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams (since each friend needs `np` grams per toast). Thus, the maximum toasts from salt is `p / (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where any resource is insufficient, leading to zero toasts. Ensure division is done in a way that truncates to an integer since partial toasts are not allowed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    toasts_from_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    toasts_from_limes = total_lime_slices // n\n    toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    min_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_limes, toasts_from_salt)\n    \n    print(min_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of eight integers read from standard input.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink is calculated as `k * l`. The number of toasts supported by the drink is found by dividing the total drink by the drink required per toast (`n * nl`), using integer division to avoid fractions.\n   - **Limes**: Total lime slices is `c * d`. The number of toasts supported by limes is the total slices divided by the slices needed per toast (`n`).\n   - **Salt**: Total salt is `p`. The number of toasts supported by salt is the total salt divided by the salt needed per toast (`n * np`).\n3. **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The minimum value among the three calculated toasts gives the actual number of toasts that can be made without exceeding any resource constraint.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
