Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. Note that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can only swap '0' with '1' and '1' with '2', the relative order of the three digits (with respect to each other) is constrained by their inherent ordering: '0' < '1' < '2'.\n\n However, note that we cannot freely rearrange all three. But we can think of the operations as allowing:\n   - Any number of swaps between adjacent 0 and 1, meaning that 0s and 1s can be rearranged arbitrarily relative to each other (because we can bubble sort through adjacent swaps).\n   - Similarly, any number of swaps between adjacent 1 and 2, meaning that 1s and 2s can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n But what about 0 and 2? We cannot swap them directly. However, note that we can use the intermediate character '1' to help.\n\n Actually, consider: we can move a '0' forward through a series of 1s (swapping 0 and 1) until it meets a '2'. Then, to get the 0 past the 2, we must have a 1 in between? But wait: we cannot swap 0 and 2. So the 0 cannot jump over a 2 without having a 1 to help? Actually, let's break down:\n\n Example: \"02\" -> cannot be swapped to \"20\". But if we have \"012\", then we can do:\n   \"012\" -> swap the '0' and '1': becomes \"102\"\n   then swap the '0' (which is now at the middle) and the '2'? But wait, we cannot swap 0 and 2. However, note that we can also swap the middle '0' with the '2' if we first change the arrangement? Actually, in \"102\", we can swap the '0' and the '2' because they are not adjacent? Wait, they are not adjacent: the string is \"102\", so adjacent pairs are ('1','0') and ('0','2'). The operation allows swapping adjacent '0' and '1' (so we can swap the first two) but we cannot swap the last two because they are '0' and '2'. \n\n Let me clarify: the operations are only for adjacent pairs that are either \"01\" or \"12\". So we can swap \"01\" to \"10\", and \"12\" to \"21\", and vice versa.\n\n Therefore, we cannot swap \"02\" or \"20\". \n\n However, note that we can use multiple steps to move a 0 past a 2 by going through a 1. For example:\n\n Start: \"02\"\n Cannot do anything because there is no '1' in between.\n\n But if we have \"012\":\n   Step 1: swap the '0' and the '1' (adjacent and allowed): becomes \"102\".\n   Now, we have \"102\": the adjacent pairs are \"10\" and \"02\". The \"10\" is allowed (swap back and forth) but the \"02\" is not. So we are stuck.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the 1 to separate the 0 and 2? Actually, we cannot swap the 0 and 2.\n\n Another example: \"012\" -> we can also do:\n   Step 1: swap the last two? But the last two are \"12\", which is allowed: swap to \"021\".\n   Now, we have \"021\": adjacent pairs are \"02\" (not allowed) and \"21\" (allowed). Then we can swap the last two: \"021\" -> \"012\" again.\n\n So what can we do? We can rearrange the entire string arbitrarily as long as the relative order of the zeros and twos is fixed? Or is it?\n\n Actually, note that the operations allow us to independently rearrange the zeros and ones (so zeros and ones can be arbitrarily rearranged), and independently rearrange the ones and twos. But zeros and twos are tied by the ones.\n\n This means that we can break the string into three independent sets? Not exactly, but note:\n\n Since we can swap zeros and ones arbitrarily, we can arrange all zeros and ones arbitrarily. Similarly, we can arrange all ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\n But the zeros and twos are connected via the ones. In fact, the entire process allows us to sort the string with respect to the ordering 0 < 1 < 2, but with the constraint that a zero cannot be placed before a two if there is no",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on the given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that these operations allow us to independently sort the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the string, but with the constraint that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the input string into its lexicographically smallest form using only adjacent swaps of '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. Lexicographical order means that the string should be as small as possible when compared character by character from left to right.\n2. **Insight**: Since we can swap adjacent '0's and '1's freely, all '0's and '1's can be rearranged among themselves. Similarly, all '1's and '2's can be rearranged among themselves. However, '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, but their relative order can be influenced by the presence of '1's.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves three main steps:\n   - **Count Characters**: Count the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the string.\n   - **Construct Result String**: \n     - First, place all '0's at the beginning of the result string.\n     - Next, place all '1's following the '0's.\n     - Finally, place all '2's after the '1's.\n   This approach ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    result = '0' * count0 + '1' * count1 + '2' * count2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Character Counting**: The code counts the occurrences of each character ('0', '1', '2') in the input string.\n3. **Result Construction**: The result string is constructed by concatenating all '0's, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. This arrangement ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n4. **Output**: The constructed string is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps to achieve the desired result by focusing on the relative ordering of characters, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
