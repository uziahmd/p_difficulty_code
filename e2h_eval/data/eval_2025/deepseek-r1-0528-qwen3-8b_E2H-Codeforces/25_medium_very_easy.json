При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it can be obtained by two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlap (as described). The conditions for an error are:\n 1. The entire message `t` must be formed by two copies of `s` that have been overlapped (with positive overlap, but not the entire message).\n 2. The error is only considered when there is an overlap (so no full duplication without overlap is an error? Actually, note: \n    - Example: \"abcabc\" is considered no error (so we output 'NO' for that).\n    - But if we have \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", then we consider that the original message was \"abrakadabra\", and there was an overlap.\n\n How does the error work?\n   Let s be the original message. Then the transmission would have sent two copies of s: s and s again.\n   However, due to the error, the second copy is partially or fully merged with the first one, but only at the boundary where they share the same starting part of the second copy and the ending part of the first.\n\n   Specifically, if the first message is s and the second is also s, then the concatenation without error would be s+s = ss.\n   With an error, we have t = s + s, but with an overlap: so t = s[0 : n] + s[n:] + s, but wait, actually:\n\n   The problem states: \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\". So the two messages are s and s.\n   The merge condition: the last k characters of the first s must equal the first k characters of the second s.\n\n   Therefore, the resulting string would be: \n        t = s + s, but with the overlapping part being omitted from the second s? Actually, no: the example says:\n\n   Example: \n      Input: \"abrakadabra\" (s) transmitted twice.\n      Then with an overlap of 1: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> the first s is \"abrakadabra\", the second s starts with \"a\", which matches the last character of the first s (which is 'a')? Actually, wait: the example has two possibilities.\n\n   Let me clarify with the example:\n\n   Possibility 1: Overlap of 1: \n        First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Second s: \"abrakadabra\" but we only take from the first character that matches the last one of the first s. Since the last character of the first s is 'a', we match the first character of the second s. Then the resulting string is:\n            First s: \"abrakadabra\" and then the second s without the first character? Actually, no: the example result is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is:\n            \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> because we overlapped the 'a' and then appended the rest of the second s.\n\n   So the total string is: s + s[k:], where k is the overlap length (k>=1 and k < len(s)).\n\n   But note: the problem says the two messages are identical. And the merge happens only if the suffix of the first s equals the prefix of the second s (and the second s is the same as the first).\n\n   Therefore, we require that for some k (1<=k<len(s)):\n        s[0:k] == s[-k:]\n\n   And then the entire string t should be: s + s[k:]\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: t must be of the form A + B, where A+B = s + s[k:], and also we know that the length of t is |s| + |s| - k.\n\n   Another way: We are given t. We want to check if there exists a string s (non-empty) and an integer k (1<=k<len(s)) such that:\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n   Also note: s must be the same in both parts.\n\n   But note: we don't know s. However, note that the entire t must be built from two copies of s. Therefore, the length of t must be between 2*len(s) - 1 and 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) ??? Actually, the length of t is 2*len(s) - k, and k is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1.\n\n   So the length of t must be at least len(s)+1 (because k can be up to len(s)-1, so then |t| = 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) = len(s)+1) and at most 2*len(s)-1.\n\n   But note: we don't know s. How can we relate t?\n\n   Let n = len(t). Then let m be the length of s. Then we have:\n        n = 2*m - k, with 1<=k<=m-1 -> so n must be between m+1 and 2*m-1.\n\n   Also, from the structure: t must be split into two parts: the first part is the entire s (which is the first m characters of t) and the second part is the remaining part (from m to the end) which must equal s[k:]. But wait, we don't know m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to consider the following:\n\n   Since t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap, we can also see that the entire t must have a periodic structure. In fact, we can consider:\n\n        Let t = ab, where a is the first m characters (which is s) and b is the rest (which is s[k:]).\n\n        Then we must have that the last k characters of a (i.e., a[-k:]) are equal to the first k characters of b (i.e., b[:k])? Actually, wait: the second copy of s is the entire s (which is a) and then we remove the first k characters? No, actually the second copy is s, but we only start from the k-th character. However, the condition for the error is that the two s are the same and the last k of the first s equals the first k of the second s.\n\n   But note: the second copy is s, so the second part of t (after the first m characters) must be s without the first k characters. However, we don't know k.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider: the entire string t must satisfy that there exists a proper divisor-like structure. Actually, note that the entire t is composed of two copies of s, so the whole string t must be periodic with period m, but the last k characters of the first period must match the first k of the next period.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not require the entire t to be periodic, but only that the two copies are s and s. So we can try to break t into two parts: the first part is s, and the second part is s without the first k characters. Then the entire t is s + s[k:].\n\n   This means that the second part (of length n - m) must equal s[k:].\n\n   But note: the first part is s, and the second part is s[k:], so we have:\n        s = t[0:m]\n        s[k:] = t[m:]\n\n   Also, from the definition of s[k:], we have that k must be such that the last k characters of the first part (s) must equal the first k characters of the second part (s[k:]), but wait: the second part is s[k:], so the beginning of the second part is s[k]. But note, we don't know k.\n\n   However, we can also note: the entire string t must be such that the second occurrence of s (the part from m to the end) must be exactly s without the prefix of length k. Therefore, the entire t must satisfy:\n\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m:] = s[k:]\n\n   Then, we can also say that the second part (t[m:]) is a suffix of s. And the length of t[m:] is n - m.\n\n   Moreover, since s = t[0:m], then s[k:] = t[0:m][k:] = t[k:m]. \n\n   But wait, that doesn't fit: because the second part is t[m:], and we are saying t[m:] must equal s[k:] = t[k:m]. \n\n   Actually, we have two expressions for s[k:]:\n        s[k:] = t[k:m]   (from the definition of s)\n        s[k:] = t[m:]    (from the error condition)\n\n   So we must have t[k:m] = t[m:].\n\n   But note: the length of t[k:m] is (m - k) and the length of t[m:] is (n - m). Therefore, we must have:\n        m - k = n - m   =>   n = 2*m - k\n\n   Also, note that k must be at least 1 and at most m-1.\n\n   So we have two equations:\n        n = 2*m - k   (1)\n        t[k:m] = t[m:]   (2)\n\n   Now, from (1): k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Conditions on k: 1 <= k <= m-1.\n\n   Then, from (2): t[k:m] must equal t[m:].\n\n   But note: the length of t[k:m] is (m - k) and the length of t[m:] is (n - m). And from (1) we have n = 2*m - k, so n-m = m - k. So the lengths are equal.\n\n   Therefore, we can iterate over possible m (the length of s) and check if there exists a k (computed as k=2*m-n) that satisfies:\n        1 <= k <= m-1   (so 1 <= 2*m - n <= m-1) and t[k:m] == t[m:]\n\n   But note: m must be such that the length of s is m, and the entire string t is built from two copies of s (so the length of t is n). Also, note that m must be at least ceil(n/2) + 1? Actually, from n=2*m-k and k>=1, then n<=2*m-1 -> m>=ceil((n+1)/2). And from k<=m-1, we have n=2*m-k >= 2*m-(m-1)=m+1 -> so m<=n-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set m from floor((n+1)/2) to n-1, but note: m must be at least (n+1)//2? Actually, from n=2*m-k and k<=m-1, we have n>=2*m-(m-1)=m+1 -> so m<=n-1.\n\n   But also, n=2*m-k and k>=1 -> n<=2*m-1 -> m>=ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n   However, note: the entire string t is built from two copies of s (with overlap). So m must be chosen such that the first m characters form s, and the remaining n-m characters form the tail of s (starting at index k).\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let n = len(t)\n\n   We are going to consider m from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). But note: m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1.\n\n   Then, k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Conditions: \n        1 <= k <= m-1   --> which is equivalent to: 1 <= 2*m - n <= m-1.\n\n   Then check if t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n   If we find one m for which these conditions hold, then we can output \"YES\" and the string s (which is t[0:m]).\n\n   However, note: what if there are multiple m? We can choose any, so we can break at the first one.\n\n   But wait: is it necessary that the entire t is built from two copies of s? Yes, because t[0:m] = s and t[m:] = s[k:].\n\n   Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n   n = 21.\n\n   What is m? \n        k = 2*m - 21, and 1<=k<=m-1 -> 1<=2*m-21<=m-1.\n\n        Solve: 2*m-21>=1 -> 2*m>=22 -> m>=11.\n               2*m-21<=m-1 -> m<=20.\n\n        So m from 11 to 20.\n\n        We know s is \"abrakadabra\", which has length 11.\n\n        Then m=11: k=2*11-21=1.\n        Check: t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\", t[11:] = \"brabrabrakadabra\" (length 10) and t[1:11] = \"brakadabra\" (length 10). \n        But wait, we require t[11:] == t[1:11]? \n                t[11:] = \"brabrabrakadabra\"\n                t[1:11] = \"brakadabra\"\n\n        They are not equal.\n\n        Why? Because the example says the error produced \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", meaning the second copy started with the first character of s (which is 'a') and then the rest. But note: the example says two possibilities: one with overlap 1 and one with overlap 4.\n\n        For overlap 1: \n            s = \"abrakadabra\"\n            t = s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> which is \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\"? Actually, no: \n            \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" is not the same as \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        Let me write:\n            s = \"abrakadabra\"\n            s[1:] = \"brakadabra\"\n            Then s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> but wait, that gives \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabbrakadabra\", which is not the same as \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        Actually, the example says the result is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 21 characters.\n\n        How is that built?\n            First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Then the second s: \"abrakadabra\", but we merge the last 1 character of the first s ('a') with the first 1 of the second s ('a'), so we write the first s and then the second s without the first character: \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> that gives 11 + 10 = 21, and the string is \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\" + \"brakadabra\" ? Actually, let me count:\n\n            \"abrakadabra\" has 11 letters: \n                a b r a k a d a b r a\n            Then adding \"brakadabra\": \n                b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            So the full string: \n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            Which is indeed \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        So in our representation, we have:\n            t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n            t[11:] = \"brabrabrakadabra\" -> wait, that's not matching.\n\n        Actually, let me break t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (21 characters) into two parts of 11 and 10:\n\n            Part1: \"abrakadabra\" (11 chars)\n            Part2: \"brabrabrakadabra\" (10 chars) -> but wait, that's not \"brakadabra\".\n\n        Correction: the example says the second copy was merged by one character, so the second copy's first character is omitted from the output (because it was merged). Therefore, the second copy is represented by its substring from index1 to the end.\n\n        But note: the second copy is the same as the first, so s is \"abrakadabra\". Then the second copy's entire content is \"abrakadabra\", but we only output from the second character (because the first character was merged). \n\n        However, the problem says: the two messages are identical. The merging condition is that the last k characters of the first message must equal the first k of the second. Then the merged message is the entire first message and then the second message without the first k characters.\n\n        Therefore, the entire t should be: \n            t = s + s[k:]\n\n        So for s=\"abrakadabra\" and k=1:\n            t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> but wait, that gives 11+10=21, and the string is:\n\n            a b r a k a d a b r a   b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n            s[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n            s[1:] = \"brakadabra\"\n\n            Then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" is not the same as the example.\n\n        Let me write the example: \n            Example input: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        Break it down: \n            The example output for this input is \"YES\\nabrakadabra\"\n\n        How did they get that? They are saying that the original message s was \"abrakadabra\", and the error occurred with an overlap of 1.\n\n        Then t should be: \n            s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> but wait, that gives 11+10=21, and the string is:\n\n            a b r a k a d a b r a   b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            Now, write the example: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            Let me count the letters: \n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            That is 21 letters.\n\n            Now, breaking into two parts of 11 and 10:\n\n                First 11: \"abrakadabra\"\n                Next 10: \"brabrabrakadabra\" -> wait, that's not \"brakadabra\".\n\n        I see the confusion: the example says two possibilities: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap 1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap 4).\n\n        Let me check the second one (overlap 4):\n\n            s = \"abrakadabra\"\n            k=4, then s[4:] = \"kadabra\"\n            Then t = s + s[4:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"kadabra\" = \"abraka\" + \"dabra\" + \"kadabra\" -> wait, no:\n\n            Actually, s[4:] is from the 5th character (if 0-indexed, then from index4) to the end: \n                s[4] = 'k', so s[4:] = \"kadabra\"\n\n            Then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"kadabra\" = \"abrakadabra\" + \"kadabra\" -> which is 11+7=18 characters, but the example says \"abrakadabrakadabra\", which is 18? \n\n            Let me count: \n                \"abrakadabrakadabra\": \n                a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> wait, that's 19? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (21) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (18). \n\n            Correction: the example says:\n\n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap 1) -> 21\n                \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap 4) -> 18\n\n            But wait, the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", so we are concerned with the 21-length string.\n\n        How do we represent the 21-length string?\n\n            s = \"abrakadabra\", k=1: \n                t = s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \n                \"abrakadabra\" has 11 letters, then adding 10 letters -> 21.\n\n            Now, the example string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is:\n\n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            Breaking the 21-letter string:\n\n                First 11: \"abrakadabra\" -> matches s.\n                Next 10: \"brabrabrakadabra\" -> wait, that's not s[1:].\n\n            Let me write s[1:] explicitly:\n\n                s = \"abrakadabra\"\n                s[1:] = \"brakadabra\" -> which is 10 letters.\n\n            Then the entire t should be \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> \n\n            Write it: \n                \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \n                a b r a k a d a b r a   b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            But the example is: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            Compare:\n\n                Our constructed: \n                    a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n                Example: \n                    a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n            They are the same.\n\n            But wait, the second part of the example string (the 10 letters) is \"brabrabrakadabra\"? \n\n            Actually, the 10 letters after the first 11 are: \n                positions 11 to 20 (0-indexed, so from index11 to index20): \n                index11: 'b'\n                index12: 'r'\n                index13: 'a'\n                index14: 'k'\n                index15: 'a'\n                index16: 'd'\n                index17: 'a'\n                index18: 'b'\n                index19: 'r'\n                index20: 'a'\n\n            So the second part is \"bra\" + \"kradabra\" -> \"brakradabra\", which is not \"brakadabra\".\n\n        Wait, I think I messed up the indexing.\n\n        Actually, the entire string t is built as:\n\n            t = s + s[k:]\n\n        So if s = \"abrakadabra\", and k=1, then s[k:] is \"brakadabra\", which is 10 letters.\n\n        Then t should be:\n\n            s[0:11] + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\"\n\n        Now, \"brakadabra\" is 10 letters: \n            'b','r','a','k','a','d','a','b','r','a'\n\n        Then the full t is:\n\n            \"a\",\"b\",\"r\",\"a\",\"k\",\"a\",\"d\",\"a\",\"b\",\"r\",\"a\",\"b\",\"r\",\"a\",\"k\",\"a\",\"d\",\"a\",\"b\",\"r\",\"a\"\n\n        Now, the example string is:\n\n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        Let me break the example string into two parts:\n\n            Part1: \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters) -> correct.\n\n            Part2: \"brabrabrakadabra\" -> wait, that's 15 letters? \n\n        Actually, the example string has 21 letters. So the second part is 10 letters: \n            The example string: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            After the first 11, we have 10 letters: \n                \"brabrabrakadabra\" -> wait, that's 15? \n\n        Let me count the example string: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            a(0), b(1), r(2), a(3), k(4), a(5), d(6), a(7), b(8), r(9), a(10), b(11), r(12), a(13), k(14), a(15), d(16), a(17), b(18), r(19), a(20)\n\n            So the second part is from index11 to index20: \n                index11: 'b'\n                index12: 'r'\n                index13: 'a'\n                index14: 'k'\n                index15: 'a'\n                index16: 'd'\n                index17: 'a'\n                index18: 'b'\n                index19: 'r'\n                index20: 'a'\n\n            So the second part is \"brakadabra\" (without the first letter of s[1:]?) \n\n        Actually, wait: we said t = s + s[k:], so the second part should be s[k:] which is \"brakadabra\", but the example second part is \"brakadabra\" (10 letters). \n\n        So the example string is:\n\n            s (11 letters) + s[1:] (10 letters) = 21 letters.\n\n        And that matches.\n\n        Then why did I think the example second part was \"brabrabrakadabra\"? \n\n        There was a misreading. The example string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", and the second part is \"brakadabra\", not \"brabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        Now, in our code, we are checking:\n\n            Let m = 11, then k = 2*m - n = 2*11 - 21 = 1.\n\n            Then we require: t[m:] == t[k:m]   -> t[11:] == t[1:11]\n\n            t[11:] is the substring from index11 to the end: \"brakadabra\"\n\n            t[1:11] is the substring from index1 to index10 (exclusive of 11): \"brakadabra\"\n\n            So they are equal.\n\n        Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        found = False\n        # m must be in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] (both inclusive) OR we can use: m from (n+1)//2 to n-1.\n\n        Actually, from the equation n=2*m-k and k>=1, we have m>=ceil((n+1)/2). And m<=n-1.\n\n        So for m in range((n+1)//2, n):\n            k = 2*m - n\n            if k < 1 or k >= m:  # because k must be in [1, m-1] (since k<=m-1)\n                continue\n\n            # Now, check if the second part of t (from m to the end) equals the substring of t from k to m (which is t[k:m])\n            if t[m:] == t[k:m]:\n                # Then we have found an s: s = t[0:m]\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(t[0:m])\n                found = True\n                break\n\n        If not found, then print \"NO\"\n\n   However, note: there is another possibility. The problem says the error might occur with different overlaps, and we only need to find one.\n\n   But wait, what if the string t can be explained by more than one s? Then we output any.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, output any.\"\n\n   However, there's an alternative approach: we can also consider that the entire t might be built from two copies of s, but we don't know s. The above method uses the condition that s is the first m characters.\n\n   But note: is it possible that the two copies of s are not aligned at the beginning? \n\n   Let me read the problem: \"the two messages are identical\". And the error occurs at the boundary. So the first message is s, and the second is s. The merge happens at the boundary: the last k of the first s must equal the first k of the second s.\n\n   Therefore, the entire t must be the first s and then the second s without the first k. So the first s must be the prefix of t.\n\n   So the above algorithm is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the string t is \"aaa\"?\n\n        n=3.\n        m from (3+1)//2 = 2 to 2 (since n-1=2).\n        Then m=2, k=2*2-3=1 -> valid (1<=1<=1, because m=2 -> k<=1? Actually, k<=m-1 -> 1<=1 -> yes, because m-1=1.\n\n        Then check: t[2:]==\"a\", and t[1:2]==\"a\" -> so condition holds.\n\n        Then we output s = t[0:2] = \"aa\"\n\n        But then the two messages are \"aa\" and \"aa\", and the error: the last 1 of the first \"aa\" is \"a\", and the first 1 of the second \"aa\" is \"a\", so we merge and get \"aa\" + \"a\" (without the first 'a') -> \"aa\" + \"a\" (without the first) is \"aa\" + \"a\"[1:] -> \"aa\" + \"\"? \n\n        Actually, s[k:] for s=\"aa\" and k=1 is \"a\"[1:] = \"\".\n\n        Then t = \"aa\" + \"\" = \"aa\", but our t is \"aaa\".\n\n        Wait, let me recast: the second copy is \"aa\", and we remove the first k=1 character, so we get \"a\". Then t = \"aa\" + \"a\" = \"aaa\", which matches.\n\n        So the algorithm works for \"aaa\".\n\n   But wait, the example input includes \"acacacaca\", and the expected output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n        t = \"acacacaca\", n=10.\n\n        We need to find an m such that:\n            m in [ceil(11/2)=6, 9] (so m from 6 to 9)\n\n        Let's try m=5? Actually, wait, our m range is from (10+1)//2 = 5 (floor division) to 9.\n\n        Correction: (n+1)//2 for n=10 is (10+1)//2 = 11//2 = 5 (in integer floor division). So m from 5 to 9.\n\n        Now, what is s? The example says s=\"acaca\", so m=5.\n\n        Then k = 2*5 - 10 = 0 -> invalid (k must be at least 1). \n\n        So we skip m=5.\n\n        Then try m=6: k=2*6-10=2 -> valid (1<=2<=5). Then check: t[6:]==\"caca\", and t[2:6]==\"cac\" -> not equal.\n\n        m=7: k=2*7-10=4 -> valid (1<=4<=6). Then check: t[7:]==\"aca\", and t[4:7]==\"ca\" -> wait, t[4:7] is from index4 to index6 (3 letters): \"c\" (index4) then 'a' (index5) then 'c' (index6)? Actually, t[4:7] is \"c\" (at index4) and then index5='a', index6='c'? \n\n        Let me break t=\"acacacaca\":\n            indices: 0:a,1:c,2:a,3:c,4:a,5:c,6:a,7:c,8:a,9: (none for t[7:] because 7:9 is two letters? Actually, n=10, so t[7:] is from index7 to the end: \"ca\", and t[4:7] is from index4 to index6 (three letters): \"a\",\"c\",\"a\" -> \"aca\".\n\n        So t[7:] = \"ca\", t[4:7]=\"aca\" -> not equal.\n\n        m=8: k=2*8-10=6 -> valid (1<=6<=7). Then check: t[8:]==\"a\", and t[6:8]==\"ac\" -> not equal.\n\n        m=9: k=2*9-10=8 -> but k must be < m, and m=9 -> k=8 is allowed? Condition is k<=m-1 -> 8<=8 -> yes. Then check: t[9:]=\"\" (empty) and t[8:9]==\"a\" -> not equal.\n\n        Then we output \"NO\", but expected \"YES\".\n\n        What went wrong?\n\n        The example says the answer is \"acaca\", so m=5. But k=0 is not allowed.\n\n        Let me reexamine the condition: the problem says the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message. So k>=1 and k < len(s)=m. \n\n        But wait, the example says the error occurred. How did they get \"acacacaca\" from two copies of \"acaca\"?\n\n        Two copies of \"acaca\" (without error) would be \"acacacaca\", which is exactly the string. \n\n        But note: the problem states that the error is defined as merging two identical messages. The merging requires that the last k characters of the first message equal the first k characters of the second. \n\n        In the example, the two copies are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\". \n\n        Consider: \n            First copy: \"acaca\"\n            Second copy: \"acaca\"\n\n        Without error: we would have \"acacacaca\". \n\n        But is that considered an error? \n\n        The problem says: \"the error is that the two messages are merged, which happens when the last k characters of the first message equal the first k of the second, and k is positive and less than the length of the message.\"\n\n        In this case, we have two ways to see:\n\n            Option 1: The entire string is just the concatenation without any overlap. But the problem says that without error (simple concatenation) is not considered an error. \n\n            However, note the problem also says: \"If the entire message t is obtained by two copies without error, then we output 'NO'.\" \n\n            But wait, the example input \"abcabc\" is considered no error (output 'NO').\n\n            Now, the example input \"acacacaca\" is given as \"YES\\nacaca\", meaning that there was an error.\n\n        Why is \"acacacaca\" considered an error? \n\n        Note: The problem says: \"When two identical messages are sent consecutively, the error may occur and the two messages are merged. The merging condition: the end of the first and the beginning of the second must be identical, and the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message.\"\n\n        In the example, we have two copies of \"acaca\". \n\n        The merging condition is met if there is an overlap. But note: the problem does not require that the entire string is obtained by an error. It says: \"By the error, the two messages are merged\". \n\n        However, the example output says YES, meaning that the message t is the result of an error.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"if the entire message t is obtained by two copies without error, then output NO\". \n\n        How is \"acacacaca\" obtained by two copies without error? It is the simple concatenation of two copies of \"acaca\". \n\n        But note: the problem says that the error is defined by the merging (overlap). So if there was no error, we would have two copies concatenated without merging. \n\n        However, the problem states: \"Analogously, simple concatenation (without error) is not considered an error.\"\n\n        Therefore, if the entire string is the simple concatenation (without overlap) then it is not an error. \n\n        But wait, the example input \"acacacaca\" is the simple concatenation of two copies of \"acaca\", so it",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap (as per the problem's error condition). The overlap must be positive and less than the length of `s`. If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking two copies of `s` and merging them at their overlapping parts. Specifically, `t` should be `s + s[k:]`, where `k` is the length of the overlap (1 ≤ k < len(s)).\n2. **Insight**: For each possible length `m` of `s`, we check if there exists an overlap `k` such that `t` can be split into `s` (the first `m` characters) and the remaining part (from position `m` to the end) matches `s[k:]`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over possible lengths `m` of `s` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `t`). For each `m`, compute `k = 2*m - n`. If `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k < m), check if the substring `t[m:]` equals `t[k:m]`. If found, `s` is `t[0:m]`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks up to `n` possible values of `m`, each requiring an O(n) comparison, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n²). Given the constraint `n ≤ 100`, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    for m in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= m:\n            continue\n        if t[m:] == t[k:m]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(t[:m])\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The length `n` of `t` is computed, and `found` is initialized to `False` to track if a valid `s` is found.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `m` of `s` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1`:\n   - **Compute Overlap Length `k`**: `k` is derived as `2*m - n`. If `k` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ k < m), skip to the next iteration.\n   - **Check Substring Equality**: Verify if the substring starting from `m` to the end of `t` matches the substring from `k` to `m` in `t`. If they match, `s` is the first `m` characters of `t`, and we print \"YES\" followed by `s`.\n4. **Output Result**: If no valid `s` is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could result from an error condition by leveraging substring comparisons and careful iteration over potential segment lengths.",
