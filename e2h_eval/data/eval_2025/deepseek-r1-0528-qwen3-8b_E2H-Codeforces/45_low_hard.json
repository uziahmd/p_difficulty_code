There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is knockout. The winner must win all his games. We want the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n The rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n Let's think:\n\n In a knockout tournament with n players, the total number of games is n-1. But the winner does not necessarily play in every game.\n\n However, note that the problem is about arranging the tournament grid so that the winner (player 1) can play as many games as possible, while respecting the condition on the number of games played by the two players in a match.\n\n Observation:\n\n We can model the tournament as a complete binary tree (but not necessarily balanced) and the condition is that the two players in a match must have played almost the same number of games.\n\n Alternatively, consider the following:\n\n Let the winner play k games. Then he must have played k consecutive wins.\n\n But note: the condition says that when two players are going to play, their current number of wins (i.e., games played) must differ by at most one.\n\n We can think of building the tournament bracket in such a way that the winner's opponents are chosen from subtrees that are as large as possible but balanced appropriately.\n\n Another idea: we can use recursion or mathematical formulation.\n\n Let f(n) be the maximum number of games the winner can play in a tournament with n players.\n\n Conditions for the tournament bracket:\n\n In the first round, we can have some matches. But note: the winner must win all his games, so he must be in one half of the bracket.\n\n However, the problem allows us to arrange the entire grid arbitrarily as long as the condition holds.\n\n Consider:\n\n We can break the n players into two groups: one containing the winner and the rest. But note that the winner must face opponents that are winners of their own subtrees.\n\n The condition: when the winner (who has i games) is to face an opponent (who has j games), then |i - j| <= 1.\n\n Since the winner is going to win, the opponent must have won all his previous j games.\n\n How to maximize the total games for the winner?\n\n We can think of the tournament as being built in rounds. The winner must start from the beginning. The condition implies that we can only put the winner against an opponent who has either:\n   - the same number of wins as the winner, OR\n   - one less than the winner.\n\n But note: the winner starts with 0 wins. So the first match: the winner plays someone with 0 wins. Then he has 1 win.\n\n Then the next match: the winner must play someone who has either 1 win or 0 wins. But wait, if there's a player with 0 wins (a first-round bye?) then we can use that? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the initial state. Actually, we can design the entire bracket arbitrarily.\n\n Let's assume we set up the tournament so that the winner gets a favorable schedule.\n\n We can model the tournament as follows:\n\n We want to assign the winner to a path of k wins, and we need to ensure that in each match, the opponent's number of wins is either k-1 (if the winner is about to get his k-th win) or k (if the winner is about to get his (k+1)-th win? Actually, no: the condition is about the number of games already played. So when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has already played k-1 wins. Then the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2? Or wait: let me restate:\n\n When the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has already played k-1 games (all wins). The opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games? Actually, the condition is that the two players (the winner and the opponent) must have numbers of games (wins) that differ by at most one. At the moment of the match, the winner has k-1 wins and the opponent has, say, x wins. Then |(k-1) - x| <= 1.\n\n Therefore, the opponent must have either k-2, k-1, or k wins? But note: the opponent is also a winner of his own subtree. He cannot have more wins than the rounds he has won. Actually, the opponent must have exactly the same number of wins as the winner (k-1) or one less (k-2) because if he had k wins, then the winner (with k-1) would have a difference of 1, which is allowed? Actually, the condition is |a - b| <= 1, so both k-2 and k are allowed? But wait: if the opponent has k",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if their number of previous games differs by at most one. The solution involves understanding the tournament structure and leveraging mathematical insights to compute the result efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is a knockout format, meaning each player must win all their matches to continue. The key constraint is that when two players compete, their previous game counts must differ by no more than one. The goal is to maximize the number of games the winner plays under these conditions.\n2. **Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the sum of a geometric series \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{k-1} \\) is less than or equal to \\( n \\). This is because each round the winner participates in, the number of potential opponents doubles, but the constraint limits the total players to \\( 2^k - 1 \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the highest power of 2 such that the sum of the series up to that power does not exceed \\( n \\). This can be efficiently computed using logarithmic functions to avoid brute-force methods, especially important given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    k = 0\n    total = 0\n    while total < n:\n        k += 1\n        total = (1 << k) - 1\n        \n    games = k\n    while (1 << (games + 1)) - 1 < n:\n        games += 1\n        \n    print(games)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If there are only 2 players, the winner plays exactly 1 game.\n2. **Finding Maximum Rounds**: The loop calculates the maximum number of rounds \\( k \\) where the total number of players in a balanced tournament (sum of \\( 2^0 \\) to \\( 2^{k-1} \\)) is less than or equal to \\( n \\). This is done using bit shifting for efficiency.\n3. **Adjusting for Larger \\( n \\)**: If \\( n \\) exceeds the total players for \\( k \\) rounds, the solution increments \\( k \\) until the total players required for \\( k \\) rounds exceeds \\( n \\), then prints the final \\( k \\), which represents the maximum games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging mathematical properties of exponents and bit operations, ensuring optimal performance even for very large \\( n \\).",
