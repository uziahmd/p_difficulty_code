After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. We need to find for each subject the maximum mark. Then, for each student, if in at least one subject they have the maximum mark (and note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum mark, so they are all considered best in that subject) then the student is successful.\n\n However, note: The problem states \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark\". So even if multiple students have the same highest mark, they are all best.\n\n Approach:\n - Read n and m.\n - Read the next n lines (each is a string of m characters)\n\n We can do:\n   Let's create a list of lists (or just keep the marks as a grid) and also we can precompute for each subject (column) the maximum mark.\n\n But note: the input format: first line is two integers, then n lines of strings.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n Steps:\n   n=3, m=3\n   Grid:\n        [['2','2','3'],\n         ['2','3','2'],\n         ['1','1','2']]\n\n   For subject 0: max is '3' (from first and second row? Actually, wait: first row has '2','2','3' -> third element is '3', but wait, the example says:\n        student 1: first row -> 2,2,3\n        student 2: second row -> 2,3,2\n        student 3: third row -> 1,1,2\n\n   So for subject 0 (first column): marks are [2,2,1] -> max is 2.\n   For subject 1 (second column): [2,3,1] -> max is 3.\n   For subject 2 (third column): [3,2,2] -> max is 3.\n\n   Now, which students are best?\n      Subject0: any student with mark '2' -> student1 (index0) and student2 (index1) have '2'. Student3 has '1' -> not best.\n      Subject1: only student2 (index1) has '3'.\n      Subject2: student1 (index0) has '3', and student2 (index1) has '2', student3 (index2) has '2'. So only student1 is best in subject2.\n\n   Now, check each student:\n      Student0: has marks [2,2,3]. In subject0: 2 (which is max) -> so best in subject0. In subject1: 2 < 3 -> not best. In subject2: 3 (max) -> best. So student0 is successful because he is best in at least one subject (actually two).\n      Student1: [2,3,2]. In subject0: 2 (best). In subject1: 3 (best). In subject2: 2 (not best). So student1 is successful.\n      Student2: [1,1,2]. In subject0: 1 < 2 -> not best. In subject1: 1 < 3 -> not best. In subject2: 2 < 3 -> not best. So student2 is not successful.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\n   However, the example output is 2.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a string: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n        Output: 3\n\n   Let me break down the second example:\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        Grid:\n            ['91728']\n            ['11828']\n            ['11111']\n\n        We'll compute the maximum for each subject (each column):\n\n        Subject0: [9,1,1] -> max=9\n        Subject1: [1,1,1] -> max=1\n        Subject2: [7,8,1] -> max=8\n        Subject3: [2,2,1] -> max=2\n        Subject4: [8,8,1] -> max=8\n\n        Now, for each student:\n\n        Student0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n            subject0: 9 == max -> best\n            subject1: 1 == max -> best\n            subject2: 7 <8 -> not best\n            subject3: 2 == max -> best\n            subject4: 8 == max -> best\n\n            So student0 is successful.\n\n        Student1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n            subject0: 1 <9 -> not\n            subject1: 1==1 -> best\n            subject2: 8==8 -> best\n            subject3: 2==2 -> best\n            subject4: 8==8 -> best\n\n            So student1 is successful.\n\n        Student2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n            subject0: 1<9 -> not\n            subject1: 1==1 -> best\n            subject2: 1<8 -> not\n            subject3: 1<2 -> not\n            subject4: 1<8 -> not\n\n            But wait: subject1 has max 1, so student2 has 1 -> best in subject1. So student2 is successful.\n\n        Therefore, all three are successful -> output 3.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse the input.\n        first_line = input().split() -> gives [n_str, m_str] then convert to int.\n\n   Step 2: Read the next n lines.\n\n   Step 3: Precompute the maximum for each subject (column).\n\n        Let grid = [ list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n) ]\n\n        Then, for j in range(m):\n            col_max[j] = max( grid[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\n        But note: the marks are characters, but since they are single digits, we can compare by character because '1'<'2' etc.\n\n   Step 4: For each student i, check for any subject j such that grid[i][j] == col_max[j]. If at least one exists, then count this student as successful.\n\n   Step 5: Print the count.\n\n However, note: what if the maximum appears multiple times? That's handled because we are comparing each student's mark to the precomputed maximum.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: the input may have leading/trailing spaces? The problem says: \"each containing m characters\", and the example does not have spaces. We use strip() to remove any accidental spaces.\n\n However, the example input is given as a string that includes the newline. So we read each line and then strip.\n\n Example input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\" -> we split the first line by space, then read the next three lines.\n\n Code:\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if not data: \n        n, m = 0,0\n   else:\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        n = int(first_line[0])\n        m = int(first_line[1])\n\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(1, 1+n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n\n   But wait, the grid must have n rows and each row has m characters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read until we have n lines.\n\n   Since the problem says the first line contains n and m, then n lines, we can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   But note: the input might be provided as a single string (like in the example) but the problem says standard input.\n\n   Let's assume we are reading from standard input.\n\n   However, the problem says the input format exactly as described.\n\n   So, we can write:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            grid.append(data[i].strip())\n\n   But note: what if the input has more than n+1 lines? The problem says the next n lines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the entire input and take the first line and then the next n lines.\n\n   However, the problem says: the first input line ... then n lines.\n\n   So, let's use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a string that has newlines. In competitive programming, we usually read from stdin line by line.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify huge inputs (n, m <= 100), we can use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   This should work.\n\n   Let's test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        Input: \n            \"3 3\"\n            \"223\"\n            \"232\"\n            \"112\"\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \n                \"3 5\"\n                \"91728\"\n                \"11828\"\n                \"11111\"\n\n   Now, code accordingly.\n\n   Edge case: when n=0 or m=0? The problem states n,m>=1.\n\n   So, we can proceed.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Precompute column maximums\n        col_max = [0] * m   # we will store the maximum for each column (as a character)\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_val = grid[0][j]\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if grid[i][j] > max_val:\n                    max_val = grid[i][j]\n            col_max[j] = max_val\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the first example:\n\n        grid = ['223', '232', '112']\n        col_max for j=0: \n            start with '2' (from first row), then compare with second row: '2' -> same, then third row: '1' -> so max is '2'\n        j=1: \n            start with '2', then second row '3' -> update to '3', then third row '1' -> remains '3'\n        j=2:\n            start with '3', then second row '2' -> no change, then third row '2' -> no change -> '3'\n\n        Then for each student:\n          i=0: ['2','2','3']\n            j0: '2' == col_max[0] ('2') -> successful -> count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n          i=1: ['2','3','2']\n            j0: '2'=='2' -> successful -> count becomes 2\n          i=2: ['1','1','2']\n            j0: '1' != '2'\n            j1: '1' != '3'\n            j2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n        Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n   Second example:\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        col_max:\n          j0: max('9','1','1') -> '9'\n          j1: max('1','1','1') -> '1'\n          j2: max('7','8','1') -> '8'\n          j3: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n          j4: max('8','8','1') -> '8'\n\n        Then for each student:\n          i0: ['9','1','7','2','8']\n            j0: '9'=='9' -> successful -> count=1\n          i1: ['1','1','8','2','8']\n            j0: '1' != '9'\n            j1: '1'=='1' -> successful -> count=2\n          i2: ['1','1','1','1','1']\n            j0: '1' != '9'\n            j1: '1'=='1' -> successful -> count=3\n\n        Output: 3 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so we don't have to worry about other characters.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the input example was given as a string that included the newline. Our reading method uses input(), which handles that.\n\n   We'll write the code without additional libraries (except sys if needed, but here we don't need sys because we are using input().\n\n   However, the problem says to read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            # It's possible that the input line has less than m characters? The problem says each row has m characters.\n            # But we assume it's correct.\n            grid.append(s)\n\n        # Precompute column maximums\n        col_max = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_char = grid[0][j]\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if grid[i][j] > max_char:\n                    max_char = grid[i][j]\n            col_max[j] = max_char\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But wait, the above counts the first successful subject for a student and breaks, then moves to next student.\n\n   However, note: we don't need to break if we are counting the student if at least one subject is successful. The above code breaks the inner loop and then increments the count by one per student.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n\n   But the above code is equivalent.\n\n   Let me run the first example again with the alternative:\n\n        i0: found becomes True -> count=1\n        i1: found becomes True -> count=2\n        i2: found remains False -> count=2\n\n   So same result.\n\n   But note: the above code I wrote initially used a nested loop and then a flag. The version I just wrote without the flag is also clear.\n\n   We'll use the version with the flag for clarity.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input can be up to 100x100, so the worst-case is 100*100=10000 comparisons, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's submit the code.\n\n   But wait, there is an alternative: we can use list comprehensions and the any() function.\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if any(grid[i][j] == col_max[j] for j in range(m)):\n                count += 1\n\n   But that is essentially the same.\n\n   We'll stick to the clear version.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are no subjects, then we don't have to do anything, but n,m>=1 so safe.\n        col_max = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the list comprehension for col_max. However, the initial way is also efficient.\n\n   But note: the max function over a list of n elements for each j: total operations n*m, which is 100*100=10000, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, the first method I wrote with nested loops for columns is also O(n*m). \n\n   Let me use the list comprehension for col_max for conciseness.\n\n   But wait: the grid is stored as list of strings, so grid[i][j] is a character. The max function compares characters lexicographically, which for digits from '1' to '9' is the same as numeric order.\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n   But note: the grid is built from input().strip(), which returns a string. Each string has length m.\n\n   Let me test with the first example:\n\n        col_max = [ max( grid[i][0] for i in range(n) ) for j in range(m) ] -> wait, no.\n\n   Correction: for each j, we want the maximum over i for grid[i][j]. The above list comprehension for col_max:\n\n        col_max = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n   But wait, the inner part: for j in range(m): we are iterating j, and for each j we take max over i in [0, n-1] of grid[i][j].\n\n   However, note: we cannot do that because the inner expression must be independent of j? Actually, no: we are building a list for j from 0 to m-1, and for each j we compute the maximum over the column j.\n\n   But wait, the expression inside the max is grid[i][j] for i in range(n). But j is fixed in the outer loop. However, the inner expression uses j from the outer loop? Actually, no: the list comprehension for j in range(m) will use the current j in the inner part.\n\n   But the inner part is:\n\n        max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n   and j is the current value from the outer loop. However, the problem is that the inner part is evaluated after the j is set. But wait, the inner part doesn't use the outer j? Actually, no: in the inner part, j is defined from the outer loop. But wait, the inner part is a generator expression that uses the variable j from the outer scope. However, in Python, the variable j in the inner part is the last assigned value from the outer loop. This is a well-known issue.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        col_max = [max(col[j] for col in grid) for j in range(m)]\n\n   But that is the same as:\n\n        col_max = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [col_j for col_j in (row[j] for row in grid)]\n            col_max.append(max(col))\n\n   But that is essentially the same as the previous method.\n\n   However, the original method I did in the step-by-step was:\n\n        col_max = [0]*m\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_val = grid[0][j]\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if grid[i][j] > max_val:\n                    max_val = grid[i][j]\n            col_max[j] = max_val\n\n   This is safe and efficient.\n\n   But the list comprehension with nested loops might be confusing and also inefficient because the inner generator expression runs for each j, and we are iterating j from 0 to m-1, and for each j we iterate through n elements.\n\n   Actually, the list comprehension:\n\n        col_max = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n   would be equivalent to:\n\n        col_max = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            # Create a generator expression for i from 0 to n-1: for each i, grid[i][j]\n            col_max.append(max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)))\n\n   This is correct and works because for each j, we consider all the i-th row's j-th character.\n\n   However, the issue is that in the inner generator expression, the variable j is the same j from the outer loop? Actually, no: the outer loop defines j, but the inner expression uses the same j. And since the inner expression is evaluated for the current j, it is correct.\n\n   But wait, in the list comprehension, the outer j is bound to the value from the range, and then the inner expression uses that j. So it is correct.\n\n   However, let me test with a small example:\n\n        grid = ['223','232','112']\n        j=0: \n            max(grid[i][0] for i in [0,1,2]) -> [grid[0][0]='2', grid[1][0]='2', grid[2][0]='1'] -> max is '2'\n        j=1:\n            [grid[0][1]='2', grid[1][1]='3', grid[2][1]='1'] -> max is '3'\n        j=2:\n            [grid[0][2]='3', grid[1][2]='2', grid[2][2]='2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But note: the grid is stored as list of strings, and we are indexing with integers. This is okay.\n\n   However, the problem says the input is from stdin, and we are reading with input().strip(). This gives a string of length m.\n\n   So we can use either method.\n\n   Considering clarity and avoiding confusion, I choose the explicit nested loop for columns.\n\n   But the list comprehension is more concise.\n\n   Let me write the code with list comprehension for col_max.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints are small, so both are acceptable.\n\n   We'll go with:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Compute column maximums for each j in [0, m-1]\n        col_max = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This should be acceptable.\n\n   But note: the performance is the same.\n\n   Let me run the second example:\n\n        grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        col_max[0] = max('9','1','1') -> '9'\n        col_max[1] = max('1','1','1') -> '1'\n        col_max[2] = max('7','8','1') -> '8'\n        col_max[3] = max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n        col_max[4] = max('8','8','1') -> '8'\n\n   Then the rest is the same.\n\n   However, one more edge: what if the grid is empty? But n>=1, so no.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input is from standard input. We are using input(), which is safe for the constraints.\n\n   However, there is a possibility that the input is given in a single line? The problem says the first line contains two integers, then n lines. So we must read the first line separately.\n\n   Our code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   This reads the first line, then the next n lines.\n\n   But if the input is provided in a file or via pipe, it should work.\n\n   Let me test with the example input as a single string:\n\n        Input string: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n        When we run:\n\n            $ echo \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\" | python3 solution.py\n\n        The first input() reads \"3 3\", then the next four input() calls: \n            first: \"223\"\n            second: \"232\"\n            third: \"112\"\n            fourth: raises EOFError?\n\n        Wait, no: we are reading n=3, then we read 3 lines.\n\n        The code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        This reads the first line, then the next 3 lines.\n\n        The example input has 4 lines: the first line and then 3 lines. So it matches.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the first line contains two integers, so the first input() is necessary.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are no subjects, then m=0, but n>=1, m>=1 so we don't handle m=0.\n\n        # Calculate the maximum for each column j\n        col_max = [max(row[j] for row in grid) for j in range(m)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Or without the flag:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        col_max = [max(row[j] for row in grid) for j in range(m)]\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n        print(count)\n\n   I prefer the latter for brevity.\n\n   Let me run the code in my head for the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        grid = ['223','232','112']\n        col_max = [ max(['2','2','1']), max(['2','3','1']), max(['3','2','2']) ] -> ['2','3','3']\n\n        Then for each student:\n            student0: '2' in col0 matches '2' -> count=1, break.\n            student1: '2' in col0 matches '2' -> count=2, break.\n            student2: no match -> count remains 2.\n\n   Example 2: \n        grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n        col_max = ['9','1','8','2','8']\n\n        student0: '9' matches -> count=1\n        student1: '1' in col0 doesn't, but '1' in col1 matches -> count=2\n        student2: '1' in col0 doesn't, but '1' in col1 matches -> count=3\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   We'll write the final code accordingly.\n\n   One more thing: what if a student has the maximum mark in multiple columns? We break at the first one, but that's okay because we only need one.\n\n   So the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks in m subjects.\n2. **Column Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column), compute the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps identify the best marks in each subject.\n3. **Success Check**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: Count the number of students who meet the success criterion and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ncol_max = [max(row[j] for row in grid) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if grid[i][j] == col_max[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The first line of input is split into two integers, n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent n lines are read as strings, each representing a student's marks.\n2. **Column Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column index j), the maximum mark across all students is determined by comparing each student's mark in that subject. This is stored in an array `col_max`.\n3. **Success Check**: For each student (row i), iterate through each subject (column j). If the student's mark matches the highest mark (`col_max[j]`) in any subject, increment the success count and break out of the loop for that student (since only one successful subject is needed).\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is feasible given the constraints (n and m are at most 100).",
