Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street [0, l] is lit.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider that the street has two ends: from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l.\n 3. The idea is to cover the gaps between the lanterns and the ends.\n\n How?\n - The entire street must be covered by the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d].\n - We can think of the problem as having two types of gaps:\n    a) The gap at the beginning: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to some point.\n        The required d for the first lantern to cover the beginning is at least (first_lantern - 0) / 2? \n        Actually, if the first lantern is at position x, then to cover 0, we require d >= (x - 0)/2? But wait, the lantern covers [x-d, x+d]. \n        To cover 0, we require x-d <= 0 -> d >= x. However, note: actually the condition for 0 to be covered is that there exists a lantern within d from 0. \n        So the leftmost requirement: the first lantern must extend to the left until 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is 'first'. So we require d >= first/2? Not exactly.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We want to cover [0, l]. The lanterns are at positions a0, a1, ... , a_{n-1} (sorted).\n\n Conditions:\n   - The leftmost point 0 must be within d of some lantern (the first one). So we need d >= a0 (if we only use the first lantern) but wait: actually the first lantern must cover from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. However, if there are multiple lanterns, we might not rely solely on the first one? Actually, the entire street must be covered. \n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n 1. The first segment: from 0 to the first lantern (at a0). The light must reach from 0 to a0. The lantern at a0 must have d at least (a0 - 0) / 1? Actually, the coverage of the first lantern extends to the left until a0-d. We require that the leftmost point 0 is covered, so d must be at least a0 (if we set d = a0, then the lantern at a0 covers from 0 to 2*a0). But wait: maybe we don't need to cover beyond a0 with that same lantern? Actually, we need to cover the entire street. We can consider:\n\n We'll traverse the sorted lanterns and check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Sort the lanterns.\n 2. The entire street is from 0 to l. We need to cover from 0 to l.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let d_min = 0\n\n Consider the gaps:\n\n  a) Before the first lantern: the gap from 0 to a0. The required d for the first lantern to cover the left part of this gap is (a0 - 0) / 2? Actually, no. Because the first lantern is at a0. To cover 0, we need d >= a0 (so that the left side of the first lantern goes to a0-d <= 0). But wait, what if there is another lantern? Actually, we are going to set the same d for all.\n\n However, note: the entire street must be lit by the same d. So:\n\n  Condition 1: The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The leftmost point 0 must be within d of a0: i.e., a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0.\n\n  Condition 2: Similarly, the last lantern must cover the end: l must be within d of the last lantern (at a_{n-1}), so a_{n-1} + d >= l -> d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\n  Condition 3: For the gaps between lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap is from a_i to a_{i+1}. The entire gap must be covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The maximum gap that needs to be covered in between is (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2. Why? Because the left lantern covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d. To avoid a gap",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points along a street of length \\( l \\) are covered by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points on the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from its position. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street.\n2. **Check Street Ends**: The street starts at point 0 and ends at point \\( l \\). The maximum distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0) and from the last lantern to the end of the street (\\( l \\)) must be considered. The required \\( d \\) for these segments is the distance from the first lantern to 0 and from the last lantern to \\( l \\), respectively.\n3. **Analyze Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by the combined light from both lanterns. The required \\( d \\) for covering the gap between two consecutive lanterns at positions \\( a_i \\) and \\( a_{i+1} \\) is half the distance between them, i.e., \\( (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 \\).\n4. **Determine Minimum \\( d \\)**: The minimal \\( d \\) required to cover the entire street is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the street ends and the gaps between lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    positions.sort()\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l / 2.0))\n        return\n        \n    # Check the left end (from 0 to the first lantern)\n    first_gap = positions[0] - 0\n    if first_gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = first_gap\n        \n    # Check the right end (from the last lantern to l)\n    last_gap = l - positions[-1]\n    if last_gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = last_gap\n        \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap_between = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        required_d_for_gap = gap_between / 2.0\n        if required_d_for_gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = required_d_for_gap\n            \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_gap))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns \\( n \\), the street length \\( l \\), and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the analysis of gaps between them and the street ends.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no lanterns, the solution defaults to lighting the entire street with a radius \\( d \\) equal to half the street length.\n4. **Calculating Gaps**:\n   - **Left End Gap**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - **Right End Gap**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (\\( l \\)).\n   - **Consecutive Lanterns Gap**: The distance between two consecutive lanterns divided by 2, representing the minimal \\( d \\) needed to cover the gap between them without overlapping coverage.\n5. **Output**: The maximum value among all calculated gaps is printed as the minimal \\( d \\) required to light the entire street, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all parts of the street are covered by the minimal light radius \\( d \\) by leveraging sorting and systematic gap analysis.",
