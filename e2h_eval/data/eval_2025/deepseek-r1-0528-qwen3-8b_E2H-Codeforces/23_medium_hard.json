In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (minimum is 0) and we want to form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu). We can draw any tile as many times as we want.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have three tiles. Let the tiles be represented as a list of two-character strings: [digit, suit]\n\n 2. We can consider two types of mentsu: koutsu (triplet) and shuntsu (sequence).\n\n 3. Since we can draw any tiles, we can consider:\n    - If we already have a mentsu (either triplet or sequence), then we need 0 draws.\n    - Otherwise, we might be able to form a mentsu by drawing 1 or 2 tiles.\n\n 4. How to approach?\n\n We note that with 3 tiles, we can try to see if we have:\n   a) Three identical tiles -> koutsu.\n   b) Three consecutive numbers in the same suit -> shuntsu.\n\n But note: there might be duplicate tiles. For example, [1m, 1m, 2m] is not a shuntsu, but if we draw one more 1m we get a koutsu? Actually, wait: we are allowed to draw any tiles, so we can complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n However, note that the hand has exactly three tiles initially, and we can draw up to (n-3) tiles. We want the minimum number of draws.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Case 0: Already a mentsu (0 draws)\n\n Case 1: With 1 draw, we can form a mentsu?\n    - To form a koutsu: if we have two identical tiles, then we can draw one more to make a triplet.\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> draw one 1m: [1m,1m,1m] (koutsu)\n        But note: what if we have [1m, 1m, 1m]? Then we have a triplet already (so 0 draws) so we don't need to consider this for 1 draw.\n\n    - To form a shuntsu: \n        Consider two possibilities: \n          Option 1: The three tiles are almost a sequence. \n          Example: [1m, 2m, 2m]: we can draw a 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (shuntsu) OR we can draw a 1m to form [1m,2m,2m] doesn't help for sequence, but wait: we have two 2m. We need three consecutive. So we can also think: \n          Actually, we can have:\n            [x, y, z] and if they are not the same suit, then we cannot form a shuntsu by one draw (unless we change the suit? but note: we can only form a shuntsu in the same suit). \n\n        Conditions for shuntsu with one draw:\n          - They must be in the same suit. \n          - The three numbers must be such that with one additional tile we can form a consecutive set.\n\n        How can one draw form a shuntsu?\n          We have three tiles. We can draw one tile. Then we have four tiles. We need to check if we can form one mentsu from these four? Actually, no: the problem says we must have at least one mentsu in our hand. But note: we don't have to use all the tiles. However, the definition of mentsu is a triplet or a sequence. \n\n        Actually, we are forming a mentsu (a triplet or sequence) from the hand. We are allowed to have extra tiles. But note: we are only concerned with the minimum number of draws so that we can win (i.e., having at least one mentsu). \n\n        However, the problem states: \"she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand\". So we don't necessarily need to use all the tiles.\n\n        But note: the hand after drawing may have more than three tiles. We can pick any three tiles to form a mentsu.\n\n        So for 1 draw: we can form a mentsu if:\n          a) There exists a triplet: meaning we have two of the same tile and we can complete the triplet by drawing one more. OR\n          b) There exists a sequence: meaning we have two tiles that are part of a sequence and the third tile is not needed? Actually, let's break down:\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n        After drawing one tile, we have four tiles. But we don't need to use all. We just need one mentsu (three tiles) to appear.\n\n        However, note: we can also form a triplet by drawing one tile if we have two of a kind. Similarly, we can form a sequence by drawing one tile if we have two consecutive numbers in the same suit and the third tile is either the missing one or an extra that doesn't break the sequence? Actually, no: because we are allowed to pick any three tiles.\n\n        Let me reframe: We are going to form a mentsu (triplet or sequence) from the entire hand (after drawing). But note: we are allowed to have duplicates and multiple suits.\n\n        However, the problem does not require to use all the tiles, so we can choose three tiles that form a mentsu.\n\n        So for 1 draw:\n\n          Option 1: Form a triplet. Condition: We have at least two of a tile. Then we can draw one more to complete the triplet.\n\n          Option 2: Form a sequence. Condition: In the same suit, we have two consecutive numbers and we can draw the third one to complete the sequence. Also, we might have three tiles that are two apart? Actually, no: a sequence requires three consecutive numbers.\n\n          Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we can draw a 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (using the two existing and the drawn one). But note: we have three tiles originally. After drawing one, we have four. Then we can pick [1m,2m,3m] to form the sequence.\n\n          Another possibility: [1m, 3m, 4m] -> we can draw a 2m to form [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, we have 1m,3m,4m and then we draw 2m, then we can form [1m,2m,3m] and ignore the 4m). Similarly, [2m,3m,4m] is already a sequence (so 0 draws) but if we have [2m,3m,4m] and then we draw one, we don't need it. \n\n          But wait: we are only drawing one tile. So we are adding one tile to the hand. Then we must check if there exists a triplet or a sequence in the four tiles.\n\n          Actually, we can break down the hand (with four tiles) and check for any triplet or sequence. However, we are trying to minimize the number of draws.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think:\n\n        With 0 draws: check if we have a triplet or a sequence.\n\n        With 1 draw: we can draw any tile. We want to know if there exists a tile such that in the hand of four tiles, we can find a triplet or a sequence (any three tiles that form a mentsu).\n\n        Similarly, with 2 draws: we can draw two tiles and then we can form a triplet (if we have one pair, then we draw two more to complete a triplet? Actually, if we have one pair, then one draw is enough for triplet. So two draws would be for other cases.\n\n        However, note: we might form two different mentsu? But we only need one.\n\n        Let's consider the cases:\n\n        Case 0: 0 draws.\n\n        Case 1: 1 draw.\n\n        Case 2: 2 draws.\n\n        Case 3: 3 draws? Actually, we can always form a triplet by drawing three copies of a tile (if we have at least one copy). So maximum draws needed is 3? But wait: we can form a triplet from scratch by drawing three copies of a tile. However, we might already have some tiles. \n\n        Actually, we can also form a sequence by drawing two tiles? \n\n        But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing three tiles (if we have zero of a kind) or two tiles (if we have one of a kind). \n\n        However, we are to find the minimum.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We are allowed to draw any tiles. We want to know the minimum number of draws so that we can form at least one mentsu (triplet or sequence) from the hand.\n\n        We can consider:\n\n        Possibility 1: We use the existing tiles to form a triplet or a sequence.\n\n        Possibility 2: We use the existing tiles and some of the drawn ones.\n\n        How about grouping by suit and value.\n\n        Let's represent each tile as (suit, number). We can count frequencies and group by suit.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Check for 0 draws.\n\n          - Check for triplet: if any tile appears three times? (Note: the hand has three tiles, so if we have three same, then yes)\n          - Check for shuntsu: if there exists a suit that has at least three distinct numbers that form a consecutive sequence (like n, n+1, n+2) and note that the numbers must be between 1 and 9.\n\n        Step 2: Check for 1 draw.\n\n          Option A: Drawing to complete a triplet.\n\n            We can look for a tile that appears at least twice. Then we can draw one more of that tile to complete the triplet.\n\n            But note: if we have two of a tile, then we can complete the triplet by one draw. However, we might have two different pairs? Then we can complete one of them.\n\n            However, we don't require the entire hand to be used. We can also form a triplet from two existing and one drawn.\n\n          Option B: Drawing to complete a shuntsu.\n\n            We need to have two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive, and then we can draw the next one (or the previous one) to complete the sequence.\n\n            Example: [1m, 2m] and a third tile that is not 3m. Then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. But note: we have three tiles. The three tiles might be [1m, 2m, x] (where x is not 3m). Then we can draw 3m to form the sequence from the three tiles? Actually, we are allowed to choose any three from the four. So we can choose [1m,2m,3m] and ignore x.\n\n            Similarly, [1m, 3m, 4m] and we can draw 2m to form the sequence [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m) or [2m,3m,4m] (ignoring 1m). But wait: [1m,3m,4m] with drawing 2m gives [1m,3m,4m,2m]. Now we can form [1m,2m,3m] (using 1m,2m,3m) OR [2m,3m,4m] (using 2m,3m,4m). So that's two possibilities.\n\n            Conditions for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n              - We must have at least two tiles in the same suit, and the numbers of these two tiles must be consecutive or differ by 1, and then the third tile can be anything (but we are going to ignore two of the tiles). Actually, we can use two of the tiles and the drawn one to form a sequence, so the two tiles must be consecutive and the drawn tile will be the missing one.\n\n              - Alternatively, we might have two tiles that are consecutive and we draw the middle one? Actually, no: the sequence must be three consecutive. The two tiles must be two consecutive numbers (like n and n+1) and then we draw n+2 (to complete n, n+1, n+2) OR n-1 (to complete n-1, n, n+1). But wait: if we have [2m,3m] then we can draw 1m to complete [1m,2m,3m] or 4m to complete [2m,3m,4m].\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. The two tiles we use for the sequence must be in the same suit and consecutive. The third tile can be from a different suit or same suit but not breaking the consecutive condition? Actually, we don't care about the third tile because we can ignore it.\n\n            But wait: we must have at least two tiles in the same suit and consecutive? And the third tile can be arbitrary.\n\n            However, we must check: the hand has three tiles. We are going to draw one. Then we have four. Then we need to check if there exists a sequence (three consecutive in the same suit). \n\n            How to check for one-draw shuntsu?\n\n            Let the tiles be T1, T2, T3.\n\n            We can consider:\n\n            For each suit, we can extract the numbers and sort them.\n\n            Then, for each suit, we can check for consecutive sequences of length 3 that can be completed by one draw.\n\n            But note: we might have multiple suits. \n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate over all possible draws (there are 27 types: 9 numbers * 3 suits) and check if by adding that tile we can form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence). Then take the minimum.\n\n            However, since the hand is small (initially three tiles) and the number of suits is fixed (3), we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Check 0 draws.\n\n            Step 2: Check 1 draw: for each possible tile (from '1m','2m',...,'9m','1p','2p',...,'9p','1s','2s',...,'9s'), add that tile to the hand and check if there exists a triplet or a sequence (any three tiles that form a mentsu). Then remove that tile and continue.\n\n            But note: the problem allows drawing any tile arbitrarily. So we can simulate drawing one tile and then checking the entire hand (which now has four tiles) for the existence of a mentsu.\n\n            However, we don't need to check every possibility if we can deduce logically.\n\n            But the total possibilities for one draw is 27, and then we check a hand of four tiles. How to check a hand of four tiles for containing at least one mentsu?\n\n            Conditions for a hand (list of tiles) to have a mentsu:\n\n            - A triplet: any tile repeated at least three times.\n\n            - A shuntsu: any three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n            But note: we can have multiple tiles and we are allowed to choose any three.\n\n            Steps to check a hand (list of tiles) for containing a mentsu:\n\n              Let hand = list of (suit, num) for each tile.\n\n              We can group by suit.\n\n              For each suit in the hand:\n                Let nums = sorted([int(tile[0]) for tile in hand if tile[1]==suit])\n                Then, check for consecutive triplets in nums? Actually, we don't need to have consecutive triplets in the entire set, but we need to see if there exists three consecutive numbers (allowing duplicates? Actually, no: a sequence requires three distinct numbers? Yes, because the same tile cannot be used twice. But wait: the representation: each tile is distinct by identity? Actually, the problem says: \"all possible suited tiles\" are represented. So if we have two 1m, they are the same tile? \n\n            Clarification: the input is three strings. Each string is two characters. So the hand is three tiles. When we draw, we are adding one more. The tiles are distinct by their representation. But note: [1m,1m,1m] is a valid triplet. So the same tile (same suit and same number) is allowed.\n\n            However, for a sequence, we need three distinct numbers (because the sequence is defined by sequential numbers). So if we have [1m,1m,2m,3m], then we can form the sequence [1m,2m,3m] (using one 1m, one 2m, one 3m). But if we have [1m,1m,2m,2m,3m,3m] then we can form [1m,2m,3m] even though we have duplicates.\n\n            So for checking a hand (multiset of tiles) for a mentsu:\n\n              We can have:\n\n              Triplet: There exists a tile (suit, num) that appears at least three times.\n\n              Sequence: There exists a suit and three distinct numbers n, n+1, n+2 (each between 1 and 9) such that for each number in {n, n+1, n+2}, there is at least one tile of (suit, that number).\n\n            However, note: the hand might have more than three tiles. But we are only concerned with the existence of three tiles (which form a triplet or a sequence). \n\n            So for triplet: we can simply check the frequency of each tile type.\n\n            For sequence: for each suit, we can collect the distinct numbers present. Then for each distinct number, we can check for n, n+1, n+2 being in the distinct numbers for that suit.\n\n            But wait: we might have duplicates. Actually, for sequence, we need one tile for each of the three numbers, so we don't care about duplicates. We just need at least one tile for each of the three numbers.\n\n            So algorithm for checking a hand (list of tiles) for a mentsu:\n\n              Let count = {}  # key: (suit, num) -> count\n              Let suits = {}  # key: suit -> set of numbers (we only need distinct numbers for sequence)\n\n              But wait: for triplet, we need to know the counts. For sequence, we need to know the distinct numbers per suit.\n\n              Steps:\n\n                For each tile in the hand:\n                  Let s = tile[1], num = int(tile[0])\n                  update count[(s, num)] += 1\n\n                # Check for triplet: if any tile type (s, num) has count >= 3, then return True.\n\n                # Check for sequence: for each suit s, let S = set of numbers for that suit (from the hand). Then for each n from 1 to 7 (since n+2 <=9), if n, n+1, n+2 are all in S, then return True.\n\n            However, note: the hand might have more than three tiles, but we are only using three for the mentsu.\n\n            But wait: the problem does not require to use all the tiles, so we can ignore the rest.\n\n            Therefore, the above check (for triplet and sequence) is sufficient.\n\n            However, we must note: the hand might have multiple suits. We are grouping by suit.\n\n        Step 3: Check for 2 draws.\n\n            Similarly, we can draw two tiles and then check if the hand (of five tiles) contains a mentsu.\n\n            But we want the minimum draws.\n\n        However, we can use a BFS-like approach: starting from the initial hand, we consider:\n\n          Level 0: hand of 3 tiles -> check if mentsu exists.\n\n          Level 1: for each possible tile to draw (27 possibilities), we have a hand of 4 tiles -> check if mentsu exists.\n\n          Level 2: for each possible two draws (27*27 possibilities) -> check if mentsu exists.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily, so we can draw the same tile multiple times.\n\n        But the problem asks for the minimum number of draws.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          if level0: answer=0\n          else if level1: answer=1\n          else if level2: answer=2\n          else: answer=3? Actually, we can always form a triplet by drawing three copies of one tile (if we have one copy, then we draw two more; if we have two copies, then we draw one more -> wait, but we already checked level1 for triplet completion. Actually, with two draws we can complete a triplet if we have one copy: draw two more. Or we can form a sequence by drawing two appropriate tiles.\n\n        But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing three tiles (if we have zero copies) then we need three draws.\n\n        However, wait: if we have zero copies of a tile, then to form a triplet we need to draw three of that tile. But we can also form a triplet from two copies? Actually, if we have one copy, then we need two more (two draws). If we have two copies, then one more (one draw). \n\n        Similarly, for a sequence: we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles if we have one consecutive pair and one isolated tile in the same suit? \n\n        Actually, the minimal number of draws is at most 3. Because:\n\n          - With 0,1,2,3 draws we cover all possibilities.\n\n        But wait: is 3 the maximum? Actually, we can always form a triplet by drawing three copies of a tile (even if we have none). So we can always do it in 3 draws. But maybe we can do better.\n\n        However, we are to find the minimum.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Check 0 draws: if yes, return 0.\n\n          Else, check 1 draw: for each of the 27 tiles, check if adding that tile to the hand (so 4 tiles) forms a mentsu.\n\n          Then, if we found one, return 1.\n\n          Else, check 2 draws: we need to check all pairs of draws (including two of the same tile). There are 27*27=729 possibilities. But we can optimize: we don't need to check all if we can deduce.\n\n        However, note: we might be able to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles in a smarter way.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          What are the ways to form a mentsu with 2 draws?\n\n          Option 1: Complete a triplet: \n            - If we have one copy of a tile, we need to draw two more -> two draws.\n            - If we have two copies, then one draw suffices (so we already handled one draw).\n\n          Option 2: Complete a sequence:\n            - We have two non-consecutive tiles in the same suit, and we can draw the two missing ones (or one of the two) to form a sequence? Actually, we need three consecutive. \n\n            Example: [1m, 4m] and two draws: we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] and [4m] is left. But wait, we are allowed to ignore the extra. However, we are adding two tiles so we have five tiles. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] from the original 1m and the two drawn. \n\n            But note: we might have three tiles originally. The hand is [1m,4m,x] (where x is another tile). Then we can draw two tiles: say 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,4m,x,2m,3m]. Then we can form the sequence [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m and x). \n\n            Conditions: We must have two tiles in the same suit that are two apart (like 1m and 4m) and then we draw the two in between (2m and 3m). Or we might have one tile and then we draw two to complete a sequence.\n\n          However, we can also form a triplet by two draws (if we have one copy, we draw two more). \n\n        But note: we already considered one draw. Now for two draws, we can also consider:\n\n          - Forming a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we start with one copy, then two draws completes the triplet).\n          - Forming a sequence by drawing two tiles (if we start with one or two tiles in the same suit that are not consecutive, we draw two to complete the sequence).\n\n        However, we can also consider: what if we have two different pairs? Then we might complete two different triplets? But we only need one.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the hand size is small (only three tiles) and the number of suits is small, we can simulate:\n\n          Step 1: Represent the hand as a multiset (or simply as a list of (suit, num)).\n\n          Step 2: Check for 0 draws.\n\n          Step 3: If not, then for each possible tile (27 options) for one draw, check the hand (size=4) for a mentsu.\n\n          Step 4: If not found, then for each possible two-draw combination (including two same) we check the hand (size=5) for a mentsu.\n\n        But note: we might be able to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles that are not necessarily the same as the existing ones. However, we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily.\n\n        However, the state space for two draws is 27*27 = 729, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: is there a better way?\n\n        Alternatively, we can think:\n\n        What are the conditions that require 2 draws?\n\n        Conditions for 2 draws:\n\n          - To form a triplet: we have one copy of a tile, and we draw two more. (This is independent of the other two tiles.)\n\n          - To form a sequence: \n            Case 1: We have two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive (like n and n+1). Then we can draw two tiles to complete two different sequences? Actually, no: with two draws we can only complete one sequence. But wait: we can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles if we have two tiles that are two apart (like n and n+2). Then we draw n+1 to complete the sequence? Actually, no: we need three consecutive. \n\n            Example: [1m, 3m] and two draws: we can draw 2m and 4m? Then we have [1m,3m,2m,4m] -> then we can form [1m,2m,3m] (if we draw 2m) but wait, we drew two: 2m and 4m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m]. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m). But wait, we only drew two: 2m and 4m. Then we have the sequence [1m,2m,3m] and we ignore the 4m.\n\n            But note: we don't need to use both drawn tiles. So actually, with two draws we can complete a sequence if we have two tiles that are two apart (like 1m and 3m) and then we draw the middle one (2m) and one extra tile (any) is not necessary for the sequence. However, wait: we are only required to have one mentsu. So we can form the sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing one 2m. But then why two draws? \n\n            Let me clarify: we are drawing two tiles. But we don't require that the two drawn tiles are both used. So if we draw two tiles, we can use one of them to complete the sequence and the other one is ignored.\n\n            Therefore, if we can complete a sequence by one draw, then we wouldn't need two draws. So the two-draw case for sequence must be when we cannot complete by one draw, but we can complete by two draws.\n\n            Example: [1m, 4m] (and the third tile is irrelevant). Then to form a sequence, we need to draw 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,4m,2m,3m]. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m]. So two draws.\n\n            Conditions for two-draw sequence:\n\n              - We have two tiles in the same suit: numbers a and b (a < b) and |a-b|>=2. Then we need to draw the two missing numbers in between? Actually, no: we only need one consecutive triplet. So we can draw the two numbers that are consecutive to form a sequence that includes the lower one and the upper one? \n\n              Actually, we can form a sequence that uses the two existing tiles and one of the drawn ones? \n\n              Example: [1m,4m] -> we can draw 2m and 3m. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m) or [2m,3m,4m] (ignoring 1m). So two draws.\n\n              But note: we might have three tiles: [1m,4m,5m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m and 5m). Or we can draw 2m and 6m? Then we can form [4m,5m,6m] (using the 4m,5m and 6m). So two draws.\n\n            However, wait: in the example [1m,4m,5m], we can also draw one tile to complete [4m,5m,6m] (if we draw 6m) -> one draw. So that would be one draw.\n\n            Therefore, the two-draw case for sequence is when we don't have two consecutive numbers in the same suit, and we don't have two numbers that are consecutive to one of the existing ones (so that one draw completes a sequence). \n\n            Actually, we can break down the two-draw sequence:\n\n              We need to form a consecutive triplet (three consecutive numbers) in the same suit. We can use the existing tiles and two drawn tiles.\n\n              Conditions: There exists a suit with at least one tile, and the numbers in that suit are such that the gap between the smallest and the largest is at most 2 (so that we can fill the gaps with two draws). Or if we have two tiles that are separated by 3 or more, then we need to draw the entire segment? \n\n            Actually, we can consider:\n\n              Let S be the set of numbers for a suit (with duplicates, but we only need distinct numbers for forming a sequence? Actually, no: duplicates don't help for forming a sequence (we need distinct consecutive numbers). \n\n            So for a given suit, let D be the distinct numbers.\n\n            Then, to form a consecutive triplet in that suit, we need three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) such that n, n+1, n+2 are all in D ∪ {drawn}. But we are drawing two tiles, so we can add two numbers.\n\n            The minimal requirement is that there is a window of three consecutive numbers that is contained in D ∪ {drawn}. \n\n            Since we can choose any two numbers to draw, we can fill two gaps.\n\n            Example: [1m,4m] (suit m: {1,4}). Then the consecutive triplets that could be formed are:\n              [1,2,3]: we need to draw 2,3 -> two draws.\n              [2,3,4]: we need to draw 2,3 -> two draws.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] (suit m: {1,2,4}). Then we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3 (one draw) or [2,3,4] by drawing 3 (one draw). So we don't need two draws.\n\n            Example: [1m,4m,7m] (suit m: {1,4,7}). Then we can form [1,2,3] (draw 2,3) or [4,5,6] (draw 5,6) or [7,8,9] (draw 8,9). Each requires two draws.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to mix the drawn tiles arbitrarily. However, we are limited to two draws. So we can only fill two missing numbers.\n\n            Therefore, two-draw sequence condition: There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that the intersection of {n, n+1, n+2} with the current distinct numbers of that suit is at least 1, and the number of missing numbers in {n, n+1, n+2} is at most 2. But wait, we are drawing two, so we can fill two. However, we can choose the triplet arbitrarily.\n\n            Actually, we can choose any consecutive triplet (n from 1 to 7). For a given triplet (n, n+1, n+2) and a suit, if the current set of distinct numbers in that suit has k numbers from {n, n+1, n+2}, then we need to draw (3-k) numbers from that triplet. But we are only drawing two, so we can only fix two missing numbers. Therefore, we require 3-k <= 2, i.e., k>=1.\n\n            However, we can choose which triplet to form. So we need to check if there exists a triplet (n, n+1, n+2) and a suit such that the suit has at least one of the three numbers and the two missing numbers are available to draw (we are drawing two, so we can draw two specific numbers). \n\n            But note: we are allowed to draw any two. So if a triplet has one number already, then we need to draw two. If a triplet has two numbers already, then we need to draw one, but then we would have done one draw. \n\n            Therefore, the two-draw sequence condition is: There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that the suit has exactly one of the three numbers, and we draw the other two.\n\n            However, what if the hand has two suits? We can choose a triplet in one suit.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1p','1s'] -> no triplet initially, and no consecutive in the same suit. Then we can draw two tiles to form a triplet? Actually, no: to form a triplet we need three of the same. We can draw two more 1m, then we have [1m,1m,1m,1p,1s]. Then we have a triplet. But wait, that is two draws for a triplet.\n\n            So two-draw triplet condition: if we have at least one copy of a tile, then we can draw two more to complete the triplet.\n\n            Similarly, for sequence: two-draw sequence condition: if we have at least one tile in a suit and we can form a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) by drawing two numbers (so the suit must have at least one of the three numbers) then we can do it in two draws.\n\n            However, note: we might have multiple suits. We can choose any suit.\n\n            Therefore, two-draw conditions:\n\n              Condition A: There exists a tile (suit, num) that appears at least once, and we draw two more of that tile (so we have three in total). Then we have a triplet.\n\n              Condition B: There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that the suit has at least one of the three numbers, and we draw the two missing ones.\n\n            But wait: Condition A is independent of the other tiles, and Condition B requires that the suit has at least one of the three numbers.\n\n            However, Condition A is actually a special case of triplet, and Condition B is for sequence.\n\n            But note: we might have two different suits. We are free to choose.\n\n            However, we must consider: the hand has three tiles. We are drawing two. Then we have five tiles.\n\n            So the plan:\n\n            We'll write a helper function: `has_mensu(hand)` that checks if the hand (list of tiles) has at least one mentsu.\n\n            Then:\n\n            Step 1: Read the three tiles.\n\n            Step 2: Let hand0 = [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\n            Step 3: if has_mensu(hand0): print(0)\n\n            Step 4: Else, for each tile in all_tiles (27 tiles):\n                    hand1 = hand0 + [tile]\n                    if has_mensu(hand1): print(1) and break\n\n            Step 5: Else, for each tile1 in all_tiles:\n                    for each tile2 in all_tiles:\n                        hand2 = hand0 + [tile1, tile2]\n                        if has_mensu(hand2): print(2) and break the loops.\n\n            Step 6: Else, we know that we can always form a triplet by drawing three of one tile. So print(3)\n\n            But wait: is 3 the maximum? Actually, we can form a triplet by drawing three of a tile that we have at least one of. So if we have one copy, we draw two (already covered in two-draw). If we have zero copies, then we draw three. But wait: if we have zero copies of any tile, then we didn't get a two-draw? Actually, we might have zero copies of a tile, but then we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   - The solution involves checking if the initial hand already contains a mentsu (0 draws). If not, we check if adding one tile (1 draw) forms a mentsu. If still not, we check if adding two tiles (2 draws) forms a mentsu. If none of these cases are satisfied, the answer is 3 draws (since drawing three identical tiles will always form a triplet).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triplet Check**: For any tile in the hand, count its occurrences. If any tile appears three times, it's a valid triplet.\n   - **Sequence Check**: For each suit, collect distinct numbers. If there exists three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) in any suit, it's a valid sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Initial Check**: Verify if the hand has a triplet or sequence without any draws.\n   - **One Draw Check**: For each possible tile (27 combinations), add it to the hand and check for a triplet or sequence.\n   - **Two Draws Check**: Similarly, check all combinations of two tiles (729 combinations) added to the hand.\n   - **Fallback**: If no combination of up to two draws works, return 3 (drawing three identical tiles).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Initial Check**: O(1) since the hand size is fixed (3 tiles).\n   - **One Draw Check**: O(27 * (hand size + checks)) ≈ O(27*5) = O(135).\n   - **Two Draws Check**: O(27^2 * (hand size + checks)) ≈ O(729*5) = O(3645).\n   - The overall complexity is manageable due to the small hand size and limited tile combinations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef has_mensu(hand):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    suit_num_set = defaultdict(set)\n    \n    for tile in hand:\n        num_str = tile[0]\n        suit_char = tile[1]\n        count_dict[(suit_char, num_str)] += 1\n        suit_num_set[suit_char].add(num_str)\n    \n    for key in count_dict:\n        if count_dict[key] >= 3:\n            return True\n            \n    for suit, nums in suit_num_set.items():\n        nums_int = sorted(map(int, nums))\n        n = len(nums_int)\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if nums_int[i] + 1 == nums_int[i+1] and nums_int[i+1] + 1 == nums_int[i+2]:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    hand0 = [tile for tile in data]\n    \n    if has_mensu(hand0):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    digits = [str(i) for i in range(1,10)]\n    all_tiles = [d + s for d in digits for s in suits]\n    \n    found = False\n    for tile in all_tiles:\n        hand1 = hand0 + [tile]\n        if has_mensu(hand1):\n            print(1)\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        return\n        \n    for tile1 in all_tiles:\n        for tile2 in all_tiles:\n            hand2 = hand0 + [tile1, tile2]\n            if has_mensu(hand2):\n                print(2)\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        return\n        \n    print(3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **has_mensu Function**: This helper function checks if a given hand contains a mentsu.
