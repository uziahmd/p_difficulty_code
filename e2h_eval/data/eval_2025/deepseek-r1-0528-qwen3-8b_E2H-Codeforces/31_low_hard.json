Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cancel per card is x.\n\n 5. We can think greedily:\n\n   Let target = -S (the amount we need to add)\n\n   Case 1: If target is 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n   Case 2: Otherwise, we need to cover the absolute value of the target by adding cards, but note that we can use both positive and negative.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to just positive or negative. But observe:\n\n     We can use multiple cards. Each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). But note: the sign matters.\n\n   Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n     We have an initial sum S, and we wish to form a sum T = -S (which might be positive or negative) by adding as few cards as possible, with each card being in [-x, x].\n\n   Since we can choose any integers in the range, we can use:\n\n     Let d = abs(T) (if T is negative, we can consider using positive cards and vice versa, but actually we can flip the signs arbitrarily).\n\n   However, note: we can also use both positive and negative cards arbitrarily. But the key is: we are trying to minimize the number of cards.\n\n   This is similar to the classic coin problem but with coins of denominations from -x to x (excluding 0? no, including 0) but wait, we can use 0 too, but using 0 doesn't help.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x, so we have all integers in that range. Then we can think of it as: we want to represent the number T (which is an integer) as a linear combination of integers in the set {-x, -x+1, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., x} with nonnegative coefficients (each card used once, and we can use the same value multiple times? yes, because we have infinitely many cards).\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to use any number of cards, and the same card value can be used multiple times.\n\n   But note: the problem is symmetric. We can also consider: what is the minimum number of cards to achieve a total of T?\n\n   Conditions: \n      Each card i: a_i ∈ [-x, x] (integers)\n\n   We want to minimize k (number of cards) such that there exist integers a_1, a_2, ... a_k with each |a_i|<=x and sum(a_i) = T.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the minimal k must satisfy:\n\n      |T| <= k*x   (because the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x)\n\n   But is this condition sufficient? Not exactly, because we can also use negative numbers. Actually, we can achieve any integer T' such that |T'| <= k*x and T' has the same parity as T if we were restricted to even steps? Wait, no: we can use any integer in [-x, x], so we can change by any integer step of size up to x.\n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n      We are allowed to choose any integer from -x to x. So the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers S such that:\n\n          -k*x <= S <= k*x\n\n      But wait, is that true? \n\n        For example, k=1: then we can get any integer from -x to x.\n\n        For k=2: we can get any integer from -2x to 2x? Not exactly: for example, if x=2, then with two cards we can get from -4 to 4, but can we get every integer in between?\n          Yes, because we can choose two consecutive integers. Actually, with two cards, we can get every integer from -4 to 4 (if x=2). Why?\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. Each card can have any integer value from -x to x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target**: The target sum needed is the negative of the current sum (i.e., if the current sum is S, the target is -S).\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target, the minimum number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the target divided by x. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    target = -total_sum\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = abs(target) / x\n    result = (k // 1) if k % 1 == 0 else (k // 1) + 1\n    \n    print(int(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum needed to make the total sum zero is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Zero Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, the answer is zero because no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Card Calculation**: For a non-zero target, the minimum number of cards required is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the target by `x` and taking the ceiling of the result. This works because each card can adjust the sum by at most `x` in absolute value. The ceiling ensures we cover any fractional part, rounding up to the next integer if necessary.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of cards needed by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks.",
