After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. We need to find for each subject the maximum mark. Then, for each student, if in at least one subject they have the maximum mark (and note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum mark, so they are all considered best for that subject) then the student is successful.\n\n However, note: The problem states \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark\". So even if multiple students have the same highest mark, they are all best.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (column), we can find the maximum mark (as a character, but we can convert to int or keep as char since '9' > '8' etc.)\n\n Then, for each student i (row), we check: \n   For any subject j, is the mark of student i in subject j equal to the maximum mark of subject j?\n\n But note: if two students both have the maximum mark in a subject, then both are best in that subject, so each of them gets credit for that subject.\n\n However, we don't need to count the number of subjects a student is best in, just if there exists at least one subject where they are best.\n\n So for a student i, we can do:\n   for j in range(m):\n        if gradebook[i][j] == max_mark[j]:\n            then student i is successful and we break out of the inner loop.\n\n But wait: what if in one subject the student is not the best? Then we continue checking other subjects.\n\n However, note: the condition is \"exists a subject he is the best at\".\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n   Subject 0: marks are ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n   Subject 1: marks are ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n   Subject 2: marks are ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, student0 (first row): \n        subject0: '2' == max0 ('2') -> yes, so successful.\n   Student1 (second row):\n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> yes, so successful.\n   Student2 (third row):\n        subject0: '1' != '2' -> skip.\n        subject1: '1' != '3' -> skip.\n        subject2: '2' != '3' -> skip -> not successful.\n\n   So output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines and store them as a list of strings (each string has m characters).\n\n 3. For each column j in range(m):\n      col = [row[j] for row in the list of strings]\n      max_mark[j] = max(col)\n\n 4. For each row i (student) in the list:\n      for each column j (subject) in range(m):\n          if gradebook[i][j] == max_mark[j]:\n              mark this student as successful and break the inner loop.\n\n 5. Count the number of successful students.\n\n Example 2: \n    Input: \n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n    Let's compute the max for each subject (each column):\n\n        col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max '9'\n        col1: ['1','1','1'] -> max '1'\n        col2: ['7','8','1'] -> max '8'\n        col3: ['2','2','1'] -> max '2'\n        col4: ['8','8','1'] -> max '8'\n\n    Now, student0: \n        col0: '9' == '9' -> successful.\n    student1:\n        col0: '1' != '9'\n        col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n    student2:\n        col0: '1' != '9'\n        col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n    So output is 3.\n\n However, wait: the example input is given as a string: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\", and the example output is 3.\n\n But note: in the example input string, the second sample is: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n Let me double-check the example:\n\n    Student0: \"91728\"\n        subject0: '9' -> best in subject0.\n    Student1: \"11828\"\n        subject1: '1' is best because the max for subject1 is '1'. Also subject3: '2' is best (max is '2').\n    Student2: \"11111\"\n        subject1: '1' is best (max is '1'), and also subject4: '1' is not best because the max for subject4 is '8'. But wait, subject1: yes, so he is best in subject1.\n\n    Actually, we only need one subject. So indeed, all three are successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We'll read the input.\n\n Important: The input is given as a single string in the example, but actually the problem reads from stdin.\n\n Since the problem says: \n   First line: n and m\n   Next n lines: each containing m characters (without spaces)\n\n We can do:\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   first_line = data[0].split()\n   n = int(first_line[0]); m = int(first_line[1])\n\n   Then, the next n lines: \n        grades = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            grades.append(data[i].strip())\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string that includes the whole thing. However, in competitive programming, we assume standard input.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   import sys\n   input_str = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   n, m = map(int, input_str[0].split())\n   grades = [line.strip() for line in input_str[1:1+n]]\n\n But note: the example input might have exactly n lines after the first.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Next n lines each containing m characters\"\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Edge: n=1, m=1: one student, one subject.\n\n Example: \n     Input: \"1 1\\n5\"\n     Then, the student has mark '5'. The max for the subject is '5'. So the student is successful.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read input.\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grades = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grades.append(input().strip())\n\n   Then, for j in range(m):\n        col_j = [grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_col = max(col_j)\n        # Store max_col for this subject, we can store in a list `max_marks` of length m.\n\n   Then, for each student i, check any subject j such that grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n   We can do:\n\n        successful = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                successful += 1\n\n   Print(successful)\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        n=3, m=3\n        grades = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   Compute max_marks for each column:\n        col0: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n        col1: ['2','3','1'] -> '3'\n        col2: ['3','2','2'] -> '3'\n\n   Then for:\n        student0: '2' (col0) matches '2' -> successful.\n        student1: '2' (col0) matches '2' -> successful.\n        student2: '1' (col0) doesn't match, '1' (col1) doesn't match, '2' (col2) doesn't match -> not successful.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n        n=3, m=5\n        grades = ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\n        max_marks = \n            col0: ['9','1','1'] -> '9'\n            col1: ['1','1','1'] -> '1'\n            col2: ['7','8','1'] -> '8'\n            col3: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n            col4: ['8','8','1'] -> '8'\n\n        student0: \n            col0: '9' == '9' -> successful.\n        student1:\n            col0: '1' != '9'\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n        student2:\n            col0: '1' != '9'\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n But wait, the example output is 3.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string that contains the entire input. In the problem statement, the example input is:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n This is two examples. Our program should handle one test case at a time.\n\n Since the problem reads from stdin, we assume one test case per run.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the input format, so we can write:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a list of strings in the example, but in the actual input, we'll have one integer n and then n lines.\n\n We are ready.\n\n Let me write the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps in identifying the best marks in each subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grades = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grades.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    max_marks = [max([grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]) for j in range(m)]\n    \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code checks all students' marks and stores the highest mark in a list `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful, and the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary checks.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging early termination once a successful subject is found for a student. The solution handles edge cases such as single students or subjects gracefully.",
