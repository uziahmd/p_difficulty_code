He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (for Roman numerals) or integers.\n Then, a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to an integer (in base 10), and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral (if the integer is between 1 and 3000 inclusive? but note: the problem says \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\" and not 0).\n 2. Otherwise, if both a and b are integers, then we convert the number from base a to base b.\n\n However, note: the input c is given as a string in base a (which may have digits beyond 0-9, using letters for bases above 10). The problem states that the number may contain leading zeros and its length doesn't exceed 10^3, but the value in base a (if not Roman) is not necessarily huge because if it's not Roman, the number won't be greater than 10^15^10? Actually, wait: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", but that is too big to handle directly. However, note that the input representation of the number in base a has at most 10^3 digits. So we must use conversion methods that can handle large numbers (but base a is at most 25).\n\n But note: the example input includes:\n   '2 2\\n1111001' -> output '1111001'\n   '12 13\\nA' -> output 'A'\n\n Also, the Roman numeral part: \n   '16 R\\n5' -> output 'V'\n   '5 R\\n4' -> output 'IV'\n\n However, the problem says: \"c is an integer written in base a\", so we have to first convert the string c (which is in base a) to a base-10 integer.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the first line and split into two parts. Let them be `a_str` and `b_str`.\n    - Convert `a_str` to integer if it's not 'R'. Similarly, `b_str` might be 'R' or an integer.\n\n 2. Read the next line which is the string `c`.\n\n 3. If `b_str` is 'R':\n        Step 1: Convert the string `c` from base `a` (integer) to base-10 integer.\n        Step 2: Convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n 4. Else:\n        Step 1: Convert the string `c` from base `a` (integer) to base-10 integer.\n        Step 2: Convert the base-10 integer to base `b` (integer). But note: base `b` can be from 2 to 25, and the representation uses digits 0-9 and then letters for 10 and above (from 'A' onward). However, note that the example base 12 to base 13 uses 'A' for 10.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the input number c is given in base a (which is between 2 and 25). The digits in c can be from '0' to the digit representing (a-1). For bases above 10, we use letters. For example, base 11: digits 0-9 and 'A' (which is 10). Base 12: digits 0-9, 'A' (10), 'B' (11). \n\n However, note: the input string c may contain leading zeros and its length is up to 10^3. We cannot simply use int(c, a) because the number might be very large (with 1000 digits). But note the condition: if the system is not Roman, then the number is not greater than 10^15^10? That is a huge number, but wait: the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning 10^(15*10) = 10^150? That is too big for standard integers. Alternatively, maybe the condition is that the base a is small (at most 25) and the number of digits is 1000, so the maximum value is (a^1000) which for a=25 is 25^1000, which is astronomically huge.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid converting the entire number to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a base-10 integer, and then converting that integer to the desired output base, which could be either a standard base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base (`a`) and the target base (`b`). The target base can be either an integer between 2 and 25 or the string 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **Number Conversion to Base-10**: Convert the input number (given as a string in base `a`) to a base-10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its decimal value, and accumulating the total value by considering the positional value of each digit.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base-10 integer to the specified base. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to corresponding digits (including letters for values greater than 9).\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral. This involves mapping the integer to Roman numeral symbols by breaking it down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, using predefined rules for Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_numerals(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for denom, symbol in val:\n        count = n // denom\n        res += count * symbol\n        n -= count * denom\n        if n == 0:\n            break\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    base_a = int(a_str) if a_str != 'R' else None\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        num = 0\n        neg = False\n        for char in c_str:\n            if char == '-':\n                neg = True\n            elif '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n            if base_a is None:\n                base_a = int(a_str)\n            \n            num = num * base_a + digit\n        \n        if neg:\n            num = -num\n        \n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n        \n        if num < 0:\n            print(\"Invalid negative Roman numeral\")\n            return\n        \n        result = roman_numerals(int(num))\n        print(result)\n        return\n    \n    base_b = int(b_str)\n    \n    num = 0\n    neg = False\n    for char in c_str:\n        if char == '-':\n            neg = True\n        elif '0' <= char <= '9':\n            digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        \n        if base_a is None:\n            base_a = int(a_str)\n        \n        num = num * base_a + digit\n    \n    if neg:\n        num = -num\n    \n    if num == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    \n    if num < 0:\n        print(\"Invalid negative number\")\n        return\n    \n    if base_b < 2 or base_b > 36:\n        print(\"Base out of range\")\n        return\n    \n    digits = []\n    n = num\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base_b\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n //= base_b\n    \n    if not digits:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    \n    digits.reverse()\n    s = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            s += str(d)\n        else:\n            s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    \n    print(s)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input lines, parsing the source and target bases, and the number to be converted.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number string is processed character by character. Each character is converted to its decimal value, and the total number is computed by iteratively multiplying the current total by the source base and adding the current digit's value.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - For standard base conversion, the decimal number is divided by the target base repeatedly, and remainders are collected to form the output digits. These digits are then mapped to characters (using letters for values 10 and above).\n   - For Roman numeral conversion, the decimal number is decomposed into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, using predefined Roman numeral symbols. The decomposition follows specific rules to handle subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
