    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string of up to 100 characters (lower-case Latin letters). We need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Approach:\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can use a more straightforward method.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll consider all possible substrings and record their starting indices and lengths.\n 2. Alternatively, we can iterate over possible substring lengths from largest to smallest (from n//2 down to 1) and check for duplicates.\n\n However, note: we are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap.\n\n Example: \n   Input \"abcd\" -> output 0 (no duplicate substring of any positive length)\n   Input \"ababa\" -> output 3 (because \"aba\" appears twice: at index0 and index2, and also \"bab\" but that's length3 as well? Actually, in \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" is of length 3 and appears twice. Also, the substring \"bab\" is of length 3 and appears once? Actually, let's break it down:\n\n   \"ababa\": \n     length 5: \"ababa\" -> appears only once.\n     length 4: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> each once.\n     length 3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> so \"aba\" appears twice.\n\n   So the answer is 3.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\". So even if there's a substring of length 4 that appears twice, then we would take 4. However, in \"ababa\", no substring of length 4 appears twice.\n\n Another example: \"zzz\"\n   length 3: \"zzz\" appears once.\n   length 2: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> two times? Actually, the substring \"zz\" appears at index0 and index1. So the answer is 2.\n\n However, wait: the example output for \"zzz\" is 2.\n\n But note: the substring \"zz\" is of length 2 and appears twice (at indices 0 and 1). \n\n How about a different approach?\n\n We can do:\n   For length L from floor(n/2) down to 1 (we don't need to check lengths beyond floor(n/2) because a substring of length L must appear at least twice, and the maximum starting index for the first occurrence is n-L, so if we have two occurrences, then the second occurrence must start at an index <= n-L - 1, so we can go from L = min(n, ...) but actually we can go from L = n//2 down to 1.\n\n However, note: the two occurrences can be anywhere, even with gaps. But the maximum length we can have is floor(n/2) because if we have a substring of length L, then the entire string is n, and if we have two non-overlapping occurrences, then we require at least 2*L <= n. But the problem allows overlapping, so even with overlapping we can have a substring of length L that starts at index i and index j (with j>=i+L) then the condition for two distinct occurrences is that j>=i+1 (overlap allowed, so j can be i+1, then the substring from i and j must be the same, but then the substring from i and j (which is i+1) might share some characters). Actually, the condition for two occurrences is that they are two distinct starting indices (so the same substring at two different starting positions). The two occurrences can overlap arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the two occurrences must be contiguous and of the same length. The condition is: we have two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that for k from 0 to L-1, s[i+k] == s[j+k].\n\n However, the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. So we can have two occurrences that overlap.\n\n But the maximum length we can have? Consider the entire string: if the entire string is duplicated, then we would have two occurrences? Actually, no, because the entire string is only one occurrence. But we can have two occurrences that are not necessarily covering the entire string.\n\n Example: \"abcabc\" has a substring \"abc\" that appears twice (at indices0 and indices3). But also \"bc\" appears three times, etc.\n\n However, we are looking for the longest. So we want the maximum L such that there exists at least two starting indices i and j (i < j) with j-i >= 0 (they can overlap) and the substring of length L starting at i equals that starting at j.\n\n Since the string is short (<=100), we can try:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   We'll iterate L from min(n, ???) down to 1.\n\n   But note: the maximum L we can have is floor(n) (if the entire string appears twice, then the string must be repeated, but then the two occurrences would require the string to be of length 2*n, which we don't have). Actually, the two occurrences must be within the string. The condition is that the two occurrences must start at two indices i and j (with j>=i) and the substring of length L must lie entirely in the string. So the condition is that i+L <= n and j+L <= n.\n\n   The maximum L we can get is n (if we have two identical copies of the entire string, then the string must be of length 2*n, but our string is of length n). So the maximum L we can have is n, but then we need two copies of the substring of length n, meaning the entire string must appear twice. This is impossible unless n=0. So the maximum L we can have is at most floor((n+1)/2)? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, the two occurrences must be in the same string. The maximum length of a substring that appears twice is at most floor(n) (if we have two copies, the two copies must be consecutive and the string must be of length 2*n? No, they can be overlapping. But the entire string is length n, so the maximum L for which we can have two occurrences is when the two occurrences start at two different positions and the substring length is L. The condition is that the two occurrences do not extend beyond the string.\n\n   However, we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L if the string has at least two disjoint (or overlapping) segments of length L that are equal.\n\n   We can try from L = n//2 down to 1, but wait: what if the string is \"aaa\", then n=3, then L can be 2: because \"aa\" appears at index0 and index1. Also, L=1: \"a\" appears three times. So we want the maximum L, which is 2.\n\n   But note: the two occurrences must be distinct. In \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" (length2) appears twice: [0:2] and [1:3]. So that's valid.\n\n   However, if we take L = floor(n/2) = 1 for n=3, then we start from L=1 and then we would return 1? But we know 2 is valid. So we should iterate from large L to small and return the first L for which we find at least two occurrences.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   Let max_length = 0\n\n   We can iterate L from min(n, ...) but actually we can set the range from min(n) down to 1, but note: the maximum L we can have is n (if the entire string appears twice, but that requires two copies of the entire string, which we don't have unless the string is empty). Actually, the two occurrences must be in the same string, so the maximum L is n-1: because if we have two occurrences of a substring of length n, then the two occurrences must be two segments of length n, but the string is only of length n, so the two segments must be the entire string and the entire string again? Then the string would have to be repeated, but we don't have two copies. Actually, the two occurrences must be two contiguous segments of length L that are equal and lie within the string. The condition is that the two segments do not necessarily cover the entire string.\n\n   Actually, the maximum L is the maximum integer L (1<=L<=n) for which there exist two starting indices i and j (0<=i<j<=n-L) such that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n   We can do:\n\n      for L in range(min(n, ...), 0, -1):   # Actually, we don't need to set an upper bound on L by n? Because if L>n, then no substring of length L exists. But we are iterating from n down to 1? Then we can set the range from n down to 1.\n\n   But note: the substring of length n: we need two copies. The condition for two copies is that the entire string is repeated, which requires the string to be of length 2n. So we cannot have two copies of a substring of length n in a string of length n. Similarly, for L = n-1: we need two copies of a substring of length n-1. The two copies must start at indices 0 and 1 (if the string is \"abcde\", then the two substrings of length 4 are \"abcd\" and \"bcde\"). So if \"abcd\" == \"bcde\", then we have a duplicate of length 4.\n\n   However, the maximum L we can have is n (if the entire string is duplicated) but that requires the string to be repeated, which we don't have. So the maximum L is at most n-1? Actually, no: consider the string \"aaaa\", n=4. Then we can have a substring of length 3: \"aaa\" appears at index0 and index1. So L=3. And 3 < 4. But we can also have a substring of length 2: \"aa\" appears multiple times. But we are looking for the longest.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n      n = len(s)\n      # We'll iterate L from n down to 1, and for each L, check all pairs of starting indices (i, j) with 0<=i<j<=n-L and see if s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]. If we find at least one pair, then we output L and break.\n\n      However, note: we want the longest, so we start from the largest L and go downwards until we find one that has at least two occurrences.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"at least twice\", so we need two or more occurrences.\n\n   Example: \"aaa\": \n        L=3: check for two occurrences: \n            i=0, j=1 -> substring s[0:3] = \"aaa\", s[1:4] -> but wait, the string is \"aaa\", so n=3. Then j must be <= n-L = 0, so only i=0, and no j. So no two occurrences for L=3.\n        L=2: check for two occurrences: \n            i=0, j=1 -> s[0:2] = \"aa\", s[1:3] = \"aa\" -> matches. So we output 2.\n\n   Example: \"abcd\":\n        For L=4: no two occurrences (only one substring of length4).\n        L=3: check: \n            i=0: \"abc\", i=1: \"bcd\" -> no match.\n        L=2: check:\n            i=0: \"ab\", i=1: \"bc\", i=2: \"cd\" -> no two same.\n        L=1: check:\n            i=0: \"a\", i=1: \"b\", i=2: \"c\", i=3: \"d\" -> no two same.\n\n        So output 0? But the problem says output 0.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n   So if no substring appears at least twice, we output 0.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", so if we found none, then the answer is 0.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n      n = len(s)\n      # We'll iterate L from n down to 1.\n      found = False\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          # We'll collect all distinct substrings of length L and count their frequency.\n          # But we don't need to collect all, we just need to check if there are at least two.\n          # We can use a dictionary, but since n is small, we can also use a set or simply check pairs.\n\n          # Alternatively, we can iterate over all starting indices i from 0 to n-L, and store the substring and its starting index? But we only care if we have seen the substring before.\n\n          # But note: we are iterating by L from large to small. We can break when we find the first L that has at least two occurrences.\n\n          # We can do: \n          seen = {}\n          # But we are going to use two loops: for each starting index i, we compute the substring s[i:i+L] and then check if we have seen it.\n\n          # However, we can break early if we find two occurrences.\n\n          # Let's do: \n          #   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n          #       substring = s[i:i+L]\n          #       if substring in seen:\n          #           then we have found two occurrences (or more) -> then we output L and break the entire loop.\n          #       else:\n          #           seen[substring] = True   (but wait, we might see the same substring again later? Actually, we are storing the substring and if we see it again, then we break. But note: we are checking for at least two. We can break at the first duplicate.\n\n          # However, we are storing the substring and then if we see the same substring again, we break. But what if the same substring appears more than twice? That's okay, we break at the first duplicate.\n\n          # But note: the same substring might appear more than twice, but we are only concerned with two.\n\n          # However, we are iterating for a fixed L. We want to know if there's at least two.\n\n          # We can do:\n\n          #   seen = set()\n          #   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n          #       substr = s[i:i+L]\n          #       if substr in seen:\n          #           print(L)\n          #           exit the loop for L and then the entire program?\n          #       else:\n          #           seen.add(substr)\n\n          # But wait: we are iterating L from large to small, so we want the largest L that satisfies the condition.\n\n          # However, note: we are breaking when we find the first L (largest) that has at least two occurrences.\n\n          # But the above code for fixed L: we are storing all substrings of length L and if we see a duplicate, we break and output L.\n\n          # But what if we have a duplicate? Then we output L and stop.\n\n          # But note: we are iterating L from n down to 1, so we start with the largest L and if we find one, we output it and exit.\n\n          # However, we must be cautious: we are not breaking the outer loop yet. We break the inner loop and then we can break the outer loop.\n\n          # But note: we are using the same variable 's'. We can do:\n\n          #   for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          #       seen = set()\n          #       for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n          #           substr = s[i:i+L]\n          #           if substr in seen:\n          #               print(L)\n          #               exit(0)   # or break out of both loops and then print(L) and return\n          #           else:\n          #               seen.add(substr)\n          #   # If we finish the loop without breaking, then no substring of length>=1 was found, so we output 0.\n\n          # But wait: what if we don't break in the inner loop? Then we move to the next L (smaller). But we are going from large to small, and we want the largest L. So if we don't find for L, we try L-1.\n\n          # However, the above code breaks at the first L (the largest) that has at least two occurrences.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"longest\", so we break at the first L we find (which is the largest) and output it.\n\n      However, what if there are two different substrings of the same maximum length? Then we break at the first occurrence of a duplicate for that L, but that doesn't matter because we are only concerned with the length.\n\n   But wait: is it efficient? The string length is at most 100, and the maximum L is 100, then for L=100, we have only one substring (the entire string) so we do one check. Then for L=99, we have two substrings (the entire string without the first character and without the last character) and so on. The total number of operations is the sum_{L=1}^{n} (n-L+1) * L. For n=100, that's about O(n^3) which is 100*100*100 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize by breaking early in the inner loop.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: we are storing substrings as strings and comparing them. The comparison of two strings of length L is O(L). So the total complexity is O(n^3) because for each L (n iterations) and for each starting index (n-L+1) and each comparison O(L). But n<=100, so worst-case 100*(100)*100 = 1000000 comparisons, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can avoid the set if we break early: we can do:\n\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          # We'll use a dictionary to count the frequency? Or we can break when we see a duplicate.\n          # Actually, we can use a set to record the substrings we've seen.\n\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  # We found a duplicate, so this L is the answer.\n                  print(L)\n                  exit(0)\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n\n      # If we didn't break, then no duplicate substring found for any L>=1, so output 0.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have two occurrences but they are not the same substring? Actually, we are storing the substring and if we see the same substring again, that's two occurrences.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"longest substring\", and we are iterating from large L to small, so we are guaranteed to find the largest L.\n\n   But wait: what if there are two different substrings of the same length? We are only checking for duplicates. We don't care which substring, we just care that there is at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, there is an edge: if the string is empty? The problem says the string is non-empty.\n\n   Let's test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0. Correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> \n        L=5: one substring -> no duplicate.\n        L=4: two substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: three substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> we see \"aba\" twice. So we break and output 3.\n\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" ->\n        L=3: one substring \"zzz\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2: two substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> we see \"zz\" twice. Output 2.\n\n   Example 4: \"abcabc\" -> \n        L=6: one substring -> no.\n        L=5: two substrings: \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no.\n        L=4: three substrings: \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no.\n        L=3: four substrings: \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> we see \"abc\" twice. Output 3.\n\n   But wait: in \"abcabc\", the substring \"abc\" appears twice, so yes.\n\n   Example 5: \"aaaa\" -> \n        L=4: one substring -> no.\n        L=3: two substrings: \"aaa\", \"aaa\" -> duplicate. Output 3.\n\n   But wait, \"aaaa\": \n        substring of length3: \n            starting at0: \"aaa\"\n            starting at1: \"aaa\"\n            starting at2: \"aa\" (but wait, for L=3, we only consider substrings of length3. So starting at0: \"aaa\", starting at1: \"aaa\", starting at2: \"aa\" -> but wait, n=4, so for L=3, the starting indices go from 0 to 4-3=1. So only two substrings: \"aaa\" and \"aaa\". So we break at L=3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above code uses `exit(0)` which terminates the program. But we are in a script. Alternatively, we can break out of the loops and then output.\n\n   But the problem says: output one number.\n\n   We can restructure without using exit:\n\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          found_duplicate = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  ans = L\n                  found_duplicate = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n          if found_duplicate:\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n   But note: we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop. Then we print ans.\n\n   However, if we don't break the outer loop, then we continue to smaller L. But we break at the first L we find (the largest) and then break the outer loop.\n\n   But what if we don't find any duplicate? Then we set ans to 0 initially and then print 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: in the inner loop, we break and set ans = L, then break the outer loop. Then we print ans.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if we have multiple duplicates at the same L? We break at the first duplicate we find.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more edge: when the string has two identical substrings that are not adjacent? The set will catch it because we are storing all substrings of that length and if we see the same substring again, we break.\n\n   Example: \"hello world hello world\" -> but wait, the string length is at most 100, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Code:\n\n      s = input().strip()   # Actually, the problem says the input is the first line containing the string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but that's an example list. Actually, the input is one string.\n\n   According to the problem: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we read one line.\n\n   However, the example input format is shown as a list, but the actual input is one string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is confusing. Actually, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So we read one string.\n\n   But the sample test 2 is \"ababa\", so the input is one string \"ababa\".\n\n   Therefore, we read one string.\n\n   Let me write:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n   However, the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This might be a typo. The actual input is one string per test case? Or multiple test cases? \n\n   The problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example input is a list of three strings. \n\n   But the sample output is a list of three numbers: [0, 3, 2]\n\n   This suggests that the input is one string, and we are to output one number.\n\n   However, the example input is shown as a list. I think the example is meant to show three separate test cases.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" meaning one test case.\n\n   Clarification: the problem is for one string.\n\n   But wait, the sample input format is ambiguous. Looking at the problem statement: it says \"Input\" and then shows a list. However, in competitive programming problems, sometimes they give multiple test cases. But the problem description says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n   After reading the problem again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input as \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we assume one string.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list. Maybe the example is showing three examples? Actually, the problem has three examples: \n        Input: 'abcd' -> Output: 0\n        Input: 'ababa' -> Output: 3\n        Input: 'zzz' -> Output: 2\n\n   So we are to read one string per run.\n\n   However, the sample input format in the problem is written as:\n\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is confusing. But the problem says: \"Output one number\".\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, but the problem says one string. I think the example is just showing three examples.\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   Code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n   Then we do the above algorithm.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string length is at most 100. Our algorithm is O(n^3) which is acceptable for n=100.\n\n   Let me test with a few examples.\n\n   Example: \"a\" (n=1)\n        L from 1 down to 1:\n            seen = set()\n            i from 0 to n-L = 0, so i=0: substr = s[0:1] = \"a\"\n            check if \"a\" in seen? no -> add to seen.\n            then no duplicate -> ans remains 0.\n\n        Output 0.\n\n   Example: \"aa\" (n=2)\n        L=2: \n            i from 0 to n-2=0: one substring \"aa\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=1:\n            i from 0 to 1: \n                i=0: \"a\" -> not seen -> add.\n                i=1: \"a\" -> seen -> duplicate found, output 1.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"a\" of length1 appears twice. So the expected output is 1.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aa\" of length2 appears only once. So the longest substring that appears at least twice is \"a\" (length1). Correct.\n\n   But wait, is there a substring of length2 that appears twice? No, because the entire string is \"aa\", and the substring of length2 is \"aa\", and there's only one occurrence.\n\n   So the answer is 1.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"at least twice\". The substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index1). So that's correct.\n\n   However, the example \"zzz\" had a substring \"zz\" (length2) appearing twice, and we output 2.\n\n   So the code seems correct.\n\n   One more: \"aabaa\" (n=5)\n        We expect: \n            substring \"aa\" appears multiple times. The longest substring that appears at least twice is \"aa\" (length2) or maybe \"baa\" (if we look) but wait:\n\n        Let me check:\n            length5: \"aabaa\" -> one time.\n            length4: \"aaba\", \"abaa\" -> no duplicate.\n            length3: \"aab\", \"aba\", \"baa\" -> no duplicate.\n            length2: \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\" -> we have \"aa\" twice (at index0 and index3). So output 2.\n\n   But wait, is there a substring of length3 that appears twice? \n        \"aab\", \"aba\", \"baa\" -> no.\n        length4: no.\n\n        So output 2.\n\n   However, what about the substring \"aa\" of length2? It appears at index0 and index3. Also, the substring \"aa\" at index0 is \"aa\", and at index3 is \"aa\". So that's two occurrences.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"aa\" at index0 is \"aa\", and the substring \"aa\" at index3 is \"aa\" (from index3 to 5, but the string is \"aabaa\", so index3 is the fourth character, then the substring is s[3:5] which is \"aa\"). Correct.\n\n   So the code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      # If the string is empty, n==0, then we output 0. But the problem says non-empty, so skip.\n\n      # Iterate L from n down to 1.\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          found = False\n          # Iterate over all starting indices for substring of length L\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  ans = L\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n          if found:\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n   But wait, what if we have a substring that appears more than twice? We break at the first duplicate we find. That's okay.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the set may grow large, but n<=100 and L is decreasing, so the set for L=100 has 1 element, then for L=99 has 2 elements, etc. The total memory is O(n^2) which is acceptable for n=100.\n\n   Let me test with \"aaa\" (n=3):\n        L=3: \n            i from 0 to 0: substring \"aaa\" -> set becomes {\"aaa\"} -> no duplicate.\n        L=2:\n            i from 0 to 1:\n                i=0: substr=\"aa\" -> set becomes {\"aa\"}\n                i=1: substr=\"aa\" -> found duplicate -> ans=2, break.\n\n   Output 2. Correct.\n\n   Example \"ababa\" (n=5):\n        L=5: set={\"ababa\"} -> no duplicate.\n        L=4: set={\"abab\",\"baba\"} -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: \n            i=0: \"aba\" -> set.add(\"aba\")\n            i=1: \"bab\" -> set.add(\"bab\")\n            i=2: \"aba\" -> found duplicate -> ans=3.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Example \"abcabc\" (n=6):\n        L=6: set={\"abcabc\"} -> no.\n        L=5: set={\"abcab\",\"bcabc\"} -> no.\n        L=4: set={\"abca\",\"bcab\",\"cabc\"} -> no.\n        L=3: \n            i=0: \"abc\" -> set.add(\"abc\")\n            i=1: \"bca\" -> set.add(\"bca\")\n            i=2: \"cab\" -> set.add(\"cab\")\n            i=3: \"abc\" -> duplicate -> ans=3.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Example \"abcd\": \n        L=4: no\n        L=3: no\n        L=2: no\n        L=1: no -> output 0.\n\n   All tests passed.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't handle empty string. But the problem guarantees non-empty.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears more than twice? We break at the first duplicate, but we don't care.\n\n   Final code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  ans = L\n                  break\n              seen.add(substr)\n          else:\n              # This else corresponds to the inner loop finishing normally (without break)\n              continue\n          break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the flag and break structure as above.\n\n   But note: the above code uses a for-else. The else clause of the inner for loop runs only if the break is not encountered. Then we break the outer loop only if we break the inner loop.\n\n   However, the above code is slightly different: we break the outer loop if we break the inner loop. But note: the inner loop break sets ans and then breaks the inner loop, then we break the outer loop. But in the above code, we break the outer loop immediately after the inner break.\n\n   Actually, the above code:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break   # breaks inner loop\n                seen.add(substr)\n            else:\n                continue\n            break\n\n   This means: if we break the inner loop (because we found a duplicate), then we break the outer loop. Otherwise, we continue to the next L.\n\n   But wait, the inner loop break happens when we found a duplicate. Then we break the inner loop and then the else is skipped, and then we break the outer loop.\n\n   However, note: the structure:\n\n        for L:\n            ...\n            for i:\n                ...\n                if condition: \n                    break   -> breaks inner loop, then the else of the inner for is not executed, and then the outer break is executed.\n\n            else:   # this else is for the inner for, meaning if the inner for did not break\n                continue   # continue the outer loop (next L)\n\n            break   # this break is for the outer loop, and it is executed only if the inner for broke\n\n   So the above code is equivalent to:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:   # note: we haven't defined 'seen' in this version? Actually, we defined it above.\n\n            But wait, in the above code, we defined 'seen' and then the inner loop. Then after the inner loop, we break the outer loop if we broke the inner loop.\n\n   Actually, the above code is correct.\n\n   However, I prefer the version with a flag for clarity.\n\n   Let me stick to the version that doesn't use for-else for the outer loop:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          found_duplicate = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  found_duplicate = True\n                  break\n              seen.add(substr)\n          if found_duplicate:\n              ans = L\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n   This is clearer.\n\n   I'll submit this version.\n\n   But wait, the above version for \"abcd\" (n=4) would output 0, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the set is cleared for each L. That is necessary.\n\n   Let me write the code.\n\n   Note: We must use the same variable names.\n\n   Final code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      # We are going to search for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n      # Start from the largest possible length (n) down to 1.\n      ans = 0\n      for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n          # We'll create a set to store the substrings of length L we've seen.\n          seen = set()\n          found = False\n          # Iterate over every starting index for a substring of length L.\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              # Extract the substring\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              # If we've seen this substring before, then we have at least two occurrences.\n              if substr in seen:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n          if found:\n              ans = L\n              break\n\n      print(ans)\n\n   This is the final code.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example: \"abcd\" -> 0\n   Example: \"ababa\" -> 3\n   Example: \"zz",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle strings of up to 100 characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that appears at least twice. The key observation here is that the solution must check all possible substrings from the longest to the shortest, ensuring that we find the first (longest) substring that meets the criteria.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the longest possible substring length down to 1, we can break early once we find the first valid substring length. This approach leverages the fact that longer substrings are checked first, optimizing for the best possible solution quickly.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each possible substring length, we generate all unique substrings of that length and check if any substring appears more than once. If a duplicate is found, we immediately return the current substring length as the result since we are checking from largest to smallest.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves nested loops: the outer loop runs from the string length down to 1, and the inner loop processes each substring of the current length. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the string length, due to substring comparisons. However, given the constraint (n â‰¤ 100), this approach is feasible and efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nans = 0\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    found_duplicate = False\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            found_duplicate = True\n            break\n        else:\n            seen.add(substr)\n    if found_duplicate:\n        ans = L\n        break\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest valid substring found.\n3. **Outer Loop**: This loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the string's length down to 1. For each length `L`, it checks if there are at least two identical substrings of length `L`.\n4. **Inner Loop**: For each starting index `i` (from 0 to `n - L`), the substring of length `L` starting at `i` is extracted. If this substring has been seen before (indicating a duplicate), the loop breaks early, and `L` is recorded as the answer.\n5. **Early Termination**: Once a valid substring length `L` is found, the outer loop terminates immediately, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.\n6. **Output**: The length of the longest valid substring is printed, or 0 if no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination and set operations to track seen substrings, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
