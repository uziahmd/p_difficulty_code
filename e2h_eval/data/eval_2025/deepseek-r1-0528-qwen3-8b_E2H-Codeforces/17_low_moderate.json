He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one prefix and one suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, note: the problem says that Ivan has given us all improper prefixes and suffixes (so two per length from 1 to n-1) and they can be in arbitrary order.\n\n We have to assign each given string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that:\n   - There is exactly one string of length n (the full string) that would produce these prefixes and suffixes.\n   - The output is a string of length 2n-2 containing 'P' and 'S', with equal number of each (n-1 of each).\n\n Important: The problem guarantees that the given strings are the prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n Observation:\n Let the string s be of length n. Then, the prefixes are s[0:i] for i from 1 to n-1, and suffixes are s[i:] for i from 0 to n-2 (which are of length from 1 to n-1).\n\n But note: the set of prefixes and suffixes must be consistent. In particular, the entire string s must be such that:\n   - The prefix of length 1 is s[0:1]\n   - The suffix of length 1 is s[-1:]\n   - The prefix of length 2 is s[0:2]\n   - The suffix of length 2 is s[-2:]\n\n However, there's a catch: the problem says that the given set of 2n-2 strings includes both the proper prefixes and proper suffixes, and they are of lengths from 1 to n-1, two for each length.\n\n How to assign?\n\n Idea: \n Since the full string s must have length n, the two strings of length 1 must be the first character and the last character. Similarly, the two strings of length 2 must be the first two characters and the last two characters.\n\n Actually, consider: \n   Let the full string be s = [c0, c1, c2, ..., c_{n-1}]\n   Then the prefix of length 1 is c0, and the suffix of length 1 is c_{n-1}.\n   The prefix of length 2 is c0+c1, and the suffix of length 2 is c_{n-2}+c_{n-1}.\n\n But note: the given strings of length 2 might not necessarily appear in the full string as consecutive at the beginning or the end? Actually, the prefix of length 2 is the first two, and the suffix of length 2 is the last two.\n\n However, what if we try to reconstruct the full string?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know the set of all prefixes and suffixes. We can group the strings by their length.\n\n 2. For a fixed length L (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings. One of them is the prefix of length L, the other is the suffix of length L.\n\n 3. But note: the entire string s must be of length n. So, if we look at the string of length 1: let them be A and B. Then the first character is A and the last character is B? Not necessarily: the problem does not specify which one is which.\n\n 4. However, we can use consistency conditions: the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must agree on the overlapping part if any.\n\n Example: n=5, then we have two strings of length 2. The prefix of length 2 is the first two, and the suffix of length 2 is the last two. These two strings do not necessarily share any characters, unless L is large enough to overlap.\n\n Actually, for a string s, the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L will share the same starting and ending parts only if the string is periodic? But wait, they are from different positions.\n\n However, note: the prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n]. They don't necessarily have any relation.\n\n But here's the catch: the entire string must be consistent. \n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one string of length n that matches, we can try to determine the assignment by looking for the minimal conditions.\n\n Consider: \n   Let the two strings of length 1 be A and B. Then the full string must start with A and end with B.\n\n   Now, consider the two strings of length 2: say X and Y. One is the prefix (first two) and the other is the suffix (last two). The prefix is (A + some char) and the suffix is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string in the input is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their relationships to deduce the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) for each string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: The input contains `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. We first group these strings by their lengths.\n2. **Identify Overlapping Conditions**: For each length `L`, one of the two strings must be a prefix and the other a suffix. The key insight is that the full string of length `n` must start with the prefix of length `L` and end with the suffix of length `L`. This means that for any position where the prefix and suffix overlap, their overlapping parts must match.\n3. **Check Consistency**: For each length `L`, we check which pair of strings (one from the prefix group and one from the suffix group) can form a consistent full string. Specifically, if we consider the prefix of length `L` and the suffix of length `L`, the last `L - (n - L)` characters of the prefix must match the first `L - (n - L)` characters of the suffix. This ensures that the overlapping parts align correctly when constructing the full string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    all_strings = [line.strip() for line in data[1:1+total_strings]]\n    \n    grouped = {}\n    for s in all_strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in grouped:\n            grouped[l] = []\n        grouped[l].append(s)\n    \n    result = []\n    for length in range(1, n):\n        str1, str2 = grouped[length]\n        if length <= n - length:\n            if str1[-(length - (n - length)):] == str2[:length - (n - length)]:\n                result.append('P')\n                result.append('S')\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n                result.append('P')\n        else:\n            if str1[:length - (n - length)] == str2[-(length - (n - length)):]:\n                result.append('P')\n                result.append('S')\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n                result.append('P')\n                \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the integer `n` (length of the unknown string), followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where each key is a length from 1 to `n-1`, and the value is a list of strings of that length.\n3. **Determining Prefix/Suffix Assignment**: For each length `L`, the algorithm checks the two strings to see which one should be the prefix and which should be the suffix. The check involves comparing the overlapping parts of the prefix and suffix. If the overlapping parts match, the string is assigned as a prefix ('P'); otherwise, it is assigned as a suffix ('S').\n4. **Output**: The results for all strings are concatenated into a single string of 'P's and 'S's, which is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the problem constraints and guarantees to determine the correct assignment for each string, ensuring consistency with the unknown string of length `n`.",
