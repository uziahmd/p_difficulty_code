Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given: n, x and then n lines with (l, r, cost)\n Conditions:\n  - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that they do not intersect (either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i).\n  - The sum of their durations is exactly x. Note: duration = r - l + 1.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's denote:\n   d_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n\n Then we require: d_i + d_j = x.\n\n Additionally, the two vouchers must not overlap.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since n, x, and the day values can be up to 200,000, we cannot try all pairs.\n\n Idea:\n\n 1. Group the vouchers by their duration. But note: two vouchers might have the same duration, so we'll have multiple entries.\n\n    However, we also need to consider the intervals (l_i, r_i) to check non-overlapping condition.\n\n 2. We are going to consider each voucher as one part, and then look for a voucher with duration = x - d_i.\n\n 3. But how to efficiently check non-overlapping? And we want minimal total cost.\n\n Alternative idea:\n\n  - We can precompute an array (or dictionary) for each possible duration (from 1 to maybe 200000) storing the best (minimal cost) voucher(s) for that duration, but we also need to know the interval.\n\n  However, note: two vouchers with the same duration might have different intervals and we need to check non-overlapping.\n\n 4. We need to avoid overlapping. So for a given voucher i (with duration d_i) and we want to find a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i, such that either:\n        r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n 5. How to store and query?\n\n    We can store for each duration d, a list of (l, r, cost). But note: we want to quickly check for a given voucher i (with [l_i, r_i]) and a duration d_target (which is x-d_i) if there exists any voucher j in d_target that does not overlap with i.\n\n    Conditions for non-overlap with i:\n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j   -> then j must have l_j > r_i.\n        Condition 2: r_j < l_i   -> then j must have r_j < l_i.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"at least one\" condition, so we can use OR.\n\n 6. We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n    For each voucher i, we are going to look for a voucher j (with duration d_j = x - d_i) such that either:\n        Option A: j has l_j > r_i (then no overlap because j starts after i ends)\n        Option B: j has r_j < l_i (then j ends before i starts)\n\n    Then we want the minimal cost from the set of all j satisfying either condition.\n\n 7. However, we cannot iterate over all vouchers for each i (n can be 200,000, and then worst-case 40e9 operations).\n\n 8. Instead, we can preprocess:\n\n    Step 1: Group vouchers by duration. We are only interested in durations from 1 to x (since d_i>=1, then d_j=x-d_i must be at least 1, so d_i must be in [1, x-1]).\n\n    Step 2: For each duration d, we want to store the available vouchers (each voucher: (l, r, cost)) and also build some data structure to quickly query for:\n\n        Given a duration d_target (which is x-d_i) and a voucher i (with [l_i, r_i]), we want to find a voucher j (in d_target) such that either:\n            (a) j.l > r_i   (then j starts after i ends) \n            (b) j.r < l_i   (then j ends before i starts)\n\n        and among these, we want the minimal cost.\n\n    But note: we can have multiple vouchers in d_target. We need to consider both conditions.\n\n    Alternatively, we can split the requirement: \n\n        Condition (a): For a fixed d_target, we want to get the minimal cost of a voucher j in d_target that has l_j > r_i.\n\n        Condition (b): Similarly, minimal cost of a voucher j in d_target that has r_j < l_i.\n\n    Then for voucher i, we take the minimum between the minimal cost from condition (a) and condition (b), if they exist.\n\n 9. How to quickly query for minimal cost in d_target for:\n\n        Case (a): l_j > R (where R = r_i) -> we are looking for a voucher j in d_target with l_j > R, and we want the minimal cost.\n\n        Case (b): r_j < L (where L = l_i) -> we are looking for a voucher j in d_target with r_j < L, and minimal cost.\n\n 10. We can precompute for each duration d (that appears) two structures:\n\n        Structure A_d: keyed by l (the start day) and we store the minimal cost for a voucher with that start day? But wait, we don't need to break by start day, we need to query by a threshold (l_j > R) and similarly for r_j < L.\n\n    Actually, for condition (a): we want to query by l_j > R. So we can store for each duration d:\n\n        Option 1: Keep a sorted list of the start days (l) for vouchers in d, and for each (l, r, cost) we can also keep a separate mapping from l to minimal cost for a given l? But note: there can be multiple vouchers with the same l? Actually, we are free to choose the minimal cost for a given (l, r) doesn't matter? Actually, for a fixed (l, r) we just need the minimal cost.\n\n        But note: we are only concerned with the condition on l (for condition a) and separately condition on r (for condition b). However, we want the minimal cost overall, so we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            For condition (a): We are going to index by l. We can create an array for the entire range of days? But days go up to 200000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            For condition (a): We want to know the minimal cost for any voucher in d_target that has l >= (R+1). We can create a segment tree or a Fenwick tree? But note: we have many durations (up to 200000) and we are doing queries per voucher i (n up to 200000) so we cannot build a separate structure for each duration.\n\n 11. We need to trade-off memory and time.\n\n    Another idea: Instead of grouping by duration and then building a structure for each, we can precompute two global structures for all durations? \n\n    But note: the condition (a) and (b) depend on the duration d_target (which is x-d_i) and we are only interested in the durations that appear.\n\n    Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d (that appears) two arrays:\n\n        Array_A[d]: for each l (from min_day to max_day) the minimal cost of a voucher in d with start day >= l? Actually, for condition (a) we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l_j > r_i. We can do:\n\n            Let events: for each voucher (l, r, cost) in duration d, we record (l, cost). Then we can sort by l and then do a suffix minimum array (so that for a given l0, we know the minimal cost for any voucher with l>=l0).\n\n        Similarly, for condition (b): we want minimal cost for any voucher with r_j < l_i. We can sort the same set by r and then do a prefix minimum.\n\n    But then we have to build this for every distinct duration d that appears. How many distinct durations? At most 200000.\n\n    However, the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the sizes of all groups is 200000. So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Read all vouchers.\n\n        Step 2: Group by duration.\n\n        Step 3: For each duration d that appears, we have a list of (l, r, cost). Then we can:\n\n            For condition (a): \n                Sort the list by l (the start day). Then create an array for the sorted l's and then an array 'min_cost_from' such that min_cost_from[i] = minimum cost from the i-th voucher to the end.\n\n            For condition (b):\n                Sort the same list by r (the end day). Then create an array 'min_cost_until' such that min_cost_until[i] = minimum cost from the start to the i-th voucher.\n\n        Then, for a given voucher i (with duration d_i) and d_target = x - d_i, we:\n\n            If d_target not in the map (or not present in our groups), then skip.\n\n            Then, from the group d_target, we have two sorted arrays: one by l and one by r.\n\n            Condition (a): Query the condition (l_j > r_i). In the sorted-by-l array for d_target, we need the smallest index where l >= (r_i+1). Then the minimal cost from that index to the end is stored in min_cost_from.\n\n            Condition (b): Query the condition (r_j < l_i). In the sorted-by-r array for d_target, we need the largest index where r <= (l_i-1). Then the minimal cost from the beginning until that index is stored in min_cost_until.\n\n        Then we take the minimum cost from the two conditions (if both conditions yield a result, then the minimum; if one doesn't, then the other; if none, then skip this d_target).\n\n        Then update the answer.\n\n 12. However, note: we are iterating over each voucher i (n up to 200000) and for each we are going to do two binary searches (one for condition a and one for condition b) in the group for d_target. The total number of groups is at most 200000, but note: we only consider d_target that is in the map. \n\n    Also, the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the sizes of all groups is 200000. The binary search in one group takes O(log(size_of_group)). So the total time would be O(n * log(max_group_size)), which is acceptable since max_group_size could be up to 200000 and n=200000 -> worst-case 200000 * log(200000) which is about 200000*18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\n 13. Implementation details:\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Preprocessing:\n            Read n, x.\n            Read n lines.\n\n            Let vouchers = []\n            For i in range(n):\n                read l, r, cost\n                d = r-l+1\n                append (l, r, cost, d)\n\n            Create a dictionary: groups = {}  # key: duration d, value: list of (l, r, cost)\n\n            For each voucher (l, r, cost, d):\n                if d not in groups: groups[d] = []\n                groups[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n            Then, for each duration d in groups:\n                sort the list by l (for condition a) and then build a suffix min array for the costs (by l order)\n                sort the same list by r (for condition b) and then build a prefix min array for the costs (by r order)\n\n            We'll store two dictionaries:\n\n                condA[d] = (sorted_by_l, suffix_min)   # sorted_by_l: list of l's, and suffix_min[i] = min(cost from i to end) for the sorted list (by l) of the group d.\n\n                condB[d] = (sorted_by_r, prefix_min)   # sorted_by_r: list of r's, and prefix_min[i] = min(cost from start to i) for the sorted list (by r) of the group d.\n\n            Actually, we can store for each d:\n\n                For condition a: \n                    arr_a = sorted([ (l, r, cost) for ... ]) by l, then extract the list of l and the list of costs, and then compute the suffix_min for the costs.\n\n                Similarly for condition b.\n\n            But note: we don't need the entire tuple for the query, we can store:\n\n                For condition a: \n                    keys: the l's (the start days) and the corresponding minimal cost from that l onwards (but note: we are grouping by l? Actually, we want to know: for a given l0, what is the minimal cost for a voucher with l>=l0? \n\n                However, we can do:\n\n                    Let arr = sorted list of (l, cost) for the group d (we don't need r for condition a, but wait: we do need r for condition a? Actually, condition a is defined by l_j>r_i, but we don't use r for condition a. However, when we query condition a, we are only concerned with the l and the cost. But note: we are storing the entire voucher, and we have to ensure that the voucher has l_j>r_i. The cost is independent.\n\n                However, the condition a is only about the start day of j being greater than the end day of i (r_i). So we don't need the r from j for condition a, but we do need the cost and the start day.\n\n            So for condition a, we can ignore r. Similarly for condition b, we ignore l.\n\n            But wait: condition a requires that j has l_j>r_i. Condition b requires that j has r_j<l_i. \n\n            Therefore, we can separate the two conditions.\n\n            Steps for condition a for a fixed duration d:\n\n                We have a list of (l, r, cost) for d. We only care about l and cost for condition a (because condition a depends only on l). Similarly for condition b, we only care about r and cost.\n\n            However, note: the same voucher is used for both conditions. But we are storing the entire voucher. So we can split the group into two parts? Actually, no. We can process condition a and condition b separately.\n\n            But we have to store the entire voucher anyway.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store for condition a: for each duration d, we store a list of (l, cost) and then sort by l and build a suffix min array for the costs.\n\n            Similarly, for condition b: for each duration d, we store a list of (r, cost) and then sort by r and build a prefix min array for the costs.\n\n            However, note: the same voucher is represented in both. But that's okay.\n\n            But wait: the same voucher i is used for condition a and condition b? Actually, no: we are considering two different vouchers. When we are processing voucher i, we are looking for a voucher j (different from i) in the group d_target. So we must avoid including the same voucher? \n\n            However, note: the problem says two distinct vouchers. But when we built the groups, we put each voucher into the group by its own duration. Then, when we are querying for d_target, we are only looking at the group d_target. Now, note: the two vouchers must be distinct, so if we accidentally pick the same voucher twice, we must avoid that.\n\n            But note: the same voucher cannot be in two different groups (unless two vouchers have the same duration). However, we are grouping by duration, so if two vouchers have the same duration, they are in the same group.\n\n            How can we avoid using the same voucher twice?\n\n            We are not storing the identity of the voucher. But note: the conditions are independent of the identity. However, we must consider: if a voucher j is the same as voucher i, then we must not consider it.\n\n            But wait: i and j are from two different durations (unless d_i = d_j and d_i+d_j=x, then d_i = d_j = x/2). Then if x is even and d_i = x/2, then the two vouchers we are picking must be distinct. However, if the same voucher appears twice? No, the input has distinct vouchers (each line is a voucher). But two vouchers can have the same (l, r, cost) and same duration.\n\n            However, the problem does not say that the vouchers are distinct. So we must assume they are distinct by the line, but the attributes can repeat.\n\n            But note: we are storing all vouchers. The problem says: choose two distinct vouchers. So we must not pick the same voucher twice.\n\n            How to avoid using the same voucher? \n\n            In the grouping, we are storing all vouchers. Then, when we are processing a voucher i (which has duration d_i) and we are looking for a voucher j (with duration d_j = x-d_i) in the group d_target, we must not consider the voucher i if it is also in the group d_target and has the same duration? \n\n            Actually, if d_i != d_j, then the two vouchers are in different groups and we never pick the same one. \n\n            But if d_i == d_j (i.e., d_i = x/2), then the two vouchers must be from the same group. Then we have to make sure that we don't pick the same voucher twice.\n\n            However, the problem does not specify that the two vouchers are distinct by index, but by the fact that they are two different ones. So if two vouchers are identical (same l, r, cost) then they are two different vouchers? Actually, the input may have duplicates.\n\n            But note: the input says \"each of the next n lines\", so the same voucher (same l, r, cost) can appear twice. Then they are two different vouchers.\n\n            Therefore, we must allow two identical vouchers? \n\n            However, the condition of non-intersection: two identical vouchers (same [l, r]) would definitely overlap (unless the interval is a single point? Actually, if two vouchers are [1,1] and [1,1], then they are the same and they overlap. But the condition for non-intersection: \n                Condition 1: r_i < l_j -> 1 < 1 -> false.\n                Condition 2: r_j < l_i -> 1 < 1 -> false.\n            So they do intersect. Therefore, we cannot use two identical vouchers.\n\n            But if two vouchers are [1,2] and [1,2] (same), then they are not disjoint. So we cannot use them.\n\n            However, if we have two different vouchers with the same (l, r, cost) then they are considered distinct, but they are not disjoint. Therefore, we must avoid using two identical intervals.\n\n            But wait: the problem says \"two vouchers i and j (i≠j)\" and the condition of non-intersection. So if two vouchers are identical, then they are not disjoint. So we must not use two identical ones.\n\n            However, in our grouping, we are storing all vouchers. Then, when we query condition a or condition b, we are getting all vouchers in the group (including duplicates). But then, when we do the binary search, we are getting the minimal cost from the entire group. But if the minimal cost comes from a voucher that is the same as voucher i (when d_i = d_j), then we must check that they are not the same voucher? \n\n            Actually, we are not storing the identity. We cannot tell which voucher is which.\n\n            Alternative: We must design the data structure so that we don't use the same voucher. But the input doesn't give an id. \n\n            However, note: the problem does not require the two vouchers to be distinct by content, but by being two different ones. But if two vouchers have the same (l, r, cost) and we pick two of them, then they are two different vouchers (because they are two rows in the input) and they are distinct. But wait: are they distinct? \n\n            The problem says: \"exactly two vouchers i and j (i≠j)\" — meaning by index. So even if two vouchers have the same attributes, they are distinct if they are from different lines.\n\n            But then, the non-intersection condition: two identical vouchers (same [l, r]) will always overlap (unless the interval is a single point and the two are the same, but then they are adjacent? Actually, if two identical vouchers, then they are the same interval and they overlap). \n\n            Therefore, we must not consider two identical vouchers (same [l, r]) as valid, even if they are two different ones? \n\n            However, the problem does not say that two vouchers with the same [l, r] are considered the same. They are distinct by index, but the condition of non-intersection is based on the intervals. So if we have two identical vouchers (same [l, r]), then they are not disjoint. \n\n            Therefore, we must not use two identical vouchers. \n\n            But note: if we have two different vouchers with the same [l, r] (same duration, same interval) then they are not disjoint. So we cannot use them together.\n\n            This complicates: We cannot simply use the entire group for d_target. We must ensure that when we pick a voucher j, it is not the same voucher as i (if d_i = d_j) but wait: we are storing the entire group. Actually, we don't have the index. \n\n            However, we don't need to worry about the identity for two different groups (d_i != d_j). For two same groups (d_i = d_j), we must avoid using the same voucher i in the group d_target? But wait: the two vouchers are distinct by index, but they are from the same group. However, we are storing all the vouchers in the group. \n\n            How to avoid using the same voucher i (if it is in the group d_target)? \n\n            Actually, we are processing voucher i and then looking in the group d_target. If d_target = d_i (so same duration) then the group d_target contains all vouchers of that duration, including voucher i. \n\n            But we must not use voucher i itself (if it appears in the group) because we are only allowed to choose two distinct vouchers. \n\n            However, the problem says: two distinct vouchers (by index). So if the same voucher i is in the group d_target, we must not use it. But note: the condition for non-intersection is independent of the identity. \n\n            But wait: if we have two vouchers with the same [l, r] (so same interval) then they are not disjoint. So we cannot use two identical ones. But if two vouchers have the same duration but different intervals, then they might be disjoint.\n\n            However, the issue is: when d_i = d_j, then the two vouchers are from the same group. We must avoid using the same voucher i twice. \n\n            But we don't know which one is voucher i. \n\n            How can we handle this?\n\n            We can store the entire list for the group and then, when we query, we are effectively getting the minimal cost from the entire group. But if the minimal cost voucher in the group for condition a is voucher i itself, then we cannot use it. \n\n            However, we don't know which voucher is which. \n\n            Alternative approach: we cannot avoid storing the identity? Or we must store the entire voucher and then later check? \n\n            Actually, we don't need to avoid the same voucher if we are using two different groups. For two different groups, the vouchers are distinct by group. So only when d_i = d_j we have to worry.\n\n            How to handle same duration (d_i = d_j):\n\n                We are processing voucher i (with duration d_i) and we are looking for a voucher j in the same group (d_target = d_i). We must not use voucher i.\n\n                But note: the query returns the minimal cost from the entire group (without excluding voucher i). Then we must consider: is the minimal cost voucher j actually voucher i? \n\n                We don't know. But we can store the entire list and then, for condition a and condition b, we can exclude voucher i.\n\n            However, we are storing the entire list of vouchers (with their l, r, cost) for the group. We can do:\n\n                For condition a: \n                    We want to find the minimal cost among all vouchers in the group (excluding voucher i) that have l_j > r_i.\n\n                Similarly for condition b.\n\n            But then, how to exclude voucher i? \n\n            We can store the entire list, and then when processing voucher i, we remove it from the group temporarily? That would be too slow.\n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d, two structures that support removal of specific elements? That is too heavy.\n\n            Another idea: we can store the entire group, and then for each voucher i (with duration d_i) we know that if d_i == d_target, then we must skip voucher i. But we cannot easily check that because we don't know the cost and the (l, r) of voucher i in the group.\n\n            But note: we are building the group from the entire set. We can store the entire list and then, when we query, we know the voucher i's (l_i, r_i, cost_i). Then we can check: for the candidate voucher j (from the query) is it the same as i? \n\n            However, the candidate j is found by (l_j > r_i) or (r_j < l_i). But if voucher i is in the group, then it has duration d_i = d_target. And we are querying for j that satisfies the condition. But voucher i itself: \n                Condition a: l_i > r_i? -> no, because l_i<=r_i. Similarly, condition b: r_i < l_i? -> no, because l_i<=r_i. So voucher i does not satisfy condition a or condition b. \n\n            Therefore, the query for condition a and condition b in the same group (d_target = d_i) will naturally exclude voucher i because voucher i does not meet the condition (unless the condition is met? Actually, condition a requires l_j>r_i, but voucher i has l_i<=r_i, so l_i is not greater than r_i. Similarly for condition b: r_i is not less than l_i). \n\n            So we don't have to worry about excluding voucher i by the condition, because the condition already fails for voucher i.\n\n            Therefore, we can proceed without explicitly excluding voucher i.\n\n            Example: \n                Voucher i: [l_i, r_i] (with d_i = x-d_i, so d_target=d_i)\n                Condition a: requires l_j>r_i. But voucher i has l_i<=r_i, so l_i is not greater than r_i. Similarly, condition b: requires r_j<l_i, and voucher i has r_i>=l_i, so r_i is not less than l_i.\n\n            So the candidate j must be a different voucher (with the same duration) and the condition automatically excludes voucher i.\n\n            Therefore, we don't need to do anything extra.\n\n 14.

However, note: the above code does not consider the possibility that the same duration d_target might be absent, so we check only if d_target is in dictA (which we built from the groups). But what if d_target is not in the groups? Then we skip.\n\n 16. But wait: what if d_target is negative? Then we skip because d_target = x - d, and d>=1, so d_target <= x-1. But x can be as small as 2, and d>=1, so d_target can be as low as 1 (if d=x-1). But if x=1, then d_target = 1-d, which would be negative if d>=1. However, the problem states: n, x from 2 to 200000. So x>=2, and d>=1, so d_target>=1 (if d<=x-1) and d_target>=1. But if d>x-1, then d_target<1, and we skip. \n\n    However, note: we are only storing groups for durations that appear. And we built groups from the input. So if d_target is negative, we skip. But our loop for d_target in dictA is only for positive durations that are in the groups.\n\n    Also, note: the duration d_i must be at least 1 and at most x-1 (so that d_target = x-d_i is at least 1 and at most x-1). But wait: d_i can be greater than x? Then d_target = x-d_i would be negative. But the problem says: the duration of Leha's vacation is x, and the total duration must be x. So we require d_i + d_j = x. Therefore, d_i must be <= x-1 (because d_j>=1). \n\n    However, the input does not guarantee that the duration d_i is <= x-1. So we should skip if d_i > x-1? \n\n    But note: if d_i > x-1, then d_target = x-d_i < 1, and we don't have such a group. So we skip.\n\n    Therefore, we can add:\n\n        if d_i > x-1: continue\n\n    But wait, the problem says: the total duration is x, so d_i must be <= x-1. \n\n    However, the input can have a voucher with duration greater than x-1. Then we cannot use it because then d_target would be negative or zero (not allowed). \n\n    So we can skip any voucher with d_i > x-1.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"Print a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print -1 if it's impossible\".\n\n    We can optimize by skipping vouchers with d_i > x-1. Because then they cannot form a pair (since d_j would be negative or zero). \n\n    Similarly, if d_i==0, but note: duration d_i = r-l+1>=1, so no.\n\n    Let me adjust:\n\n        for each voucher (l, r, cost, d):\n            if d > x-1:\n                continue   # because then d_target = x-d < 1, so no valid j.\n\n        But wait: what if d_i < 1? Not possible.\n\n        However, we are building groups for d>=1. But if d_i > x-1, then we don't want to consider this voucher.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for d, lst in groups.items():\n            if d > x-1:\n                del groups[d]\n\n        Then, when building dictA and dictB, we only consider d in [1, x-1]. But then, when we iterate over vouchers, we still have to consider that the voucher's d might be in the groups (which we filtered). \n\n    But note: we built groups from the input. We can filter the groups by d<=x-1.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        After reading, we can:\n\n            groups = defaultdict(list)\n            for ...:\n                d = r-l+1\n                if d <= x-1:   # then d_target = x-d >= 1, so valid\n                    groups[d].append(...)\n\n        Then, we build dictA and dictB only for d in [1, x-1] (and also d_target must be in [1, x-1]). \n\n        But note: d_target = x-d, and if d<=x-1 then d_target>=1, and also d_target<=x-1 (because d>=1 -> d_target<=x-1). \n\n        However, if d is in [1, x-1], then d_target is also in [1, x-1]. So we can build dictA and dictB for all d in [1, x-1] that appear.\n\n    But wait: what if d is 0? Not possible.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for each voucher, if d <= x-1, then add to groups. Then, when building dictA and dictB, we only consider the groups that have d in [1, x-1] (which we did).\n\n        Then, when iterating over vouchers, we only consider those vouchers with d<=x-1.\n\n        However, the input voucher might have d> x-1, then we skip.\n\n        But note: the problem says: two vouchers i and j (i≠j) such that d_i+d_j",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently processing the vouchers by grouping them based on their durations and then querying these groups to find valid pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration (i.e., the number of days they cover). This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers of a specific duration during the search for valid pairs.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Queries**: For each voucher, we determine the required duration of the complementary voucher (i.e., `x - current_voucher_duration`). Using binary search, we then check within the complementary group for vouchers that do not overlap with the current voucher. Specifically:\n   - **Condition A**: The start day of the complementary voucher must be after the end day of the current voucher.\n   - **Condition B**: The end day of the complementary voucher must be before the start day of the current voucher.\n3. **Suffix and Prefix Minimum Arrays**: For each duration group, we precompute suffix minimum arrays (for start days) and prefix minimum arrays (for end days) to quickly find the minimal cost voucher meeting the conditions above.\n4. **Iterate and Validate**: For each voucher, we check if its complementary duration exists. If it does, we use binary search to find valid complementary vouchers and keep track of the minimal total cost encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        d = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val, d))\n    \n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for (l, r, cost_val, d) in vouchers:\n        if d <= x-1:\n            groups[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n            \n    dictA = {}\n    dictB = {}\n    \n    for d, lst in groups.items():\n        sorted_by_l = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        l_vals = [item[0] for item in sorted_by_l]\n        costs = [item[2] for item in sorted_by_l]\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(costs)\n        if costs:\n            suffix_min[-1] = costs[-1]\n            for i in range(len(costs)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(costs[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n            dictA[d] = (l_vals, suffix_min)\n        \n        sorted_by_r = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        r_vals = [item[1] for item in sorted_by_r]\n        costs_b = [item[2] for item in sorted_by_r]\n        prefix_min = [0]*len(costs_b)\n        if costs_b:\n            prefix_min[0] = costs_b[0]\n            for i in range(1, len(costs_b)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min(costs_b[i], prefix_min[i-1])\n            dictB[d] = (r_vals, prefix_min)\n            \n    ans = float('inf')\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_val, d) in vouchers:\n        if d > x-1:\n            continue\n        d_target = x - d\n        candidate_ans = float('inf')\n        \n        if d_target in dictA:\n            l_vals_arr, suffix_min_arr = dictA[d_target]\n            low = 0\n            high = len(l_vals_arr) - 1\n            idx1 = -1\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                if l_vals_arr[mid] > r:\n                    idx1 = mid\n                    high = mid - 1\n                else:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                    \n            if idx1 != -1:\n                candidate_a = suffix_min_arr[idx1]\n            else:\n                candidate_a = float('inf')\n                \n            if d_target in dictB:\n                r_vals_arr, prefix_min_arr = dictB[d_target]\n                low = 0\n                high = len(r_vals_arr) - 1\n                idx2 = -1\n                while low <= high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if r_vals_arr[mid] < l:\n                        idx2 = mid\n                        low = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid - 1\n                        \n                if idx2 != -1:\n                    candidate_b = prefix_min_arr[idx2]\n                else:\n                    candidate_b = float('inf')\n            else:\n                candidate_b = float('inf')\n                \n            candidate_ans = min(candidate_a, candidate_b)\n            \n        if candidate_ans < ans:\n            ans = candidate_ans\n            \n    if ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of tuples, each representing a voucher's start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration. Only durations that could potentially form a valid pair (i.e., `d <= x-1`) are considered.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, two structures are built:\n   - **dictA**: A sorted list of start days with a suffix minimum array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher starting after a given day.\n   - **dictB**: A sorted list of end days with a prefix minimum array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher ending before a given day.\n4. **Querying for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks if a complementary voucher exists (i.e., one with duration `x - current_voucher_duration`). Using binary search, it finds valid non-overlapping vouchers and updates the minimal cost if applicable.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all vouchers, the minimal cost is printed. If no valid pair is found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
