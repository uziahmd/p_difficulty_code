Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row (index 2, which is the middle) the third character (index 2) is 's' but it should be part of the diagonal? \n   Actually, let's break down:\n\n   The diagonals:\n     Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) -> all should be 'x'\n     Other diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) -> also all should be 'x'\n\n   But note the center (2,2) is common to both diagonals. So we require that the entire diagonal is one letter and the other diagonal is the same letter (so both diagonals are the same letter).\n\n   Now, what about the rest?\n     In the example, the third row has an 's' at the center? Actually, the third row is \"soxoo\", meaning:\n        index0: 's', index1: 'o', index2: 'x', index3: 'o', index4: 'o'\n\n   But wait: the center is (2,2) which is the third row and third column. The center is part of both diagonals and must be 'x'. However, the example input has 's' at (2,0) and (2,1) and (2,3) and (2,4). \n\n   Actually, the example input says:\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n   Let me map the rows:\n      Row0: 'xooox'\n      Row1: 'oxoxo'\n      Row2: 'soxoo'\n      Row3: 'oxoxo'\n      Row4: 'xooox'\n\n   Now, the main diagonal: \n      (0,0): 'x'\n      (1,1): 'o' -> wait, no, in row1 the second character (index1) is 'x'? Actually, row1: \"oxoxo\" -> \n          index0: 'o', index1: 'x', index2: 'o', index3: 'x', index4: 'o'\n      So (1,1) is 'x' (if we consider 0-indexed, then the first character is at index0). \n\n   But wait, the example input says the first line is \"xooox\", so:\n      (0,0) = 'x'\n      (0,1) = 'o'\n      (0,2) = 'o'\n      (0,3) = 'o'\n      (0,4) = 'x'\n\n   Then the next row: \"oxoxo\"\n      (1,0) = 'o'\n      (1,1) = 'x'\n      (1,2) = 'o'\n      (1,3) = 'x'\n      (1,4) = 'o'\n\n   Then row2: \"soxoo\"\n      (2,0) = 's'\n      (2,1) = 'o'\n      (2,2) = 'x'\n      (2,3) = 'o'\n      (2,4) = 'o'\n\n   Then row3: \"oxoxo\" -> same as row1\n   Then row4: \"xooox\" -> same as row0.\n\n   Now, the main diagonal: \n        (0,0)='x', (1,1)='x', (2,2)='x', (3,3)='x', (4,4)='x' -> good.\n\n   The anti-diagonal: \n        (0,4)='x', (1,3)='x', (2,2)='x', (3,1)='x', (4,0)='x' -> good.\n\n   Now, the rest of the squares: \n        We need to check every cell that is not on either diagonal must be the same letter and different from 'x'.\n\n   Let's list the non-diagonal cells:\n\n   For row0: indices 1,2,3 -> but wait, (0,0) and (0,4) are diagonal. So in row0, non-diagonal are indices 1,2,3.\n        row0[1]='o', row0[2]='o', row0[3]='o'\n\n   For row1: indices 0,2,4 -> (1,1) is diagonal, so non-diagonals: 0,2,4.\n        row1[0]='o', row1[2]='o', row1[4]='o'\n\n   For row2: indices 0,1,3,4 -> (2,2) is diagonal, so non-diagonals: 0,1,3,4.\n        row2[0]='s', row2[1]='o', row2[3]='o', row2[4]='o'\n\n   Here we see: in row2, we have an 's' (at [2][0]) which is different from 'o'. Therefore, condition fails.\n\n   So the answer is \"NO\", which matches the example.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read n.\n   2. Read n lines.\n\n   3. Define two sets or lists for the diagonals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let grid be a list of n strings.\n\n   Condition 1: Check the two diagonals have the same letter.\n\n      main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n      anti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n   Then, we can check if all characters in main_diag are the same, and all in anti_diag are the same, and they are the same letter.\n\n   Condition 2: For every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal (i != j) and not on the anti-diagonal (i+j != n-1), the letter must be the same (let's call it '.') and '.' != the diagonal letter.\n\n   However, note: the center is common to both diagonals. We can avoid double-checking by marking the diagonals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can:\n\n   Step 1: Check that the two diagonals are uniform and the same letter.\n\n   Step 2: Check that for every cell (i, j):\n        if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): then the letter must be the diagonal_letter (say d)\n        else: the letter must be the same (say '.') and '.' != d.\n\n   But wait, we don't know the diagonal_letter until we check the diagonals.\n\n   However, we can do:\n\n   Let d1 = main_diag[0] and d2 = anti_diag[0]. Then we expect all of main_diag to be d1, and anti_diag to be d2, and d1 must equal d2.\n\n   Then, we can set the diagonal_letter = d1 (which equals d2).\n\n   Then, for every cell (i, j):\n        if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): \n            if grid[i][j] != d1 -> return \"NO\"\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != '.' -> then we have a problem, but wait: we don't know the non-diagonal letter? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: all other squares must contain the same letter (so we can pick the first non-diagonal letter we find and then check the rest) and that letter is different from d1.\n\n   But note: the non-diagonal letter can be any letter, not necessarily '.'.\n\n   Correction: The problem does not specify which letter is used for the non-diagonal. It just says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\". So we can let that letter be `other_char`.\n\n   However, we have two conditions:\n\n   Condition 1: The two diagonals are the same letter (say `d`).\n   Condition 2: Every non-diagonal cell must be the same letter (say `x`) and `x` != `d`.\n\n   So:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the two diagonals and check they are uniform and equal.\n\n        d1 = all(grid[i][i] == main_diag[0] for i in range(n))\n        d2 = all(grid[i][n-1-i] == anti_diag[0] for i in range(n))\n        if not (d1 and d2) or main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   Step 2: Find the non-diagonal letter.\n\n        We can look at the first cell that is not on a diagonal. Since the grid is at least 3x3, there will be some.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check for every cell:\n\n        We'll set:\n            diag_set = set()\n            for i in range(n):\n                diag_set.add((i,i))\n                diag_set.add((i, n-1-i))\n\n        Then, for a cell (i, j):\n            if (i, j) in diag_set: then we require grid[i][j] == d (the diagonal_letter)\n            else: we require grid[i][j] == other_char and other_char != d.\n\n        But how to determine other_char? We can take the first non-diagonal cell's letter and then check that every non-diagonal cell is that letter and different from d.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let d = main_diag[0] (which is same as anti_diag[0])\n\n   Then, we can:\n\n        other_char = None\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    if grid[i][j] != d:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if other_char is None:\n                        other_char = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n\n        Also, after collecting other_char, we must ensure that other_char != d.\n\n   However, note: what if there are no non-diagonal cells? But n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n   But wait: the center is included in both diagonals. So when n=3, the center is counted once. The rest are non-diagonal.\n\n   But there's a catch: if the grid is 3x3, then the non-diagonal cells are the four corners? Actually, no:\n\n        For 3x3:\n            Diagonals: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n            So non-diagonal cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\n        There are four non-diagonal cells.\n\n   However, our method: we set other_char from the first non-diagonal cell. Then we check all non-diagonal cells are that same letter.\n\n   But what if we have multiple non-diagonal cells? We require them to be the same.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Extract diagonals\n        main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        anti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        # Check condition 1: all in main_diag are the same, all in anti_diag are the same, and they are the same letter.\n        if len(set(main_diag)) != 1 or len(set(anti_diag)) != 1 or main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d = main_diag[0]  # the diagonal letter\n\n        # Now, we want to check the non-diagonal cells: they must all be the same letter and different from d.\n        # We'll traverse the grid and for each cell that is not on the diagonal, record the letter.\n\n        # But note: the center is included in both diagonals, so we skip it only once.\n\n        other_char = None\n        all_non_diagonal_same = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    # This is a diagonal cell, must be d\n                    if grid[i][j] != d:\n                        all_non_diagonal_same = False\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if other_char is None:\n                        other_char = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                        all_non_diagonal_same = False\n                        break\n            if not all_non_diagonal_same:\n                break\n\n        # Also, we must ensure that other_char is set and that other_char != d.\n        if not all_non_diagonal_same or other_char is None or other_char == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        This is the second example, expected \"YES\".\n\n        Let's break down:\n\n        n=3, grid:\n            ['wsw',\n             'sws',\n             'wsw']\n\n        Diagonals:\n            main_diag: [grid[0][0]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][2]='w'] -> all 'w'\n            anti_diag: [grid[0][2]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][0]='w'] -> all 'w'\n\n        Then, non-diagonal cells:\n            (0,1): 's'\n            (1,0): 's'\n            (1,2): 's'\n            (2,1): 's'\n\n        So other_char becomes 's' (from the first non-diagonal cell at (0,1)), and then we check the rest are 's'. And 's' != 'w' -> YES.\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Expected: \"NO\"\n\n        Diagonals:\n            main_diag: [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='p', grid[2][2]='e'] -> set(['x','p','e']) -> not uniform -> condition 1 fails -> NO.\n\n   But wait, our condition 1 checks that main_diag is uniform and anti_diag is uniform and they are the same.\n\n        main_diag: ['x','p','e'] -> not uniform -> condition fails -> prints \"NO\".\n\n   However, the example output is \"NO\", so that matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input was: \n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n   The anti-diagonal: \n        grid[0][2] = 'x'\n        grid[1][1] = 'p'\n        grid[2][0] = 'x'\n\n   So anti_diag = ['x','p','x'] -> not uniform, so condition 1 fails.\n\n   So our code correctly outputs \"NO\".\n\n   However, consider a case where the diagonals are uniform but the anti-diagonal is not the same as the main_diag?\n\n        Example: \n            n=3\n            aba\n            bbb\n            cac\n\n        main_diag: ['a','b','c'] -> not uniform -> condition 1 fails.\n\n   Another example: \n        n=3\n        aaa\n        aab\n        aaa\n\n        main_diag: ['a','a','a'] -> uniform, anti_diag: ['a','a','a'] -> uniform and same as main_diag. \n        Then non-diagonal cells:\n            (0,1): 'a' -> but wait, the non-diagonal letter must be different from 'a'. Here, we have an 'a' in non-diagonal.\n\n        So condition 2: other_char is 'a' (from (0,1)) and then we check the rest, and they are all 'a'? \n            (0,1): 'a' -> other_char='a'\n            (1,0): 'a' -> same\n            (1,2): 'b' -> different -> fails.\n\n        But wait, the grid is:\n\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        The non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\n        (0,1): 'a'\n        (1,0): 'a'\n        (1,2): 'b'\n        (2,1): 'a'\n\n        So we see 'a' and 'b' -> not uniform.\n\n        Our code would break at (1,2) because we set other_char='a' and then find 'b' != 'a'.\n\n   So the code seems correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition requires the non-diagonal letter to be the same. So we can also optimize by:\n\n        - First, check the two diagonals are uniform and same letter.\n        - Then, check that every non-diagonal cell is the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n   But wait, the problem does not specify which letter is the non-diagonal one. We don't know it. So we must:\n\n        Step 1: Check the two diagonals are uniform and the same letter (d).\n        Step 2: Check that every non-diagonal cell is the same letter (call it x) and x != d.\n\n   We did that.\n\n   One more edge: what if the grid is 1x1? but n>=3.\n\n   Let's run the example 2 again with our code:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = ['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw']\n\n        main_diag = ['w','w','w'] -> uniform and same for anti_diag: ['w','w','w'] -> same.\n\n        Then, we iterate through the grid:\n\n            i=0, j=0: (0,0) is diagonal -> check 'w'=='w' -> ok.\n            i=0, j=1: not diagonal -> set other_char = 's'\n            i=0, j=2: diagonal -> check 'w'=='w' -> ok.\n\n            i=1, j=0: not diagonal -> compare 's' (from grid[1][0]) with other_char 's' -> ok.\n            i=1, j=1: diagonal -> check 'w'=='w' -> ok.\n            i=1, j=2: not diagonal -> compare grid[1][2] which is 's' with other_char 's' -> ok.\n\n            i=2, j=0: diagonal -> check 'w'=='w' -> ok.\n            i=2, j=1: not diagonal -> compare grid[2][1] which is 's' with other_char 's' -> ok.\n            i=2, j=2: diagonal -> ok.\n\n        Then, we check: other_char is 's' and s != 'w' -> YES.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n            3\n            xxx\n            xxx\n            xxx\n\n        Diagonals: \n            main_diag: ['x','x','x'] -> uniform.\n            anti_diag: ['x','x','x'] -> uniform and same.\n\n        Then, non-diagonal cells: \n            We set other_char from the first non-diagonal cell, say (0,1): 'x'. Then we check that all non-diagonal cells are 'x'. \n            But then we require that other_char != d (which is 'x') -> fails.\n\n        So output \"NO\", which is correct because the non-diagonal cells must be a letter different from the diagonal.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Extract the two diagonals\n        main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        anti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        # Check condition 1: both diagonals are uniform and same letter\n        if len(set(main_diag)) != 1 or len(set(anti_diag)) != 1 or main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d = main_diag[0]\n\n        # Now, we need to check the non-diagonal cells: they must be the same and different from d.\n        other_char = None\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    if grid[i][j] != d:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if other_char is None:\n                        other_char = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n\n        # After the loops, check that we have a non-diagonal letter and it is different from d.\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif other_char is None: \n            # This means there are no non-diagonal cells? But n>=3, so there should be. But safe guard.\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif other_char == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   However, note: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Actually, for n>=3, the non-diagonal cells exist. But we break out if we find an invalid diagonal cell, so the non-diagonal part might not run.\n\n   But the problem states n>=3 and odd, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n   Let me test with n=3: the non-diagonal cells count is n*n - 2*n + 1 = 9-6+1 = 4, so always non-diagonal cells.\n\n   But wait, the formula for the number of diagonal cells is 2*n - 1, so non-diagonal is n*n - (2*n - 1) = (n-1)*(n-1) which for n=3 is 4.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, we can also use:\n\n        non_diagonal_set = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j and i+j != n-1:\n                    non_diagonal_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        Then, if len(non_diagonal_set) != 1: condition fails.\n\n        Also, the diagonal condition must hold.\n\n   But our current method is breaking early, which is efficient.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=5, grid as given.\n\n        Diagonals: both are 'x'\n\n        Then, we traverse and at row2 (index2) and column0 (index0): (2,0) is not diagonal (because 2!=0 and 2+0=2 != 4) -> so non-diagonal. We set other_char = 's' (from grid[2][0]).\n        Then, we continue and at row2, column1: (2,1) -> non-diagonal, we compare with 's': grid[2][1] is 'o' -> not 's'. So we break and say \"NO\".\n\n   This matches.\n\n   We can submit this solution.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the diagonals is that they are the same letter, but we use main_diag[0] for both. What if the main_diag is uniform but anti_diag is uniform but with a different letter? \n\n        Example: \n            n=3\n            aaa\n            aab\n            aaa\n\n        Actually, wait, we already check that main_diag[0] == anti_diag[0]. So if they are uniform but different, we catch that.\n\n   Another example:\n\n        n=3\n        aba\n        bbb\n        bab\n\n        main_diag: ['a','b','b'] -> not uniform -> caught.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: we break the inner loop and then the outer loop. We use two breaks (break and then break again). Alternatively, we can use a flag and break appropriately.\n\n   We can also use:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if (i == j or i+j == n-1):\n                    if grid[i][j] != d:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n                else:\n                    if other_char is None:\n                        other_char = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Then after the loops, check that other_char != d and we have set other_char (which we do because there is at least one non-diagonal cell)\n        if other_char == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait, we must check the diagonals first. And then we break the entire program if we find a diagonal cell with wrong letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can restructure:\n\n        Step 1: Check diagonals are uniform and same letter. If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n        Step 2: Check all diagonal cells are the same letter d. (We already did that in step1, so we know d is the letter for diagonals.)\n\n        Then, we check the non-diagonal cells.\n\n        But note: in step1, we only checked that the diagonals are uniform and same. However, we did not check that every diagonal cell is the same as d (we did: because we checked the entire main_diag and anti_diag). \n\n        So we can proceed.\n\n   However, the above code using two breaks and then a final check is acceptable.\n\n   But to avoid nested breaks and exits, we can use a function and return.\n\n   Since the problem is small (n<300, so maximum 300*300=90000 cells) we can do:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check the two diagonals\n        d1 = grid[0][0]\n        d2 = grid[0][n-1]\n        # Check main diagonal: all same and d1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal: all same and d2\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Now, if the diagonals are not the same letter, then NO.\n        if d1 != d2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d = d1\n\n        # Now, we know the diagonals are uniform and same. Check the non-diagonal cells.\n        # We'll collect the non-diagonal letter and check they are all the same and not d.\n        other_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    # Already checked the diagonals, so we can skip this part? \n                    # But wait, we did the entire diagonal check above, so we know they are d.\n                    # So we don't need to check again? However, the problem says the entire grid must satisfy the conditions.\n                    # But the diagonals are already checked. So we can skip the diagonal cells.\n\n                    # Actually, we can skip the diagonal cells entirely.\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    if other_char is None:\n                        other_char = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check that we have at least one non-diagonal cell and that other_char != d.\n        if other_char is None or other_char == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait, we did a separate check for the diagonals. That is, we verified that every diagonal cell is d1 (for main) and d2 (for anti) and then we checked d1==d2.\n\n   However, what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter? We check d1==d2 and if not, we output \"NO\".\n\n   But in the above, we broke the diagonal checking into two separate loops. \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check main diagonal: all same\n        d1 = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal: all same\n        d2 = grid[0][n-1]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        if d1 != d2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d = d1\n\n        # Now, check the non-diagonal cells: they must be the same letter and not d.\n        # We can skip the diagonal cells.\n\n        # But note: the anti-diagonal check used d2, which we know is equal to d1, so d=d1=d2.\n\n        # Now, let other_char be the letter for non-diagonals.\n        other_char = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                c = grid[i][j]\n                if other_char is None:\n                    other_char = c\n                else:\n                    if c != other_char:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Now, if we found at least one non-diagonal cell (which we do for n>=3) and other_char != d:\n        if other_char == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? Then other_char remains None. But for n>=3, we have non-diagonal cells.\n\n   However, if n=1, then there are no non-diagonal cells, but n>=3.\n\n   But wait, the problem says n>=3 and odd.\n\n   This version is more efficient because we skipped the diagonal cells.\n\n   But wait: the two separate diagonal checks: we did the main diagonal and then the anti-diagonal. We set d1 and d2, and then checked d1==d2. Then we set d=d1.\n\n   Then, in the non-diagonal part, we skip the diagonals.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, we must ensure that the entire grid is being checked for the non-diagonal condition. \n\n   But note: the condition for the diagonals is that they are uniform and the same letter. We did that.\n\n   But what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform but the center is the same? \n\n        Example: \n            n=3\n            xxx\n            xxx\n            xxx\n\n        Then, d1 = 'x', d2 = 'x', and then we set d='x'. Then we check non-diagonal: \n            non-diagonal cells: \n                (0,1): 'x' -> other_char='x'\n                (0,2): skip (diagonal)\n                (1,0): non-diagonal: 'x' -> same as other_char\n                (1,2): non-diagonal: 'x' -> same\n                (2,0): skip (diagonal)\n                (2,1): non-diagonal: 'x' -> same\n\n        Then, we check: other_char == d -> 'x'=='x' -> NO.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the non-diagonal is that they are the same and different from d. So we require that the non-diagonal letter is not d. \n\n   However, in the above example, the non-diagonal cells are all 'x' (same as d) -> so we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   Another example: \n        n=3\n        aba\n        bab\n        aba\n\n        Diagonals: \n            main: ['a','b','a'] -> not uniform -> caught in the first diagonal check.\n\n   So I think we can use this version.\n\n   However, the first version (with list comprehensions) is also acceptable and clear. But the above version avoids building lists for the diagonals.\n\n   Considering performance: n<300, so building two lists of 300 elements is negligible.\n\n   But the above version does two passes for the diagonals (each of length n) and then one pass for the entire grid (skipping diagonals). The original version built two lists and then one pass. \n\n   They are similar in complexity.\n\n   Let me choose the first version for clarity and simplicity.\n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify which is better. I'll stick with the first version that uses list comprehensions for the diagonals, because it is straightforward.\n\n   However, let me run the example with the first version and the second version on the same example.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=5, grid as given.\n\n        First version:\n\n            main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(5)] -> ['x','x','x','x','x']? Wait, no:\n\n            row0: 'xooox' -> [0][0]='x'\n            row1: 'oxoxo' -> [1][1]='x'\n            row2: 'soxoo' -> [2][2]='x'\n            row3: 'oxoxo' -> [3][3]='x'\n            row4: 'xooox' -> [4][4]='x'\n\n            anti_diag = [grid[i][4-i] for i in range(5)] -> \n                i0: grid[0][4] = 'x'\n                i1: grid[1][3] = 'x'\n                i2: grid[2][2] = 'x'\n                i3: grid[3][1] = 'x'\n                i4: grid[4][0] = 'x'\n\n            Then, condition: set(main_diag)=={'x'} and set(anti_diag)=={'x'} and main_diag[0]==anti_diag[0] -> yes.\n\n            Then, we go to the non-diagonal part:\n\n            We traverse the grid and at row2, col0: (2,0) -> not diagonal (because 2!=0 and 2+0=2 !=4) -> set other_char = 's'\n\n            Then, row2, col1: (2,1) -> not diagonal -> compare with 's': grid[2][1] is 'o' -> not equal -> break and output \"NO\".\n\n        Second version (using two loops for diagonals) would also break at the same point.\n\n   So both versions are equivalent.\n\n   I'll go with the first version because it is more direct in expressing the problem.\n\n   Final code (first version):\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Extract the two diagonals\n        main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        anti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        # Check condition 1: both diagonals are uniform and same letter\n        if len(set(main_diag)) != 1 or len(set(anti_diag)) != 1 or main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d = main_diag[0]\n\n        # Now, we need to check the non-diagonal cells: they must be the same and different from d.\n        other_char = None\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    if grid[i][j] != d:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if other_char is None:\n                        other_char = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif other_char is None or other_char == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait, there is a possibility: what if the grid has a diagonal cell that is not d? We break and print \"NO\". \n\n   This covers.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the diagonals is that they are uniform and same letter. But if the diagonals are uniform and same, then every diagonal cell is d. So we don't need to check the diagonals again in the nested loops? \n\n   Actually, we do: because the condition for the diagonals is necessary, but the problem requires that the diagonals are the same letter AND the non-diagonals are the same letter and different. \n\n   But if the diagonals are uniform and same, then we already know the diagonal cells are d. However, our initial condition only checks that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the given grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are:\n1. Both diagonals of the grid must consist of the same letter.\n2. All other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Verify that all elements in both diagonals are the same letter and that these letters are identical.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** Ensure that all cells not on either diagonal contain the same letter, which must be different from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Output Result:** If both conditions are satisfied, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1 or len(set(anti_diag)) != 1 or main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\nd = main_diag[0]\n\nother_char = None\nvalid = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if grid[i][j] != d:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        else:\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    if not valid:\n        break\n\nif not valid:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif other_char is None or other_char == d:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check:** The main diagonal and anti-diagonal are extracted. The code checks if all elements in both diagonals are the same and if these same letters are identical across both diagonals.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** The code then verifies that all cells not on the diagonals contain the same letter, which must differ from the diagonal letter. This is done by iterating through each cell, skipping those on the diagonals, and checking consistency among the remaining cells.\n4. **Result Determination:** Based on the checks, the code prints \"YES\" if all conditions are met; otherwise, it prints \"NO\". The solution efficiently handles edge cases and ensures correctness by systematically validating each condition.",
