And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we compute the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of sleep times in all weeks.\n\n Then, the average is S / (number_of_weeks) = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: How do we compute S?\n We can precompute the prefix sum array to quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Alternatively, note that each element ai might appear in multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position i (0-indexed) will appear in \n max(0, min(k, n-i+1)) ... Actually, let's see:\n\n The first week starts at index 0, so the element at index i appears in weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n - k) [if we consider the week must be of length k and end at most n-1].\n\n Alternatively, the element at index i is included in the week starting at j if j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, i.e., j <= i and j >= i-k+1. So the number of weeks that include the element is:\n   L = max(0, i - k + 1)   [the earliest start index] but wait, we have to consider the start index from 0 to n-k.\n Actually, the condition for a week starting at j (0-indexed) to include the element at i is:\n   j <= i <= j+k-1   =>   j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n And j must be in [0, n-k] (because there are n-k+1 weeks).\n\n So the number of weeks that include the element at i is:\n   count_i = min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total sum S by:\n   S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (number of weeks that include i)\n\n But we can also use a sliding window to compute the sum for each week and then add them up.\n\n However, note the constraints: n and k up to 200,000. We cannot iterate over each week (which would be O(n*k)).\n\n Instead, we can use a prefix sum to calculate the sum for each week in O(1) and then iterate over the weeks (O(n)).\n\n Steps:\n   Step 1: Read n, k and the list of a.\n   Step 2: Precompute the prefix sum array, say `pref`, where:\n        pref[0] = 0\n        pref[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]\n\n   Then the sum of the week starting at j (from 0 to n-k) is: \n        week_sum(j) = pref[j+k] - pref[j]\n\n   Then total_sum = sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (pref[j+k] - pref[j])\n\n   Then the average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: The example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n        weeks: [3,4] -> 7, [4,7] -> 11\n        total_sum = 7 + 11 = 18\n        average = 18 / 2 = 9.0\n\n However, we can also compute without using the prefix sum for each week separately? Actually, we can use the prefix sum to avoid recalculating the entire week each time.\n\n But note: We are only asked for the average over all weeks. We can use:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        for j in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_sum += (pref[j+k] - pref[j])\n\n   Then output total_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n However, note: This is O(n) which is acceptable for n up to 200,000.\n\n But wait: the prefix array is built with O(n) and then we iterate over n-k+1 weeks (which is about n) so overall O(n). \n\n Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer or sliding window to compute the total_sum in one pass.\n\n But the above method is straightforward.\n\n However, we can also think: \n\n        total_sum = sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (sum of a[j:j+k])\n\n        = (a0 appears in the first k weeks?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently summing the sleep times for each week and then computing the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous subarrays (weeks) of length `k` in a sequence of `n` days. Each week's total sleep time is the sum of its elements, and the average is the total sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\n2. **Intuition**: The key observation is that each element in the sequence contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position `i` appears in `min(i + 1, k, n - i)` weeks. However, a more efficient approach is to use a prefix sum array to compute the sum of any week in constant time.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: This array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in O(1) time. We first construct the prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the sequence up to index `i-1`.\n   - **Sliding Window**: Using the prefix sum array, we can compute the sum of each week (subarray of length `k`) by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the week from the prefix sum at the end of the week. \n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The algorithm involves two main steps: building the prefix sum array (O(n)) and iterating over each week (O(n)), resulting in an overall O(n) time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The prefix sum array requires O(n) space, which is optimal for this problem given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    pref = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_sum = 0.0\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    for start in range(num_weeks):\n        end = start + k\n        total_sum += (pref[end] - pref[start])\n        \n    average = total_sum / num_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the week length `k`, and the sequence of sleep times.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` is zero (though the problem constraints ensure `k >= 1`), it defaults to printing \"0.0000000000\".\n3. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix sum array `pref` is built where each element `pref[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the sequence.\n4. **Summing Week Totals**: For each possible week (starting from index 0 to `n - k`), the sum of the week is computed using the prefix sum array. This sum is accumulated into `total_sum`.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is computed by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging prefix sums to minimize repeated calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
