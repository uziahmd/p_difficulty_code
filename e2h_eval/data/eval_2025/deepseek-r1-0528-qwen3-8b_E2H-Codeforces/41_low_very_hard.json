There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m (all between 1 and 50) and then m lines of restrictions.\n Since n, m are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities.\n\n However, note that the profit function is a^2, and we have linear constraints on intervals (each restriction gives an upper bound on the maximum in the interval).\n\n Observation: The problem has two parts:\n   1. Each house i can be built with a height a_i in [0, h] (but note: if there's a restriction that covers house i, then a_i must be <= the minimum x from any restriction covering i).\n   2. The restrictions are: for each restriction j (l_j, r_j, x_j), the maximum height in [l_j, r_j] must be <= x_j.\n\n Since n and m are small (<=50), we can consider the following:\n\n Approach:\n   - First, we can precompute for each house i the minimum allowed maximum value in every interval that contains i? Actually, we need to know the tightest restriction for each house.\n\n However, note: the restrictions are independent and each says that in [l_i, r_i] the max must be <= x_i. Therefore, for house i, the maximum height we can assign is the minimum x_j among all restrictions j such that i is in [l_j, r_j]. But note: if no restriction covers house i, then we can use up to h.\n\n But wait: it's not that simple. Because if we set house i to a value less than the tightest restriction that covers it, then we might break a condition elsewhere? Actually, no: the conditions are about the maximum in the entire interval. So for house i, the condition is that it must be at most the minimum x_j for which the restriction j covers i? Actually, no: the condition is that for each restriction j, the entire interval [l_j, r_j] must have houses <= x_j. So for house i, we must have a_i <= x_j for every restriction j that includes i. Therefore, the maximum allowed for house i is min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} {x_j} (if there are multiple, we take the minimum). However, note that there might be no restriction, then we take h as the base? But actually, the problem says \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\", so without any restriction, the house can be at most h.\n\n However, wait: what if there is a restriction that covers house i with x_j=0? Then house i must be 0. Similarly, if there are multiple restrictions, the house must be at most the minimum x_j.\n\n But note: the problem states that the city has m zoning restrictions. There might be overlapping restrictions. So:\n\n   Let R[i] = min{ x_j | j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }   (if there is no restriction covering i, then R[i] = h? Actually, we can set R[i] to a very large number if no restriction, but then we want to cap at h. Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   For each house i, the maximum allowed height is min( h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j ) ?\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\". So the base maximum is h. Then the restrictions further reduce it. So yes, we can define:\n\n   Let max_height[i] = min( h, min_{j: [l_j, r_j] contains i} x_j )\n\n But note: the example: \n      Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n      House 1: only restriction 1 -> x1=1 -> max_height[0]=min(3,1)=1.\n      House 2: only restriction 2 -> x2=3 -> max_height[1]=min(3,3)=3.\n      House 3: only restriction 3 -> x3=2 -> max_height[2]=min(3,2)=2.\n\n However, consider the second example:\n      Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n      House 1: no restriction? -> max_height[0]=10.\n      House 2: covered by first restriction (x=8) and no other? -> max_height[1]=min(10,8)=8.\n      House 3: covered by both restrictions -> min(8,7)=7.\n      House 4: covered by second restriction (x=7) -> max_height[3]=min(1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height `h`, but must comply with all zoning restrictions that apply to its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each house's maximum allowable height is constrained by the tightest restriction covering its position. A restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. Therefore, for each house, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of all the restrictions' heights that include it, or `h` if no such restrictions exist.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, compute the tightest restriction by checking all restrictions that include the house's position. This gives the maximum height allowed for that house. Once we have these constraints, the problem reduces to selecting heights for each house (within their respective constraints) such that the sum of the squares of these heights is maximized.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50), a dynamic programming approach is feasible. However, a simpler method involves directly computing the maximum allowable height for each house and then determining the optimal height for each house independently. Since the profit function is quadratic and separable, the optimal height for each house is simply the maximum allowed height (as higher values yield higher profits until the constraint is reached).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Processing each restriction to determine the tightest constraint for each house: O(n*m).\n   - Calculating the profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights: O(n).\n   The overall complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n        index += 3\n    \n    max_allowed = [h] * n\n    \n    for l, r, x_val in restrictions:\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < max_allowed[i]:\n                max_allowed[i] = x_val\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed:\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the small constraints.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code checks all houses within the specified range and updates their maximum allowable height to the minimum value encountered among all restrictions affecting them.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: After determining the maximum allowable height for each house, the profit is computed by summing the squares of these heights. This is because the profit function (height squared) is maximized when each house is built at its maximum allowed height.\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal profit by leveraging the separability of the profit function and the independence of each house's height decision under its constraints.",
