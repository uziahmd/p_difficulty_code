He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n But note: we are not directly solving for n given m, but rather for a given m, we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function Z(n) is non-decreasing. Also, note that sometimes consecutive n's have the same number of trailing zeros (like from 5 to 9, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, etc).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Let this be L.\n 2. Then, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Let this be R.\n    Then, the numbers n for which Z(n) = m are the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n But wait: what if there is no n with Z(n) = m? Then the set is empty.\n\n However, note that the function Z(n) is known to take every integer value from 0 upwards without skipping any? Actually, no. It jumps. For example, when n goes from 4 to 5, we get 0 to 1. Then from 24 to 25, we get 4 to 6 (jumping from 4 to 6). So sometimes a particular m might be skipped.\n\n Therefore, we must check that there exists an n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n We want to find the set S_m = {n | Z(n) = m}\n\n We can do:\n\n   Step 1: Find the minimal n0 such that Z(n0) >= m.\n   Step 2: Check if Z(n0) == m. If yes, then we start from n0 and go until we hit a number where Z(n) becomes m+1.\n\n   But note: it's possible that we jump over m. For example, if we are looking for m=5, then we might have:\n\n        Z(24) = 4, Z(25) = 6 -> so m=5 is skipped.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot assume that m is achieved.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n)\n\n   We want to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, we check:\n\n        If f(n) != m, then there is no n with exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"positive integers n\". And we are to output:\n\n        First, k (the number of such n), then the list of these k integers in increasing order.\n\n   But wait, note the example: \n        Input: 1 -> Output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n   How does that work?\n\n        n=5: Z(5)=1, n=6: Z(6)=1, n=7:1, n=8:1, n=9:1, n=10:2.\n\n   So for m=1, the n's are from 5 to 9.\n\n   How about m=0?\n        Then n from 1 to 4: Z(1)=Z(2)=Z(3)=Z(4)=0.\n\n   But note: the input constraint is m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   However, the problem states: m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000)\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let low = 0, high = something big. What should be the upper bound?\n\n        We know that Z(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/5 * (1/(1-1/5)) = n/4. So we need an n such that n/4 >= m -> n >= 4*m.\n\n        But also, because of the floor, we can set high = 5*m (or maybe 5*m+some) but note that sometimes we skip m, but we are only concerned with the existence.\n\n        Actually, we are going to do two binary searches:\n\n        First, find the minimal n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n        Second, find the minimal n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the product. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the problem reduces to counting the number of factors of 5 in \\( n! \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). This involves a helper function `zeroes(n)` that calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing \\( \\lfloor n/5 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/25 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/125 \\rfloor + \\ldots \\) until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Check Valid Range**: Once we find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `low`) where the trailing zeroes are at least \\( m \\), we check if the trailing zeroes exactly equal \\( m \\). If not, there are no numbers \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. \n\n3. **Determine Valid Numbers**: If the trailing zeroes at `low` is exactly \\( m \\), we then find the next number `high` where the trailing zeroes become \\( m+1 \\). The valid numbers \\( n \\) are all integers from `low` to `high - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    base = 5\n    while n >= base:\n        count += n // base\n        base *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m + 100\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if zeroes(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    if zeroes(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high_bound = low\n        high = 5 * m + 100\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if zeroes(mid) < m + 1:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        k = low - 1 - (0 if low == 0 else 0)\n        start = low\n        end = low - 1 + (low < high_bound)\n        numbers = list(range(start, end + 1))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        if numbers:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function `zeroes(n)`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) and summing the quotients. Each quotient represents the number of times the current power of 5 divides into \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound (`low`)**: The binary search starts with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to a sufficiently large value (5*m + 100). It adjusts `high` based on whether the midpoint's trailing zeroes are less than \\( m \\), narrowing down to the smallest \\( n \\) where trailing zeroes are at least \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Validation and Upper Bound Calculation**: After finding `low`, if the trailing zeroes at `low` are not exactly \\( m \\), the solution outputs 0. Otherwise, another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where trailing zeroes exceed \\( m \\) (i.e., reach \\( m+1 \\)). The valid numbers are all integers from `low` to one less than this upper bound.\n\n4. **Output**: The solution prints the count of valid numbers followed by the numbers themselves in increasing order. If no numbers satisfy the condition, it simply prints 0. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible time complexity.",
