            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (for Roman).\n The second line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to an integer (base 10) first, then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    But note: the input number is given in base a (which can be as low as 2 and as high as 25). Also, the input string for the number may have leading zeros, but its length is up to 1000.\n\n 2. If b is not 'R', then we have two bases: a and b (both between 2 and 25). We convert the number from base a to base b.\n\n However, note: the input number is given in base a and may contain digits beyond 9? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So the string c can have digits from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' onward (but note: base a is at most 25, so the digits can go from 0 to 24, which means we might see digits up to 'X' if base is 24? Actually, base 11: digits are 0-9 and 'A' (which is 10), base 12: 0-9, 'A','B', etc.)\n\n But note: the example input includes:\n   '12 13\\nA' -> output 'A'\n\n However, wait: \n   Input: \"12 13\\nA\"\n   This means: base a=12, base b=13, and the number is \"A\" in base 12. \n   What is A in base 12? It's 10 (decimal). Then we convert 10 (decimal) to base 13. \n   In base 13, 10 is represented as 'A'.\n\n Steps for conversion when b is not 'R':\n\n   Step 1: Convert the given string (which is in base a) to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n        We can do this by processing each digit (character) of the string. Since the base a can be up to 25, we map:\n          - For characters in '0'-'9': value = int(char)\n          - For characters in 'A'-'Z': value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        But note: the input string may have leading zeros and the length can be up to 1000. However, the decimal value might be very large (up to 25^1000, which is huge). \n\n   However, the problem states: \n        \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\"\n\n   But wait: 10^1510 is a very big number. However, note that the input string is at most 1000 digits, and the base a is at most 25. The maximum value would be 25^1000, which is about 10^1505 (since log10(25^1000) = 1000 * log10(25) ~ 1000 * 1.39794 ~ 1398). So it is less than 10^1510.\n\n   But we cannot use standard integer conversion for such a big number because Python integers can handle arbitrary precision, but we must be cautious of performance.\n\n   Alternatively, we can convert the number from base a to base b without going through decimal? But that is more complex.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that if the second part is R, then the decimal representation (if we were to compute it) is at most 300010 (so we can safely convert to an integer). But for the other cases, the number can be very large (up to 10^1510) and converting to decimal would require handling very big integers.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is guaranteed to be <= 300010 and not zero. So we can safely convert to decimal for the Roman case.\n\n   For the other case (b is a base between 2 and 25), we have two options:\n\n   Option 1: Convert the input string from base a to a decimal integer (which might be very big, but the problem says it won't exceed 10",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves handling two main scenarios: converting between standard bases and converting from a standard base to Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values which include the source base `a`, the target base `b` (which might be 'R' for Roman numerals), and the number string `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: If the target base is not 'R', first convert the number string from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, mapping them to their respective values, and accumulating the total value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal integer to a Roman numeral. This requires breaking down the number into its constituent Roman numeral components (thousands, hundreds, tens, and units) and mapping each component to its corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Base Conversion**: For standard base conversion (when `b` is not 'R'), convert the decimal integer to the target base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting the remainders, which are then mapped to the appropriate digits (including letters for values greater than 9).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Invalid input\", e)\n        return\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        # Convert the number from base a to decimal\n        num_val = 0\n        neg = False\n        if num_str[0] == '-':\n            neg = True\n            num_str = num_str[1:]\n        if not num_str:\n            num_val = 0\n        else:\n            for char in num_str:\n                if char in '0123456789':\n                    d = int(char)\n                else:\n                    d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                if d >= a:\n                    print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                    return\n                num_val = num_val * a + d\n\n        if num_val == 0:\n            print(\"N/A\")\n            return\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400), ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40), ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n            while num_val >= value:\n                res.append(numeral)\n                num_val -= value\n        print(''.join(res))\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Invalid base\", e)\n            return\n\n        num_val = 0\n        neg = False\n        if num_str[0] == '-':\n            neg = True\n            num_str = num_str[1:]\n        if not num_str:\n            num_val = 0\n        else:\n            for char in num_str:\n                if char in '0123456789':\n                    d = int(char)\n                else:\n                    d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                if d >= a:\n                    print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                    return\n                num_val = num_val * a + d\n\n        if num_val == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n\n        if neg:\n            num_val = -num_val\n\n        digits = []\n        while num_val:\n            r = num_val % b\n            num_val //= b\n            if r < 10:\n                digits.append(str(r))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n        result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the first line to get the source base `a` and target base `b`, and the second line to get the number string `c`.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The number string is converted to a decimal integer by processing each character. Digits are mapped to their numerical values, considering both numeric characters and letters (for bases higher than 10).\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard base conversion, the decimal number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders mapped to digits (including letters for values 10 and above). The remainders are collected in reverse order to form the result string.\n5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles negative numbers, leading zeros, and ensures that invalid inputs (like digits exceeding the source base) are caught and reported.",
