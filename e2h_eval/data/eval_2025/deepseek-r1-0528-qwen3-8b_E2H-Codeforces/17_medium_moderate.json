He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and then 2n-2 strings (each of length from 1 to n-1). There are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1: one prefix and one suffix of some string s of length n.\n\n However, we don't know which is which. We have to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that:\n 1. There are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes (so the same number of P and S, total 2n-2 characters).\n 2. The assignment is consistent with at least one string s of length n.\n\n But note: It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation:\n For a string s of length n, we know that:\n   - The set of prefixes: [s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1]]\n   - The set of suffixes: [s[1:], s[2:], ..., s[n-1:]]\n\n We are given exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n Since the entire string s is not known, we can consider the following:\n\n Let's denote by L the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n We know that the two strings of length 1 must be the first character (as prefix) and the last character (as suffix). Similarly, for other lengths.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to recover the exact string, but to assign labels 'P' and 'S' to the input strings.\n\n Important: The problem states that if there are several possible answers, we can print any.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea 1: Since the entire string s is of length n, we can try to determine the string by looking for consistency conditions.\n\n However, note the guarantee: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\"\n\n Alternate idea:\n\n Consider the following: \n   - The shortest strings (length 1) must be either the first character (prefix) or the last character (suffix).\n\n But note: what if the first and last characters are the same? Then we have two identical strings of length 1. Then we cannot tell which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix? Actually, no: wait, we have two strings of length 1. They could be the same or different.\n\n Example: Input \"2\\na\\nc\" -> output \"PS\" (which means the first string is prefix and the second is suffix). But also note: the string could be \"ac\" or \"ca\". In the example, they provided the answer \"PS\".\n\n Another example: Input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" -> Output can be \"PPSS\", but note that the two strings are given in arbitrary order. So we might see two 'a' and two 'aa'. \n\n How do we assign?\n\n Conditions that must hold for the entire string s of length n:\n\n Let s = s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}\n\n Then:\n   Prefix of length 1: s0\n   Suffix of length 1: s_{n-1}\n\n   Prefix of length 2: s0 s1\n   Suffix of length 2: s_{n-2} s_{n-1}\n\n   ...\n\n Also, the entire string must match the prefix and the suffix in the overlapping parts.\n\n However, note: We don't know the entire string, but we have all the prefixes and suffixes.\n\n Another idea: use the fact that the prefix of length k must end with the suffix of length k? Not necessarily.\n\n But note: the problem says that the set of prefixes and suffixes is given, and we know that there exists at least one string s of length n that produces these.\n\n We can try to reconstruct the string s by:\n\n   s[0] must be the prefix of length 1.\n   s[-1] must be the suffix of length 1.\n\n But wait, what if the two strings of length 1 are the same? Then s0 = s_{n-1}. Then for the next ones:\n\n   The prefix of length 2 is s0 s1, and the suffix of length 2 is s_{n-2} s_{n-1}. And we know s0 and s_{n-1} are the same.\n\n However, we don't know which of the two strings of length 2 is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n\n   Let the two strings of length 1 be A and B (they might be the same). Then the string s must start with one of them and end with the other. But wait, actually:\n\n   The prefix of length 1 is s0, and the suffix of length 1 is s_{n-1}. So if we have two distinct strings of length 1, then one must be the prefix and the other the suffix. If they are the same, then s0 = s_{n-1}.\n\n But note: the problem says there are exactly two strings for each length. So for length 1, we have two strings. They might be the same or different.\n\n However, in the example: \n   Input \"2\\na\\nc\" -> two strings: ['a','c'] (distinct). So we assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n   Input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\": Here, for length 1: two 'a's, and for length 2: two 'aa's.\n\n How can we assign?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let L be the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n We can group the strings by their length.\n\n Then, we have two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n Now, we need to assign each string as either a prefix or a suffix.\n\n Conditions for consistency:\n\n   For the entire string s, we must have:\n     Let p_i be the prefix of length i, and s_i be the suffix of length i.\n\n     Then, the prefix of length i must start with the prefix of length i-1 (if we consider building the string from the beginning), and similarly the suffix of length i must end with the suffix of length i-1.\n\n   But note: we don't know the entire string, so we can try to check:\n\n     Condition 1: The two strings of length 1: one is the first character (prefix) and the other is the last (suffix).\n\n     Condition 2: The two strings of length 2: one is the first two characters (prefix) and the other is the last two (suffix). But note: the last two characters of s are the suffix of length 2, and the first two are the prefix.\n\n     However, the prefix of length 2 must start with the prefix of length 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the suffix of length 1.\n\n     But wait: what if we assign the prefix of length 1 as the wrong one? We must assign the correct one.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can try to assign the two length-1 strings: one must be the prefix (so the first character) and the other the suffix (last character). Then, for length 2, we have two strings. We know that the prefix of length 2 must start with the chosen prefix of length 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the chosen suffix of length 1.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify the order of the input. The input order is arbitrary.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and the 2n-2 strings.\n\n 2. Group the strings by length.\n\n 3. We know that the entire string s has length n, so the prefix of length k is the first k characters, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\n 4. We have two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n 5. We need to assign each string to either prefix or suffix.\n\n Conditions for a valid assignment:\n\n   Let the assignment be a function f: {strings} -> {'P','S'}.\n\n   Then, for k from 1 to n-1:\n        There is exactly one string of length k that is assigned 'P' and one that is assigned 'S'.\n\n   Additionally, the following must hold for the entire string s:\n\n        s[0] is the prefix of length 1 (assigned 'P').\n        s[-1] is the suffix of length 1 (assigned 'S').\n\n        The prefix of length 2: must be s[0:2] and must start with s[0].\n        The suffix of length 2: must be s[-2:] and must end with s[-1].\n\n        Similarly, for length k: the prefix of length k must be s[0:k] and the suffix of length k must be s[n-k:n].\n\n        Also, the entire string must be consistent: the prefix of length k must be the first k characters, and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters.\n\n        Moreover, the two sets (prefixes and suffixes) must be consistent with the same string s.\n\n But note: we don't know s. However, we can build s from the prefixes? Or from the suffixes?\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Let A be the set of prefix strings and B the set of suffix strings.\n\n   Then, the entire string s must be such that:\n        s = A_1 (the prefix of length 1)\n        s must end with B_1 (the suffix of length 1)\n\n        The prefix of length 2 (A_2) must be s[0:2] and must equal A_1 + s[1] (but we don't know s[1]). Similarly, the suffix of length 2 (B_2) must be s[-2:] and must equal s[-2:-1] + B_1.\n\n   However, we can also relate the prefixes and suffixes:\n\n        The prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must have the same starting and ending characters for the overlapping part.\n\n        Specifically, for k=2, the prefix of length 2 is the two-character string, and the suffix of length 2 is the two-character string. They are independent except for the entire string.\n\n   But note: the entire string s must satisfy:\n\n        s[0:k] = (prefix of length k)\n        s[n-k:n] = (suffix of length k)\n\n        and for k>=2, we must have that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k share the same character at the appropriate positions if k is more than the distance from the beginning and end? Actually, the entire string must be the same.\n\n   However, we can also note:\n\n        The prefix of length 1 and the suffix of length 1 must be the first and last character.\n\n        Then, the prefix of length 2 must be the first two characters, and the suffix of length 2 must be the last two. And the entire string must have:\n\n          s[0] = prefix1\n          s[-1] = suffix1\n\n          s[0:2] = prefix2\n          s[-2:] = suffix2\n\n        Then, the entire string must be:\n\n          [prefix2][suffix2][?] but wait, for n=3, we have:\n\n          s0, s1, s2.\n\n          prefix2: s0+s1, suffix2: s1+s2.\n\n          Then, we have:\n\n            s0 = prefix1 (from the prefix of length1)\n            s2 = suffix1 (from the suffix of length1)\n\n            s0+s1 = prefix2\n            s1+s2 = suffix2\n\n          Then, from prefix2, we get s1 = prefix2[1]. Then from suffix2, we get s1 = suffix2[0] and s2 = suffix2[1]. But we already know s2 is from the length1 suffix.\n\n        So for n=3, we can check:\n\n          Let the two length1: [a, b] -> then one is the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n          Then, for length2: we have two strings, say x and y.\n\n          Then, if we assign the prefix1 = a, then the prefix2 must start with a. Similarly, the suffix2 must end with b (if we assigned the suffix1 as b). Then, the entire string would be:\n\n            s0 = a, s1 = x[1] (if x is the prefix2) and s2 = b.\n\n            Then, the suffix2 should be s1 + s2 = x[1] + b. But we have two possibilities for which string is the prefix2 and which is the suffix2.\n\n        However, we are given two strings for length2: x and y. One must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n        Conditions:\n\n          If we assume the prefix2 is x and the suffix2 is y, then:\n            x[0] == a and y[1] == b.\n\n          Then, the string is a + x[1] + b, and the suffix2 must be x[1] + b. So we require y == x[1] + b.\n\n          Similarly, if we swap: prefix2 is y and suffix2 is x, then:\n            y[0] == a and x[1] == b, and then the entire string is a + y[1] + b, and the suffix2 must be y[1] + b, so x must be y[1] + b.\n\n        But note: we have two possibilities for the assignment of the two length1 strings: either a is prefix and b is suffix, or vice versa.\n\n        However, we know that the entire string must have length n=3, and we have two length1 strings and two length2 strings.\n\n        Let me try the example: Input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\"\n\n        The input: \n          n=3\n          Strings: ['a','aa','aa','a']\n\n        Group by length:\n          length1: ['a','a']\n          length2: ['aa','aa']\n\n        Possibilities for length1: \n          Option1: assign one 'a' as prefix and the other as suffix -> then the entire string must have first character 'a' and last character 'a'.\n          Then for length2: two strings of 'aa'. \n\n          Then, the prefix of length2 must be 'aa', so the first two characters are 'aa'. Then the string is \"a a ?\" and the last character is 'a'. So the string is \"aaa\". Then the suffix of length2 must be the last two: \"aa\", which matches.\n\n          So the assignment for the two length1: both are 'a'. We can assign arbitrarily? But wait, we have two identical strings.\n\n          However, the condition: the two length1 strings are both 'a'. Then we can assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n          Then, for the two length2 strings: they are both 'aa'. Then we can assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n          But note: the condition for the entire string: \n            prefix1 = 'a' (first char)\n            suffix1 = 'a' (last char)\n            prefix2 = 'aa' (first two chars) -> so the string starts with \"aa\"\n            suffix2 = 'aa' (last two chars) -> so the string ends with \"aa\"\n\n          Then the entire string must be \"aaa\", which indeed satisfies.\n\n        But how do we decide the order of the output? The input order is arbitrary. We have to output a string of length 2n-2 (which is 4 for n=3) of 'P' and 'S'. The number of P and S must be equal (n-1 each, so 2 of each).\n\n        We have two ways to assign the two length1: we can assign the first occurrence of 'a' as 'P' and the second as 'S', or the opposite.\n\n        Similarly for the two length2.\n\n        However, note: the entire string must be consistent. But in this case, both assignments for the length1 and length2 are consistent because the two strings are the same.\n\n        But wait, if we assign the first 'a' (in the input order) as 'P' and the second 'a' as 'S', then the two length2 strings: we can assign arbitrarily. Similarly, if we assign the first 'a' as 'S' and the second as 'P', that would also be consistent? Actually, no: because the entire string must have the same first character (prefix1) and the same last character (suffix1). \n\n        But note: the two length1 strings are the same. So it doesn't matter which one we assign as prefix and which as suffix. The entire string must have first character 'a' and last character 'a'. Then the two length2 strings: we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the problem says that the assignment must be consistent. The condition for the entire string is that the prefix of length k must be the first k characters and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters.\n\n        Since the entire string is \"aaa\", then the prefix2 is \"aa\" and the suffix2 is \"aa\". So both are correct. But the assignment of the two length2 strings: we have two strings \"aa\" and \"aa\". So we can assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n        Therefore, we have multiple solutions.\n\n        How to choose?\n\n        The problem says: if there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Step 1: For each length from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n\n          Step 2: We need to assign each string to either 'P' or 'S' such that:\n\n                  - The set of prefixes (all the 'P' strings) and the set of suffixes (all the 'S' strings) are consistent.\n\n          How to check consistency?\n\n          We can try to build the entire string s from the prefixes, and then check that the suffixes of the same length as the ones we assigned as suffixes match the built string.\n\n          But we don't know which ones are the prefixes and which are the suffixes.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n          Note: The entire string s must be of length n. The prefixes are uniquely determined by the first character and then the subsequent characters.\n\n          We know the two strings of length 1: let them be A and B. Then the entire string must start with one and end with the other.\n\n          Then, the two strings of length 2: one must be the first two characters and the other the last two.\n\n          Then, the entire string must satisfy:\n\n            s0 = A (if we assign A as prefix1) or B (if we assign B as prefix1)\n            s_{n-1} = the other one.\n\n          Then, for the two strings of length 2, say X and Y:\n\n            If we assume that the prefix2 is X, then the first two characters are X[0] and X[1]. But we already fixed s0. So X[0] must equal s0.\n\n            Similarly, if we assume that the suffix2 is Y, then the last two characters are Y[0] and Y[1] (meaning the second last is Y[0] and the last is Y[1]), and we know the last character is s_{n-1}. So Y[1] must equal s_{n-1}.\n\n          Then, the entire string is built from the prefix of length 2 (if we have that) and the suffix of length 2 (if we have that) must match the last two.\n\n          However, we don't know which of the two length2 strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          We can iterate over the possible assignments for the two length1 strings (there are two possibilities: either the first occurrence is prefix and the second is suffix, or the reverse). But wait, what if there are more than two distinct strings? Actually, the grouping by length is done, and the two strings of a given length are distinct or not?\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1.\" and \"consisting only of lowercase Latin letters\", and \"these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n          So, we can consider:\n\n            Let groups = {k: [s1, s2] for k in range(1, n)}\n\n          But note: the input order is arbitrary, so we don't know which one is which.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n          Let the two length1 strings be A and B.\n\n          Then, the entire string s must have:\n\n            s0 = either A or B, and the last character is the other.\n\n          Then, for the two length2 strings, say X and Y:\n\n            If we assume s0 = A and s_{n-1}=B, then:\n\n                The prefix of length2 must start with A, so one of X or Y must start with A. Similarly, the suffix of length2 must end with B, so one of X or Y must end with B.\n\n            Then, the remaining string (the other one) must be the other type.\n\n          But wait, what if the two length2 strings are the same? Then we have two identical strings. Then we must assign one as prefix and one as suffix. But then the condition: the prefix must start with A and the suffix must end with B. So if the string is, say, \"AB\", then if A='a' and B='b', then \"AB\" starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'. Then we can assign that one string as both? No, we have two copies. Actually, we have two copies of \"AB\", so we can assign one copy as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n          But note: the entire string s must be of length n. Then, if n=3, we have:\n\n            s0 = A, s_{2}=B.\n\n            The prefix of length2 is s0+s1 = A+s1 = \"AB\" => so s1 = 'B' (if AB is the prefix2) and then the entire string is \"AB?\" (where ? is the third character, which is B). Then the suffix of length2 is s1+s2 = B+B. So we require that the suffix of length2 is BB. But we have two copies of AB. So we cannot form BB from AB? \n\n          Wait, in the example above, we assumed the two length2 strings are both \"AB\". Then we must assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n          Then, the prefix of length2 is \"AB\", so s0=A, s1=B.\n          The suffix of length2 is \"AB\", so s1=A, s2=B.\n\n          Then we have s1 must be both B and A. This is only possible if A==B.\n\n          So if A != B, then we cannot have the two length2 strings being \"AB\" (with A and B different) because then we get a contradiction on s1.\n\n        Therefore, we must have:\n\n          If we assign the two length1 strings as (A, B) (with A being prefix and B being suffix), then:\n\n            The prefix of length2 must start with A, and the suffix of length2 must end with B.\n\n            Moreover, the entire string s must be built from the prefix2 and the suffix2, and the middle part must be consistent.\n\n        But note: we have multiple lengths. We can check from the smallest to the largest.\n\n        However, the problem size is small (n<=100, but the total strings are 2n-2, which is 198 at worst, but n>=2, so maximum 198, but actually 2*99+1? Wait, n from 2 to 100, so 2n-2 from 2 to 198). But n is at most 100, so we have up to 198 strings.\n\n        We can try to assign the two length1 strings in two ways (if they are distinct) and then propagate the assignment for the rest.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let groups = {}\n          For each string in the input (after reading n and the 2n-2 lines):\n            l = len(string)\n            groups.setdefault(l, []).append(string)\n\n          Then, we have groups for keys 1 to n-1, each having two elements.\n\n          Now, we consider two possibilities for the length1 group:\n\n            Possibility 1: assign the first string in groups[1] as prefix and the second as suffix.\n            Possibility 2: assign the first string in groups[1] as suffix and the second as prefix.\n\n          But wait, what if the two strings in groups[1] are the same? Then both possibilities are the same.\n\n          Then, for each possibility, we try to assign the rest of the groups (for lengths from 2 to n-1) by:\n\n            For a given length k, we have two strings: X and Y.\n\n            We know the entire string s must be built from the prefixes. We can use the prefix of length k to extend the string from the beginning, but we don't know the entire string.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            We know the entire string s must have:\n\n              s0 = chosen_prefix1\n              s_{n-1} = chosen_suffix1\n\n            Then, for the prefix of length k: it must be s[0:k] and must be one of the two strings in groups[k].\n\n            Similarly, the suffix of length k must be s[n-k:n] and must be the other.\n\n            But we don't know which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n            Conditions for a candidate assignment for a given k:\n\n              Let the two candidates for length k be A and B.\n\n              Then, if we assign A as prefix and B as suffix, then:\n\n                 Condition1: A must start with the prefix of length (k-1) if k>1? Actually, the prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k-1 extended by one character. But wait, we don't have the entire string. However, we can use the prefix of length k-1 (which we have already assigned) to check the next character.\n\n              But note: we don't have the entire string, so we can use the suffix of length k to check the end.\n\n            Actually, we can use the fact that the entire string must be consistent from the beginning and from the end.\n\n            However, we can also use the following:\n\n              The prefix of length k must be the same as the first k characters of the entire string.\n\n              The suffix of length k must be the same as the last k characters.\n\n            And the entire string must satisfy:\n\n              s[0:k] = prefix_k (if we assign it as prefix)\n              s[n-k:n] = suffix_k (if we assign it as suffix)\n\n            Then, the two parts must meet in the middle. But we don't know the entire string.\n\n          Another idea: use the known prefix1 and suffix1 to fix the ends, then use the prefix2 to fix the second character, and then the suffix2 to fix the second last, etc.\n\n          Steps for propagation:\n\n            We'll build an array s[0..n-1] initially unknown, except:\n\n              s[0] = chosen_prefix1 (if we assigned the first string of length1 as prefix) OR chosen_suffix1 (if we assigned the first string of length1 as suffix) -> wait, no: we have two possibilities.\n\n            Actually, we fix the entire string s as:\n\n              s[0] = the prefix of length1 (if we assign that string as prefix) OR the suffix of length1 (if we assign that string as prefix? no, wait: the prefix of length1 is the first character, the suffix of length1 is the last character).\n\n            So:\n\n              Possibility 1: \n                  s0 = groups[1][0]   (if we assign groups[1][0] as prefix)\n                  s_{n-1} = groups[1][1]   (if we assign groups[1][1] as suffix)\n\n            Then, for k=2:\n\n              We have two strings in groups[2]: A and B.\n\n              Then, the prefix of length2 must be A (if we assign A as prefix) and then s1 = A[1] (because s0 is known).\n\n              The suffix of length2 must be B (if we assign B as suffix) and then s_{n-2} = B[0] (because the last two are s_{n-2} and s_{n-1}, and s_{n-1} is known, so B must be s_{n-2} + s_{n-1}).\n\n              Then, we have two possibilities for the assignment for length2:\n\n                Option1: assign A as prefix and B as suffix.\n                Option2: assign B as prefix and A as suffix.\n\n              Then, check:\n\n                For Option1:\n                  The prefix of length2 is A, so the second character s1 = A[1] (if A has length2, then A[0] is the first character (which must be s0) and A[1] is the second.\n\n                  Condition: A[0] == s0. (which is groups[1][0])\n\n                  Then, the suffix of length2 is B, so the second last character s_{n-2} = B[0] and the last character is B[1] which must equal s_{n-1} (groups[1][1]).\n\n                  Condition: B[1] == s_{n-1}.\n\n                For Option2:\n                  The prefix of length2 is B, so B[0] == s0 and s1 = B[1].\n                  The suffix of length2 is A, so A[1] == s_{n-1}.\n\n              Then, we can choose the option that satisfies the conditions.\n\n            Then, we can continue for k=3, etc.\n\n          However, note: the two strings in groups[k] are independent, and we have to assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n          But the condition for the prefix of length k: it must be the first k characters. We can build the prefix from the previous prefix? Actually, we know the entire string s must be consistent: the prefix of length k is the prefix of length k-1 (if we have that) extended by one character. But we don't have the entire string, but we can use the fact that the prefix of length k-1 is already known (if we have assigned it as prefix) and then the next character must be the one that completes the prefix of length k.\n\n          Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the suffix of length k-1 (if we have assigned it as suffix) extended by one character at the beginning? Actually, the suffix of length k is the previous suffix (length k-1) without the last character and then the new character at the beginning? No, the suffix of length k is the substring from index n-k to n-1. The suffix of length k-1 is the substring from n-(k-1) to n-1, so the suffix of length k is the substring from n-k to n-(k-1)-1 (wait, no). Actually, the suffix of length k is the last k characters, so the suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters, which is the last k characters without the first character of the last k.\n\n          Therefore, the suffix of length k is the suffix of length k-1 without its first character? No, wait: \n\n            Let s = s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}\n            Suffix of length k: s_{n-k} s_{n-k+1} ... s_{n-1}\n\n            Suffix of length k-1: s_{n-(k-1)} ... s_{n-1}\n\n            So the suffix of length k is: s_{n-k} + (suffix of length k-1 without the first character?) -> no, because the suffix of length k-1 starts at s_{n-(k-1)} which is s_{n-k+1}. \n\n            Actually, the suffix of length k is the string of k characters, and the suffix of length k-1 is the last k-1 characters, so the first character of the suffix of length k is s_{n-k}, and the suffix of length k-1 is s_{n-k+1} ... s_{n-1}.\n\n            So we cannot directly get the suffix of length k from the suffix of length k-1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the entire string s we are building. But we are building s from the beginning with the prefixes and from the end with the suffixes.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let s_arr = [None] * n   # to be filled\n\n            Step 1: Assign the two length1 strings.\n\n            Step 2: For k from 2 to n-1 (in increasing order):\n\n                We have two strings for length k: X and Y.\n\n                We need to assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n                Conditions:\n\n                  If we assign X as prefix and Y as suffix:\n\n                    Condition for prefix: X must be the next part of the current prefix. But we know the prefix of length k-1 (if we have built the first k-1 characters). Then, the prefix of length k must be the prefix of length k-1 plus one character. However, we haven't built the entire string? Actually, we can use the prefix of length k-1 to determine the k-th character.\n\n                    Specifically, if we have already assigned a prefix of length k-1 (which is the first k-1 characters), then the prefix of length k must be that prefix plus one character.\n\n                    Similarly, the suffix of length k must be the last k characters, and we know the last character (from length1) and the suffix of length k-1 (if we have assigned one) and then the (n-k)th character must be the first character of the suffix of length k.\n\n                    But note: we are building the string from the beginning and from the end. We can also use the suffix of length k-1 to determine the (n-k+1)th character (the last character of the prefix part) and then the suffix of length k gives the (n-k)th character.\n\n                This becomes messy.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that n is at most 100, but the total number of strings is 2n-2 (about 200) and the depth is n-1 (about 100) and at each step we have two choices, we cannot iterate over 2^(n-1) possibilities.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Insight:\n\n          The entire string s must be the same regardless of whether we build from the front or the back.\n\n          We know the first character and the last character.\n\n          Then, the second character is determined by the prefix of length2 (if we assign the prefix of length2) or by the suffix of length2 (if we assign the suffix of length2)? Actually, no: the prefix of length2 gives the second character, and the suffix of length2 gives the second last character.\n\n          But wait, the second character is the same as the second character from the front, and the second last character is the same as the one from the back.\n\n          Then, the condition for the entire string is that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be compatible with the previously determined characters.\n\n        We can use a greedy method:\n\n          We'll maintain:\n\n            s_known_front = [None]*n   # the part we know from the front (prefixes)\n            s_known_back = [None]*n    # the part we know from the back (suffixes)\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Assign the two length1 strings.\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                s_known_front[0] = groups[1][0]\n                s_known_back[n-1] = groups[1][1]\n\n            Step 2: For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n                Let the two strings be A and B.\n\n                We have two possibilities: (A as prefix, B as suffix) or (B as prefix, A as suffix).\n\n                For possibility (A as prefix, B as suffix):\n\n                  Condition1: The prefix part: we know the first k-1 characters (if k-1 >= 1) and the next character must be A[k-1] (the k-th character) if we are extending the prefix.\n\n                  But wait, the prefix of length k is A. Then, the first k characters are A. So we must have:\n\n                      s_known_front[0:k] = A   (if we haven't fixed them before, but we might have fixed some from shorter prefixes)\n\n                  However, we have built the string from the front using the prefixes of length 1,2,...,k-1. So we have s_known_front[0:k-1] already. Then, the next character (at index k-1) must be A[-1] (if A is the prefix of length k) and also must be consistent with the suffix side? \n\n                  Alternatively, we can build the entire string from the front and then check the suffix part.\n\n                But note: we are also assigning the suffix of length k as B. Then, the last k characters must be B. But we also know the last character (from length1) and the last k-1 characters (if we have built them from longer suffixes) are already known from the suffixes of lengths 2 to k-1.\n\n                Actually, we are building from the front and from the back simultaneously.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n              We know the entire string must have:\n\n                s0 = groups[1][0] (if we chose possibility1) and s_{n-1}=groups[1][1]\n\n              Then, the prefix of length2: if we assign it, then s0 and s1 are fixed.\n\n              The suffix of length2: if we assign it, then s_{n-2}",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their lengths to ensure consistency with the properties of prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem provides `2n-2` strings, which are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of the unknown string `s` (excluding the full string itself). Each length from 1 to `n-1` has exactly two strings: one prefix and one suffix. The task is to assign each string to either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that the assignments form a valid string `s`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The first character of `s` must be the prefix of length 1, and the last character must be the suffix of length 1. For longer strings, the prefix of length `k` must start with the prefix of length `k-1`, and the suffix of length `k` must end with the suffix of length `k-1`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Grouping by Length**: Group all input strings by their lengths. There will be two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`.\n   - **Initial Assignment**: Start by assigning the two strings of length 1. One must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n   - **Propagation**: For each subsequent length from 2 to `n-1`, determine the correct assignment by checking consistency with previously assigned prefixes and suffixes. Specifically, a candidate prefix must start with the known prefix of the previous length, and a candidate suffix must end with the known suffix of the previous length.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each string once and checks consistency in linear time relative to the string length. Given the constraints (n ≤ 100), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(total_strings):\n        strings.append(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n        \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in groups:\n            groups[l] = []\n        groups[l].append(s)\n        \n    result_chars = []\n    used = {length: [False, False] for length in range(1, n)}\n    \n    for length in range(1, n):\n        candidates = groups[length]\n        if len(candidates) != 2:\n            continue\n            \n        found_assignment = False\n        for i in range(2):\n            for j in range(2):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n                    \n                candidate_prefix = candidates[i]\n                candidate_suffix = candidates[j]\n                \n                if length == 1:\n                    result_chars.append('P')\n                    used[1][i] = True\n                    result_chars.append('S')\n                    used[1][j] = True\n                    found_assignment = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    prev_length = length - 1\n                    if used[prev_length][0] and used[prev_length][1]:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    if not used[prev_length][0] or not used[prev_length][1]:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    prev_prefix = None\n                    for idx, cand in enumerate(groups[prev_length]):\n                        if used[prev_length][idx]:\n                            prev_prefix = cand\n                            break\n                            \n                    if prev_prefix is None:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    if candidate_prefix.startswith(prev_prefix):\n                        if not used[length][i]:\n                            used[length][i] = True\n                            result_chars.append('P')\n                            found_assignment = True\n                            break\n                            \n                    if candidate_suffix.endswith(groups[prev_length][1 - idx]):\n                        if not used[length][j]:\n                            used[length][j] = True\n                            result_chars.append('S')\n                            found_assignment = True\n                            break\n                    \n            if found_assignment:\n                break\n                \n        if not found_assignment:\n            for idx, cand in enumerate(candidates):\n                if not used[length][idx]:\n                    used[length][idx] = True\n                    if len(cand) == 1:\n                        result_chars.append('P' if 'P' not in result_chars[-2:] else 'S')\n                    else:\n                        result_chars.append('P' if 'S' not in result_chars[-2:] else 'S')\n                    break\n                    \n    output_string = ''.join(result_chars)\n    print(output_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the integer `n` (length of the string `s`) and the `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Initial Assignment**: For strings of length 1, they are directly assigned as 'P' and 'S' since they must be the first and last characters of `s`.\n4. **Propagation for Longer Strings**: For each subsequent length, the algorithm checks which of the two strings can be a prefix (must start with the prefix of the previous length) or a suffix (must end with the suffix of the previous length).
