And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and a list of n integers.\n We consider every contiguous subarray (week) of length k. There are (n - k + 1) weeks.\n For each week, we compute the sum of sleep times, then we want to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the average per week, but the overall average of the sleep time over all weeks.\n\n Let S = total sum of sleep times in all weeks.\n\n Then, the average is S / (number_of_weeks) = S / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: How do we compute S?\n We can precompute the prefix sum array to quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Alternatively, note that each element ai might appear in multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position i (0-indexed) will appear in \n max(0, min(k, n-i+1)) ... Actually, let's think:\n\n The first week starts at index 0, so the element at index i appears in weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n - k) [if we consider the week must be of length k and end at most n-1].\n\n Alternatively, the element at index i is included in the week starting at j if j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, i.e., j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j must be in [0, n-k] (since there are n-k+1 weeks).\n\n So the number of weeks that include a_i is:\n   left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   right_bound = min(i, n - k)   [because the last week that includes a_i must start at most i (if i is the last index, then the week must start at i-k+1, but also the week must start at most n-k)]\n\n Actually, the number of weeks that include a_i is: \n   count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   The element at index i is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) inclusive? \n\n Actually, the starting index j must satisfy: j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). Therefore, the number of such j is:\n   L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n   R = min(i, n - k)\n   Then, if L <= R, then the count is R - L + 1, else 0.\n\n But note: we have n-k+1 weeks, so the starting indices go from 0 to n-k.\n\n However, we can also note that the total sum S is the sum for each i of a_i * (number of weeks containing a_i)\n\n Then, we can compute S by iterating i from 0 to n-1 and multiplying a_i by the number of weeks that contain it.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read n, k and the list a.\n  2. Precompute the prefix sum for the entire list? Or we can compute the counts without prefix.\n\n But note: the constraints are up to 200,000. We can do a single pass.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the entire set of weeks is (n-k+1). But we can also compute the total sum by:\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        # Count the number of weeks that include a[i]\n        # The first week that includes a[i] is the one starting at max(0, i-k+1)\n        # The last week that includes a[i] is the one starting at min(i, n-k)  [since the week must end at or before n-1, so the start must be at least i-k+1 and at most i, but also the week must start at most n-k]\n\n        # Actually, the condition for the week starting at j is: j <= i < j+k.\n        # So j must be in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)] (but note: the week must start at j and j<=n-k, and j>=0, and j<=i and j>=i-k+1).\n\n        low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high = min(i, n - k)   # because the last week that can include a[i] is the one starting at i (if i <= n-k) or if i>n-k then the last week is n-k? Actually, no: the week must start at j and j+k-1 <= n-1 => j <= n-k.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks (contiguous subarrays of length `k`) in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all these weeks and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all contiguous subarrays of length `k` in the given sequence. The challenge is to compute this efficiently without resorting to a brute-force method, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n2. **Key Insight**: Each element in the sequence contributes to multiple weeks. Specifically, an element at position `i` appears in all weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. The total contribution of each element to the overall sum is its value multiplied by the number of weeks it appears in.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. However, instead of processing each week individually, we leverage the observation about the contribution of each element. This allows us to compute the total sum by iterating through each element once and multiplying its value by the number of weeks it appears in.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        for num in a:\n            total_sum += num\n    else:\n        for i in range(n):\n            low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high = min(i, n - k)\n            count = high - low + 1 if high >= low else 0\n            total_sum += a[i] * count\n            \n    average = total_sum / num_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of a week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing sleep times.\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `k` is 1, each day is considered a week, so the total sum is simply the sum of all sleep times.\n3. **General Case**: For `k > 1`, we iterate over each element in the list. For each element at position `i`, we determine how many weeks include it by calculating the valid range of starting indices for these weeks. The element's value is multiplied by this count and added to the total sum.\n4. **Output**: The average is computed by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`), formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the contributions of each element in constant time, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
