Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour.\n   - After burning, each candle becomes a burned candle.\n   - Then, we can take 'b' burned candles to make a new one.\n\n We can think of it as:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   burned_candles = 0\n\n However, note that we can use the burned candles to create more candles, which then become burned after burning.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We start by having 'a' candles. We burn them all, so we get 'a' hours and 'a' burned candles.\n   Then, from these 'a' burned candles, we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we are left with a % b burned candles.\n   Then we can use the new candles (which are made from the burned ones) to burn again, and so on.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total = 0\n   Let remaining = a\n   Let recycled = 0\n\n But actually, we can simulate:\n\n   while remaining > 0:\n        total += remaining   # because we burn all the current candles\n        recycled += remaining   # these will become burned\n        remaining = recycled // b   # how many new candles we can make from the recycled burned ones\n        recycled = recycled % b    # leftover burned candles\n\n However, note: In the next iteration, the new candles are made from the recycled burned ones, and when we burn them we get more burned candles.\n\n But wait, in the above simulation, we are counting the initial 'remaining' as the current candles to burn, and then we update the number of candles for the next round from the recycled burned ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   cycle = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n        hours += candles\n        # Now we burn these candles, so they become burned and we can recycle them\n        # But note: we can use the burned candles to form new ones\n        # The total burned candles now is candles (from this round) plus any leftovers from previous recycling?\n        # Actually, we need to keep track of the total burned candles.\n\n   Instead, let's reframe:\n\n   We start with 'a' candles. We burn them -> we get a burned candles and we have a hours.\n   Then we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we have a % b leftover burned candles.\n\n   Then we burn the new candles -> we get additional floor(a / b) hours and then those become burned, so we add floor(a / b) to the burned count, then we can make floor((a//b + a % b) / b) new candles, and so on.\n\n   So:\n\n   total = 0\n   current_burned = 0\n   current_candles = a\n\n   But we can also accumulate the burned candles from each burning.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while a > 0:\n        total += a\n        # Burn 'a' candles, so we get 'a' burned candles\n        total_burned = a + leftover   # the leftover from previous rounds plus the current a\n        new_candles = total_burned // b\n        leftover = total_burned % b\n        a = new_candles\n\n   But wait, let's test with the example \"4 2\":\n\n   Step 1: a=4, leftover=0\n        total = 4\n        total_burned = 4+0 = 4\n        new_candles = 4//2 = 2\n        leftover = 0\n        a becomes 2\n\n   Step 2: a=2, leftover=0\n        total = 4+2 = 6\n        total_burned = 2+0 = 2\n        new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n        leftover = 0\n        a becomes 1\n\n   Step 3: a=1, leftover=0\n        total = 6+1 = 7\n        total_burned = 1+0 = 1\n        new_candles = 1//2 = 0\n        leftover = 1\n        a becomes 0\n\n   This gives 7, which matches.\n\n   However, note that in step 3 we have leftover 1, but we don't use it because a becomes 0.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n\n   Step 1: a=6, leftover=0\n        total = 6\n        total_burned = 6+0=6\n        new_candles = 6",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be combined to create new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (a) and the number of burned candles needed to make a new one (b).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: While there are candles available (either initially or newly created from burned ones), burn them all. Each burning session adds the number of candles burned to the total hours.\n3. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning the candles, calculate how many new candles can be made from the total burned candles (including any leftovers from previous recycling). The leftover burned candles after creating new ones are carried over to the next iteration.\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when no more new candles can be created (i.e., when the number of burned candles is less than b).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring that we maximize the total burning time by utilizing all possible resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while a > 0:\n        total_hours += a\n        total_burned = a + leftover\n        new_candles = total_burned // b\n        leftover = total_burned % b\n        a = new_candles\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are candles (`a`) to burn. In each iteration:\n   - **Total Hours Calculation**: The current number of candles (`a`) is added to `total_hours`, representing the hours these candles will burn.\n   - **Burned Candles Calculation**: The total burned candles is the sum of the current candles (`a`) and any leftover burned candles from previous iterations (`leftover`).\n   - **New Candles Creation**: The number of new candles (`new_candles`) is calculated by dividing the total burned candles by `b`. The remainder (`leftover`) is the number of burned candles that couldn't form a complete set for a new candle.\n   - **Update Candles**: The variable `a` is updated to `new_candles`, allowing the loop to continue with the newly created candles.\n3. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the total hours (`total_hours`) is printed, which is the maximum time Vasily can light his room.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by continuously recycling burned candles into new ones until no more can be created, thus maximizing the total burning time.",
