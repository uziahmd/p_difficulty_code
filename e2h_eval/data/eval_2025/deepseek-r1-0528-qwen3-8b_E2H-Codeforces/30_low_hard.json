Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (1 <= n <= 18) and a string A of exactly 2n digits.\n We have two players, Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number.\n\n The goal is to maximize the total prize: S1 (Homer's number) + S2 (Marge's number).\n\n However, note that the sequence of moves matters. At each turn, one of the players is chosen to move.\n\n Since both players must make exactly n moves, the entire sequence of 2n moves will be a string of n 'H' and n 'M' in some order.\n\n How does the game work?\n   Initially, A is the given string of 2n digits.\n   For each move:\n        Let the current leftmost digit be d.\n        The moving player appends d to their own number.\n\n   Then the digit d is removed from the front of A.\n\n The catch: The players can choose the order of moves. But note that the entire sequence must have n H's and n M's.\n\n We want to maximize: (value of S1) + (value of S2)\n\n Observation:\n   The entire set of digits is fixed. The two numbers S1 and S2 are built by taking some digits from the front of A (in order) and assigning them to either H or M.\n\n   The total value is: \n        S1 = d1 * 10^(k1-1) + d2 * 10^(k2-1) + ...   [for the digits assigned to H, in the order they appear]\n        Similarly for S2.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire set of digits is being partitioned into two sequences (each of length n). The order of digits in each number is fixed by the order they appear in A.\n\n   However, the assignment to H and M can be interleaved arbitrarily as long as each gets n moves.\n\n   Let the original string be A[0:2n].\n\n   Suppose we assign the digits at positions i1, i2, ..., in (in increasing order of indices) to H, and the rest to M (which will then be at positions j1, j2, ..., jn, also in increasing order).\n\n   Then:\n        S1 = A[i1] * 10^(n-1) + A[i2] * 10^(n-2) + ... + A[in] * 10^0\n        S2 = A[j1] * 10^(n-1) + A[j2] * 10^(n-2) + ... + A[jn] * 10^0\n\n   But note: The moves are taken from the front. The first move takes the first digit, the next from the remaining string (so the second digit originally becomes the first of the remainder). However, the assignment is not independent: the digits are taken in order from left to right. The only freedom is which player takes which digit when.\n\n   Actually, the entire process is equivalent to: \n        We are going to assign each digit to either H or M, and the digits are used in the order of A.\n\n   However, the catch is that the assignment must be done in such a way that the moves are interleaved (the sequence of moves must be a string with n H's and n M's). But note: the problem does not require us to output the sequence that maximizes the total, but any sequence that achieves the maximum.\n\n   How to think:\n\n   We are effectively building two numbers from the same set of digits, and the digits are fixed in order (the first digit must be assigned to someone, then the next, etc.). The value of each number depends on which digits are assigned and the position (the earlier the digit, the higher the power of 10).\n\n   So we want to assign the largest digits to the highest place values. However, note that the two numbers are built simultaneously. The first move (first digit) goes to one of the players, and that player's number gets multiplied by 10 (and then the digit is added) for the subsequent moves? Actually, no: the subsequent moves add digits to the left? \n\n   Wait: The problem says \"On its turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si.\" So the first move: if H moves, then S1 becomes the first digit. Then the next move: the leftmost digit is now the second one, so if H moves again, then S1 becomes (first_digit)(second_digit) -> which is (digit0)*10 + digit1. Similarly, if M moves first, then S2 becomes the first digit.\n\n   Therefore, the numbers are built from left",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given number A. The goal is to determine an optimal sequence of moves (a string consisting of 'H' and 'M' characters) such that each player makes exactly n moves, and the sum of their resulting numbers is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the digits of a 2n-digit number A into two sequences (one for each player) of length n each. The digits must be taken in order from left to right, but the assignment to players can be interleaved. The key insight is that the value of each player's number depends on the digits they pick and their positions (higher place values contribute more). \n\n2. **Intuition**: To maximize the sum, we should assign higher-value digits to higher place values. This means the first digit picked by a player contributes the most (10^(n-1)), the second digit picked contributes less (10^(n-2)), and so on. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to explore all possible ways to split the digits between the two players. The DP state tracks the current position in the number, the count of digits assigned to each player, and the current contributions of both players' numbers. The DP table is filled by considering whether the next digit should be assigned to Homer or Marge.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The DP approach efficiently explores all possible assignments by memoizing states (current position, counts of moves per player, and partial sums). The solution then backtracks from the optimal state to construct the sequence of moves.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The DP state has dimensions (2n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1), leading to a time complexity of O((2n) * n * n) = O(8n³), which is feasible given n ≤ 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n_line = data[0].strip()\n    n_val = int(n_line)\n    \n    A_line = data[1].strip()\n    A_str = A_line\n    \n    if len(A_str) != 2 * n_val:\n        n_val = len(A_str) // 2\n        \n    dp = {}\n    s1 = 0\n    s2 = 0\n    total_moves = 2 * n_val\n\n    def dp_solve(pos, h_count, m_count, s1_val, s2_val):\n        if pos == total_moves:\n            return \"\", s1_val, s2_val\n            \n        key = (pos, h_count, m_count, s1_val, s2_val)\n        if key in dp:\n            return dp[key]\n            \n        option1 = None\n        if h_count < n_val:\n            new_s1 = s1_val * 10 + int(A_str[pos])\n            res1, _, _ = dp_solve(pos + 1, h_count + 1, m_count, new_s1, s2_val)\n            option1 = ('H' + res1, new_s1, s2_val)\n        \n        option2 = None\n        if m_count < n_val:\n            new_s2 = s2_val * 10 + int(A_str[pos])\n            res2, _, _ = dp_solve(pos + 1, h_count, m_count + 1, s1_val, new_s2)\n            option2 = ('M' + res2, s1_val, new_s2)\n        \n        best_score = -1\n        best_sequence = None\n        \n        if option1:\n            score1 = new_s1 + s2_val\n            if score1 > best_score:\n                best_score = score1\n                best_sequence = option1[0]\n                \n        if option2:\n            score2 = s1_val + new_s2\n            if score2 > best_score:\n                best_score = score2\n                best_sequence = option2[0]\n                \n        dp[key] = (best_sequence, s1_val, s2_val)\n        return best_sequence, s1_val, s2_val\n\n    result_sequence, _, _ = dp_solve(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n    print(result_sequence)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer n and a string A of 2n digits. The code reads these values and adjusts n if necessary based on the length of A.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The DP dictionary stores states as tuples (position, counts of moves per player, partial sums for both players). The `dp_solve` function recursively explores each possible move (assigning the current digit to either player) and memoizes results to avoid redundant calculations.\n3. **Base Case**: When all digits are processed (position equals 2n), the function returns an empty string and the current sums.\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each digit, the function checks if assigning it to Homer or Marge yields a higher total sum. The better option is chosen and memoized.\n5. **Result Construction**: After processing all digits, the optimal sequence of moves is reconstructed from the DP results and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible move sequences using dynamic programming, ensuring the maximum total prize is achieved while adhering to the constraints.",
