    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, note that we are asked: for a given m, how many n have Z(n) = m?\n\n Observation:\n   Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. For example:\n     Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n   But note: the value of Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5. Also, for a given m, there is an interval [L, R] of consecutive n's such that Z(n) = m.\n\n   Actually, the condition is that Z(n) must be exactly m. But note that when n increases, Z(n) can jump from m-1 to m+1? Actually, no: it jumps by the number of 5s in the new factor. However, the jumps are by the multiplicity of 5 in n. But the key is that between two jumps (at multiples of 5) the trailing zeros remain constant.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let f(x) = Z(x) = floor(x/5) + floor(x/25) + floor(x/125) + ...\n\n   Then for a fixed m, we want to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   Note: The function f is strictly increasing in the sense that it increases only at multiples of 5 and then remains constant until the next multiple. However, sometimes the jump can be more than one (e.g., at 25, we add 2). So we cannot assume that for every n, f(n) is just one more than f(n-1).\n\n   But we know that f(n) is non-decreasing and we can find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m and the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   However, note that we want exactly m. So:\n\n   Let L(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Let R(m) = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 - 1? Actually, we need the largest n such that f(n) <= m? But wait, we want exactly m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   Let low = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Let high = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then the numbers n with f(n) = m are the integers from low to high-1, provided that low <= high-1.\n\n   However, note that the function f(n) might not hit every integer. For example, if m=0, then n from 0 to 4 (if we consider n>=0) but the problem says positive integers. So we are only considering n>=1.\n\n   But the problem states: positive integers n.\n\n   However, note: the sample input m=1 gives n from 5 to 9.\n\n   How to compute f(n)? We can write a helper function, but note that m can be up to 100000 and n might be large (like around 5*m, because each multiple of 5 adds at least one zero). But we cannot iterate n from 1 to a very large number.\n\n   Instead, we can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n   Similarly, to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Define a function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   Step 2: We need to find:\n        left_bound = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n        right_bound = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then, the numbers n that satisfy the condition are the integers from left_bound to right_bound-1.\n\n   However, note that the trailing zeros function is defined for n>=0. We are considering positive n (n>=1). But our binary search will naturally handle that.\n\n   Example: m=1\n\n        We want the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= 1 -> that's 5.\n        We want the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= 2 -> that's 10.\n\n        Then the numbers are from 5 to 9.\n\n   Example: m=0\n\n        We want the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= 0 -> that's 1 (because 0! is 1, but we don't consider 0 as positive? Actually, we start from n=1: \n            count_trailing_zeros(1)=0, so the smallest n with >=0 is 1.\n        Then we want the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= 1 -> 5.\n\n        Then the numbers are from 1 to 4. However, the problem says positive integers. But note: the problem does not say \"positive integers n\" for which the factorial ends with exactly m zeros, and we must output the numbers. But the problem states: \"the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial\", and the factorial of 1,2,3,4 has 0 zeros.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n        So for m=0, we would output:\n           4\n           1 2 3 4\n\n        But note: the problem input constraint is m>=1. So we don't have to worry about m=0? Actually, the input m is from 1 to 100000.\n\n        However, the example input includes '1' and '5'. So m>=1.\n\n        But wait: the example input ['1', '5'] — actually, the example input is given as two separate examples? The problem says: \n          Input: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000)\n\n        So we only need to handle m>=1.\n\n        However, note: the problem statement example input is ['1','5'] — but that might be two examples. Actually, the problem says: \n          Input: ['1', '5'] \n\n        This is confusing. Actually, the problem example input is a single integer, and the example output is for m=1.\n\n        Let me read again: \n          Example Input: ['1', '5'] — this seems like two separate examples? Actually, the example output is two outputs? But the problem says: \n          First print k — the number of values, then the list.\n\n        And the example: \n          Input: 1\n          Output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n        And another example: \n          Input: 5\n          Output: 0\n\n        Wait, the example input ['1','5'] might be two separate test cases? But the problem says \"The only line of input\", meaning one test case per run.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Example Input: ['1', '5']\" — but then the output is two strings: \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\" and \"0\". \n\n        Actually, I think the example input was meant to be two examples, but the problem says the input is one integer.\n\n        Clarification: We are solving one test case per run.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"The only line of input contains an integer m\"\n\n        So we read one integer m.\n\n        However, the example output for m=5 is 0? That means there is no positive integer n such that n! has exactly 5 trailing zeros? \n\n        Let me check:\n\n        We know:\n          Z(20) = 4 (because 20//5 + 20//25 = 4+0 = 4)\n          Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6 (because 25//5 + 25//25 = 5+1=6)\n\n        So indeed, there is no n such that Z(n)=5.\n\n        Therefore, we must output:\n           0\n\n        And for m=1, we output:\n           5\n           5 6 7 8 9\n\n        So the problem requires:\n\n          If there exists an n such that Z(n)=m, then output the count and the list (in increasing order) of those n's.\n\n          Otherwise, output 0.\n\n        How to compute the bounds?\n\n        We can use binary search for the lower bound and upper bound.\n\n        The function count_trailing_zeros(n) can be computed by:\n\n          def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n              count = 0\n              divisor = 5\n              while divisor <= n:\n                  count += n // divisor\n                  divisor *= 5\n\n        Now, we need to find:\n\n          left = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n\n          right = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, the set of n is [left, right-1] and the count is (right - left).\n\n        However, note: it is possible that there is no n with exactly m zeros? Then left might be such that count_trailing_zeros(left) == m, but then we check the next one: if the next n (left+1) already has more than m, then the set is [left] and then we check if the next n has at least m+1? Actually, we are using:\n\n          left = first n with at least m zeros.\n          right = first n with at least m+1 zeros.\n\n        Then the numbers with exactly m zeros are from left to right-1.\n\n        But if the set is empty, then left >= right, then we output 0.\n\n        However, note that the function is non-decreasing, so if left is the first n with >=m and right is the first n with >=m+1, then by definition, the n's that have at least m zeros start at left, and the n's that have at least m+1 zeros start at right. Then the n's that have exactly m zeros are from left to right-1.\n\n        But what if there is no n with exactly m zeros? Then the set [left, right-1] would be empty if left >= right. However, note that the function is non-decreasing, so if left is the smallest n with at least m, then at left we have at least m, and at right we have at least m+1. But if the next n (left+1) already has more than m, then right = left+1 (if left+1 is the next number that pushes the count to m+1 or more). But note: the trailing zeros count can jump by more than one.\n\n        Actually, we are defining right as the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1. So if the trailing zeros count jumps from m to m+k (k>=1) at left, then we don't know. But note: we are looking for n with exactly m zeros. The condition is that the trailing zeros must be m. So if at left, the count is m, then we include left. Then we look for the next n where the count becomes m+1 (or more). However, if the count at left is already m+1 (so we skipped m), then the set [left, ...] doesn't include any n with exactly m zeros.\n\n        Actually, let me correct:\n\n          We want to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m. Then, the smallest n0 is that n. Then we want the next n where the count becomes at least m+1. Then the numbers from n0 to n1-1 have count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m and < m+1, so they are exactly m? \n\n        But wait, what if the count at n0 is greater than m? Then we have skipped m. So we must ensure that the first n we find has count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m, but we don't know if it is exactly m or more.\n\n        Actually, the condition for being exactly m is that the count is m. But we are searching for the smallest n such that count >= m. Then the next n (with count >= m+1) is the first n where the count exceeds m (if the count jumps by more than one, then we still capture the same idea: the numbers from the first n with count>=m to the first n with count>=m+1 are the ones that have count==m? Not necessarily: if the count at the first n is m+2, then we have:\n\n          n0: count = m+2, then the set [n0, ...] has counts starting from m+2, so we don't have any n with count==m.\n\n        Therefore, we must also check that the first n we found (left) has count_trailing_zeros(left) == m? No, because we don't know. Actually, we are using the condition \"smallest n such that count>=m\". Then we want to know the entire range of n that have count==m.\n\n        However, note: the function count_trailing_zeros(n) is non-decreasing and only increases at multiples of 5. Moreover, the increase is by the exponent of 5 in the factorization of n (if n is divisible by 5^k but not 5^(k+1), then we add k zeros? Actually, no: the formula is the total number of 5s in the factorization of all numbers from 1 to n. When we add a number that is divisible by 5^k, we add k (because the number contributes k factors of 5). But note, the function is additive and the entire count is the sum over divisors.\n\n        However, the key is: the function is non-decreasing and we are only concerned with the exact value m.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n          We can also find the largest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) <= m, and the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m. But then the set of n with count==m is the intersection of [n_min, n_max] where n_min is the smallest n with count>=m and n_max is the largest n with count<=m. However, we already know that the function is non-decreasing, so the set of n with count==m is contiguous.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let L = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n          Let R = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n          Then the set of n with exactly m zeros is {n | L <= n < R} (if we consider that at n=R, the count is at least m+1, so all n from L to R-1 have count exactly m? Not necessarily: the count might jump from m to m+k (k>=1) and then we have an interval of n with the same count (m) only from L to the next jump? Actually, no: the count is constant between jumps. The count only changes at multiples of 5. And the change is by the number of factors of 5 in that multiple.\n\n        But note: the count function is defined as the sum of floor(n/5^i). It is constant on intervals between multiples of 5.\n\n        However, the issue is: if we start at n = L, then the count at L is >= m. Then we move to n = L+1, the count remains the same until the next multiple of 5. Then the next jump happens at some multiple of 5, and then the count increases.\n\n        But wait: the count only increases at multiples of 5. So if L is not a multiple of 5, then the count at L is the same as at L-1? Actually, no: the count is defined for the entire factorial. The count at n is the same as the count at n-1 unless n is a multiple of 5. So the count is constant between multiples of 5.\n\n        Therefore, the set of n with a given count value is an interval that starts at a multiple of 5 (or after) and ends at the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) minus one? Actually, no: the count increases at multiples of 5. So the count for n in [a, b] (where a and b are consecutive multiples of 5) is constant? Actually, no: the count increases at every multiple of 5, but the amount of increase depends on the power of 5.\n\n        However, the count is non-decreasing and increases only at multiples of 5. So the set of n with a particular count value is an interval. But note: the count might jump by more than one, so there might be gaps in the sequence of counts.\n\n        Example: m=5. We know there is no n such that Z(n)=5.\n\n        How does the binary search work for m=5?\n\n          We want to find the smallest n such that Z(n)>=5.\n\n          Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6.\n\n          So the smallest n with Z(n)>=5 is 25.\n\n          Then the smallest n with Z(n)>=6 is 25.\n\n          Then the set is from 25 to 24? -> empty set, so we output 0.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read m.\n\n          Step 2: Define function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the trailing zeros.\n\n          Step 3: Use binary search to find:\n            left = smallest n (starting from 0 or 1) such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n\n          Step 4: Similarly, find right = smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n          Step 5: Then the numbers n that satisfy the condition are the integers from left to right-1.\n\n          Step 6: If left >= right, then there are no numbers (so output 0). Otherwise, output the count (right-left) and then the numbers from left to right-1.\n\n        However, note: the problem says positive integers. Our binary search should start from 1? Or 0? Since the problem says positive, we consider n>=1.\n\n        Let's set the lower bound for binary search to 0 and the upper bound to a sufficiently large number.\n\n        What should be the upper bound? We know that Z(n) = n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/4 (geometric series). So n must be at least 4*m. But we are going to m up to 100000, so n can be up to about 4*m? Actually, the standard way to get m zeros is n ~ 5*m, but sometimes we need more because of the higher powers.\n\n        However, we can set the upper bound to 5 * m * 5? Or maybe 5*m + 1? Actually, we know that Z(5*m) is at least m (because floor(5*m/5)=m, and then adding higher terms). So we can set the upper bound to 5*m * 5? Actually, worst-case, the smallest n for m zeros is around 4*m (but wait, for m=1, n=5). Alternatively, we can set the upper bound to 5*m (since Z(5*m) is at least m) and then if needed, extend.\n\n        But wait, the example for m=1: 5 is the smallest n. For m=2, the smallest n is 10. But for m=5, the smallest n is 25, which is 5*5. \n\n        We can set the upper bound to 5*m + 1? Actually, we know that Z(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is more than m. So we can set the upper bound to 5*(m+1) or something. But we are doing binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. We need an upper bound that is guaranteed to have Z(n)>=m.\n\n        We can set the upper bound to 5*m * 5 (i.e., 25*m) to be safe. But let's think: the maximum number of zeros for n is less than n/4, so n must be at most 4*m. But wait, that's not linear: actually, we need to solve for n: Z(n) = m. We know that Z(n) = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/4. So n >= 4*m. But we need the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. The smallest n is at least 5*m? Actually, no: for m=1, n=5. For m=2, n=10. For m=3, n=15. For m=4, n=20. For m=5, n=25. So the smallest n is 5*m? Actually, no: for m=6, the smallest n is 25? Because Z(25)=6, so yes. But for m=0, n=0 or 1? But we are only considering m>=1.\n\n        Actually, the minimal n for m zeros is the smallest n such that Z(n)=m. But sometimes we have to take a multiple of 5. However, we are using the condition Z(n)>=m. So we can set the upper bound to, say, 5*m*5 (which is 25*m). But 25*m might be too big? m up to 100000, then n up to 2.5e6, which is acceptable for binary search? We are doing logarithmic steps.\n\n        However, we can also set the upper bound by knowing that the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m (actually, sometimes 5*m is the minimal, but sometimes we have to go higher: for example, m=5, 5*5=25 is the minimal). Actually, the minimal n for m zeros is the smallest n such that the sum of floor(n/5^i) >= m. \n\n        But we can use an upper bound of 5*m (this might not be enough for m=5? because 5*5=25, which is the minimal, and for m=5, we need n=25. Then for m=6, we need n=25 (Z(25)=6) so minimal n=25, which is 5*5. But for m=0, we need n=0 or 1. \n\n        Actually, we are only handling m>=1, so minimal n is at least 5.\n\n        We can set the upper bound to 5*m*5 (i.e., 25*m) to be safe. But wait, the minimal n for m zeros is the smallest n such that Z(n)=m, and we know that n must be at least 5*m (if m is the minimal for that n) but sometimes less? Actually, no: for m=1, n=5; for m=2, n=10; for m=3, n=15; for m=4, n=20; for m=5, n=25. So the minimal n is 5*m. But wait, what if m=6? n=25, which is 5*5, and 5*5=25, but 5*6=30, which is bigger. So the minimal n for m=6 is 25, not 30. \n\n        Actually, the minimal n for m zeros is the minimal n such that Z(n)=m. We don't know a closed form, but we know that the minimal n is at least 5*m (if m is small) but sometimes we can have n < 5*m? No, because to have m zeros, we need at least m factors of 5. The minimal n that provides m factors of 5 is the smallest n such that the sum_{k>=1} floor(n/5^k) >= m. \n\n        But we can set the upper bound to 5*m*5 (i.e., 25*m) and then if we don't find a solution, we can extend. But we don't need to: we are doing binary search and we know that n must be at least 0 and at most 5*m (if m is the minimal for n=5*m, then we have at least m zeros, so 5*m is an upper bound). Actually, we have:\n\n          Z(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... >= m.\n\n        So we can set the upper bound to 5*m (which is 500000 for m=100000). But wait, for m=100000, then 5*m=500000, and Z(500000) = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124999, which is more than 100000. So that's fine.\n\n        However, we are searching for the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. We can set the lower bound to 0 and the upper bound to 5*m (or even 5*m+1) for the binary search.\n\n        But wait: what if m=100000? Then the minimal n might be much larger than 5*m? Actually, no: because Z(5*m) is already 124999, which is >100000, so the minimal n for m=100000 must be less than 500000. But wait, we don't know the exact minimal n. However, we can set the upper bound to 5*m (which is 500000) and then the binary search will find the minimal n.\n\n        But note: the minimal n for m=100000 is the smallest n such that Z(n)=100000. We know that Z(400000) = 400000//5 + 400000//25 + 400000//125 + 400000//625 + ... \n          = 80000 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 80000+16000=96000, 96000+3200=99200, 99200+640=99840, 99840+128=99968, 99968+25=99993, 99993+5=99998, 99998+1=99999. \n          Then Z(400000)=99999, so 400000 has 99999 zeros. Then we need 100000, so we must go to 400001? But 400001 is not a multiple of 5, so the count remains 99999 until the next multiple of 5, which is 400005? Actually, no: the count only changes at multiples of 5. So we need to check 400005: \n          Z(400005) = Z(400000) + (how many 5s in 400001,400002,400003,400004,400005) \n          Only 400005 is divisible by 5. How many 5s in 400005? 400005 = 5 * 80001, and 80001 is not divisible by 5. So one factor. Then Z(400005)=99999+1=100000.\n\n        So the minimal n for m=100000 is 400005, which is less than 500000. So our upper bound of 5*m (500000) is safe.\n\n        However, we can set the upper bound to 5*m*5 (25*m) to be safe for all m, but 5*m is sufficient.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          low_bound = 0\n          high_bound = 5*m   (for m>=1, 5*m is at least 5, so we cover from 0 to 5*m)\n\n        But wait: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        Algorithm for binary search:\n\n          def find_lower_bound(m):\n              low = 0\n              high = 5*m   # since we know that Z(5*m) >= m (actually, Z(5*m) = m + m/5 + ... >= m), so we can use 5*m as an upper bound.\n\n              while low < high:\n                  mid = (low+high)//2\n                  if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                      low = mid+1\n                  else:\n                      high = mid\n\n              return low\n\n          Then left = find_lower_bound(m)\n          Then right = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n          Then if left >= right:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              count = right - left\n              print(count)\n              # Then print the numbers from left to right-1, but note: the problem says \"Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n              # But if the count is large (like millions) we cannot output each number? Actually, the problem says m up to 100000, and the numbers n we output are from left to right-1. The length of the interval is (right - left). \n\n          However, note: the set of n with exactly m zeros is contiguous. But the length (right-left) can be as large as 5? (like for m=1, we have 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9). But wait, for m=0, we have 4 numbers (1,2,3,4). But m>=1. \n\n          But wait, for m=5, we have 0 numbers.\n\n          But for m=6, the minimal n is 25 (Z(25)=6) and the next n that gives 7 zeros is 26? Actually, no: the count increases only at multiples of 5. So from 25 to 29, the count is 6 (because 26,27,28,29 don't add any 5). Then at 30, we add one more 5 (since 30 is divisible by 5). So Z(30)=6 + 1 = 7.\n\n          Therefore, for m=6, the numbers are from 25 to 29 (inclusive). So 5 numbers.\n\n          However, note: the minimal n for m=6 is 25, and the minimal n for m=7 is 30. So the set is [25,29].\n\n          Now, the length is 5.\n\n          How about m=100000? Then the set is [400005, 400009] (if the next jump is at 400010? Actually, the next multiple of 5 after 400005 is 400010, so the set is [400005,400009] (5 numbers). \n\n          But wait, that is always 5? No: the length of the interval is determined by the next multiple of 5. Actually, the next multiple of 5 after the minimal n (which is 400005) is 400010, so the numbers from 400005 to 400009 are the ones with 100000 zeros.\n\n          However, what if the minimal n is not a multiple of 5? Then the set of n with exactly m zeros is from the minimal n (which is a multiple of 5) to the next multiple of 5 minus one. So the length is always 5? \n\n          But wait, what if the minimal n is the last multiple of 5 before the jump? Then the set is from that multiple to the next multiple minus one. But the next multiple is 5 more, so 5 numbers.\n\n          However, consider m=0: \n            We are not handling m=0, but for m=0, the minimal n is 1, and the next n that gets a zero is 5. So the set is [1,4] (4 numbers). \n\n          But wait, the minimal n for m=0 is 1, but 1 is not a multiple of 5. So the set is from 1 to 4 (which is 4 numbers). \n\n          However, the problem states m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n          But wait: the example input m=1: the set is [5,9] (5 numbers). \n\n          Now, what if m=2? \n            Minimal n: 10 (Z(10)=2)\n            Next n that gives 3 zeros: 15 (Z(15)=3)\n            So the set is [10,14] (5 numbers).\n\n          So for m>=1, the set of n with exactly m zeros is either empty or a contiguous block of 5 numbers? \n\n          Let me check m=3:\n            Minimal n: 15 (Z(15)=3)\n            Next n: 20 (Z(20)=4) -> so the set is [15,19] (5 numbers).\n\n          m=4:\n            Minimal n: 20 (Z(20)=4)\n            Next n: 25 (Z(25)=6) -> wait, here we jump from 4 to 6. So the set is [20,24] (5 numbers). \n\n          But wait, the condition for m=4: we require exactly 4 zeros. The numbers 20,21,22,23,24 have 4 zeros. Then 25 has 6 zeros. So the set is 5 numbers.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the set is from left (minimal n with >=m) to right-1 (minimal n with >=m+1). For m=4, left=20, and right=25 (because Z(25)=6>=5). Then the set is [20,24] (5 numbers).\n\n          Now, what about m=5? \n            We said there's no n with exactly 5 zeros. Then left=25 (because Z(25)=6>=5) and right=25 (because Z(25)=6>=6). Then the set is from 25 to 24 -> empty.\n\n          So the length of the set is either 0 or 5? \n\n          Let me check m=6:\n            Minimal n: 25 (Z(25)=6>=6) -> left=25.\n            Minimal n for m=7: the next multiple of 5 is 30, Z(30)=7 -> so right=30.\n            Then the set is [25,29] (5 numbers).\n\n          m=7:\n            Minimal n:30 (Z(30)=7)\n            Minimal n for m=8: the next multiple of 5 is 35, Z(35)= 35//5 + 35//25 = 7+1=8 -> so right=35.\n            Set: [30,34] (5 numbers)\n\n          m=8: [35,39] (5 numbers)\n\n          m=9: [40,44] (Z(40)=8+? -> 40//5=8, 40//25=1, 40//",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of the primes 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds. If the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound, it means there are no such \\( n \\) values.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The binary search approach efficiently narrows down the bounds without checking every number, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of \\( Z(n) \\). The helper function `count_trailing_zeros` computes \\( Z(n) \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def find_lower_bound(target):\n        low = 0\n        high = 5 * target\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < target:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n    \n    left_bound = find_lower_bound(m)\n    right_bound = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    \n    if left_bound >= right_bound:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = right_bound - left_bound\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(left_bound, right_bound))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_lower_bound(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times \\text{target} \\), ensuring the bounds are sufficiently large to include the solution.\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the lower and upper bounds for \\( n \\) using `find_lower_bound`, and checks if there exists any \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\). If such \\( n \\) exists, it prints the count and the numbers; otherwise, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
