Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem requires processing a series of string replacements on an initial string of digits, and then computing the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, note: The total length of all 'ti' in queries is at most 10^5, but the initial string s can be up to 10^5, and we have up to 10^5 queries.\n\n But if we try to do the replacements naively (by scanning the string and replacing every occurrence of a digit with a string), the string might blow up in size. For example, if we replace '2' by \"00\", then replace '0' by \"00\", then again by \"00\", etc., the string can grow exponentially.\n\n We need a better way.\n\n Observation:\n Each query is of the form: \"di -> ti\"\n We are to apply the queries in order.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the queries are applied in the given order. So, the first query replaces all occurrences of one digit (say d) with a string t, and then the next query operates on the resulting string.\n\n But the catch: the replacements might interact. For example, replacing '2' by \"00\", and then later replacing '0' by something else.\n\n But note: the queries are for specific digits. And the replacement for a digit d is independent of the current string's content? Actually, no: after the first replacement, the string changes, and then the next query will see the new string.\n\n However, the problem does not require to actually build the huge string (because the string can become very long). Instead, we must compute the number modulo 10^9+7.\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot build the entire string because the length may be too large (exponentially growing).\n\n Alternative idea: process the queries from last to first? Or use dynamic programming?\n\n But note: the operations are sequential and each operation replaces a specific digit with a string. This is similar to a system of string rewriting, but the problem asks for the final number.\n\n Let's think about the value of the final number. We can represent the entire process as:\n\n Start with the initial string s0 = s.\n Then, for each query i (from 0 to n-1): \n   s_{i+1} = s_i with every occurrence of the digit d_i replaced by t_i.\n\n We want the number represented by s_n mod 1000000007.\n\n However, the direct simulation is not possible due to exponential growth.\n\n We need to precompute the effect of each query and combine them in a way that avoids building the entire string.\n\n Idea: reverse the queries and use memoization or dynamic programming to represent the transformation of a digit to a final string.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in order, so the later queries might refer to digits that were introduced by earlier replacements.\n\n Example: \n   s = \"2\"\n   Query1: \"2->00\"\n   Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n Then the result is: first becomes \"00\", then each '0' becomes '7', so \"77\".\n\n But if we reverse the queries, we might define for each digit what it becomes after processing all subsequent queries.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Process the queries from last to first, and for each digit (0-9) we want to know what it is transformed into by the entire sequence of queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied sequentially, and each query only replaces one digit. But when we reverse, we have to consider that a digit might be replaced by a string that contains other digits, which then get replaced by the following queries.\n\n So, let F_i(d) be the transformation of digit d after processing the queries from the i-th to the last.\n\n Then, we can define for the last query (index n-1) down to 0:\n\n   Let's say we are at query i (which is \"d_i -> t_i\"). Then, for any digit d:\n\n     If d == d_i, then after this query and the subsequent ones, it becomes the transformation of t_i (but t_i is a string, so we have to transform each character in t_i by the subsequent queries).\n\n     Otherwise, it remains the same (until the next query).\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order, and we are reversing. So:\n\n   Let G_i(d) be the transformation of digit d after the queries from i to n-1.\n\n   Then for i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n     For each digit d (0-9):\n        if d == d_i, then \n            G_i(d) = the string obtained by replacing each character c in t_i with G_{i+1}(c) (and then concatenate them)\n        else\n            G_i(d) = G_{i+1}(d)\n\n   But wait:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to efficiently process a series of string replacement queries on an initial digit string and compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in handling the replacements without explicitly constructing potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing queries in the given order, we reverse them. This allows us to determine the final transformation of each digit after all subsequent queries have been applied.\n2. **Digit Transformation Tracking**: For each digit (0-9), maintain a mapping that represents how it transforms through all subsequent queries. This involves:\n   - For each query, if the digit matches the query's digit, transform it using the query's replacement string, where each character in the replacement is further transformed by subsequent queries.\n   - If the digit does not match, it remains unchanged by the current query but may be transformed by later queries.\n3. **Efficient Modulo Handling**: Since the final number can be very large, we compute its value modulo 1000000007 during the transformation process. Each digit's contribution to the final number is calculated based on its position and value, considering the transformations applied to it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        q_line = input().strip()\n        if '->' in q_line:\n            parts = q_line.split('->')\n            d = parts[0].strip()\n            t_str = parts[1].strip()\n            queries.append((d, t_str))\n    \n    dp_digit = [None] * 10\n    for i in range(10):\n        dp_digit[i] = {'value': None, 'len': 0}\n    \n    dp_next = [None] * 10\n    for i in range(10):\n        dp_next[i] = {'value': None, 'len': 0}\n    \n    for d in range(10):\n        dp_next[d] = {'value': d, 'len': 1}\n    \n    if n > 0:\n        for idx in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            d_char, t_str = queries[idx]\n            d_int = ord(d_char) - ord('0')\n            for char in t_str:\n                c_int = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                next_dp = dp_next[c_int]\n                new_value = (dp_next[c_int]['value'] * pow(10, dp_next[c_int]['len'] * 0, MOD)) % MOD\n                new_len = dp_next[c_int]['len']\n                if dp_digit[d_int]['value'] is None:\n                    dp_digit[d_int]['value'] = new_value\n                    dp_digit[d_int]['len'] = new_len\n                else:\n                    dp_digit[d_int]['value'] = (dp_digit[d_int]['value'] + new_value) % MOD\n                    dp_digit[d_int]['len'] += new_len\n            for d in range(10):\n                if d == d_int:\n                    continue\n                dp_next[d] = dp_digit[d]\n    \n    num_val = 0\n    num_len = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d_int = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        d_info = dp_digit[d_int]\n        power = pow(10, num_len, MOD)\n        num_val = (num_val * power + d_info['value']) % MOD\n        num_len += d_info['len']\n    \n    print(num_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and number of queries `n` are read. Each query specifies a digit to replace and the replacement string.\n2. **Digit Transformation Setup**: Two arrays (`dp_digit` and `dp_next`) are initialized to keep track of each digit's final value and length after all transformations.\n3. **Reverse Query Processing**: Starting from the last query to the first, each digit's transformation is updated. If a digit matches the query's digit, it is replaced by the transformation of the replacement string's digits. Non-matching digits retain their current transformations.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The initial string is processed digit by digit, using the precomputed transformations to build the final number's value modulo 1000000007, considering each digit's positional value and length contributions.\n5. **Output**: The computed result is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations without explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and performance.",
