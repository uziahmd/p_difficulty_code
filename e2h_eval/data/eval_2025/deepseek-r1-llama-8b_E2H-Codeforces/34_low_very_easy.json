And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm. So Polycarp has recorded his sleep times for n days, and we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days. Oh right, because a week in Berland is k days long. So the number of weeks we'll consider is (n - k + 1), right?\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. Like when n=3, k=2, and the array is [3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. So the sum is 3+4+4+7 = wait, no, each week is two days. So the first week is 3+4=7, the second is 4+7=11. So total sum is 18, divided by 2 weeks gives 9. So the output is 9.0000000000, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach here is to compute the sum of all possible consecutive k-length windows in the array and then divide by the number of such windows, which is (n -k +1).\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently compute the sum of all these windows without doing O(nk) operations, which could be slow for large n? Because n can be up to 2*10^5, right? So if I naively add each window by iterating through each element each time, that would be O(n*k) time, which for k up to 2e5 would be O(4e10) operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, the sliding window technique or using prefix sums would help here.\n\nLet me think about prefix sums. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray quickly. So for each window starting at i and ending at i+k-1, the sum is prefix[i + k -1] - prefix[i-1]. But wait, what's the exact formula?\n\nYes, prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (assuming 1-based or 0-based, but I'll have to adjust accordingly). So for a window from index j to j+k-1, the sum is prefix[j+k-1] - prefix[j-1].\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n2. Iterate through each possible window, compute the sum using the prefix array.\n3. Sum all these window sums.\n4. Divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nThis way, each window sum is computed in O(1) time, and the overall time is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n- Read the array a as a list of integers.\n- Compute the prefix sum array. Let's say prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1] for i >=1. So for 0-based a, prefix is 1-based.\n- Then, for each window starting at index j (from 0 to n-k), the end is j + k. The sum is prefix[j + k] - prefix[j].\n- Sum all these sums.\n- The average is total_sum / (n - k + 1).\n- Output the average with sufficient decimal precision.\n\nWait, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: n=3, k=2. a = [3,4,7]\n\nprefix[0] = 0\nprefix[1] = 3\nprefix[2] = 3+4=7\nprefix[3] = 7+7=14\n\nThen the windows are:\n- j=0: sum is prefix[2]-prefix[0] =7\n- j=1: sum is prefix[3]-prefix[1] =14-3=11\nTotal sum is 7+11=18. Number of windows is 2. Average is 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: third example input is 8 2, and the array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. Wait, the input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'—so n=8, k=2. So the number of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nCompute each window sum:\n\n1+2=3\n2+4=6\n4+100000=100004\n100000+123=100123\n123+456=579\n456+789=1245\n789+1=790\n\nAdding them all: 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to compute this efficiently, even for large values of n.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of sleep times and need to find the average over all possible windows of size k. The number of such windows is (n - k + 1), which can be very large, so an efficient approach is necessary.\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of calculating the sum of each window directly, which would be inefficient, we use a prefix sum array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times array. Using this array, the sum of any window from index j to j+k-1 can be computed as `prefix[j + k] - prefix[j]`.\n4. **Summing Windows**: Iterate through each possible window, compute its sum using the prefix sum array, and accumulate the total sum.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    total = 0\n    for j in range(n - k + 1):\n        end = j + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[j]\n    \n    average = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers n and k, followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array is constructed to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. Each element at index i in the prefix array is the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times array.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each possible starting index of a window, compute the sum using the prefix array and accumulate the total sum.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large inputs.",
