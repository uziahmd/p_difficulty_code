    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Gluttony. The task is to construct an array b by permuting the elements of array a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S (with size k between 1 and n-1), the sum of elements in positions S of a and b are different. So, for any non-empty proper subset, the sum of elements in a's subset should not equal the sum in b's subset.\n\nHmm, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the subsets are based on the indices. So for each subset S, which is a set of positions in the array, when you look at the elements in a at those positions, their sum is compared to the sum of the corresponding elements in b. And these two sums must be different.\n\nSo, for example, if S is {1,3}, then sum_a = a[0] + a[2], sum_b = b[0] + b[2]. These must be different.\n\nThe goal is to find a permutation of a into b such that all possible non-empty proper subsets have different sums in a and b. If it's impossible, output -1.\n\nThe input is n and the array a, with n distinct integers.\n\nLet me think about what constraints this imposes.\n\nFirst, let's consider that for any two different subsets S and T, the sum for a and b must differ. But more specifically, for each S, the sum of a's elements in S must differ from the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nWait, but S is a subset of the indices. So for each S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S).\n\nNow, since b is a permutation of a, the total sum of a and b are the same. So for any subset S, sum_a(S) + sum_a(not S) = sum_b(S) + sum_b(not S). Because sum_b(S) = sum_a(pi(S)), where pi is a permutation. But since it's a permutation, the sum of all elements in a and b is the same.\n\nBut wait, for a subset S, the sum of a's S is equal to the sum of b's S only if the sum of a's S is equal to the sum of b's S. Which would mean that the sum of a's S and b's S are equal. So we need to arrange b such that for no non-empty proper subset S, sum_a(S) equals sum_b(S).\n\nSo the problem reduces to arranging the permutation such that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b differ.\n\nWhat's a way to approach this?\n\nOne thought is that if the permutation is such that no two subsets S and T have the same sum in a and b, then we can satisfy the condition.\n\nBut how do we construct such a permutation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where the permutation must assign each element to a position in such a way that certain linear algebra conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the problem as follows: For each position i, assign a value b_i which is some permutation of a. Then, for each non-empty proper subset S, the sum of a's elements in S must not equal the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nBut considering all subsets is computationally impossible because n can be up to 22, leading to 2^22-1 subsets, which is about 4 million, but manageable for small n. But n=22 is 2^22=4 million, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, n is up to 22, so 2^22 is about 4 million. For each subset S, we need to check whether sum_a(S) != sum_b(S). How can we ensure that?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the key is that for the permutation b, for each element, it's placed in a position such that no two elements can form a subset whose sum is the same in a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simple way to construct such a permutation.\n\nWait, let's think about small examples.\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nn=2, a = [1,2]\n\nSample output is [2,1].\n\nLet's see why:\n\nFor S={1}, sum_a =1, sum_b=2 → different.\n\nFor S={2}, sum_a=2, sum_b=1 → different.\n\nSo both single-element subsets have different sums.\n\nSo the condition is satisfied.\n\nWhat about another example, say n=3. Suppose a is [1,2,3].\n\nWhat's a possible permutation? Let's try [3,1,2].\n\nCheck all subsets:\n\nS of size 1: {1}=1 vs 3 → different; {2}=2 vs 1 → different; {3}=3 vs 2 → different.\n\nS of size 2: {1,2} → 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an array `b` by permuting the elements of array `a` such that for every non-empty subset of indices, the sum of elements in `a` and `b` are different. If it's impossible to construct such an array `b`, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to ensure that each element in the permutation `b` is placed such that no two subsets of indices have the same sum in both arrays. This can be achieved by greedily placing each element in a position where it maximizes the difference in sums for all possible subsets.\n\n1. **Greedy Placement**: We start by sorting the array `a` and then place each element into the next available position in `b` in a way that maximizes the difference in sums for all possible subsets.\n2. **Check Validity**: After constructing `b`, we check if it meets the condition for all non-empty proper subsets. If any subset has the same sum in both arrays, we return `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible permutations efficiently while checking the validity of the constructed array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    n, *rest = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    a = rest[:n]\n    \n    # Check if n is 1: No proper subsets, so output a itself\n    if n == 1:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))\n        return\n    \n    # Sort the array for easier handling\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    \n    # Try to construct b step by step\n    b = [0] * n\n    used = [False] * n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        max_pos = -1\n        best_diff = 0\n        for pos in range(n):\n            if not used[pos]:\n                current_sum = sum(a_sorted[j] for j in range(n) if j != pos]\n                # Sum of a without pos is current_sum, sum of b without pos would be total_b - b[pos]\n                # We want current_sum != (total_b - (sum of a up to pos))\n                # But since b is being built, perhaps it's better to consider the sum after placing b[pos]\n                # Alternatively, compute the impact of placing a_sorted[i] at pos\n                # The sum of a's subset S including pos is a_sorted[i], which will be added to the sum when considering subsets that include pos\n                # This is getting complicated.

Because the problem only requires that the sums for the same subsets in `a` and `b` are different, not that all subset sums are unique across all subsets.\n                \n                # So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into ensuring that the prefix sums of `a` and `b` are such that for any position `i`, the sum of the first `i` elements in `a` and `b` are different.\n                \n                # Because if the prefix sums are all different, then any subset sum will be different between `a` and `b`.\n                \n                # How? Let's think: Suppose the prefix sums of `a` are s_0, s_1, ..., s_n, where s_0=0, s_1=a[0], s_2=a[0]+a[1], etc. Similarly for `b`, prefix sums t_0, t_1, ..., t_n.\n                \n                # If for any k, s_k != t_k for all 1<=k<=n-1, then any subset sum in `a` and `b` will differ. Because any subset sum in `a` can be represented as s_j - s_i for some j>i, and similarly for `b` as t_j - t_i. If s_j - s_i != t_j - t_i for all j>i, then the subset sums differ.\n                \n                # So, the condition that the prefix sums of `a` and `b` differ for all 1<=k<=n-1 implies the desired property.\n                \n                # Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a permutation `b` such that the prefix sums of `a` and `b` are different for all positions except the full sum.\n                \n                # This is a crucial insight. So now, the problem is to arrange `b` such that the prefix sums of `a` and `b` are distinct for all 1<=k<=n-1.\n                \n                # Now, how to find such a permutation `b`?\n                \n                # One approach is to sort `a` and then assign the elements to `b` in a way that the prefix sums of `b` are as different as possible from those of `a`.\n                \n                # Here's a plan:\n                1. Compute the prefix sums of `a`.\n                2. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n                3. Try to assign the elements to `b` in such a way that the prefix sums of `b` are as different as possible from those of `a`.\n                \n                # To do this, we can use a backtracking approach where we try placing each element in `b` and check if the current prefix sum is different from `a`'s prefix sum at that position.\n                \n                # However, for n=22, a backtracking approach is not feasible due to the high computational cost.\n                \n                # Therefore, we need a heuristic approach that can construct `b` quickly.\n                \n                # Here's another Idea: Since the prefix sums of `a` are fixed, we can try to arrange `b` such that the prefix sums are as different as possible. One way is to sort `a` in ascending order and then place elements in `b` in a way that the prefix sums increase as slowly as possible or as quickly as possible, depending on what's needed.\n                \n                # For example, if `a` is sorted in ascending order, we can try to place the largest elements first to create larger jumps in the prefix sums of `b`.\n                \n                # Let's try this approach:\n                - Sort `a` in ascending order.\n                - Try to construct `b` by placing the largest remaining element at each step.\n                \n                # Let's test this with the sample input:\n                # Sample Input 1: [1,2] sorted as [1,2].

So this permutation works.\n                \n                # So, the approach of assigning the largest remaining element at each step seems promising.\n                \n                # Now, let's see how to implement this.\n                \n                # Steps:\n                1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n                2. Initialize `b` as an empty list.\n                3. Create a list of available elements, initially the sorted `a`.\n                4. For each position in `b`, select the largest available element and add it to `b`.\n                5.
