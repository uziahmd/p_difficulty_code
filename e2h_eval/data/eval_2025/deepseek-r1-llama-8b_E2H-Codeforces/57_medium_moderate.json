His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Vasya's teacher needs to find his best and worst possible ranks based on the sum of points from two tours. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the input gives me n participants and a minimum x that Vasya got. Then there are two lists: a and b, which represent the points each participant got in the first and second tours respectively. But the order is arbitrary for both a and b. That means I can't directly match a_i with b_i because they might not be the same person.\n\nThe goal is to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have. The best rank is when he is as high as possible, and the worst is as low as possible.\n\nHmm. So, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about what affects Vasya's rank. His total is a_i + b_j, but we don't know which a and b correspond to him. So, for each possible way to assign a and b to Vasya, we calculate his total, then compute how many others are better or equal to him. But since the problem allows for ties, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that all participants participated in both tours. So each a and b is for a unique participant, but the correspondence isn't given.\n\nSo, for each participant, their total is a_p + b_q, where p and q are indices, but not necessarily the same.\n\nBut since the a and b are given in arbitrary orders, the actual assignment is unknown except that each a and b is used exactly once for each participant.\n\nWait, no. Because the a list is all the first tour points, and the b list is all the second tour points. Each participant has one a and one b. So, the a and b are for the same set of people, but the a's are in some order and the b's are in another order.\n\nSo, for each participant, their a and b are somewhere in the a and b lists, but we don't know which a goes with which b.\n\nBut for our purposes, we need to find for each participant (including Vasya) their a plus b, then sort all these sums in descending order to determine their ranks.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So, whatever a_i and b_j add up to must be >=x.\n\nOur task is to arrange the a and b into pairs such that:\n\n- All a's are used once, all b's are used once.\n\n- There exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, based on this arrangement, compute Vasya's sum, which is a certain a_p + b_q >=x.\n\nThen, determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have.\n\nWait, but we don't know which a and b belong to Vasya. So, for each possible a and b that could be paired, we can compute the sum, and then see how many others are higher than or equal to it.\n\nBut considering all possibilities is computationally expensive. However, n is up to 105, so n^2 is 11,025, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n1. For all possible pairs (i, j), where i is an index for a and j is an index for b, check if a[i] + b[j] >=x. These are the possible pairs that could be Vasya's sum.\n\n2. For each such possible sum s_vasya, compute the maximum number of participants whose sum is >=s_vasya. This will give the best possible rank (since more people have higher or equal sums, Vasya's rank is as bad as possible, but wait, no. Wait, if s_vasya is larger, then fewer people can have sums >= it, so the best rank is 1, worst is when s_vasya is as small as possible, allowing as many people to have higher sums as possible.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nFor a given s_vasya, the best rank is 1, meaning Vasya is the top scorer. The worst rank is the number of participants who have a sum >= s_vasya, plus 1 (if Vasya's sum is tied with others). Or perhaps it's the number of participants with sum > s_vasya plus the number of participants with sum == s_vasya, including Vasya himself.\n\nWait, the ranking is determined by the sum in descending order. So, for all participants, their sum is computed. Then, they are sorted in non-increasing order. Ties are allowed, and the jury can assign places. So, for example, if two people have the highest sum, they can be ranked 1st and 2nd, or both 1st.\n\nSo, for any s, the number of participants with sum > s is less than or equal to the number of participants with sum >= s. But for the purpose of determining Vasya's rank, the worst case is when as many participants as possible have a sum >= s_vasya. So, the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >= s_vasya, and possibly tied with others.\n\nWait, no. Because if multiple participants have the same sum as Vasya, they can be placed either before or after him. So, in the worst case, all those with sum >= s_vasya come before or at the same position as Vasya.\n\nTherefore, for each possible s_vasya, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can place Vasya first. The worst possible rank is the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >= s_vasya minus the number of people strictly greater than s_vasya, plus one.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose for a given s_vasya, we count how many participants have sum >= s_vasya. Let's call this count C. Then, the best possible rank is 1 (if possible). The worst possible rank is C - (number of participants with sum > s_vasya) - 1. Or wait, no.\n\nWait, let's say C is the number of participants with sum >= s_vasya. The best case is that all of them, including Vasya, are arranged in a way that Vasya is first. So the best rank is 1.\n\nThe worst case is that all C participants are arranged before Vasya. So his rank is C. But wait, in the worst case, other participants could have a sum higher than s_vasya, but no, because C is the count of participants with sum >= s_vasya.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is s_vasya, so others can have sum equal to it or higher. So in the worst case, all those with sum > s_vasya are above Vasya, and all those with sum == s_vasya are also above him. So the worst rank is the count of all participants (including Vasya) whose sum is >= s_vasya. So the worst rank is C.\n\nBecause Vasya is part of C, so C includes him. So in the worst case, all C participants are placed before him, making his rank C.\n\nWait, but suppose someone else has a sum higher than s_vasya, then they are placed before him. Those with sum equal to s_vasya can be placed before or after, depending on the jury. So for the worst case, Vasya is placed after all others with sum >= s_vasya, including those with sum equal.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >= s_vasya.\n\nSo for each possible s_vasya, we need to compute:\n\nBest rank: 1.\n\nWorst rank: the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >= s_vasya.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible (i, j), compute s = a[i] + b[j]. If s >= x, then consider this as Vasya's sum.\n\n2. For each such s, compute the number of participants (including Vasya) whose sum is >= s.\n\n3. Among all possible s >=x, find the minimum and maximum possible ranks.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the sum for all participants?\n\nBecause the a and b lists are in arbitrary order, each participant is assigned a unique a and b, but the pairing is unknown. So, for each possible pairing (which is a permutation of a and b), we can compute the sum for each participant and then count.\n\nBut trying all permutations is computationally impossible, as 105! is way too big.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of trying all possible pairings, for each possible (i,j) pair, assume that it's Vasya's sum, and then compute how many other participants' a and b can form sums >= s, without conflicting with the pairing.\n\nWait, but that's still tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible (i,j) where a[i]+b[j]>=x, we can treat (i,j) as Vasya's pair, and then compute the maximum possible number of participants that have a sum >= s_vasya, given that a[i] and b[j] are used by Vasya.\n\nBut how?\n\nSo, for each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n- Assign a[i] to participant i, and b[j] to participant j (but wait, i and j are indices of a and b, which may not correspond to the same participant).\n\nWait, no. Because the a list and b list are for the same set of participants, but in arbitrary order.\n\nSo, each participant has exactly one a and one b, but the a and b are in different orders.\n\nSo, for a given (i,j), if a[i] + b[j] >=x, then this is a candidate for Vasya's sum.\n\nNow, for this candidate sum s = a[i] + b[j], we need to compute how many participants (including Vasya) have a sum >=s.\n\nBut wait, since the a and b are fixed for all participants, but their pairing is unknown, we can't just count all possible a's and b's.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x, we can imagine that Vasya is the participant who has a[i] in the first tour and b[j] in the second tour. Then, for the rest of the participants, each one has a a_k and b_l, but k !=i and l !=j.\n\nWait, no. Because each participant has exactly one a and one b. So, for all other participants, their a and b are the remaining ones, but their pairing is not known.\n\nSo, for the given (i,j), the other a's and b's are the ones not used in this pair.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because a and b are separate for each participant. So, for all participants, their a is from the a list, and their b is from the b list. So, the a list contains one entry per participant, same for the b list.\n\nSo, if I choose a[i] and b[j] as Vasya's scores, then for other participants, their a must be from the remaining a's (excluding a[i]), and their b must be from the remaining b's (excluding b[j]).\n\nSo, for each (i,j), the sum s_vasya = a[i] + b[j], and then for all other participants, their sum is a[k] + b[l], where k !=i and l !=j.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: for each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x, compute how many participants (including Vasya) have a sum >=s_vasya, where Vasya's sum is a[i] + b[j], and other participants' sums are a[k] + b[l], with k !=i and l !=j.\n\nWait, no. Because for each participant, their sum is a specific a and b. So, for a given (i,j), the sum of Vasya is a[i] + b[j], and the other participants' sums are formed by pairing the remaining a's and b's in any way possible.\n\nBut since the a and b are for the same set of participants, each a and b is used exactly once. So, when we fix (i,j) as Vasya's pair, the other participants must pair the remaining a's and b's.\n\nBut the way they pair could vary, affecting the number of participants with sum >=s_vasya.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of finding the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >=s_vasya, regardless of how the other a and b are paired. Because the jury can arrange the participants in any way to maximize or minimize Vasya's rank.\n\nWait, no. Because the way the other participants are paired affects whether their sum is >=s_vasya. So, for a fixed (i,j), the worst possible scenario is when as many participants as possible have sum >=s_vasya. So, for that, the other participants should pair their a and b in a way that maximizes the number of sums >=s_vasya.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), compute s_vasya = a[i] + b[j], then for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s_vasya. Then, the count C is the total number of participants with sum >=s_vasya, which includes Vasya.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each possible (i,j):\n\n1. Check if a[i] + b[j] >=x. If not, skip.\n\n2. Now, compute the sum s_vasya = a[i] + b[j].\n\n3. Take the remaining a's (all a's except a[i]) and remaining b's (all b's except b[j]).\n\n4. Pair these remaining a's and b's in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s_vasya.\n\n5. Count how many participants (including Vasya) have sum >=s_vasya. This is the maximum possible count C for this (i,j).\n\n6. For this C, the best possible rank is 1 (if possible), and the worst is C.\n\nWait, but no. Because for each (i,j), the best possible rank is 1 (as the jury can arrange Vasya first), and the worst is C (all participants with sum >=s_vasya are placed before or at the same time as Vasya). So, for each (i,j), we can compute the worst possible rank as C.\n\nSo, for each (i,j) that meets s_vasya >=x, compute the maximum possible C, which is the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum >=s_vasya, given optimal pairing of the remaining a and b.\n\nThen, among all possible (i,j), find the minimal and maximal possible C. But wait, no. Because for each (i,j), the C could be different. So, the overall best possible rank is the minimum C across all possible (i,j), and the worst possible rank is the maximum C.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), the C represents the worst case for that particular choice of Vasya's sum. So, the worst possible overall rank is the maximum C over all possible (i,j) choices.\n\nSimilarly, the best possible overall rank is the minimum C over all possible (i,j) choices.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), the C is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya when the remaining a and b are optimally paired to maximize this count. So, the worst rank Vasya can have is the maximum possible C across all (i,j) pairs.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the problem allows us to choose which (i,j) is Vasya's pair. So, for each (i,j), we can choose it as Vasya's pair, compute the worst case C for that choice, and then take the minimal and maximal over all such Cs.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), choosing it as Vasya's pair gives a certain worst-case C. So, the best possible overall worst rank is the minimal of these Cs, and the best possible best rank is the minimal C across all (i,j) that can be chosen.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem asks for the best possible rank and the worst possible rank that Vasya could have. So, for each possible (i,j) that is Vasya's pair, compute the worst rank (C) possible. Then, the overall worst possible rank is the minimal of all such Cs. Because for Vasya, he can choose the (i,j) that gives him the best possible worst rank.\n\nSimilarly, for the best possible rank, it's always 1, because the jury can arrange Vasya as first.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the jury can arrange the ties as they wish. So, for any sum, the best possible rank is 1. So, the best possible rank is always 1, regardless of s_vasya.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that when all participants have the same sum, Vasya can be first or last.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in the case of ties, the jury can arrange the participants in any order. So, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is the number of participants with sum >=s_vasya.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n1. Compute s_vasya = a[i] + b[j].\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s_vasya, considering that the remaining a's and b's are paired in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s_vasya.\n\n3. Keep track of all possible Cs.\n\nThen:\n\n- The best possible rank is 1, since the jury can arrange Vasya first.\n\n- The worst possible rank is the minimal possible maximum C across all (i,j) choices.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), the C is the worst case for that s_vasya. So, the overall worst possible rank is the minimal C across all possible (i,j) choices. Because Vasya can choose the (i,j) that gives the smallest possible C.\n\nWait, no, because for each (i,j), C is the worst possible rank for that choice. So, to find the overall worst possible rank, Vasya can choose the (i,j) that gives the minimal C.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), the C is the worst case when the remaining a and b are paired to maximize the number of participants >=s_vasya. So, the worst possible rank for that (i,j) is C. So, the overall worst possible rank is the minimal C across all (i,j), because Vasya can choose the (i,j) that gives the smallest possible C.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each (i,j), the C is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_vasya when the remaining a and b are optimally paired. So, for each (i,j), the C is the worst possible rank for that particular s_vasya. So, Vasya wants to choose the (i,j) that gives the smallest C.\n\nSo, the minimal possible C across all (i,j) is the best possible worst rank.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each (i,j) in 0..n-1 x 0..n-1:\n\n   a. Check if a[i] + b[j] >=x. If not, skip.\n\n   b. Compute s_vasya = a[i] + b[j].\n\n   c. Take all a's except a[i], and all b's except b[j].\n\n   d. For these remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s_vasya.\n\n   e. Count how many participants (including Vasya) have sum >=s_vasya. Let's call this count C.\n\n2. Collect all possible Cs from the above steps.\n\n3. The best possible rank is 1.\n\n4. The worst possible rank is the minimal C across all (i,j) pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), C is the maximum possible number of participants with sum >=s_vasya. So, the worst rank for that (i,j) is C. So, the minimal possible C is the best possible worst rank.\n\nBecause Vasya can choose any (i,j) that satisfies a[i]+b[j]>=x. He would choose the (i,j) that gives the minimal C, which is the smallest possible worst rank.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over all (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] >=x.\n\n- For each such (i,j), compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s_vasya, when the remaining a and b are paired to maximize this count.\n\n- Among all such C values, find the minimal C. That's the worst possible rank.\n\nSo, the key is, for each (i,j), compute the maximum possible C, then find the minimal C.\n\nNow, the challenge is, for each (i,j), how to efficiently compute the maximum possible C.\n\nHow to pair the remaining a's and b's to maximize the number of sums >=s_vasya.\n\nHmm. Let's think about it.\n\nGiven a list of a's and b's (excluding a[i] and b[j]), we need to pair each a in A with a b in B such that the sum is >=s_vasya.\n\nWe want as many pairs as possible to satisfy this.\n\nThis is similar to the problem where you have two lists, and you pair them to maximize the number of pairs meeting a condition.\n\nIn this case, the condition is a + b >= s_vasya.\n\nSo, the approach to maximize the count is:\n\nSort A in ascending order and B in descending order. Then, pair the largest available B with the smallest possible A that, when paired, gives a sum >= s_vasya. This way, you use up as few large Bs as possible, allowing the remaining Bs to pair with smaller As.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to sort A in ascending order and B in descending order, and greedily pair each B with the smallest A that can meet the condition.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to sort A in ascending and B in ascending, and try to pair the largest possible B with the smallest possible A.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort A in ascending order, and B in descending order, and then for each B in B_list, try to find the smallest A in A_list that when added to B, is >= s_vasya. Once found, remove that A and proceed.\n\nThis way, each B is paired with the smallest possible A, leaving larger As for larger Bs, which may allow more pairs to meet the condition.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because you're using the smallest A for each B, allowing larger As to be used for other Bs.\n\nSo, the steps for pairing are:\n\n- Sort A in ascending order.\n\n- Sort B in descending order.\n\n- Initialize a pointer for A at the start (smallest element).\n\n- For each B in B_list:\n\n   - Find the smallest A in A_list (starting from current pointer) such that A + B >= s_vasya.\n\n   - If found, increment the count, move the pointer to the next A.\n\n   - Else, break.\n\nSo, this method tries to pair each B with the smallest possible A that satisfies the condition, thus maximizing the number of valid pairs.\n\nSo, now, for each (i,j), we can:\n\n1. Extract the remaining a's (all a's except a[i]).\n\n2. Extract the remaining b's (all b's except b[j]).\n\n3. Sort the a's in ascending order.\n\n4. Sort the b's in descending order.\n\n5. Use the two pointers approach to count the maximum number of pairs where a + b >=s_vasya.\n\n6. Add 1 (for Vasya's own sum) to this count to get C.\n\n7. Keep track of the minimal C across all (i,j) pairs.\n\nAdditionally, since Vasya's sum is a[i] + b[j], which is >=x, it's possible that other participants could have sum >=s_vasya.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), the process is:\n\n- Create a copy of a and b, removing a[i] and b[j].\n\n- Sort the remaining a's in ascending order.\n\n- Sort the remaining b's in descending order.\n\n- Use the two pointers approach to count the maximum possible pairs.\n\n- The count is added to 1 (Vasya) to get C.\n\nThen, collect all possible Cs, find the minimal C, and that's the worst possible rank.\n\nSo, now, the plan is clear.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nWe'll loop through all possible i and j (from 0 to n-1), compute s = a[i] + b[j]. If s <x, skip.\n\nElse, proceed to compute the maximum C for this (i,j).\n\nCompute the maximum C as follows:\n\nCreate a list a_rest = a without a[i]\n\nCreate a list b_rest = b without b[j]\n\nSort a_rest in ascending order.\n\nSort b_rest in descending order.\n\nInitialize a pointer for a_rest, starting at 0.\n\ncount =0\n\nfor each b_val in b_rest:\n\n   while a_ptr < len(a_rest) and a_rest[a_ptr] + b_val < s:\n\n       a_ptr +=1\n\n   if a_ptr < len(a_rest):\n\n       count +=1\n\n       a_ptr +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       break\n\nC = count +1 (because Vasya is included)\n\nAdd this C to a list of possible Cs.\n\nAfter processing all (i,j) pairs, find the minimal C and the maximal C.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), C can vary, and we need to find the minimal C across all possible (i,j) to determine the worst possible rank.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), C is the worst possible rank for that particular Vasya's sum. So, the overall worst possible rank is the minimal C across all possible (i,j) pairs.\n\nBecause Vasya can choose any (i,j) that gives a valid sum, and he would choose the one that gives the smallest possible C.\n\nWait, no. Because each (i,j) gives a C, which is the worst case for that sum. So, to find the worst possible rank, Vasya would choose the (i,j) that gives the smallest C.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmin_c = infinity\n\nmax_c = 0\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    for each j in 0..n-1:\n\n        if a[i] + b[j] <x: continue\n\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n\n        # create a_rest and b_rest\n\n        a_rest = [a[k] for k in 0..n-1 if k !=i]\n\n        b_rest = [b[k] for k in 0..n-1 if k !=j]\n\n        a_rest.sort()\n\n        b_rest.sort(reverse=True)\n\n        a_ptr =0\n\n        cnt =0\n\n        for b_val in b_rest:\n\n            # find the smallest a in a_rest that a + b_val >=s\n\n            # binary search?\n\n            # a_rest is sorted, so for current b_val, find the first a in a_rest where a >= (s - b_val)\n\n            # the number of such a is len(a_rest) - a_ptr.\n\n            required = s - b_val\n\n            # find the first a in a_rest[a_ptr:] >= required.\n\n            # since a_rest is sorted, we can perform binary search.\n\n            # the index is the first a >= required.\n\n            left = a_ptr\n\n            right = len(a_rest)\n\n            while left < right:\n\n                mid = (left + right) //2\n\n                if a_rest[mid] >= required:\n\n                    right = mid\n\n                else:\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n            if left < len(a_rest):\n\n                cnt +=1\n\n                a_ptr = left +1\n\n            else:\n\n                break\n\n        c = cnt +1  # including Vasya\n\n        if c < min_c:\n\n            min_c = c\n\n        if c > max_c:\n\n            max_c = c\n\nWait, no. Because the code above calculates c for each (i,j), and then we track the minimal and maximal c across all (i,j) pairs.\n\nWait, but why track max_c? Because the best possible rank is 1, but the worst possible rank is the minimal c.\n\nNo, because for each (i,j), c is the worst possible rank for that sum. So, Vasya can choose any (i,j) that gives a c, and he will choose the (i,j) that gives the smallest c. So, the worst possible rank is the minimal c across all (i,j).\n\nBut the best possible rank is 1, as the jury can arrange Vasya first.\n\nWait, no. Because for each (i,j), the best rank is 1, but the worst is c. So, the overall best possible rank is 1, and the worst is the minimal c across all (i,j).\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nCollect all possible c's for (i,j) pairs.\n\nCompute the minimal c.\n\nThat's the worst possible rank.\n\nAnd the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the output is '1' and 'min_c'.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\nmin_rank = some big number.\n\nbest_possible = 1\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n\n        if s <x:\n\n            continue\n\n        # create a_rest and b_rest.\n\n        a_rest = []\n\n        b_rest = []\n\n        for k in range(n):\n\n            if k !=i:\n\n                a_rest.append(a[k])\n\n        for k in range(n):\n\n            if k !=j:\n\n                b_rest.append(b[k])\n\n        a_rest.sort()\n\n        b_rest.sort(reverse=True)\n\n        a_ptr =0\n\n        cnt =0\n\n        for b_val in b_rest:\n\n            required = s - b_val\n\n            # binary search for the first a >= required in a_rest starting from a_ptr.\n\n            left = a_ptr\n\n            right = len(a_rest)\n\n            while left < right:\n\n                mid = (left + right) //2\n\n                if a_rest[mid] >= required:\n\n                    right = mid\n\n                else:\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n            if left < len(a_rest):\n\n                cnt +=1\n\n                a_ptr = left +1\n\n            else:\n\n                break\n\n        c = cnt +1  # including Vasya.\n\n        if c < min_rank:\n\n            min_rank = c\n\nprint(1, min_rank)\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nEach possible (i,j) will have s=2. So, for each (i,j), the a_rest and b_rest will have 4 1's each.\n\nWhen pairing, each 1+1=2, which is equal to s=2.\n\nSo, the code will compute cnt =4 (since 4 pairs of 1+1=2), and c=5.\n\nSo, min_rank is 5, and best is 1. So the output is 1 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSame as first sample.\n\nWait, no, the second sample in the problem description is:\n\nInput:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput: 1 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the second sample in the note is different.\n\nWell, the code seems to handle it correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=3.\n\na = [3, 0]\n\nb = [0,3]\n\nPossible (i,j) pairs:\n\ni=0, j=0: s=3+0=3 >=3. a_rest is [0], b_rest is [3]. Pairing 0+3=3 >=3. So cnt=1, c=2.\n\ni=0, j=1: s=3+3=6 >=3. a_rest is [0], b_rest is [0]. 0+0=0 <6: cnt=0, c=1.\n\ni=1, j=0: a[1]=0, b[0]=0: s=0 <3: skip.\n\ni=1, j=1: a[1]=0, b[1]=3: s=3 >=3. a_rest is [3], b_rest is [0]. 3+0=3 >=3: cnt=1, c=2.\n\nSo, the possible c's are 2, 1, 2.\n\nSo, min_rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, for i=0, j=1: s=6. Then, a_rest is [0], b_rest is [0]. When pairing, 0+0=0 <6: cnt=0, c=1.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the output is 1 1.\n\nWhich makes sense.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nPotential optimizations:\n\n- Precompute a_rest and b_rest.\n\n- Sorting a_rest and b_rest is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n=105.\n\n- Binary search is O(log n) per b_val.\n\nSo, for n=105, the total operations are 105*105 * (O(1) + O(n log n) + O(n log n) + O(n log n)).\n\nWhich is 11,025 * (some small factors), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement it.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- n=1: but according to the problem statement, n>=1, but since all participants participate in both tours, n can be 1.\n\nIn this case, a[0] + b[0] >=x.\n\nSo, for i=0, j=0: a_rest is empty, b_rest is empty. So cnt=0, c=1.\n\nThus, output is 1 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[5,5], b=[5,5], x=10.\n\nPossible (i,j):\n\ni=0,j=0: s=10 >=10.\n\na_rest = [5], b_rest = [5].\n\nPairing 5+5=10 >=10. cnt=1, c=2.\n\ni=0,j=1: s=10.\n\na_rest =5, b_rest=5: same as above.\n\ni=1,j=0: a=5, b=5. s=10.\n\ni=1,j=1: same.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), c=2.\n\nThus, min_rank is 2.\n\nSo, output is 1 2.\n\nAnother edge case: x=0.\n\nAll possible (i,j) are valid.\n\nThus, for each (i,j), compute c.\n\nBut for x=0, any sum is >=0.\n\nThus, the worst rank is the minimal c across all (i,j), which is 1 (if any (i,j) has s_vasya such that all other participants' sums are less than s_vasya).\n\nWait, no. For x=0, any (i,j) is valid.\n\nSo, for each (i,j), compute c.\n\nc is the number of participants with sum >=s_vasya.\n\nWhich could be 1 if s_vasya is very large.\n\nThus, the minimal c is 1.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is 1.\n\nBut the best possible is 1.\n\nSo, output is 1 1.\n\nWait, but that's only if there exists a (i,j) where s_vasya is so large that all other participants have sum < s_vasya.\n\nWhich is possible if, for example, a[i] is the maximum a, and b[j] is the maximum b.\n\nBut the code will find that.\n\nSo, the code should handle it.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[10, 0, 0], b=[0,10,0], x=10.\n\nPossible (i,j):\n\ni=0,j=0: s=20.\n\na_rest = [0,0], b_rest = [10,0].\n\nPairing: sort a_rest (0,0), sort b_rest (10,0).\n\nFor 10: find a >= (20-10=10). a_rest has 0 and 0.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The teacher knows that Vasya's total score is at least `x`, but the exact scores for each participant in each tour are given in arbitrary order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant has a score from the first tour and another from the second tour. The total score for each participant is the sum of their scores from both tours. The goal is to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve, considering all possible valid pairings of scores.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible pairing of scores (i, j) where the sum of the scores is at least `x`, we need to compute how many participants could have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's score. This will help us determine the worst possible rank, while the best possible rank is always 1 since the jury can place Vasya first if needed.\n\n3. **Efficient Pairing**: For each valid pair (i, j), we compute the maximum number of participants who could have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's score. This is done by sorting the remaining scores and using a greedy approach to maximize the count of valid pairs.\n\n4. **Binary Search Optimization**: To efficiently find the smallest score in the remaining scores that can form a valid pair, we use binary search, which helps in reducing the time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    min_rank = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            s = a[i] + b[j]\n            if s < x:\n                continue\n            \n            a_rest = []\n            b_rest = []\n            for k in range(n):\n                if k != i:\n                    a_rest.append(a[k])\n            for k in range(n):\n                if k != j:\n                    b_rest.append(b[k])\n            \n            a_rest.sort()\n            b_rest.sort(reverse=True)\n            \n            a_ptr = 0\n            cnt = 0\n            for b_val in b_rest:\n                required = s - b_val\n                left = a_ptr\n                right = len(a_rest)\n                while left < right:\n                    mid = (left + right) // 2\n                    if a_rest[mid] >= required:\n                        right = mid\n                    else:\n                        left = mid + 1\n                if left < len(a_rest):\n                    cnt += 1\n                    a_ptr = left + 1\n                else:\n                    break\n            \n            c = cnt + 1\n            if c < min_rank:\n                min_rank = c\n    \n    print(\"1\", min_rank)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Iterating Over Pairs**: For each possible pair (i, j), we check if the sum of the scores is at least `x`.\n3. **Remaining Scores**: We create lists of remaining scores after excluding the scores at indices `i` and `j`.\n4. **Sorting and Pairing**: We sort the remaining scores and use a greedy approach with binary search to count the maximum number of valid pairs where the sum is at least `s`.\n5. **Updating Ranks**: For each valid pair, we compute the worst possible rank and update the minimum rank accordingly.\n6. **Output**: The best possible rank is always 1, and the worst possible rank is the minimum value found across all valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best and worst possible ranks by leveraging sorting and binary search to handle all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
