    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We need to add k golden rings. Each ring is like a border around a rectangle that's getting smaller each time.\n\nHmm, let me think about how each ring is formed. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells in from there, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick. So for each i-th ring (starting from 1), it forms a border around a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, why 4? Because for each side, we subtract 2*(i-1) cells, right? Because each ring reduces both width and height by 2*(i-1) on each side.\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think: the first ring is the outermost, so the rectangle for it is w x h. The next ring would be 2 cells in from each edge, so the rectangle becomes (w-4) x (h-4). Oh right, because each dimension loses 2*(i-1) for each side. So for i=1, it's original; for i=2, subtract 4, etc.\n\nSo each ring i contributes a certain number of cells. How do I calculate that?\n\nWell, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because when you have a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is the sum of all four sides, but subtracting the four corners which are counted twice. So for a rectangle of WxH cells, the perimeter is 2*(W + H) -4.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is W_i = w - 4*(i-1), and height H_i = h -4*(i-1). Then the number of cells for that ring is 2*(W_i + H_i) -4.\n\nBut wait, what if W_i or H_i becomes less than or equal to zero? No, because the constraints say that k is chosen such that all rings can fit. So for example, the maximum k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ), which ensures that after k rings, the inner rectangle is at least 3x3 or similar, but I don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute W_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute H_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2*(W_i + H_i) -4\n   d. Add this to the total.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 1\n\nRing 1: W=3, H=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9 1\n\nRing 1: W=7, H=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. That's the output.\n\nSample Input 3:\n7 9 2\n\nRing 1: 7*9 gives perimeter 28.\nRing 2: W=7-4=3, H=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, in code, I need to loop from 1 to k, compute for each step, and sum them all.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    wi = w -4*(i-1)\n    hi = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(wi + hi) -4\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's pretty simple.\n\nWait, but wait, what about when wi or hi is less than 1? But according to the problem statement, k is within the limits, so for i up to k, wi and hi will be >=3, perhaps? Or no, maybe not necessarily.\n\nWait, the problem says k is at most floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). Let me see:\n\nFor example, min(w, h) could be 3: then (3+1)/4 is 1. So k can be 1.\n\nThen, after the first ring, W and H become 3-4= -1, which is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with a specified number of golden rings. Each ring is formed by bordering cells that are progressively further inward from the edge.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle that reduces in size as we move inward. The first ring is along the outermost edge, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells can be calculated using the perimeter of the rectangle it forms. The perimeter of a rectangle with width \\( W \\) and height \\( H \\) is given by \\( 2 \\times (W + H) - 4 \\), which accounts for all the bordering cells.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to \\( k \\), compute the current width and height by subtracting \\( 4 \\times (i-1) \\) from the original width and height respectively. Calculate the perimeter for each ring and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    wi = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    hi = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (wi + hi) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers \\( w \\) (width), \\( h \\) (height), and \\( k \\) (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\( k \\), compute the current width and height by adjusting for the inward position of each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and calculating the perimeter for each, ensuring that all edge cases are handled within the constraints provided.",
