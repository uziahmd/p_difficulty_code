For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nHmm, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the sequence was C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B. But here, it's including H instead of B? Or maybe I'm misreading. Oh no, looking back, the problem says the 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's correct. So after H comes C again.\n\nEach consecutive note has a semitone distance of 1, meaning each step is 0.5 tone. So, for example, C to C# is 1 semitone, C to D is 2, etc.\n\nA major triad requires that when the notes are ordered X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3, making a total of 7 semitones. Alternatively, if any rotation of the notes fits that, then it's major.\n\nA minor triad is when the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively, again in order.\n\nSo, the approach is: take all possible permutations of the three notes, check for each permutation whether it forms a major or minor chord, and then classify accordingly.\n\nWait, but since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes. For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes and see if they fit either the major or minor pattern.\n\nBut how do I represent the positions of each note? Maybe assign each note a number corresponding to its position in the 12-note scale. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, up to H which is 11. Then, the distance between two notes is (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is measured as moving forward, perhaps it's (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x). Wait, no, because in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is from the lower to the higher note. So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, to D is 2, D# 3, E 4), and between E and C is 8 (since E to F is 5, F to F# 6, G 7, G# 8, G## would be 9, but H is 11, then C is 12, but wait, the scale is cyclic. Wait, maybe I should model the positions as numbers modulo 12.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each note has a position in 0-11. The distance between X and Y, when X is before Y in the scale, is (Y_pos - X_pos) * 0.5 semitones. But according to the problem statement, the distance is 4 semitones between C and E, which is correct because E is 4 steps away from C (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4). So the distance is 4 semitones.\n\nSo, for any two notes, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but multiplied by 0.5? No, wait no. Because the problem says that the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) * 1 semitone. Because each consecutive note is one semitone apart. So, for example, C to D is 2 semitones.\n\nWait, the problem says that between two consecutive notes, there's exactly one semitone. So the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. So the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y when moving forward in the scale, which is (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12. Because after H comes C, so for example, H is 11, C is 0. So H to C is (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1, but wait, that's not right because H to C is one semitone. Wait, (0 - 11) is -11 mod 12 is 1. So yes, the distance is 1 semitone.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12, but since we're considering the forward direction, the distance is (y - x) if y >= x, else (y -x + 12). So, in terms of modular arithmetic, the distance is (y - x) % 12, but that might give a negative result if x > y. So perhaps better to compute (y - x + 12) % 12 to get the positive distance.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf x is 11 (H) and y is 0 (C), then y -x is -11. Adding 12 gives 1, which is correct.\n\nIf x is 0 and y is 4, y -x is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the distance from X to Y is (y - x) % 12. Because when you subtract, if y is smaller than x, you wrap around.\n\nWait, no. Because (y - x) could be negative. So (y -x) % 12 will correctly give the positive distance.\n\nFor example:\n\ny=0, x=4: 0-4 = -4. (-4) %12 is 8. Which is the distance from E to C, which is 8 semitones. Which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo, for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12.\n\nSo, for the triad, I need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes, compute the distances between consecutive notes, and see if any of them form a major or minor triad.\n\nWait, but the triad is an unordered set. So for each permutation of the three notes as X, Y, Z, I need to calculate the distances between X-Y and Y-Z.\n\nWait, but what defines the order? Because the distance is computed as X to Y to Z, but if the notes are arranged differently, it may not fit. So for each permutation, we can compute d1 = (Y - X) mod 12, d2 = (Z - Y) mod 12. Then, if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3, it's a major. If d1 ==3 and d2 ==4, it's minor.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the triad must be a set of exactly three notes, and for a major, the distances are 4 and 3 in some order that allows the triad to be major. So, for each permutation, we can compute these distances.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their positions. Like a dictionary where 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, up to 'H' which is 11.\n\n2. Read the three notes, create a list of them.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes, since the order matters for calculating the distances.\n\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute d1 = (y - x) mod 12, d2 = (z - y) mod 12.\n\n5. Check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3: if so, it's a major triad.\n\n6. Else, check if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4: if so, minor.\n\n7. If any permutation satisfies either condition, record the type.\n\n8. After checking all permutations, determine which type it is. Since the problem states that the answer is unambiguous, there won't be cases where a chord is both major and minor.\n\nSo, how many permutations are there? For three distinct elements, 6 permutations. So it's manageable.\n\nBut wait, what if two notes are the same? Like, if the input is ['C', 'C', 'E'] — but the problem says that it's a set, but the input is three space-separated notes. So, I think in the problem, the notes are all distinct. Because a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes, implying that all are unique.\n\nSo, the code can assume that the three notes are distinct.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, create a note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nThen, read the three notes into a list.\n\nGenerate all 6 possible permutations of these three notes.\n\nFor each permutation, compute d1 and d2.\n\nCheck for major and minor conditions.\n\nOnce any permutation meets major, return major.\n\nElse, if any permutation meets minor, return minor.\n\nElse, it's strange.\n\nNow, the question is: how to represent the notes. The input is given as strings, like 'C E G', so I need to split them into individual note strings, then process each.\n\nSo, first, split the input line into three parts.\n\nThen, for each note, look up their position in the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nOnce I have the positions, generate all permutations.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\n- Create the note_to_pos mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n- Read the input line, split into three notes.\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\n- Convert each note into its position.\n\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in notes]\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three positions.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = permutations(positions)\n\nWait, but permutations returns tuples, so for each p in perms, p is a tuple of three integers.\n\nFor each permutation, compute d1 = (p[1] - p[0]) % 12, d2 = (p[2] - p[1]) % 12.\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nIf d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nWe need to check each permutation until we find either a major or minor.\n\nOnce a major is found, we can immediately return 'major'.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nIf none of the permutations satisfy either condition, then it's strange.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nmajor_found = False\nminor_found = False\n\nfor p in perms:\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        major_found = True\n        break\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        minor_found = True\n        break\n\nif major_found:\n    print('major')\nelif minor_found:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWhich translates to the three triads:\n\nTriad 1: C, E, G.\n\nPositions: C is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7):\n\nd1 =4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo, output is major.\n\nTriad 2: C#, B, F.\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations where the distances are 4 and 3 or 3 and 4.\n\nOne permutation is (B, C#, F): 10,1,5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod 12 → 1-10 is -9 → mod 12 is 3.\n\nd2 = (5-1) mod 12 →4.\n\nSo, d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nTriad3: A, B, H.\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nLooking for any permutation that gives 4 and 3 or 3 and 4.\n\nLet me see all permutations:\n\nA, B, H: 9,10,11 → d1=1, d2=1 → no.\n\nA, H, B: 9,11,10 → d1=2, d2=11 → no.\n\nB, A, H: 10,9,11 → d1= (9-10) mod12 = 11, d2=2 → no.\n\nB, H, A: 10,11,9 → d1=1, d2= (9-11) mod12= 10 → no.\n\nH, A, B: 11,9,10 → d1= (9-11)= -2 mod12=10, d2=1 → no.\n\nH, B, A: 11,10,9 → d1= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11, d2= (9-10)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nNone of these permutations give 4 and 3 or 3 and4. So the triad is strange.\n\nSo the output is ['major', 'minor', 'strange'], which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: let's say the input is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nAs discussed, the permutation (C, E, G) gives d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nWhat about ['E', 'G', 'C']?\n\nE is 4, G is7, C is0.\n\nd1 =7-4=3, d2=0-7=5 (mod12, 0-7 is -7 → 5 mod12).\n\nWait, no: (0-7) mod12 is 5.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=5 → no.\n\nBut another permutation: E, C, G.\n\nE is4, C is0, G is7.\n\nd1=(0-4) mod12 → 8.\n\nd2=(7-0) mod12 →7.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, but the permutation (C, G, E) is 0,7,4.\n\nd1=7, d2=(4-7) mod12= ( -3 ) mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe another permutation: G, C, E.\n\nG is7, C is0, E is4.\n\nd1= (0-7) mod12=5.\n\nd2= (4-0)=4 mod12.\n\nSo d1=5, d2=4 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think about all permutations.\n\nWait, let's try another example. Let's say the notes are ['C', 'D#', 'G'].\n\nC is0, D# is3, G is6.\n\nIn the permutation C, D#, G: d1=3, d2=3 → no.\n\nC, G, D#: d1=6-0=6, d2=(3-6) mod12= 9 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: for a major triad, any permutation where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two are 3.\n\nWait, but the order matters. So in this case, C, E, G is a major triad.\n\nBut C, G, E is not.\n\nSo, for the code, it's correct to check all permutations.\n\nSo, the code will correctly find the major triad when the correct permutation is encountered.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase where all three notes are the same? But according to the problem, the chord is a set, so all three must be distinct. So the input will have three distinct notes.\n\nAnother edge case: the three notes form a minor chord in one permutation and major in another.\n\nBut the problem says that such cases don't exist, so the code can safely stop at the first occurrence.\n\nAnother edge case: when a permutation leads to d1=4, d2=3, and another permutation leads to d1=3, d2=4. But according to the problem statement, the answer is always unique.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nSo, now to write the code.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_pos mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nRead the three notes:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nConvert to positions:\n\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in notes]\n\nGenerate all permutations:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = permutations(positions)\n\nLoop through each permutation:\n\nmajor_found = False\nminor_found = False\n\nfor perm in perms:\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        major_found = True\n        break\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        minor_found = True\n        break\n\nThen, decide output:\n\nif major_found:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif minor_found:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but the order of checking is important. Because once major is found, it breaks and returns, but what if a permutation could also be minor? According to the problem statement, that doesn't happen.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The classification is based on the distances between consecutive notes when ordered in a specific way.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: Each note is assigned a position in a 12-note scale, which helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three notes, which are read and converted into their respective positions using the mapping.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the type of triad, we generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n4. **Checking Triad Type**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. If the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad, classify the chord accordingly.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, output whether the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Mapping each note to its corresponding index\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n# Read input notes\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n# Convert notes to their respective positions\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in input_notes]\n\n# Check all permutations of the three notes\nmajor_found = False\nminor_found = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        major_found = True\n        break\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        minor_found = True\n        break\n\nif major_found:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif minor_found:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: Each note is mapped to a position from 0 to 11, where 0 corresponds to C, 1 to C#, and so on up to H at position 11.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we consider every possible ordering to check for the required distances.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Classification**: If any permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor triad, the respective flag is set, and the result is printed. If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the notes to determine the correct classification of the triad.",
