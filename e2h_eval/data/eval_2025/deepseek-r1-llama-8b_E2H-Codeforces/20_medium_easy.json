For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, a beautiful multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. For each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find the number of ways to choose all c_s such that the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem says \"for every binary string s of length from 1 to n\". Oh, wait no—the multiset is of strings of length exactly n, but the condition applies to all possible prefixes s of any length from 1 to n. So for each s (like \"0\", \"00\", etc.), the count of strings in the multiset that start with s should be <= c_s.\n\nAnd our goal is to choose c_s for all s such that the largest possible size of the multiset is f. We have to count how many such choices of c_s exist, modulo 998244353.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that each choice of c_s defines a constraint on the multiset. The maximum size of the multiset is determined by the c_s's. We need to count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum possible size is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can model this as a combinatorial problem where for each s, the maximum allowed is c_s, and we want the sum over all s' of the number of times s' appears in the multiset to be exactly f, but also ensuring that for each s, the count of its suffixes (or maybe prefixes) doesn't exceed c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the condition is that for every s (as a prefix), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. So for example, if the multiset has \"11\" and \"111\", then for s=\"11\", both are counted. So the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s.\n\nSo the problem is about choosing c_s for each s, and then the maximum possible size of the multiset is f. We need to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe the key is to realize that the constraints on the c_s's form a certain structure. For instance, for s being a prefix of t, the c_t must be at least as large as the number of t's in the multiset, which affects s's c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the inclusion-exclusion of the constraints. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming, considering the constraints on the counts of each s.\n\nBut given the size of n (up to 15), the number of possible s is manageable. Let's see: for n=15, the number of binary strings is 2^15 = 32768. But for n up to 15, that's manageable because the DP state would have to consider these.\n\nWait, but the c_s can be up to 2e5, which is a big number. So perhaps the key is to find a way to compute for each possible set of c_s's whether the maximum multiset size is f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of the Möbius function or some inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, another angle: the maximum size of the multiset is f when, for some s, the minimal required c_s is exactly f minus the sum of some other constraints. Or perhaps the constraints form a tree, and the maximum is determined by the path through the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be viewed as a tree where each node is a string s, and edges represent the parent-child relationship (i.e., s is a prefix of t). Then, the c_s's must satisfy certain conditions based on their children.\n\nLet me think: for each string s, the count of the number of times s appears in the multiset (let's call it cnt[s]) must satisfy cnt[s] ≤ c_s. Also, for any string t that is a proper suffix of s, cnt[s] must be ≥ cnt[t], because t is a prefix of s, so the count of s is part of the count for t.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if t is a prefix of s, then s is a longer string. So the count for t includes all the strings in the multiset that start with t. So if s starts with t, then any occurrence of s contributes to the count of t. Therefore, cnt[t] must be >= cnt[s].\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, suppose t is \"0\" and s is \"00\". Then, the count for t is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"0\", which includes \"00\", \"01\", \"00\", etc. So if s is \"00\", then the count for t (\"0\") is at least as large as the count for s (\"00\").\n\nSo in other words, for any s, the count cnt[s] (number of times s appears in the multiset) must be ≤ c[s], and for any t that is a proper suffix of s (i.e., s is a prefix of t), cnt[s] must be ≥ cnt[t].\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite. Because t is a proper suffix of s. So s is a prefix of t. So the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. That includes t, because t is longer than s. So for example, if t is \"10\" and s is \"1\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"10\" will also start with \"1\", so the count for s (which is \"1\") includes the count for t.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's clarify: cnt[s] is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So for any t that is a proper suffix of s, s is a prefix of t. So any string that starts with t will automatically start with s. Thus, the count for s includes all the counts of its proper suffixes.\n\nThus, for any s and t where s is a prefix of t, cnt[s] >= cnt[t]. So in the constraints, for each s, cnt[s] <= c[s], and for each t that is a proper suffix of s, cnt[s] >= cnt[t]. \n\nThis forms a hierarchy where the count for longer strings can't exceed the count for shorter ones that are their prefixes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting c[s] for all s, and then the maximum possible size of the multiset is f. The size is the sum of cnt[s] for all s, and each cnt[s] is bounded by c[s] and the cnt of their suffixes.\n\nWe need to count the number of c[s] assignments where the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how? Because the maximum possible sum depends on the constraints imposed by the c[s]s.\n\nI think the key is to model the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node is a string s, and there's an edge from s to t if t is a proper suffix of s (i.e., s is a prefix of t). Then, the constraints are that for each node s, cnt[s] <= c[s], and for each edge s → t, cnt[s] >= cnt[t].\n\nIn such a setup, the maximum possible sum of cnt[s] across all s is determined by the c[s]s.\n\nBut how do we find the sum? It's the sum over all s of the minimal possible cnt[s]s that satisfy all the constraints.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum of cnt[s] is the size of the multiset. Each cnt[s] can be as large as possible, but subject to the constraints that for each s, cnt[s] <= c[s], and for each t that is a suffix of s (so s is a prefix of t), cnt[s] >= cnt[t].\n\nWait, but in that case, the cnt[s]s are determined by the c[s]s. Because, for the maximal sum, each cnt[s] is as large as possible under the constraints. So the maximum possible sum is the sum over s of min(c[s], ...). Wait, no, that's not precise.\n\nWait, think of it as building the cnt[s]s from the leaves up. For each s, the maximum cnt[s] is min(c[s], cnt[parent(s)]). Because, for s to be a child of parent(s), which is a prefix of s, the cnt[s] can't exceed the cnt[parent(s)], since parent(s) is a prefix of s.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Suppose s is a child of t, meaning t is a proper prefix of s. Then, cnt[t] >= cnt[s], because any string that starts with s also starts with t. So the maximum possible cnt[s] is min(c[s], cnt[t]). Wait, no—because cnt[s] can't exceed c[s], and also can't exceed cnt[t], because cnt[t] is the count of strings that have t as a prefix, including s.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to model this correctly.\n\nEach string s has a hierarchy based on its prefixes. For example, for s = \"000\", its prefixes are \"0\", \"00\", \"000\". So in the DAG, \"0\" → \"00\" → \"000\".\n\nFor each node s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is the minimum of c[s] and the cnt of its immediate predecessor in the hierarchy (the string formed by adding a bit to the end). Wait, perhaps not. Because for s, the maximum cnt[s] is limited by c[s], but also by the cnt of its immediate predecessor. For example, if s is \"00\", its immediate predecessor is \"0\". So cnt[\"00\"] can't be larger than cnt[\"0\"], because any string that starts with \"00\" also starts with \"0\", so the count for \"0\" includes the count for \"00\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, if s is \"00\", then any string that starts with \"00\" also starts with \"0\". So the count for \"0\" is at least as large as the count for \"00\". So for s=\"00\", the maximum cnt[\"00\"] can be is min(c[\"00\"], cnt[\"0\"]). Because if you have cnt[\"00\"] = x, then cnt[\"0\"] must be >= x.\n\nSo the maximum possible cnt for each s is min(c[s], the cnt of its immediate predecessor).\n\nWait, but the immediate predecessor is the string obtained by adding a '0' or '1' to the end of s. For example, s = \"01\" has two predecessors: \"0\" and \"00\"? No, wait: no. Wait, for s = \"01\", the immediate predecessor is \"0\" (since \"0\" is the string before adding the '1'). So, any string that starts with \"01\" must have started with \"0\", so the count for \"0\" is at least the count for \"01\".\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is the minimum between c[s] and the cnt of its immediate predecessor. But wait, the immediate predecessor is s without the last character, right? So, for s, the immediate predecessor is s[:-1], assuming s is non-empty.\n\nSo, the way to model this is that for each s, the cnt[s] can be at most c[s], and also at most the cnt of its predecessor s[:-1].\n\nBut wait, what about the other way around? For example, the predecessor s' = s[:-1] could have its own constraints. So for s', the cnt[s'] is also constrained by its own c[s'], and by the cnt of its predecessor.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum of cnt[s] for all s is the sum over all s of the minimum of c[s] and the cnt of s's predecessor.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum sum is determined by the minimal values along the chains of prefixes.\n\nLet me think recursively. For the empty string, which isn't considered here, but for each s, the maximum cnt[s] is min(c[s], cnt[s[:-1]]).\n\nWait, but the empty string isn't part of the problem. So for s of length m, the predecessor is s without the last character.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the sum over all s of the min(c[s], the maximum cnt of any string that is a proper prefix of s).\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree, and for each node s, the maximum cnt[s] is the minimum of c[s] and the maximum cnt of its parent (its immediate predecessor).\n\nSo, the problem becomes: assign c[s] for each s, and compute the maximum possible sum of cnt[s], which is the sum of min(c[s], parent_cnt), where parent_cnt is the cnt of the predecessor of s.\n\nThen, the question is: how many assignments of c[s] lead to this sum being exactly f.\n\nOur task is to compute the number of such assignments.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this for all s, and compute the number of c[s] assignments that result in the sum being exactly f.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 15, the number of possible s is 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable for some kind of dynamic programming approach.\n\nWait, but the c[s] can be up to 2e5, which is a problem because the state space would be too large.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where for each s, the c[s] can vary, and for each s, we track the minimal value that allows the sum to reach f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the maximum sum is determined by the c[s]s along the paths of the prefix hierarchy.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum sum is equal to the sum over all s of the minimal c[s] along the chain from the root (empty string) down to s, but since the empty string is not considered, perhaps starting from the leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the minimal c[s] for each node s, considering the constraints from the hierarchy.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input:\n\nn=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe c assignments are:\n\nCase 1: c_0 =0, c_1=2.\n\nMaximum sum is min(c_0, ...) but wait, for s=0 and s=1.\n\nWait, for s=1, the predecessor is 0. So cnt[1] can be up to min(c_1, cnt[0]).\n\nBut in this case, cnt[0] can be up to c_0, which is 0. So cnt[0] is 0. Then, cnt[1] can be up to min(c_1, 0) = 0. So the sum is 0.\n\nWait, that's not matching the sample. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's look at the sample explanation.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nPossible c assignments:\n\nc_0=0, c_1=2: maximum sum is 2.\n\nHow? The multiset can have two '1's. Because for s=0, the count is 0 (no strings start with 0), which is ≤ c_0=0. For s=1, the count is 2 (two '1's), which is ≤ c_1=2. So the maximum sum is 2.\n\nAh, so in this case, the sum is 2, which comes from the fact that for s=1, the count is 2, and for s=0, the count is 0.\n\nWait, but according to my previous model, the maximum cnt[0] is min(c_0, ...) but what is the predecessor of 0? There is none. So for the root node, which is the empty string, the maximum cnt is c_0. But wait, in the sample, the count for 0 is 0, which is less than or equal to c_0=0. So in that case, the sum is 2.\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum cnt[s] is the minimum between c[s] and the cnt of its immediate predecessor, except for the root (empty string), whose cnt is c_0.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- The root (empty string) has cnt equal to c_0.\n\n- For each s of length m>0, the predecessor is s without the last character. So, the cnt[s] can be at most min(c[s], cnt[pred(s)]).\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the predecessor is pred(s), which is a proper prefix. So, any string that starts with s also starts with pred(s). Thus, the count of pred(s) must be at least the count of s. So, cnt[s] <= cnt[pred(s)].\n\nBut in the sample, when c_0=0 and c_1=2:\n\ncnt[0] = 0 (since it's the root).\n\ncnt[1] can be up to min(2, cnt[0]) = 0. But in the sample, the sum is 2. So this suggests that my model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the direction wrong. Perhaps the count for pred(s) is at least the count for s. So, for s, the cnt[s] cannot exceed cnt[pred(s)]. So, the maximum possible cnt[s] is min(c[s], cnt[pred(s)]).\n\nBut in the sample, when c_0=0 and c_1=2:\n\ncnt[0] is 0.\n\ncnt[1] can be at most min(2, cnt[0]) = 0. But the sample shows that the sum is 2, which implies that the count for 1 is 2, which is more than cnt[0]. So this suggests that my understanding is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I got the direction of the edges reversed. Maybe the edge is from s to its superstring.\n\nWait, no. Because for s = \"1\", its only proper prefix is \"0\". So, any string that starts with \"1\" doesn't start with \"0\" unless it's \"0...\". So, the count for \"0\" includes \"1\" as a prefix.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, \"1\" does not start with \"0\". So, the count for \"0\" is the number of strings that start with \"0\", which includes \"00\", \"01\", etc. But \"1\" is a string that starts with \"1\", not \"0\". So the count for \"0\" is separate from \"1\".\n\nWait, so for s = \"0\", its cnt is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"0\". For s = \"1\", it's the number of strings that start with \"1\".\n\nThese two counts are independent. So, in the sample, the multiset can have two \"1\"s. So, the count for \"1\" is 2, which is <= c_1=2. The count for \"0\" is 0, which is <= c_0=0.\n\nBut according to the earlier model, cnt[1] should be <= cnt[0], which is 0. But that's not the case here. So clearly, my model is incorrect.\n\nAh! So my mistake was thinking that for s, the count cnt[s] is constrained by the count of its immediate predecessor. But that's not the case. Because s's predecessor is a different string. So, the count for s is independent of its predecessor's count, except for the fact that any string that starts with s's predecessor may or may not start with s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a string starts with s's predecessor, it doesn't necessarily start with s. For example, \"0\" is the predecessor of \"1\", but \"0\" does not start with \"1\".\n\nSo, the counts for s and its predecessor are independent. So, the count for s can be up to c[s], but there is no direct constraint between s and its predecessor except that the count for s can be anything, as long as it doesn't exceed c[s], and doesn't have any constraints from its own children.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because for any s, the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So, for each s, the count is the sum of the counts of all of its children plus itself. Or, perhaps, it's just the count of s itself, because s is a string in the multiset.\n\nWait, no. The multiset contains strings of length exactly n. So, for each string s of length exactly n, the count of s in the multiset is 1 if it's present, 0 otherwise. So, for any s, the count cnt[s] is 1 if s is in the multiset, 0 otherwise.\n\nWait, no, no. Because the problem says that the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So, for example, if s is a string of length m < n, then any occurrence of s as a prefix in the multiset would be for longer strings. So, for s of length m, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s and have length >= m.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So, for s of length m, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. So, for example, if s is \"0\", then the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"0\" (like \"00\", \"01\", etc.).\n\nThus, for the root string (empty string), the count is the total number of strings in the multiset. For a string s of length m, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s.\n\nSo, for the empty string, cnt[empty] is the size of the multiset.\n\nFor s of length 1, say \"0\" and \"1\", their counts are the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"0\" and \"1\", respectively.\n\nNow, the constraints are:\n\nFor each s, cnt[s] ≤ c[s].\n\nMoreover, for any two strings a and b, if a is a prefix of b, then cnt[a] >= cnt[b].\n\nBecause if b starts with a, then any string that starts with b also starts with a. So, the count of a includes the count of b.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for example, if the multiset contains \"00\" and \"01\", then cnt[\"0\"] is 2, cnt[\"00\"] is 1, cnt[\"01\"] is 1. Because \"00\" and \"01\" both start with \"0\", so cnt[\"0\"] is 2, which is greater than or equal to both cnt[\"00\"] and cnt[\"01\"].\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n- For each s, cnt[s] ≤ c[s].\n\n- For any s, if t is a proper prefix of s, then cnt[t] ≥ cnt[s].\n\nSo, the hierarchy is such that the count for a prefix is at least as large as the count for any of its suffixes.\n\nThus, the maximum possible sum of the counts is determined by the c[s]s, with the constraints that for each s, cnt[s] can't be larger than c[s], and for any t that is a proper prefix of s, cnt[s] can't be larger than cnt[t].\n\nWait, no. Because for any t that is a proper prefix of s, cnt[t] must be ≥ cnt[s]. So, the count for the longer string can't exceed the count of its prefix.\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is the minimum of c[s] and all cnt[t], where t is a proper prefix of s.\n\nWait, but that's tricky because for s, it can have multiple proper prefixes (all its ancestors in the hierarchy). So, for each s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is the minimum of c[s] and the cnt of its immediate predecessor, and the cnt of its grand-predecessor, and so on, up to the root.\n\nWait, no. Because for s, all its proper prefixes are in the path towards the root. So, the maximum cnt[s] is the minimum of c[s] and the cnt of all its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. For example, if s is \"01\", its proper prefixes are \"0\" and \"00\" (if n is large enough). So, cnt[s] can't exceed cnt[\"0\"], which in turn can't exceed cnt[\"00\"], and so on.\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is min(c[s], min{ cnt[prefix] for all proper prefixes prefix of s }).\n\nBut calculating this for each s seems computationally expensive. However, since n is up to 15, and the number of possible s is 2^15, which is manageable, perhaps we can precompute for each s the maximum possible cnt[s] given the c[s]s.\n\nBut then, how do we model the problem of counting the number of c[s] assignments that lead to the sum of cnt[s] being exactly f?\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the constraints as forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and model the problem as finding the number of ways to assign c[s] such that the sum of the minimal c[s] along each path is exactly f.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is determined by the minimal c[s] along the path from the root to each s. Because for each s, its cnt[s] is bounded by the minimal c[s] along the path from the root to s.\n\nWait, for example, if along the path from the root to s, the minimal c is m, then cnt[s] can be at most m. So, the maximum sum is the sum of all such m's for each s.\n\nBut in the sample, n=1, s can be \"0\" and \"1\". The path from root to \"0\" is just \"0\", so m is c_0=0. The path from root to \"1\" is \"0\" → \"1\", but wait, no. The path to \"1\" is via \"0\"? Or is the path directly to \"1\"?\n\nWait, no. The path to \"1\" is via the empty string, but \"1\" is not a prefix of the empty string. So, perhaps each string s has its own path, which starts from the empty string and adds each character step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps each string s can be viewed as a path in the trie. So, the root is the empty string, and each level represents adding a character. So, for s=\"0\", its path is the empty string followed by \"0\". For s=\"1\", it's the empty string followed by \"1\". For s=\"00\", it's empty → \"0\" → \"00\", etc.\n\nIn this case, for each s, the path from the root to s is the sequence of all its proper prefixes, including the empty string.\n\nThus, for each s, the maximum cnt[s] is the minimum c along this path.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. Because for s, all the nodes along the path from root to s must have c at least as large as cnt[s]. Because each node in the path is a prefix of s.\n\nSo, for example, if the path to s is root → a → b → s, then c[root], c[a], c[b], c[s] must all be >= cnt[s]. So, the minimal of these c's is the maximum possible cnt[s].\n\nThus, the maximum sum is the sum over all s of the minimal c along the path from root to s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting c[s] for all s (including the empty string?), but wait the empty string is not considered as per the problem statement. Wait, the problem says that s ranges from length 1 to n.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So, the empty string is not included. But the root is needed for the calculation.\n\nSo, the path from the root (empty string) to each s is needed to determine the minimal c along that path.\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is the minimal c value along the path from the root to s.\n\nThus, the maximum sum is the sum over all s (length 1..n) of the minimal c along their path.\n\nSo, the problem now is to count the number of c assignments (c[s] for s in all possible binary strings of lengths 1..n) such that the sum of the minimal c along each s's path is exactly f.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the c is assigned for every s of length 1..n. So, the empty string is not part of the c assignments. So, the root's c is not part of the c variables. So, how does that affect the model?\n\nWait, the root is the empty string, which is not part of the c variables. So, the path for each s starts with the empty string, but the empty string's c is not part of the variables. So, how does this affect the model?\n\nHmm. For example, consider s = \"0\". Its path is root (empty string) → \"0\". So, the minimal c along this path is min(c_root, c_0). But c_root is not a variable, it's fixed?\n\nNo, wait, the problem states that the c is chosen for each s of length 1..n. The empty string's c is not a variable. So, how is the root treated?\n\nWait, perhaps the root's c is considered as infinity, because it's not part of the variables. So, for any s, the minimal c along the path would be the minimal c of the variables along the path.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the root is the empty string, and for s=\"0\", the path is empty → \"0\". So, the minimal c along this path is c_0, because the empty string's c is not part of the variables.\n\nSimilarly, for s=\"1\", the path is empty → \"1\". The minimal c is c_1.\n\nSo, in the sample, the sum is c_0 + c_1. So, when the c_0 is 0 and c_1 is 2, the sum is 0+2=2, which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the sum is 2, which is indeed c_0 + c_1.\n\nSo, this suggests that the maximum sum is the sum of c[s] for each s, since each s's path from the root includes the empty string, but the empty string's c is considered as infinity. So, the minimal c along the path is the minimal c among the variables along the path.\n\nWait, no. Because the empty string is not a variable, so for s=\"0\", the path is empty → \"0\". The minimal c along this path is min(c_empty, c_0). But c_empty is not a variable, so perhaps it's considered to have a very high value (like +infinity). So, the minimal is c_0.\n\nSimilarly, for s=\"1\", the minimal is c_1.\n\nThus, the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nWait, but that's not the case in the sample. Because in the sample, the sum is 2 when c_0=0 and c_1=2, which equals 0+2=2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, this suggests that the maximum sum is the sum of c[s] for all s in the set (since each s's path from the root includes the empty string, but the empty string's c is considered as infinity, so the minimal c along each path is just c[s]).\n\nWait, but that can't be right for all cases. For example, consider n=2, and s=\"00\". Its path is empty → \"0\" → \"00\". The minimal c along this path is min(c_empty, c_0, c_00). Since c_empty is infinity, the minimal is min(c_0, c_00).\n\nSo, the maximum cnt[\"00\"] is min(c_0, c_00). Similarly, for s=\"01\", the path is empty → \"0\" → \"01\", so the maximum cnt[\"01\"] is min(c_0, c_01).\n\nThus, the maximum sum is sum_{s} min(c_0, c_{prefixes of s}).\n\nWait, but that's not the same as the sum of c[s], because for s=\"00\", it's min(c_0, c_00), which could be less than c_00.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is not simply the sum of c[s] for all s, but the sum of the minimal c along each path.\n\nThus, the problem requires us to find the number of c assignments where the sum of the minimal c along each path is exactly f.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nHmm. Let's think of each binary string s as a node in a trie, rooted at the empty string. Each node has a path from the root to itself, which is unique. For each node s, the maximum possible cnt[s] is the minimal c along this path.\n\nSo, the sum we're trying to compute is the sum over all s of the minimal c along the path from root to s.\n\nWe need to find the number of c assignments (c[s] for all s in the set of binary strings of length 1..n) such that this sum is exactly f.\n\nConstraints on c[s]: each c[s] can be between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\nAdditionally, the sum must be exactly f.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c[s] for each s, such that the sum of the minimal c along each path is exactly f.\n\nNow, the key is to model this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of nodes (binary strings of length up to 15) is 2^15 -1 = 32767, which is manageable for some kind of dynamic programming.\n\nBut with c[s] up to 2e5, the state space for DP would be too large.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the sum is additive, perhaps we can model the problem using generating functions, considering each node's contribution to the sum.\n\nEach node s contributes x^{m}, where m is the minimal c along its path. But since m can be up to k, and there are 3e4 nodes, this approach might be feasible.\n\nBut how to model the dependencies between the nodes?\n\nWait, each node's minimal c is determined by the minimal c along its path. So, for a node s, its contribution to the sum is the minimal c along the path from the root to s.\n\nBut the path is a chain: root → ... → s.\n\nSo, the minimal c along this chain is the minimal c of all the nodes along the path.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum of the minimal c for each node's path.\n\nBut the minimal c for each node's path is determined by the minimal c among the c's of the nodes in that path.\n\nSo, for each node s, let m_s = min{c[ancestor(s)] for all ancestors of s, including s itself}.\n\nThen, the sum we want is sum_{s} m_s.\n\nOur goal is to count the number of c assignments where sum_{s} m_s = f.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the number of ways to assign c[s] for all s, such that for each s, m_s is the minimal c along its path, and the sum of all m_s is f.\n\nSo, the problem can be transformed into finding for each node s, the value of m_s, which is the minimal c along its path. The sum of all m_s must be f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for each node s, the minimal c along its path is m_s, which is the minimal c among all nodes on the path. So, for each node s, we can represent its contribution as m_s, which is a variable that must be <= c[s], and must be <= all c[ancestors of s].\n\nBut again, the dependencies make this difficult.\n\nAnother idea: for each node s, the minimal c along its path is the minimal c in the set consisting of all c's along the path from the root to s.\n\nSo, the minimal c for s's path is the same as the minimal c for any of the prefixes of s.\n\nThus, the minimal c for s's path is equal to the minimal c among all the prefixes of s.\n\nBut that's not necessarily true. For example, if the path is root → a → b → s, then the minimal c along the path is the minimal c among root, a, b, s. But the root's c is not a variable, so the minimal is the minimal among a, b, s.\n\nWait, no, the root's c is not a variable. So, the minimal c along the path is min(a, b, s). So, for s, m_s = min(a, b, s).\n\nThus, the sum is sum_{s} min(a, b, s), where a, b, s are the nodes along the path.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can represent the problem as a tree where each node's m_s is the minimal c along its path, and we need to sum all m_s to f.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of c assignments such that sum_{s} m_s = f, where m_s is the minimal c along the path to s.\n\nBut how can we model this in a way that allows for efficient computation?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a product of possibilities for each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to choose integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset is defined as one where for every binary string \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by considering each binary string as a node in a trie, where each node represents a unique path from the root (empty string) to that node. The key insight is that the maximum count of each string \\( s \\) in the multiset is determined by the minimum value of \\( c \\) along the path from the root to \\( s \\).\n\nTo efficiently solve this, we use dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) values.

But m_s must be <= c_s and also <= all c's of its ancestors.\n\n    # So, for each string, m_s is the minimal c along its path, which can be considered as a variable that is <= all c's on its path.\n\n    # Thus, the sum of m_s is f.\n\n    # We can model this as a problem where for each string, we choose m_s (from 0 to k), subject to the constraints that m_s <= c_s, and for each ancestor t of s, m_t >= m_s.\n\n    # This seems like a problem that can be modeled with inclusion-exclusion or Möbius inversion.\n\n    # But it's tricky.\n\n    # Another idea: The sum of m_s is equal to the sum over all strings s of the minimal c along their paths.\n\n    # The minimal c for s is the minimal c among all its ancestors (including itself). So, for each string, m_s = min(c[t] for t in path(s)).\n\n    # So, the sum is sum_{s} min(c[t] for t in path(s)).\n\n    # We need to find the number of assignments where this sum is exactly f.\n\n    # To compute this, perhaps we can use a generating function approach, where each string contributes a term based on its possible minimal c.\n\n    # For each string s, let’s consider all possible values of m (the minimal c along its path). For each possible m, we can count how many ways to assign c's such that m is the minimal for s.\n\n    # Then, the total number is the convolution of these individual contributions.\n\n    # But how?\n\n    # Let’s think recursively. For each string s, the minimal c along its path is the minimal of c[s] and the minimal c along the path of its parent.\n\n    # So, for each s, the minimal c for s is min(c_parent, c[s]).\n\n    # Thus, for the entire tree, the minimal c for each node can be determined by the minimal c along the path.\n\n    # Therefore, the problem reduces to assigning c values to each node such that for each node, c is at least as large as its minimal c.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because m_s is the minimal c along the path, so for each node s, m_s <= c[s], and for each ancestor t of s, m_t >= m_s.\n\n    # So, the constraints are:\n\n    # 1. For each node s, m_s <= c[s].\n\n    # 2. For each node s, m_s <= m_t for all t that are proper ancestors of s.\n\n    # So, the variables are the m_s's, and the constraints are that for each node s, m_s <= m_t for all t in its path.\n\n    # Additionally, each m_s can be between 0 and k.\n\n    # The goal is to count the number of assignments of m_s's such that the sum of m_s's is f, and the constraints are satisfied.\n\n    # So, the problem can be rephrased as counting the number of tuples (m_s) where each m_s is between 0 and k, m_s <= m_t for all t in the path of s, and the sum is f.\n\n    # This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming.\n\n    # Given the constraints, we can model this using a DP approach where we process each node in a certain order, ensuring that the constraints are respected.\n\n    # Since the nodes form a trie, we can process them in reverse order, starting from the leaves and moving towards the root.\n\n    # Each node's m_s can be at most the minimum of its own c and the m of its parent.\n\n    # So, the approach is to represent the problem as a product of possibilities for each node, considering the constraints from its parent.\n\n    # However, since the sum needs to be exactly f, we can use dynamic programming where the state is the current sum and the node being processed.\n\n    # But with n up to 15, the number of nodes is manageable, and the sum can be up to f, which is up to 2e5.\n\n    # So, the plan is:\n\n    # 1. For each node s, determine its parent in the trie.\n\n    # 2. Process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root).\n\n    # 3. For each node s, determine the possible values of m_s, which can be from 0 to min(k, m_parent).\n\n    # 4. Use dynamic programming to accumulate the number of ways to reach each possible sum.\n\n    # 5. Finally, check if the sum equals f and return the count modulo 998244353.\n\n    # Now, to implement this, we can represent the DP state as the current sum and the node being processed.\n\n    # The initial state is sum=0 when processing the root (though the root is not part of the nodes in our problem).\n\n    # For each node s, we iterate through possible m_s values and update the DP accordingly.\n\n    # But wait, the root is not part of the nodes, so the first node to process is the leaves (length n), then their parents (length n-1), and so on until the root (which is empty, not part of our nodes).\n\n    # So, the processing order is from the deepest nodes (length n) upwards.\n\n    # Now, let's structure the DP:\n\n    # - We'll create a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a sum of `i` using the nodes processed so far.\n\n    # - We initialize `dp[0] = 1` before processing any nodes.\n\n    # - For each node s (processed in reverse order of their depth), we determine the maximum possible m_s (which is min(k, m_parent)), and for each possible m_s value, we update the dp array.\n\n    # - For each possible m_s, we add the current dp values multiplied by the number of ways to choose m_s for this node.\n\n    # - After processing all nodes, the value `dp[f]` will give us the required count.\n\n    # However, since the nodes form a trie, each node's m_s depends on its parent's m value. So, we need to process the nodes in reverse order of their depth to ensure that when processing a node, its parent has already been processed.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # First, generate all binary strings of length 1 to n, map each to an index, and precompute their parents.\n\n    # Then, sort the nodes in reverse order of their length (so that longer strings are processed first).\n\n    # For each node, compute the maximum possible m_s, which is min(k, m_parent). If it's the root (no parent), m_s can be up to k.\n\n    # Then, for each node, for each possible m_s, update the DP.\n\n    # But since the root is not part of our nodes, we start processing from the leaves.\n\n    # Now, implement this step-by-step.\n\n    # Step 1: Generate all binary strings of length 1 to n, assign indexes.\n\n    # Step 2: Precompute the parent for each string.\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the strings in reverse order of their length (so that longer strings are processed first).\n\n    # Step 4: For each string in this order, compute the maximum possible m_s (min(k, m_parent)).\n\n    # Step 5: Use dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to achieve the sum f.\n\n    # Now, implementing this.\n\n    # Let's represent the nodes in a list, sorted by decreasing length.\n\n    # For each node, we'll store its index, parent index, and the list of its ancestors.\n\n    # But for the purposes of the DP, we only need to know the parent's m value, which is the minimal c along its path.\n\n    # So, during processing, for each node, we can look up the parent's m value and compute the current node's possible m values.\n\n    # However, in practice, since we're processing in reverse order, when we process a node, its parent has already been processed, so we can access the parent's m value.\n\n    # Now, let's proceed to code.\n\n    # Initialize the DP array.\n\n    max_f = f\n    dp = [0] * (max_f + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n\n    # Process each node in reverse order of their depth.\n\n    # Generate the list of nodes, sorted by decreasing length.\n\n    nodes = sorted(strings, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))\n    node_info = []\n    for s in nodes:\n        if s == '':\n            continue\n        if len(s) < n:\n            continue  # Only process nodes of lengths 1..n\n        parent = parent.get(s, '')\n        if parent == '':\n            parent_m = k + 1  # Treat root's c as infinity\n        else:\n            parent_m = dp_parent[parent]\n        max_m = min(k, parent_m)\n        node_info.append((s, max_m))\n\n    # Now, process each node in the sorted order.\n\n    for s, max_m in node_info:\n        current_max = min(k, max_m)\n        new_dp = [0] * (max_f + 1)\n        for m in range(current_max + 1):\n            for sum_val in range(max_f + 1):\n                if sum_val > max_f:\n                    continue\n                new_dp[sum_val] = (new_dp[sum_val] + dp[sum_val]) % MOD\n                if sum_val + m > max_f:\n                    continue\n                new_dp[sum_val + m] = (new_dp[sum_val + m] + dp[sum_val]) % MOD\n        dp = new_dp\n\n    # After processing all nodes, the answer is dp[f] if f is reachable.\n\n    print(dp[f] % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
