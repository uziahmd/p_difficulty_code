The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be in ai by the time she completes all tasks before i. Wait, no—the description says she needs to be in ai for the i-th task and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Wait, the way the problem is phrased: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh wait, maybe that means that for each task i, she must have already completed all j < i tasks. So the i-th task must be done after all the previous ones. \n\nSo the tasks are processed in order 1 to m. Each task i requires her to be at ai at some point. But the exact timing depends on when she arrives there, considering she has to do all earlier tasks first.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal total time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm, okay, so the approach is to model her path through the tasks, making sure that for each i, she's at ai at the right time.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. \n\nEach task i requires her to reach ai, and she must arrive at ai no later than the time she finishes all prior tasks. But she can't start task i until she's arrived at ai. Wait, no—she must have arrived at ai at some point before or during the processing of the task. Because each task is sequential, meaning she can't do task 2 until she's done task 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows: She starts at house 1 at time 0. Then, for each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She must be at ai at some time before or equal to the current time plus the time taken to get there.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the movement is continuous—she can't just teleport. So the movement between houses takes time, and the tasks have to be done in order.\n\nSo, let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, she is at house 1 at time 0.\n\nFor each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She must be at ai by the time she starts processing this task.\n\nWait, no. Because she can't start processing task i until she arrives at ai. So the order is: she moves around, then reaches ai, and then does task i. But after that, she can proceed to the next task.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she needs to be in ai to do the i-th task, and all tasks with j < i must be done before. So the i-th task is the latest one she needs to do. So the earliest possible time she can start doing the i-th task is when she arrives at ai.\n\nBut what about the other tasks? For example, if she's at ai for task i, she can do task j where j < i while she's there. Or perhaps the tasks are done in order, and each task i requires her to be present at ai, regardless of when others are done.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that for each task i, she must be at ai at some point in time. So she can do multiple tasks in the same house, but she must have been at the required house for each task by the time she starts doing it.\n\nSo the main idea is that for each task i, she must have arrived at ai before or at the moment she starts processing it. Because processing a task takes zero time, I think. So she can be in ai at any time, but after all previous tasks.\n\nSo the strategy is to determine the order in which she visits the required houses, ensuring that each required ai is visited in the correct order, considering the positions and the minimal steps.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by keeping track of the current position and the current time. For each task i, we need to ensure that she arrives at ai by the time she starts processing it. Processing time is zero, so the arrival time is when she starts processing.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nInitialize current_time = 0, current_house = 1.\n\nFor each i from 1 to m:\n\n   target_house = a[i]\n\n   Determine the earliest time she can arrive at target_house.\n\n   The time taken to go from current_house to target_house is the number of steps between them. Since it's a ring, the distance is min( (target_house - current_house) % n, (current_house - target_house) % n ). Wait, no. Because the ring is circular, moving clockwise. So the distance from current to target is (target - current) mod n if target > current. Otherwise, it's (n - (current - target)).\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is (target_house - current_house) if target >= current else (n + target_house - current_house). Because moving clockwise.\n\nWait, for example, if current is 4 and target is 1 in a ring of 4 houses: moving clockwise, you go 4->1, which is 1 step. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nWait, 4 to 1 is just 1 step, but 1 to 4 would be 3 steps via the ring.\n\nSo yes, the minimal steps is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target + n - current).\n\nSo for each i, compute the time needed to go from current_house to target_house, add that to current_time, then set current_house to target_house. Then, after that, current_time is updated.\n\nWait, but wait: the order of processing the tasks is important. Because for each i, she must be at ai by the time she processes it. So perhaps the order in which we process the tasks matters.\n\nWait, but the problem says the second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am. So the tasks are given in order, and for each task i, she must be at ai before starting to do it.\n\nTherefore, the processing order is fixed as per the input: she must process task 1 first, then task 2, and so on.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at house 1 at time 0.\n\n- For each task i from 1 to m:\n\n   Compute the minimal steps from current_house to a_i.\n\n   Add this to current_time.\n\n   Update current_house to a_i.\n\n- The total time is the sum of all these steps.\n\nBut wait, that can't be the case because sometimes you can optimize the path by combining movements. Like, if a_i is ahead of a_j for j>i, you might pass through a_j on the way to a_i.\n\nBut in our initial approach, each step is considered separately. However, that might not capture the possibility of overlapping movements.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that she can do multiple tasks along the way.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the tasks are processed in order. So she cannot skip any task. So she must process each task in sequence, and each task requires her to be present at a certain house at a certain time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the earliest time she can be at each a_i, considering that she can't leave until she's done the previous tasks.\n\nLet me think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nSo the tasks are [3,2,3]. So she starts at 1.\n\nProcessing task 1: she must be at 3.\n\nCurrent time is 0.\n\nTime to go from 1 to 3: 3-1=2 steps. So arrives at time 2. So current_time becomes 2.\n\nProcessing task 2: must be at 2. Current time is 2. How long to get to 2?\n\nFrom 3 to 2: since it's a ring, 3→4 is 1 step, then 4→2 is another 2 steps. So total 3 steps. So current_time becomes 2+3=5.\n\nProcessing task 3: must be at 3. From 2, 2→3 is 1 step. So current_time is 6.\n\nSo total time is 6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n2 3 3\n\nSo tasks are [2,3,3].\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask 1: go to 2. Steps: 1. Time is 1.\n\nTask 2: go to 3. Steps: 1. Time is 2.\n\nTask 3: already at 3, so no steps. Total time is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nBut what about cases where the tasks are not in order around the ring?\n\nWait, let's think of another test case.\n\nSuppose n=5, m=2. Tasks are [5,1].\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst task: go to 5.\n\nSteps from 1 to 5: 5-1=4 steps. Time becomes 4.\n\nSecond task: go to 1.\n\nFrom 5 to 1: it's 1 step. Time becomes 4+1=5.\n\nTotal time is 5.\n\nBut could she have optimized this by going a different route?\n\nNo, because the order of tasks is fixed. She has to do task 1 first, then task 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3. Tasks are [3,5,4].\n\nProcessing steps:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask 1: go to 3. Steps: 2. Time is 2.\n\nTask 2: go to 5. From 3 to 5: 2 steps. Time is 4.\n\nTask 3: go to 4. From 5 to 4: 1 step. Time is 5.\n\nSo total time is 5.\n\nAlternative approach: could she have gone from 3 directly to 4, but that's not allowed because task 2 is 5. She can't skip tasks.\n\nSo the initial approach of processing each task in order and adding the steps works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the tasks in the order they appear in the input.\n\n- For each task i, compute the minimal steps from the current house to a_i.\n\n- Sum all these steps.\n\nWait, but what if a_i is the same as the current house for multiple consecutive tasks? For example, m=3, a = [3,3,3]. So she starts at 1, then goes to 3 (2 steps), then stays, then stays again. So total time is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are as follows:\n\nInitialize current_time = 0, current_house = 1.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   compute the minimal steps from current_house to a_i.\n\n   add to current_time.\n\n   current_house = a_i.\n\nSum all steps and output current_time.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. But according to the sample, it works.\n\nWait, let's see the second sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_time =0, current_house=1.\n\na_1=2: steps from 1 to 2: 1. current_time=1.\n\na_2=3: steps from 2 to 3: 1. current_time=2.\n\na_3=3: no steps. So total time is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. As discussed, the steps are 4+1=5.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nSort the list? No, because the order is fixed as per the input.\n\nWait, no. Because the list is given in order of the tasks. So the order is fixed; she must process the first task before the second, etc.\n\nSo the code will process the list in the given order.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_house = 1\n\ncurrent_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    # calculate steps from current_house to num\n\n    # compute the minimal steps\n\n    if num >= current_house:\n\n        steps = num - current_house\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = (num + n - current_house)\n\n    current_time += steps\n\n    current_house = num\n\nprint(current_time)\n\nWait, but wait: what if the same house appears multiple times in the list? For example, a = [3,3,2]. Then, the second 3 is processed, but current_house is already 3, so steps are zero.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the a list is [3,2,3], which after processing, the third 3 adds 1 step. Because after processing the second task, current_house is 2, and the third task is 3: steps is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is 4 3, 3 2 3.\n\nCode steps:\n\ncurrent_house =1, current_time=0.\n\nProcess 3: steps 2. current_time=2. current_house=3.\n\nProcess 2: steps from 3 to 2: n=4, 2 is less than 3. steps = 2 +4 -3= 3. current_time=5. current_house=2.\n\nProcess 3: steps from 2 to 3: 1. current_time=6.\n\nOutput 6.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n4 3, 2 3 3.\n\ncurrent_house=1, time=0.\n\nProcess 2: steps 1. time=1. current_house=2.\n\nProcess3: steps 1. time=2. current_house=3.\n\nProcess3: steps 0. time remains 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. Code computes 4+1=5.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[3,5,4].\n\nProcessing:\n\n1→3: 2 steps. time=2.\n\n3→5: 2 steps. time=4.\n\n5→4: 1 step. time=5.\n\nOutput is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a case where the target is behind in the ring, but the minimal steps wrap around.\n\nLike, n=5, current_house=4, target is 2.\n\nsteps: 2 is behind 4? No, 2 is less than 4.\n\nSo steps = 2 +5 -4=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think this approach is correct. So the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house at a certain point in time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must move clockwise around a ring of `n` houses. She has `m` tasks, each requiring her to be at a specific house. The tasks are given in a fixed order, meaning she must complete each task one after another.\n2. **Movement Calculation**: Moving from one house to the next takes 1 unit of time. The minimal steps between two houses `i` and `j` can be calculated as `(j - i) % n` if moving clockwise.\n3. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the minimal steps required to move from her current house to the target house. Update her current position and the total time taken after each task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_house = 1\ncurrent_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num >= current_house:\n        steps = num - current_house\n    else:\n        steps = (num + n - current_house)\n    current_time += steps\n    current_house = num\n\nprint(current_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `current_time` set to 0.\n- **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the minimal steps from the current house to the target house using the formula for clockwise movement.\n- **Update Time and Position**: Add the computed steps to `current_time` and update `current_house` to the target house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes all tasks in the minimum possible time by efficiently calculating the shortest path for each movement required by the tasks.",
