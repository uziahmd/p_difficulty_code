Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, and z. The problem statement says that A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality: x + y > z.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. So, for each possible x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and z in [C, D], we need to check if x + y > z. But directly iterating through all possible triplets is impossible because the ranges can be up to 5e5, which would make the computation way too slow—O(N^3) is definitely not feasible.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, since x is between A and B, and y is between B and C, and z is between C and D, perhaps I can fix y and then find the valid x and z that satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, but even that might not be efficient enough. Let me think differently. Maybe I can express the problem in terms of variables that are easier to handle.\n\nThe triangle inequality is x + y > z. Since z has to be at least C, for a fixed y, what is the minimum z that satisfies this? Or for a fixed z, what x and y are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can precompute for each possible y, the range of x and z that are allowed.\n\nBut perhaps another angle: since x ≤ y (because x is up to B and y starts from B), and y ≤ z (since y is up to C and z starts from C), the condition x + y > z becomes important. Because z can vary up to D, which may be larger than x + y.\n\nWait, but for a given x and y, the maximum z that satisfies x + y > z is z < x + y. So for a given x and y, the number of z's is the number of integers from C to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nSo for each (x, y), the count is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1). Because z must be ≥ C and ≤ D and also < x + y.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [y_min, y_max], of the number of z's that satisfy these conditions.\n\nBut again, doing this naively would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the variables. For each x in [A, B], and y in [y_start, y_end], where y_start is the maximum between B and the lower bound for y based on x. Wait, no. Wait, y starts at B, right? Because y must be ≥ B.\n\nWait, no, according to the problem statement: A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So y ranges from B to C. So for each x in [A, B], y ranges from B to C.\n\nSo for each x, the y can vary from B to C. And for each such (x, y), the number of z is the count of integers in [C, D] that are less than x + y.\n\nSo the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x + y > C. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo, for each x and y, we calculate this value and add it to the total.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nWe can represent the sum as:\n\nsum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nBut again, computing this directly is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which is too slow.\n\nWe need to find a way to compute this sum by grouping terms or finding mathematical expressions that allow us to compute it in O(1) or O(N) time.\n\nLet me consider that for each x, the sum over y can be broken into two parts: one where y is small enough that x + y <= C, contributing nothing, and the other where y is large enough that x + y > C.\n\nSo for a fixed x, let's find the minimal y where x + y > C. That would be y > C - x. But since y starts at B, if B > C - x, then all y in [B, C] contribute",
