For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, for each binary string s of length 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find all possible assignments of c_s such that when you compute the maximum possible size of such a multiset, it equals f.\n\nHmm. The goal is to count the number of c assignments that result in the maximum beautiful multiset size being exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, note that each binary string s can be considered as a node in a trie-like structure. Each node represents a certain prefix, and its children are the next bits. For example, \"0\", \"00\", \"01\", etc., form a tree.\n\nIn the context of the problem, for each node s (each binary string), the c_s is the maximum allowed number of times s appears in the multiset as a prefix. Wait, no. Because each occurrence of a longer string that starts with s will contribute to s's count. For example, if '00' is in the multiset, then '0' will have its count increased by one.\n\nSo, for the multiset to be beautiful, for each string s, the number of its occurrences (plus all longer strings that start with it) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that for every binary string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. So for s itself, any string in the multiset that starts with s (including s) contributes to the count for s.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the multiset contains '00', '000', then both contribute to the count for '0' and '00'.\n\nSo the total count for '0' is the sum of the counts for all its suffixes in the multiset. Or perhaps more accurately, for each string t in the multiset, all prefixes s of t (including t) contribute +1 to c_s.\n\nWait, no: For each t in the multiset, for every s that is a prefix of t, the count for s increases by 1. So for each t, the number of s that are prefixes of t is equal to the length of t. So each t contributes 1 to all c_s where s is a prefix of t.\n\nTherefore, for each string s, the total count is the number of t's in the multiset such that s is a prefix of t. This includes s itself.\n\nSo, the condition for the multiset to be beautiful is that for every s, the number of t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t must be <= c_s.\n\nWe want to find the number of c assignments where the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the process is: for a given set of c_s, the maximum size is determined by the constraints. We need to count how many c assignments lead to the maximum being exactly f.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached using dynamic programming, considering the structure of the binary trie.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 15, which suggests that the number of nodes in the trie is manageable, since it's O(2^15) = 32768, which is acceptable.\n\nEach node s corresponds to a binary string, and for each such node, we have a c_s. The maximum possible size of the multiset depends on these c_s's.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a DP over the trie nodes, keeping track of the maximum possible size for the current state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of inclusion-exclusion or combinatorics, considering the dependencies between the c_s's.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that the maximum size is determined by the minimal constraints. For each node s, the maximum possible number of strings that can be added to the multiset that have s as a prefix is c_s, but also, for all descendants of s (strings that start with s), their c_t must be >= the count they contribute.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum over all s of min(c_s, the number of t's that are in the subtree rooted at s). But that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each string t contributes to all its prefixes s. So the maximum number of t's that can be included is constrained by the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t.\n\nWait, yes! That's a key insight. For a string t, the number of times it can appear in the multiset is limited by the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t. Because for each s that is a prefix of t, t's inclusion would require that c_s >= the number of times s is used as a prefix. But for t itself, it's part of the count of s = t.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let's think again: For a string t, each time it is added, it contributes 1 to all its prefixes s. So the maximum number of t's that can be added is the minimum of c_s across all s in the path from the root to t. Because for each s in that path, adding t once increases their count by 1, so the maximum number of t's is the smallest c_s among all s's on that path.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each node s, the maximum number of times any string t in the subtree of s can be added is c_s. So the overall maximum size of the multiset is the sum over all s of min(c_s, the number of possible t's in the subtree of s).\n\nWait, no. Because for each t, the number of times it can be added is the minimum c_s along its path. So the maximum possible number of t's is the minimum of c_s for all prefixes s of t.\n\nWait, no. Because adding a t affects all its prefixes. So, for example, if t is '001', then adding it once adds 1 to '0', 1 to '00', and 1 to '001'. So the maximum number of times t can be added is limited by the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t. So if any c_s is zero, you can't add any t under that s.\n\nSo the maximum size is the sum for each t of the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t, but considering that each t can only be added a certain number of times. But wait, no. Because each t can be added multiple times, but each addition contributes to all its prefixes. So the maximum number of t's is limited by the minimum c_s along the path.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach string t can be added any number of times (possibly zero) up to a certain maximum. The maximum number of times t can be added is the minimum of c_s for all s that are prefixes of t (including t itself). Because for each addition, all the prefixes s along t's path get +1, so the maximum number of times t can be added is the minimum c_s along that path.\n\nSo the total maximum size is the sum for each t of the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum would be the same as the sum of min(c_s) for each t, but each t is a string of length m, and each of its extensions is a longer string. So perhaps the total is not just the sum of all t's min(c_s), but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum for each node s of the number of strings in the subtree of s that can be added, which is the minimum c_s. So for each node s, the maximum number of times any string in its subtree can be added is c_s. So the total maximum size is the sum of c_s for all s, but with the constraint that for any s, the sum of the number of strings in the subtree of s that are chosen must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, but this is not additive because longer strings are part of multiple subtrees. So the sum isn't straightforward.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently.\n\nThe maximum size is determined by the constraints on the c_s's. Each c_s is a limit on the number of times any string in the subtree of s can be added.\n\nSo the maximum size is the sum for each node s of the number of strings in the subtree of s that are added, but each string is counted in all its ancestor nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of all c_s, but each string is counted in multiple c_s's. So the maximum size could be larger than the sum of c_s's.\n\nWait, no. Because for each string t, it contributes to all its prefixes. So for each t, the number of times it can be added is the minimum c_s along its path. Therefore, the maximum number of times t can be added is m = min_{s | s is a prefix of t} c_s.\n\nBut the total number of strings added is the sum over all t of m, which is the sum of min_{s | s is a prefix of t} c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because if t is '001', then adding it once contributes 1 to '0', '00', and '001'. So the sum of min c_s along the path is the maximum number of times t can be added.\n\nBut the total size is the sum of all the m's for each t. So the maximum size is the sum for each t of m.\n\nBut this seems complex because the same c_s is used for multiple t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum over all nodes s of c_s multiplied by the number of strings in the subtree of s, but I don't think that's right.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Each node s contributes to the maximum size by c_s, but the c_s must be at least as large as the sum of the c's of all its children. Because if a child t has c_t, then adding c_t for t would imply that s's c_s must be at least c_t, otherwise adding t's would cause s's count to exceed c_s.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. Because for node s, the sum of the c_t for all children t of s cannot exceed c_s. Because each t is a string that contributes to s's count. So the maximum number of t's that can be added is min(c_s, ...), but for the children, their own c's may impose further constraints.\n\nWait, maybe the c_s must satisfy that for every child t of s, c_t <= c_s. Because if you have a string t that is a child of s, then adding any number of t's contributes to s's count. So the maximum number of t's you can add is c_t, but this must be <= c_s, otherwise adding those t's would cause s's count to exceed c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because c_s is the maximum allowed for s, and c_t is the maximum allowed for t. Since t is a prefix of s, the count for s includes all the t's added. So if c_t is 5 and c_s is 3, then even though t's c_t allows 5, s can only have 3, meaning that t can be added up to 3 times. So c_t must be <= c_s.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So for the hierarchy of the trie, each node s must have c_s >= c_t for all its children t. Because otherwise, the constraints on t would cause s's count to exceed c_s.\n\nSo, the c_s's must form a non-increasing function along the path from the root to any node. Because for any parent s and child t, c_s >= c_t.\n\nIf this is the case, then the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each node such that:\n\n- For each node s, c_s >= c_t for all its children t.\n- Additionally, for each node s, c_s can be at most k, since each c_s is between 0 and k.\n- Also, the sum of (c_s - c_{parent(s)}) for all nodes s (excluding the root) must equal f.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum size is the sum of c_s for all nodes s.\n\nWait, earlier reasoning: the maximum size is the sum over all t of m, where m is the minimum c_s along the path from root to t. But since the hierarchy requires c_s >= c_t for each child, the minimum c_s along the path is c_t for the leaves. Wait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of c_s for all s.\n\nBecause each c_s is the maximum number of times any string in the subtree of s can be added. So for each s, the number of times s can be added is c_s, and each of its children can be added up to c_t times, but c_t <= c_s. So the sum of c_s for all s is the total maximum size.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each s, the number of times any string in the subtree of s is added cannot exceed c_s. And since each string t is in the subtree of all its ancestors, the sum of c_s for all s is an upper bound on the total number of strings in the multiset.\n\nBut wait, for example, if s is a parent of t, then s's count includes t's count plus any other strings in s's subtree. So perhaps the sum is not directly the maximum size.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine this. Let's take a small example.\n\nSuppose we have the root s0, with two children s1 and s2. Let's say s0 has c0 = 3, s1 has c1=2, s2 has c2=1.\n\nThen, the maximum size is the number of strings that can be added without violating any c_s. So the strings are s0, s1, s2, s10, s11, s20, etc. But for each string t, the number of times it can be added is min(c_s along the path).\n\nWait, for s0, the maximum number of times s0 can be added is 3. But s0 is a string of length 1. So adding s0 three times would contribute 3 to the count for s0, but also to the count for any longer strings that start with s0.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: think of the c_s's as forming a tree where each parent has a higher or equal c value than its children.\n\nIn this scenario, the maximum possible size is the sum of c_s for all s, because each s can contribute exactly c_s strings to the multiset. But wait, no, because s is a single string. Wait, no—each string can be added multiple times, but each addition contributes to all its prefixes.\n\nWait, no. Each string t can be added multiple times, but each addition contributes +1 to all of its prefixes. So the number of times t can be added is limited by the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t.\n\nWait, no, because the c_s's are per-node, not per-string. So for each t, the number of times it can be added is the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t. Because each addition increases all the c_s's along that path.\n\nSo for each t, the maximum number of times it can be added is m = min{c_s : s is a prefix of t}.\n\nThus, the total maximum size is the sum over all t of m.\n\nBut the problem is that t can vary in length from 1 to n, and the c_s's are assigned per node.\n\nSo the total maximum size is the sum over all t of the min c_s along the path from the root to t.\n\nHmm, but how does this relate to the c_s's?\n\nWait, suppose we have a node s, and its children t1, t2, etc. Then for each ti, the min c_s along their paths is the minimum of c_s and c_t_i. Since c_t_i <= c_s (due to the earlier condition that c_s >= c_t for children), the min for ti is c_t_i. So the sum for ti is c_t_i.\n\nFor s itself, the min c_s along its path is c_s, so it contributes c_s to the sum.\n\nSo the total sum is the sum of all c_s for all nodes s.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each node s, the number of times s can be added is c_s, and for each of its children ti, their contribution is c_ti, which is <= c_s.\n\nSo the total maximum size is the sum of c_s for all nodes s.\n\nSo our goal is to assign c_s for each node s in such a way that:\n\n1. For each node s, c_s >= c_t for all children t of s.\n2. For each node s, 0 <= c_s <= k.\n3. The sum of all c_s is exactly f.\n4. We need to count the number of such assignments.\n\nAdditionally, the assignment must satisfy that the sum is exactly f, and that the sum is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but the sum is the maximum possible because each c_s is as large as possible given the constraints.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s for each node s such that:\n\n- c_s >= c_t for all children t of s.\n- 0 <= c_s <= k.\n- The sum of c_s is exactly f.\n- The sum is as large as possible, i.e., no c_s can be increased further without violating the constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is exactly f, and the assignment must be such that the sum is the maximum possible. So the sum is f, and it's the maximum possible, which implies that there are no assignments that can have a sum larger than f while satisfying the constraints.\n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is that the sum of c_s is exactly f, and for each assignment, the sum is the maximum possible given the constraints.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of valid c assignments where the sum is f, and for each s, c_s is >= all its children's c_t, and c_s <=k.\n\nMoreover, since the sum is the maximum possible, the sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, our task is to find the number of such c assignments.\n\nNow, the question is: how to model this as a dynamic programming problem.\n\nIdea:\n\nWe can model this with a DP that keeps track of the current node and the sum accumulated so far. For each node, we can decide the value of c_s, ensuring that it's at least as large as all its children's c_t. Wait, but the children are processed before their parent, so perhaps the order is important.\n\nBut the problem is that the nodes form a trie, and the hierarchy is a DAG, not a tree. So perhaps the processing order must be such that parents are processed before their children. Wait, no. Because the constraints are that c_parent >= c_child, so when assigning c_child, we must know the value of c_parent.\n\nSo perhaps the processing order should be from the root down to the leaves. Or, more accurately, for each node, process it after all its children have been processed.\n\nWait, but the root has no parent. So the root can be processed first.\n\nWait, the root is the top-level node. For each of its children (length 1 strings), their c values must be <= root's c. Then, for each of those children, their children (length 2 strings) must have c <= the child's c, and so on.\n\nSo, the idea is to process the nodes in order of decreasing depth. Because when processing a node, all its children have already been processed.\n\nSo, for each node s, when we assign c_s, we can choose a value between 0 and min(k, c_parent), but wait, no: the c_parent is the parent of s, and c_parent must be >= c_s.\n\nWait, no. The parent of s is s's immediate ancestor in the trie. For example, the root has no parent, the children of the root have their parent as the root, and so on.\n\nSo, for a node s, its parent is the node that is the immediate predecessor in the path from the root to s. So, for each node s, during processing, we have already processed its parent and all its siblings, so we can determine the maximum possible c_s based on its parent's c.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Enumerate all binary strings up to length n, and build a trie where each node represents a binary string.\n\n2. For each node s, list its children t (strings that are longer than s and start with s).\n\n3. Process the nodes in reverse order of their depth (i.e., process the leaves first, then their parents, etc.), so that when processing s, all its children have been processed.\n\n4. For each node s, the maximum possible c_s is the minimum of k and the c_value of its parent, because c_parent >= c_s.\n\nWait, no. The c_parent can be any value >= c_s, but for the purposes of this DP, perhaps we can model the maximum possible c_s based on the parent's c.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the DP as follows:\n\nThe DP state will consist of the current node s and the remaining sum that needs to be achieved. For each node s, we can choose a c_s value between 0 and min(k, c_parent), but wait, no. Because the parent's c is fixed when we process it, so for node s, the maximum c_s can be up to the parent's c_s minus any constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because when processing the parent, the parent's c is chosen, and s's c can be any value up to the parent's c.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state is the node and the current sum, and for each node, we can assign a c_s value between 0 and min(k, c_parent), but that seems incorrect because the parent's c hasn't been determined yet.\n\nWait, perhaps the order is reversed. We process the root first, then its children, and so on.\n\nWait, for the root, it's the top node. It doesn't have a parent. Its c can be any value between 0 and k.\n\nEach child of the root can have a c value up to the root's c value.\n\nEach child's c can be up to the parent's c, and so on.\n\nSo, the processing order is root, then its children, then their children, etc.\n\nSo, for the root, we can choose c_root from 0 to k.\n\nThen, for each child of the root, we can choose c_child from 0 to c_root.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the DP state can be represented as the current node and the current sum of c's chosen so far.\n\nWait, yes. So the DP state is (node, sum_so_far). The transition is, for each possible c_s for the current node, we add c_s to the sum_so_far, provided that c_s is between 0 and the parent's c (if any), and also <= k.\n\nWait, but for the root, there's no parent, so c_root can be between 0 and k.\n\nFor each child of the root, their c can be between 0 and c_root.\n\nSimilarly, for each node s, when processing it, the parent's c has already been determined, so the maximum c_s is min(k, parent_c).\n\nSo, the DP can proceed as follows:\n\n- For each node s, in BFS order starting from the root.\n\n- For each possible c_s value that is allowed (based on the parent's c and k), compute the number of ways to reach the sum_so_far + c_s.\n\nBut wait, the sum_so_far is the sum of all c's chosen so far, including the current node's c.\n\nWe need to accumulate the sum until it reaches exactly f.\n\nBut the problem is that the sum can be up to (sum of all possible c_s's), which can be up to (sum for each node s of k) = (number of nodes)*k. Since n is up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^15 = 32768. So the maximum sum is 32768 * 2e5 = which is about 6e9, which is way too big for a standard DP approach.\n\nBut f can be up to 2e5, so perhaps we can optimize.\n\nWait, but n is up to 15, which means the number of nodes is 2^15=32768, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but the sum_so_far can be up to 32768 * 2e5, which is 6.5e9, which is way too big to handle with a standard DP.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: for each node, the c_s can be anything between 0 and min(k, parent_c), and the sum of all c's must be exactly f.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a product of possibilities for each node, subject to the constraints that c_s >= c_t for all children t.\n\nBut the problem is that the sum must be exactly f, which complicates things.\n\nAnother approach: realize that the c_s's form a monotonic function along the trie. So, for any node s, c_s is >= c_t for all t in the subtree of s.\n\nSo, the problem can be viewed as a tree where each node's c is a variable, and the sum of all variables must be exactly f, with each variable >= 0, <=k, and each variable >= all its descendants.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the concept of multiplicative functions, where each node contributes a certain range of possible values, and the sum is built accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another observation: the sum of c_s's is f, and each c_s can be written as c_s = a_s, where a_s is the amount that s contributes beyond its parent's contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, considering that for each node s, the c_s can be written as c_p + d_s, where p is the parent of s, and d_s >=0. Because c_s >= c_p, since s is a child of p.\n\nWait, no. Because c_p is the parent's c, and c_s can be any value up to min(k, c_p). So c_s can be less than or equal to c_p, but not necessarily equal.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system of variables where each c_s is a non-decreasing function along the path from the root to the leaf. No, wait, it's the opposite: c_s is non-increasing as we go deeper into the trie.\n\nSo, the c's form a non-increasing sequence along each path from the root to a leaf.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a tree where each node's value is the minimum of its parent's value and some other condition.\n\nSo, perhaps for the root, c_root can be any value between 0 and k.\n\nFor each child of the root, c_child can be any value between 0 and c_root.\n\nFor each child of a child, c_grandchild can be any value between 0 and c_child.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible c_s is bounded by the parent's c and k.\n\nSo, the sum of all c_s's is f.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of valid assignments of c_s's that satisfy the above conditions, and the sum is exactly f.\n\nNow, the question is: How can we model this efficiently, given the constraints on n and the sum.\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of nodes is manageable. But the sum can be up to 32768*2e5 = 6.5e9, which is way too big for a standard DP approach.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be up to 32768 * 2e5 = 6.5e9, but f can be up to 2e5. So, for f greater than the maximum possible sum, the answer is zero. Otherwise, perhaps we can model the DP with f as the target.\n\nBut even so, 6.5e9 is way too large.\n\nAlternative idea: Realize that the sum of c_s's is f, and each c_s must be at least the sum of all c's of its descendants.\n\nWait, no. Because each c_s is a separate variable, and the sum is their sum.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a knapsack problem, where each node contributes a certain range of possible values, and the sum must be exactly f.\n\nBut the ranges are dependent on the hierarchy of the trie, making it a bit tricky.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the problem with a recursive function that processes each node and tracks the sum so far.\n\nBut with n=15, the number of nodes is 32768, which is manageable.\n\nBut how do we handle the sum? Because f can be up to 2e5, and the sum can be up to 32768 * 2e5 = 6.5e9, which is way beyond what can be stored in a DP table.\n\nWait, but the sum is up to f, which is 2e5. So perhaps we can model the DP with the sum as the target, and for each node, accumulate the possible contributions.\n\nWait, but the sum is exactly f, so perhaps the DP can be designed to track the sum up to f.\n\nSo, the DP state is (current node, sum_so_far). For each node, we iterate through all possible c_s values, which are between 0 and min(k, parent_c), and for each such c_s, we add c_s to sum_so_far and proceed to the next nodes.\n\nBut the problem is that the sum_so_far can be up to f, which is 2e5, and the number of nodes is 32768, so the total number of states is 32768 * 2e5 = 6.5e9, which is way too big.\n\nThat's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps we can precompute the possible contributions of each node and combine them using generating functions, but considering the dependencies.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother angle: Since the c_s's are non-increasing along each path, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a tree where each node's c_s is determined by the minimum between k and the c of its parent.\n\nWait, but the sum is the sum of all c_s's, which must equal f.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding the number of valid assignments where the sum is f, and each c_s is at most k, and each c_s is at least the c of its children.\n\nWait, but the sum is f, which is manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using memoization, but with optimizations.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the trie and the constraints again.\n\nEach node's c_s is <= the parent's c_s.\n\nEach node's c_s can be any integer between 0 and min(k, parent's c_s).\n\nSo, the sum is the sum of all c_s's, which must be exactly f.\n\nThe problem is to count the number of such assignments.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: For each node s, the maximum possible c_s is min(k, parent_c). So, the c_s can be chosen independently as long as it's within this range.\n\nBut since the sum must be exactly f, perhaps we can model this as a product of the possible choices for each node, given the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be thought of as a tree where each node s has a weight of c_s, and the sum of all weights is f.\n\nEach node's weight is constrained by the weights of its ancestors.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to counting the number of valid weight assignments to the nodes such that the sum is f, and for each node, its weight is <= the parent's weight and <=k.\n\nBut again, the challenge is handling the sum efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach: Since the sum is f, and each c_s can be up to k, perhaps we can model the problem with a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where for each node, we track the possible sums that can be achieved by the subtree rooted at that node.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps for each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s's to its subtree such that the sum is a certain value, considering the constraints from the node's c_s and the c's of its children.\n\nSo, the DP state would be (node, sum), representing the number of ways to assign c_s's to the subtree rooted at node such that the sum of c_s's in the subtree is 'sum'.\n\nBut considering that each node's c_s is constrained by its parent's c, and also by k.\n\nWait, but the parent's c is determined when processing the parent, so for each node, when processing it, its parent's c is known.\n\nHmm, perhaps the DP can be structured as follows:\n\n- Process nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root).\n\n- For each node s, and for each possible sum value up to f, compute the number of ways to assign c_s's to the subtree rooted at s, given that s's c is fixed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\n1. Build the trie structure for all binary strings up to length n.\n\n2. Sort the nodes in reverse order of their depth (process leaves first, then their parents, etc.).\n\n3. For each node s in this order, and for each possible c_s value (0 <= c_s <= min(k, parent_c)), compute the possible sums for the subtree rooted at s.\n\n4. Combine these sums with the sums from the children to compute the sum for the parent.\n\nBut the problem is that each node's c_s contributes to the sum, and the children's c_s's are processed before the parent.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the sum contributed by s's subtree is the sum of c_s plus the sum of the contributions from its children.\n\nBut each child t of s must have c_t <= c_s.\n\nSo, for each node s, when processing it, we can consider all possible c_s values (0 to min(k, parent_c)), and for each c_s, the sum contributed is c_s plus the sum of the contributions from the children, where each child t's contribution is computed based on c_t <= c_s.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the DP as follows.\n\nEach node s has a certain number of ways to choose c_s, given that the sum so far is s_sum, and the c_s must be <= min(k, parent_c).\n\nWait, but the parent's c is processed before the children, so perhaps for each node s, the c_s can be chosen as any value between 0 and min(k, parent_c).\n\nOnce c_s is chosen, the sum increases by c_s, and then for each child t of s, the c_t can be chosen as any value between 0 and min(k, c_s).\n\nSo, the DP can be structured as follows:\n\n- The root is processed first.\n\n- For the root, choose c_root between 0 and k. The sum starts at c_root.\n\n- For each child t of the root, recursively process t, choosing c_t between 0 and c_root. The sum for t is c_t plus the sum of its children.\n\n- Continue this process until all leaves are processed.\n\n- The total sum must be exactly f.\n\nBut with n=15, the number of nodes is 32768, and f=2e5, this approach is not feasible due to the high number of states.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps we can use the fact that the c_s's are non-increasing along each path. So, for each node, the c_s can be considered as a variable that is the minimum of its parent's c and some other constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a tree where each node's c_s is a variable, and the sum of all variables is f. The constraints are that each variable is <= its parent's variable and <=k.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to counting the number of tuples (c_0, c_1, ..., c_m) where m is the number of nodes, each c_i is an integer between 0 and k, c_i <= c_{i-1}, and the sum is f.\n\nWait, but the nodes are arranged in a trie, not a linear chain, so the constraints are that for any two nodes s and t, if s is an ancestor of t, then c_s >= c_t.\n\nBut this is a generalization of the linear case where each node's c is >= its children's c.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of assignments where the sum is f, each c_i <=k, and for each node, c_i >= c_j for all j in the subtree of i.\n\nThis is a challenging problem.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's represent the c_s's as a vector, and model the problem with inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the c_s's form a non-increasing tree, perhaps we can model the problem using a priority queue where each node's c_s is determined by its parent's c.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using the Möbius inversion or generating functions, but I'm not familiar enough with that.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the sum f.\n\nWe need to select c_s for each node s such that:\n\nsum(c_s) = f\n\nc_s <= min(k, c_p) for all children p of s.\n\nc_s >=0.\n\nWe can model this as",
