            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break down the problem. The input gives me two integers a and b on the first line. Then, the next line is a number in base a, which could be up to 103 digits long. My task is to convert this number into base b. But if b is 'R', then I need to represent the number as a Roman numeral instead of a decimal number.\n\nFirst, I'll need functions to handle the conversion between different numeral systems. Let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: a, b, and the number in base a.\n2. Determine whether the output should be in base b or Roman numerals.\n3. Convert the given number from base a to a decimal (integer) value.\n4. If the output is in base b, then convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n5. If the output is Roman numerals, then convert the decimal to Roman using the rules provided.\n\nWait, but wait—when the second part is 'R', what does that mean for b? Oh right, in the input, the second part is either an integer or 'R'. So, when the second part is 'R', the target base is considered to be the Roman numeral system. So, for example, if the input line is '16 R', that means the target base is Roman numerals, not base 16.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is process each line correctly. For each test case, after reading a and b, check if the second part is 'R' or an integer. That will determine whether the output is Roman or base b.\n\nNow, let's think about the conversion functions.\n\nConverting from base a to decimal:\n- Iterate through each digit of the input string.\n- For each character, calculate its value as (digit_value * a^position).\n- Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\nBut wait, the input can be up to 103 digits, which is manageable since Python handles big integers well.\n\nThen, converting from decimal to base b:\n- Divide the number by b repeatedly, collecting remainders.\n- The remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in base b.\n\nBut for the Roman numeral conversion, that's more complex. I need to know how to represent numbers up to 300010 as per the note. Wait, the note says that if using Roman numerals, the number won't exceed 300010. So my function needs to handle up to 3999999? Or wait, the problem statement says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010\". So the maximum number I need to handle for Roman numerals is 300010.\n\nSo, for Roman conversion, I need to generate the correct Roman numeral string for numbers up to 300010.\n\nHow to implement that? I can create a list that maps Roman symbols to their values. The standard Roman numerals go up to M=1000, but in higher bases like 16, the letters A-F are used. Wait, no—the problem states that in bases greater than 10, letters A, B, etc., are used. So the mapping for Roman numerals is as follows:\n\nThe Roman numerals use I, V, X, L, C, D, M, etc. But for this problem, when converting to Roman, the digits are based on these symbols. So for example, 4 is IV, 9 is IX, 40 is XL, etc.\n\nI'll need a helper function that converts a decimal number into a Roman numeral string. Let's outline how that function would work.\n\nThe algorithm for Roman numeral conversion typically involves breaking the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and then mapping each part to the corresponding Roman symbols.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to use a lookup table that contains the values and their corresponding Roman strings, ordered from largest to smallest. Then, for each value, subtract the largest possible value from the number and append the corresponding Roman string.\n\nFor example, the table would include:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThis way, for any number, we can iterate through the values, subtracting the largest possible value each time",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard numeral system or the Roman numeral system.
