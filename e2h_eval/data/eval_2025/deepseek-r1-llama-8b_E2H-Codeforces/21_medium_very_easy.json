The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum will be odd, which satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because adding two odds gives even, adding an even and odd gives odd. So the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd. So, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity.\n\nSo, the idea is to find how many chests can be unlocked by pairing them with keys such that their parities are different.\n\nHmm. So first, I think we need to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys, but perhaps we don't need to do that yet.\n\nWait, because each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened once. So, for each key, it can be used to unlock a chest of the opposite parity, but once used, it can't be reused.\n\nSo, the approach is probably:\n\n- Count the number of even and odd keys.\n- For each type of key (even or odd), determine how many chests of the opposite parity can be unlocked.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Because each key can unlock any chest of the opposite parity, but the number of such chests depends on the counts.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's categorize the chests:\n\n- Let C_even be the number of chests where a_i is even.\n- Let C_odd be the number of chests where a_i is odd.\n\nSimilarly, for the keys:\n\n- Let K_even be the number of keys where b_j is even.\n- Let K_odd be the number of keys where b_j is odd.\n\nNow, to maximize the number of chests opened, we can pair the keys and chests in a way that uses the available keys optimally.\n\nEach key can unlock a chest of opposite parity. So, for example:\n\n- A key that is even can unlock any chest that is odd.\n- An odd key can unlock any even chest.\n\nBut since each key can be used only once, the maximum number of chests we can unlock is determined by how many keys of each parity we have and how they can match with the chests.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nThe total chests we can unlock would be:\n\nThe minimum between the sum of (keys of type X multiplied by chests of type Y) where X and Y are opposite parities.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because each key can be used once, and each chest can be used once. So, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimums of the pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe maximum number of even key usages is min(K_even, C_odd). Because each even key can unlock an odd chest, and there are C_odd such chests. Similarly, the maximum number of odd key usages is min(K_odd, C_even).\n\nWait, no. Wait, each even key can unlock one odd chest, and each odd key can unlock one even chest. But the usage is limited by the number of keys and the number of chests of the required parity.\n\nSo the total is the sum of the min between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the min between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n\nYes! Because even keys can unlock odd chests, and odd keys can unlock even chests. We can take as many as possible of each.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nmax_chests = min(K_even, C_odd) + min(K_odd, C_even)\n\nThat's the maximum possible.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nChests: a_i are [9,14,6,2,11]\n\nSo a_i parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\n\nSo C_odd is 2 (chests 9 and 11), C_even is 3.\n\nKeys: b_j are [8,4,7,20]\n8 even, 4 even,7 odd, 20 even.\n\nSo K_even is 3 (keys 8,4,20), K_odd is 1 (key7).\n\nSo min(3, 2) is 2, min(1,3) is 1. Sum is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\n5 1\n2 4 6 8 10\n5\n\nChests: all even. So C_even=5, C_odd=0.\n\nKeys: 5 is odd. So K_even=0, K_odd=1.\n\nmin(0,0) is 0, min(1,5) is 1. Sum is 1. Which matches.\n\nThird example:\n\n1 4\n10\n20 30 40 50\n\nChests: 10 is even. So C_even=1, C_odd=0.\n\nKeys: all even, so K_even=4, K_odd=0.\n\nmin(4,0)=0, min(0,1)=0. Total 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Compute min(even_keys, odd_chests) + min(odd_keys, even_chests).\n4. That's the answer.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n, m.\n- Read a array, count how many are even (C_even) and odd (C_odd).\n- Read b array, count how many are even (K_even) and odd (K_odd).\n- Compute the sum as described.\n\nSo, the code would be straightforward.\n\nLet me think about handling large numbers. Since n and m can be up to 1e5, the solution needs to be O(n + m), which is acceptable.\n\nIn Python, reading the input is manageable.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead n and m from stdin.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers for a.\n\nCompute C_even and C_odd by checking each element in a.\n\nSame for b, compute K_even and K_odd.\n\nCalculate the sum as min(K_even, C_odd) + min(K_odd, C_even).\n\nPrint that sum.\n\nWait, but what if some of the C_* or K_* are zero? It doesn't matter; the min function handles that.\n\nSo the code is simple.\n\nLet me write a draft.\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nc_even = 0\nc_odd = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        c_even += 1\n    else:\n        c_odd += 1\n\nk_even = 0\nk_odd = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        k_even += 1\n    else:\n        k_odd += 1\n\nres = min(k_even, c_odd) + min(k_odd, c_even)\nprint(res)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → 2 odd, 3 even.\n\nb:8,4,7,20 → 3 even, 1 odd.\n\nmin(3,2)=2, min(1,3)=1 → 3.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na: all even.\n\nb:5 is odd.\n\nmin(0,0) + min(1,5) → 0+1=1.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na:10 is even.\n\nb: all even.\n\nmin(4,0) + min(0,1) →0+0=0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when keys are all even and chests are all odd.\n\nn=3, m=2.\n\na: all odd.\n\nb: all even.\n\nc_even=0, c_odd=3.\n\nk_even=2, k_odd=0.\n\nmin(2,0) =0, min(0,3)=0. So total 0.\n\nWhich makes sense because each even key can unlock an odd chest, but there are more chests than keys, but each key can only unlock one.\n\nSo the maximum is min(2,3) = 2.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right! Because each even key can be used to unlock an odd chest, but you have 2 keys and 3 chests.\n\nSo min(2,3) is 2. So the sum is 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nWait, why? Because the even keys can unlock the 3 odd chests, but each even key can only be used once.\n\nSo for each even key, assign it to a chest.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nAh, so my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, I thought it was min(k_even, c_odd) + min(k_odd, c_even).\n\nBut in this case, k_even is 2, c_odd is 3. So min is 2.\n\nk_odd is 0, so min is 0.\n\nTotal 2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let's see another scenario.\n\nSuppose:\n\nC_even = 5, C_odd = 3.\n\nK_even=4, K_odd=1.\n\nSo, even keys can unlock 3 odd chests, but since K_even=4 >3, we can only use 3 even keys. Wait no: because each key is used once.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach even key can unlock one odd chest. So the maximum number of even keys used is the minimum of K_even and C_odd.\n\nSimilarly, each odd key can unlock one even chest, so the maximum is min(K_odd, C_even).\n\nSo the sum is correct.\n\nWait, in the earlier test case:\n\nC_even=0, C_odd=3.\n\nK_even=2, K_odd=0.\n\nSo the maximum is min(2,3) + min(0,0) = 2.\n\nWhich is correct because 2 even keys can unlock 2 out of 3 odd chests.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nC_even=5, C_odd=5.\n\nK_even=3, K_odd=4.\n\nThen, even keys can unlock 3 of the 5 odd chests.\n\nOdd keys can unlock 4 of the 5 even chests.\n\nTotal 3+4=7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if and only if the sum of their numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys by Parity**: Separate the chests and keys into two categories based on whether their numbers are even or odd.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Chests**: Count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Count Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n4. **Calculate Maximum Openable Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum number of available keys of each parity that can be used to unlock chests of the opposite parity.\n\nThe formula to compute the maximum number of chests that can be opened is:\n- `min(even_keys, odd_chests) + min(odd_keys, even_chests)`\n\nThis formula works because each even key can unlock an odd chest and each odd key can unlock an even chest. The sum of these minimum values gives the total number of chests that can be unlocked.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nc_even = 0\nc_odd = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        c_even += 1\n    else:\n        c_odd += 1\n\nk_even = 0\nk_odd = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        k_even += 1\n    else:\n        k_odd += 1\n\nmax_chests = min(k_even, c_odd) + min(k_odd, c_even)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: Using the counts of even and odd chests and keys, we compute the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering the minimum possible matches between keys and chests of opposite parities.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests Neko can open with the given constraints, handling up to the maximum limits effectively.",
