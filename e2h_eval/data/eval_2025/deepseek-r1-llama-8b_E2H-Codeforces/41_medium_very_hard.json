There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a dynamic programming problem because for each spot, the choice of height depends on the previous choices, especially considering overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, but n and m are up to 50, which isn't too bad. So maybe a DP approach where the state represents the current position and some constraints is feasible.\n\nWhat's the state? Well, for each spot i, I need to track what's the maximum allowed height considering all the restrictions that affect it. Because a spot can be part of multiple restrictions.\n\nBut how do I represent the state? Maybe for each position, I can track the maximum possible height given the constraints from the previous spots. Or perhaps, for each position i, the state is the maximum height allowed at i, considering all applicable restrictions up to i.\n\nWait, no. Because the restrictions can cover ranges, and a particular spot could be part of multiple overlapping restrictions. So each restriction affects a range, and each spot's height must not exceed the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include it.\n\nWait, that's an important point. For each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from the restrictions that include it. Plus, of course, it can't exceed h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the effective maximum height is min(h, min{x_i for all restrictions where l_i ≤ i ≤ r_i}).\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because a spot could be included in multiple restrictions. For example, if one restriction says the max height in 2-3 is 8, and another says in 3-4 is 7, then spot 3's max height is min(8,7) =7. So yes, the maximum allowed for each spot is the minimum of all the x_i's of the restrictions that cover it, or h if that's smaller.\n\nSo, first step: for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include i. If no restrictions cover i, then the maximum is h.\n\nWait, but how do I compute this? For each spot i, collect all the restrictions where l_i <=i <=r_i, then take the min of their x_i, then take the min of that and h.\n\nYes. So, for each i, the initial maximum allowed height is h. Then, for each restriction, if i is in [l_i, r_i], we take the minimum between the current maximum and x_i.\n\nOnce I have the maximum allowed heights for each spot, the problem reduces to choosing for each spot a height between 0 and its maximum allowed, inclusive, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nWait, but no. Because the restrictions are on the maximum in a range, not on individual spots. So even if for a spot i, the maximum allowed is 5, but in a certain range including i, the maximum could be constrained by other spots in that range.\n\nOh right! That's the catch. Because a restriction is on a range, the maximum height in that range is the maximum of all the spots' heights in that range. So the initial approach I had is incorrect because it only considers per-spot constraints based on the overlapping restrictions, but doesn't account for the fact that the maximum in a range could be limited by any of the spots in it.\n\nSo for example, if I have a restriction that says spots 2-3 must have a maximum of 8. Even if spot 2's maximum allowed is 10, if spot 3's maximum is 8, then the overall maximum in that range is 8, which satisfies the restriction. But if spot 3 is set to 9, then the maximum would be 9, violating the restriction.\n\nSo the initial approach of determining per spot the maximum allowed based on the restrictions is insufficient. Because the restrictions impose a global constraint on the maximum in the range, which could be higher than the per spot maximums.\n\nThis complicates things. So the problem is not just assigning each spot a height up to its own maximum, but also ensuring that in every restriction's range, the maximum height does not exceed x_i.\n\nHmm, so how to model this? It feels like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming, where for each position, we track the maximum height allowed up to that point, considering all the constraints from previous spots.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the DP state as the current spot and the maximum height allowed in the last considered spot. Because for a range-based restriction, the maximum can come from anywhere in the range. So when processing a new spot, the maximum height in the current spot can't be higher than any of the x_i's that apply to it, and also can't be higher than the previous spot's maximum if there's a restriction that includes both.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each spot i, the maximum height assigned to it cannot be higher than the minimum of (x_j for all restrictions covering i) and (the maximum height of any spot j in the same restriction ranges as i). Hmm, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that for each spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's for the restrictions that cover it, and also the maximum height in any overlapping restriction ranges that include it.\n\nWait, maybe not. It's tricky.\n\nLet me think differently. The problem is similar to interval constraints where each interval has a maximum allowed value, and for each spot, the value chosen must be less than or equal to all the x_i's for the intervals that include it, as well as the maximum of any of those x_i's that might impose a stricter condition.\n\nWait, no. Because the restrictions are on the maximum in the interval. So for each interval [l, r], the maximum height in that interval must be <= x_i.\n\nThis is a kind of constraint that's not local to individual spots but to ranges. So the problem is to assign values to each spot such that for every restriction's interval, the maximum in that interval is <= x_i.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nOne approach is to model the problem as finding an array of heights where for each restriction's interval, the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. And then maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with graph constraints, but perhaps a more efficient way is to use dynamic programming.\n\nSo let's consider the dynamic programming approach.\n\nWe can process the spots from left to right. For each spot i, we'll keep track of the maximum height allowed for that spot, subject to all the constraints up to that point.\n\nWait, but the constraints involve ranges, so a spot i's choice affects not only itself but also any future spots that are part of a range that includes i.\n\nHmm, perhaps the state needs to include the maximum height up to i, but that's not sufficient because a future spot could be part of a range that starts before i and ends after i.\n\nWait, perhaps the state can be represented by the current position and the maximum height allowed for the current position. Because for any future restrictions that include this position, the maximum can't exceed the current height.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for a spot i, the maximum height assigned to it sets an upper bound for any future spots that are in a range that includes i. So when processing spot i+1, if a restriction includes i and i+1, then the maximum for spot i+1 can't exceed the maximum of spot i and the x_i of that restriction.\n\nSo the DP state can be defined as dp[i][k], where i is the current spot, and k is the maximum height allowed for spot i. The value is the maximum profit achievable up to spot i, with spot i's height being k.\n\nThen, for each spot i, and for each possible height k, we look at all possible previous states (from i-1) that could transition into k without violating any restrictions.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the restrictions that include spot i but start before i or end after i?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each spot i, the maximum height k is constrained by:\n\n- The x values of all restrictions that include i.\n- The maximum height of the previous spot, if there's a restriction that covers both i-1 and i.\n\nWait, that's a bit unclear.\n\nLet me think again. For a given spot i, the maximum height k can't be larger than any x_i of the restrictions that include i. Also, for any restriction that starts before i and ends after i, the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i. But the maximum in that range is the maximum between the current spot i and the previous spots in that range.\n\nWait, perhaps for a restriction [L, R], the maximum of spots L to R must be <= x. So when processing spot i, any restriction that includes i and starts before i (so L <= i and R >=i) will require that the maximum between spots L and R is <= x. So when assigning a height to i, it must be <= x, and also, if there's a spot before i in the same restriction's range, the maximum of those spots must also be <=x.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the DP approach should track, for each spot i, the maximum height chosen up to i, and ensure that for any restriction that includes i, the maximum in that restriction's range is <= x_i.\n\nBut how do we enforce that during the DP transitions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP state needs to include the maximum height in the current spot, and for each new spot, we can check if any existing restrictions that include it are satisfied.\n\nBut that seems difficult because a spot could be part of multiple overlapping restrictions.\n\nAnother idea: for each spot i, the maximum height can be up to the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that include i. But this is only a necessary condition, not sufficient, because in a restriction that includes i and some spot j>i, the maximum could be determined by j.\n\nWait, but if for each spot i, we set the maximum allowed as the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i, then when we process the spots in order, the maximum for spot i can't exceed that. However, this might not be enough because for a restriction that spans multiple spots, the maximum could be determined by any of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to precompute for each spot i the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i, and then assign to each spot i a height that is as high as possible but not exceeding that, while also ensuring that for any restriction that includes i, the maximum in that restriction's range is <= x_j.\n\nBut how to enforce that the maximum in the range is <= x_j.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents a spot, and edges represent transitions between heights, with constraints based on the restrictions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a problem of variables (spot heights) with constraints that for each restriction [L, R], the maximum of variables L..R is <= x_i. We want to maximize the sum of squares of variables, each variable being <= h.\n\nThis is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.\n\nBut solving this exactly for small n and m (up to 50) is manageable.\n\nWait, but with n=50, that's 50 variables, each with up to h+1 possible values. The number of possible states would be (h+1)^n, which for h=50 is 51^50, which is way too big.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the DP approach is better.\n\nLet me think again about the DP.\n\nThe DP state can be dp[i][k], representing the maximum profit when processing up to spot i, with the height at spot i being k. Then, for each i, we can try all possible k (from 0 to the maximum allowed for spot i), and for each possible previous state (i-1, prev_k), check if setting the current height to k violates any restrictions that include spot i.\n\nWait, but how to check if the current choice of k for spot i violates any restrictions that include i.\n\nEach restriction that includes i may have a range that starts before i and/or ends after i. So when setting k for spot i, we need to make sure that for any such restriction, the maximum in its range is <= x_i.\n\nBut the maximum in the range is the maximum of all the spots in that range.\n\nSo when processing spot i, for each restriction that includes i, we need to know the maximum height in that restriction's range. But since we're processing from left to right, the only way a restriction's maximum can be affected by spot i is if the restriction's range ends at i. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. Because for a restriction [L, R], if L <= i <= R, then the maximum of the entire range could change as we process spot i.\n\nSo for each restriction [L, R], during processing, whenever we reach a spot in L..R, we need to track the maximum height in that range and ensure it doesn't exceed x.\n\nThis seems challenging because the restrictions can overlap in complex ways.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem by considering each restriction as a constraint on the maximum height in its range. So for each restriction, the maximum of spots L to R must be <= x.\n\nBut how to represent this in DP.\n\nPerhaps for each spot i, and for each possible maximum height up to i, we track the maximum in the previous spots, and when processing i, we can check against all restrictions that include i.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nThe DP state is dp[i][current_max], where current_max is the maximum height in the current spot i. For each possible current_max, we track the maximum profit up to i.\n\nWhen processing spot i+1, for each possible next_max (height of i+1), we need to ensure that:\n\n1. next_max <= min_x, where min_x is the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include i+1.\n2. For any restriction that includes i+1 and starts before i+1, the maximum in that restriction's range must be <= x_i. So, if the restriction's range is [L, R], and L < i+1 <= R, then the maximum height in L..R (which includes spots up to i+1) must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, but how do we track the maximum in L..R when processing i+1.\n\nThis seems tricky because for a restriction that starts before i+1 and ends after i+1, the maximum could be determined by any of the spots in L..R, including those beyond i+1 which haven't been processed yet.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the DP approach may not work directly because the state doesn't capture the necessary information about the maximum in all relevant ranges.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps, for each spot i, the maximum height can be as high as possible, but subject to the constraints of all the restrictions that include i. Additionally, for each restriction that starts before i and ends after i, the maximum in that restriction's range must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, but when processing spot i, the maximum for that restriction's range is the maximum between the current spot's height and the previous maximum of that range.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a restriction [L, R] where L <= i < R. Then, when processing spot i, the maximum of [L, R] is the maximum between the current spot's height and the previous maximum of [L, R].\n\nBut how to track the previous maximum for each possible restriction.\n\nThis seems impossible because for each restriction, we'd need to track its maximum, which could be expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of tracking the maximum for each restriction, perhaps precompute for each spot i the earliest restriction that starts before i and ends after i. For each such restriction, the maximum height in that range can't exceed x_i.\n\nWait, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nHmm. Maybe for each spot i, the maximum height is the minimum of the x_i's for all restrictions that include i, and the maximum height of any spot in the same range as i.\n\nWait, that's a bit circular.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum height for spot i is the minimum of:\n\n- h\n- min{ x_j | j is a restriction that includes i }\n- for any restriction that includes i and is a superset of i, the maximum height in that restriction's range.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nSince the problem is small (n=50), perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nFor each spot i, the height can be up to the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that include i, and the maximum of all spots in any restriction that includes i.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent for each spot i, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of:\n\n- h\n- the minimum x_j for all restrictions that include i.\n\nAdditionally, for any restriction [L, R] where L <= i <= R, the maximum height in [L, R] must be <= x_j.\n\nSo for spot i, the maximum is min( min_x, ... ), but also, for each such restriction, the maximum height in [L, R] must be <= x_j.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe constraints can be viewed as a graph where each node represents a spot, and edges represent dependencies due to overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nMaybe I can model the problem by treating each restriction as a separate constraint and precompute for each spot i the list of restrictions that include it.\n\nThen, for each spot i, the maximum height is bounded by the minimum x_j for all these restrictions, but also, for any restriction that includes i, the maximum in that restriction's range must be <= x_j.\n\nBut again, the issue is that the maximum in a range depends on multiple spots.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution will have, for each spot i, the height as the minimum of h, the minimum x_j for all restrictions that include i, and the maximum height in any of the overlapping restrictions that include i.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → max height at spot 1 is 1.\n\n2 2 3 → max height at spot 2 is 3.\n\n3 3 2 → max height at spot 3 is 2.\n\nSo the maximum allowed heights per spot are [1,3,2].\n\nWhich gives sum 1 +9 +4=14.\n\nIn this case, the initial approach works.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → max height in 2-3 is 8.\n\n3 4 7 → max height in 3-4 is7.\n\nSo for spot 2: min x is 8 (since it's included in the first restriction). But the second restriction includes spot 3 and 4.\n\nSpot 3 is included in both restrictions, so its maximum is min(8,7)=7.\n\nSpot 4 is included in the second restriction, so maximum is7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7], which gives sum 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nBut in this case, the initial approach would correctly assign the maximum allowed heights as [10,8,7,7], and the sum is correct.\n\nWait, but what about a case where a restriction's range extends beyond the current spot, and the maximum in that range is not determined by the current spot.\n\nFor example, suppose:\n\nn=2, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=5.\n\nSo, the maximum in 1-2 must be 5.\n\nIf I process spot 1: its maximum is 5.\n\nThen, when processing spot 2, its maximum is 5, but if I set it to 6, the maximum in 1-2 would be 6, which exceeds the restriction.\n\nSo, for spot 2, the maximum allowed is min(10,5) =5.\n\nThus, the initial approach works.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-3, x=5.\n\nSo, all spots 1,2,3 must be <=5.\n\nIn this case, each spot's maximum is 5.\n\nSo the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=4.\n\nRestriction 2: 2-3, x=3.\n\nSo, spot 2 is included in both restrictions.\n\nSpot 1: maximum is 4.\n\nSpot 2: min(4,3) =3.\n\nSpot 3: min(3) =3.\n\nThus, the heights would be [4,3,3], which gives sum 16+9+9=34.\n\nBut what about the maximum in 1-2: 4 <=4 → ok.\n\nMaximum in 2-3:3 <=3 → ok.\n\nSo the initial approach works.\n\nBut what about a case where a later spot in a restriction's range imposes a stricter limit on earlier spots.\n\nLike:\n\nn=3.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-3, x=3.\n\nSo, the maximum in 1-3 must be 3.\n\nBut suppose the initial approach computes spot 1's maximum as min(h=10, x=3) =3.\n\nSpot 2's maximum is 3.\n\nSpot 3's maximum is3.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut what if:\n\nn=3.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=4.\n\nRestriction 2: 2-3, x=3.\n\nSo, spot 2's maximum is min(4,3)=3.\n\nSpot 1's maximum is4.\n\nSpot 3's maximum is3.\n\nSo the heights are [4,3,3].\n\nBut in the first restriction, the maximum in 1-2 is4, which is allowed.\n\nIn the second, maximum is3.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nBut what if I have another restriction:\n\nRestriction 3: 3-3, x=2.\n\nThen spot 3's maximum is min(3,2)=2.\n\nThus, the heights are [4,3,2], which sum is 25.\n\nIn that case, the initial approach would correctly compute the maximum allowed heights.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to, for each spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum of h, and the minimum x_i for all restrictions that include it.\n\nBecause in all the examples I tried, this approach works.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is min(h, min { x_j for all restrictions j where l_j <=i <= r_j }).\n\nIs this always correct?\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose we have two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: 1-3, x=5.\n\nRestriction 2: 2-3, x=3.\n\nSo for spot 2, the min x_j is min(5,3)=3.\n\nSpot3: min(5,3)=3.\n\nSpot1:5.\n\nThus, heights are 5,3,3.\n\nThe maximum in 1-3 is5, which is allowed because x=5.\n\nThe maximum in 2-3 is3, which is allowed.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=4.\n\nRestriction 2: 2-3, x=3.\n\nSo, spot2's maximum is min(4,3)=3.\n\nSpot3's maximum is3.\n\nSpot1's maximum is4.\n\nThus, in 1-2, maximum is4, allowed.\n\nIn 2-3, maximum is3, allowed.\n\nBut what if another restriction is added:\n\nRestriction3: 3-4, x=2.\n\nSo, spot3's maximum is min(3,2)=2.\n\nThus, the heights are 4,3,2.\n\nBut what about a scenario where a spot is part of multiple overlapping restrictions, but the maximum is not determined by any single spot, but by the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct because for any restriction, the maximum in its range is the maximum of all spots in that range, which is <= the minimum x_j for each spot in the range.\n\nNo, wait, that's not necessarily true.\n\nWait, for a restriction [L, R], the maximum in that range must be <= x_j.\n\nBut each spot i in [L, R] has a maximum height of min( h, min{x_k for all restrictions that include i} ).\n\nSo, for each spot i, its maximum is <= x_j for all restrictions that include i.\n\nThus, the maximum in the range [L, R] is <= x_j for each i in [L, R], but not necessarily <= the minimum x_j across all restrictions in [L, R].\n\nWait, no. Because each spot's maximum is the minimum of h and the x_j's for all restrictions that include it. So, for each spot i in [L, R], its maximum is <= x_k for all k where i is in restriction k's range.\n\nBut the x_k's could vary.\n\nWait, for a restriction [L, R], the x_i for that restriction is x.\n\nBut for each spot in [L, R], the maximum allowed is the minimum of h and the x_j's for all restrictions that include it.\n\nSo, for a spot i in [L, R], it's allowed to have a maximum of min(h, min x_j for all j where i is in j's range).\n\nBut the x_j for the restriction [L, R] is x. So, for spot i, it's allowed to have up to x (if x is the smallest among all x_j for i's restrictions).\n\nBut for the restriction [L, R], all spots in [L, R] have their maximum allowed <=x (since x is one of the x_j's for each spot in [L, R]).\n\nThus, the maximum of the entire range [L, R] is the maximum of all spots in [L, R], each of which is <=x.\n\nThus, the maximum is <=x.\n\nSo, for the restriction [L, R], the maximum is automatically <=x.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach of setting each spot's maximum allowed as min(h, min x_j for all restrictions that include it) is sufficient to satisfy all the restrictions.\n\nWow, that's a crucial insight!\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum of h and the x_j's for all restrictions that include i. Then, for each spot, choose a height between 0 and this maximum allowed height, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in the initial approach, each spot's maximum is determined by the minimal x_j across all restrictions that include it, but in reality, for a given restriction [L, R], the x_j could be larger than the spot's maximum. But as long as each spot is <=x_j, the maximum in the range is <=x_j.\n\nYes, because the maximum in the range is the maximum of all the spots in that range, each of which is <=x_j for their own restrictions, but x_j could be different.\n\nWait, but for a given restriction [L, R], x is the x_j for that restriction. So, for each spot in [L, R], their maximum allowed is <=x_j, which includes x (since x_j could be x for that restriction). So, for each spot in [L, R], their maximum allowed is <=x_j, which is <=x (since x_j could be x or smaller).\n\nWait, no, because x_j is the x for the restriction, but the spot could be in other restrictions with higher x_j.\n\nWait, for a spot i, the maximum allowed is min(h, min x_j for all j where i is in j's range). So, for the restriction [L, R], x is one of the x_j's for spot i (assuming i is in [L, R]). So, the maximum allowed for i is <=x.\n\nThus, the maximum in [L, R] is the maximum of all i in [L, R], each <=x. So the maximum is <=x.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i. Let's call this min_x[i].\n\n2. The maximum allowed height for spot i is min(h, min_x[i]).\n\n3. For each spot i, choose a height a_i between 0 and max_allowed[i], such that the sum of a_i^2 is maximized.\n\nNow, this is a standard problem: given a set of numbers (max_allowed for each spot), choose a_i as large as possible, but within their limits, to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nWait, because the sum of squares is maximized when each a_i is as large as possible, within their constraints.\n\nBecause for a fixed sum, the sum of squares is minimized when the variables are equal, but here we are to maximize it, so the opposite: each a_i should be as large as possible.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is achieved when each a_i is as large as possible, i.e., a_i = max_allowed[i].\n\nWait, but wait: the sum of squares is maximized when each a_i is as large as possible. Because for a_i in [0, M], a_i^2 is increasing with a_i. So, to maximize the sum, each a_i should be as large as possible.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to set each a_i to max_allowed[i], and then the sum is the sum of squares of the max_allowed array.\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input 2:\n\nAfter computing the max_allowed for each spot:\n\nSpot1: no restrictions, so min_x is h=10.\n\nSpot2: restriction 1 (x=8) and none others. So min_x=8.\n\nSpot3: restrictions 1 (x=8) and 2 (x=7). So min_x=7.\n\nSo the max_allowed is [10,8,7,7].\n\nSum is 100+64+49+49=262, which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, in sample input 1, the max_allowed is [1,3,2], sum is 14.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\n- For each spot, compute the min_x as the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include it.\n\n- The maximum allowed for spot i is min(h, min_x[i]).\n\n- Sum the squares of these maximum allowed values.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize min_x array as h for all spots.\n\nFor each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = input.\n\n   for i from l to r:\n\n       if x < min_x[i]:\n\n           min_x[i] = x\n\nCompute the sum of squares of min_x[1...n], but wait, no: wait, min_x[i] is the minimum x_j for all restrictions that include i, but for the spot i, the maximum allowed is min(h, min_x[i]).\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, min_x[i] is computed as the minimum x_j for all restrictions that include i. So, the maximum allowed is min(h, min_x[i]).\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, min_x[i] is initialized to h. Then, for each restriction, for each spot in the range, min_x[i] is updated to the minimum between current min_x[i] and x.\n\nThus, min_x[i] after processing all restrictions is the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i.\n\nSo, the maximum allowed for spot i is min(h, min_x[i]).\n\nWait, but initially, min_x[i] is h. So, if a spot i is not covered by any restriction, min_x[i] remains h, and the maximum allowed is h.\n\nWhich is correct because in the note, the second example says that even though there's no explicit restriction on spot1, it's still limited by h.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmin_x = [h] * (n+1)  # assuming 1-based indexing.\n\nfor each of m restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if x < min_x[i]:\n\n            min_x[i] = x\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\n    max_allowed[i] = min(h, min_x[i])\n\nsum = sum( (max_allowed[i])^2 for i in 1..n )\n\nprint sum.\n\nYes, that's the solution.\n\nSo, in the code, it's straightforward.\n\nTesting this against the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for i=1: x=1. min_x[1] = min(3,1) =1.\n\n2 2 3 → i=2: x=3. min_x[2] =3.\n\n3 3 2 → i=3: x=2. min_x[3]=2.\n\nThus, max allowed is [1,3,2]. Sum 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → for i=2,3: x=8.\n\n3 4 7 → i=3,4: x=7.\n\nSo, for i=1: min_x remains 10.\n\ni=2: min(10,8) →8.\n\ni=3: min(8,7) →7.\n\ni=4:7.\n\nThus, max allowed is [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, h=10.\n\nm=1.\n\nRestriction: 1-2, x=5.\n\nSo, min_x for i=1:5.\n\ni=2:5.\n\nMax allowed:5 and5.\n\nSum is 25+25=50.\n\nBut what if another restriction: 2-2, x=3.\n\nThen, for i=2: min(5,3)=3.\n\nSo max allowed:5 and3.\n\nSum is 25+9=34.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize min_x as [h]*(n+1).\n\nFor each m restrictions:\n\n   Read l, r, x.\n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n       if x < min_x[i]:\n\n           min_x[i] = x\n\nCompute the sum of squares of min_x[1..n].\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nWait, no: Wait, the maximum allowed is min(h, min_x[i]), but in our code, min_x[i] is already the minimum of x_j for all restrictions that include i. So, if a spot i is not covered by any restriction, min_x[i] is h, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmin_x = [h]*(n+1)  # 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if x < min_x[i]:\n            min_x[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    total += min_x[i]**2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the code above, min_x[i] is set to the minimum x for all restrictions that include i. But for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and min_x[i]. So, in the code, the min_x[i] is already min( h, min_x[i] ) because initially min_x[i] is h, and for each restriction, x can't be larger than h.\n\nWait, no. Because x can be up to h. So for a spot i, min_x[i] is the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that include it. So, if a spot is not in any restriction, min_x[i] is h. Otherwise, it's the minimum x_j.\n\nThus, for each spot i, the maximum allowed is min(h, min_x[i]), but since min_x[i] is either h (if no restrictions) or some x_j (<=h), the maximum allowed is min_x[i], which is already <=h.\n\nSo, the code as written correctly computes the maximum allowed for each spot.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to build houses on a street with certain height constraints to maximize the profit. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared. The challenge is to respect the zoning restrictions while maximizing the profit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We have `n` spots on a street where each spot can have a house of height between 0 and `h`. There are `m` restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house in a given range must not exceed a certain height.\n2. **Insight**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum height constraint from all applicable restrictions. This ensures that we respect all restrictions.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values.\n   - For each restriction, update the maximum allowed height for each spot in the specified range.\n   - Compute the total profit as the sum of squares of these maximum allowed heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmin_x = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if x < min_x[i]:\n            min_x[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += min_x[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `min_x` is initialized to store the minimum height constraint for each spot. Initially, each spot can have a house of height up to `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the maximum allowed height for each spot in the specified range. This ensures that each spot's height does not exceed any of the restrictions that apply to it.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the code calculates the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each restriction and computes the optimal heights for each spot, ensuring all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit.",
