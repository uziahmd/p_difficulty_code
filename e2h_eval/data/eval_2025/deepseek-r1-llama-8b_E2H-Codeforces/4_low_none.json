The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They each have their own sequences of moves that they follow cyclically. For each round, they choose their move based on their sequence, and the winner determines who gets a red spot. The task is to calculate how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm. So for each round, we need to determine who wins and then count the loser's red spots.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the moves are chosen. Both players have a cycle of their own sequences. So for each round i (from 0 to n-1), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's is B[i % k]. Then, we determine if the round was a win for either, or a draw.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the order is that in each round, the players choose their items from their sequences in order, cycling back as needed. So for the first round, both show their first element. Second round, second, and so on, looping around as necessary.\n\nSo, for each of the n rounds, we'll pick the corresponding character from A and B based on the current round index modulo their sequence lengths.\n\nThen, for each such pair, we determine who loses. If they choose the same, no one loses. Otherwise, the outcome is determined by the rules: R beats S, S beats P, P beats R.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input: n, string A, string B.\n2. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get a_char = A[round % len(A)]\n   b. Get b_char = B[round % len(B)]\n   c. Compare a_char and b_char.\n   d. If they are the same: no one gets a spot.\n   e. Else, determine who wins and who loses.\n   f. Add a spot to the loser's count.\n3. After all rounds, output the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the problem says that in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, resulting in a red spot. So the loser is the one who gets the spot. So for each round where there's a winner, the loser is the one with the losing choice.\n\nSo, for example, if a chooses R and b chooses S: R beats S, so a wins. So b gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, how to model the outcomes? We can create a function that, given two choices, returns whether a wins, b wins, or it's a draw.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: a == b → draw → no one gets a spot.\n\nCase 2: a beats b → a wins → b gets a spot.\n\nCase 3: b beats a → b wins → a gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to check if a and b are the same. If not, determine which one beats the other.\n\nSo, let's precompute for each possible pair whether a beats b, b beats a, or it's a draw.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of a and b, decide the outcome.\n\nSo, for each round, do:\n\na = A[i % m]\nb = B[i % k]\n\nif a == b: continue\n\nelse:\n\nCheck if a beats b.\n\nIf a does, then b gets a spot.\n\nElse, a gets a spot.\n\nSo, the steps are clear.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. n can be up to 2e5 (200,000). m and k can be up to 1000. So for each round, the modulo operations are O(1), since 1000 is manageable.\n\nWait, for 2e5 rounds, each with a modulo operation on 1e3, that's acceptable because 2e5 * 1e3 is 2e8 operations, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nSo, now, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nWe can initialize two counters, say, a_spots and b_spots, starting at 0.\n\nLoop over each round from 0 to n-1:\n\ni is the round number.\n\nai = A[i % m_len] where m_len is len(A).\n\nbi = B[i % k_len] where k_len is len(B).\n\nCompare ai and bi.\n\nIf they are equal: nothing happens.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if ai beats bi.\n\nIf yes: add 1 to b_spots.\n\nElse: add 1 to a_spots.\n\nSo, the key is determining whether a's move beats b's.\n\nHow to represent that?\n\nWell, for any a_move and b_move, we can check",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they play a specified number of rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize counters for the red spots of both players.\n3. **Round Simulation**: For each round, determine the move of each player based on their respective cyclic sequences. Check if one player wins over the other:\n   - If both players choose the same move, it's a draw, and no spots are awarded.\n   - If Player A's move beats Player B's move, Player B gets a red spot.\n   - If Player B's move beats Player A's move, Player A gets a red spot.\n4. **Output the Results**: After processing all rounds, print the count of red spots for both players.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\na_spots = 0\nb_spots = 0\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_char = A[i % m]\n    b_char = B[i % k]\n    \n    if a_char == b_char:\n        continue\n    \n    # Determine who loses\n    if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n        b_spots += 1\n    else:\n        a_spots += 1\n\nprint(a_spots, b_spots)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players.\n- **Cyclic Move Determination**: For each round, the move of each player is determined using modulo operations to cycle through their respective sequences.\n- **Winning Condition Check**: For each pair of moves, we check if one move beats the other. If so, the losing player gets a red spot.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 200,000 rounds with sequences of up to 1000 characters, ensuring it runs within acceptable time limits for competitive programming constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that each round is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient and scalable for large inputs.",
