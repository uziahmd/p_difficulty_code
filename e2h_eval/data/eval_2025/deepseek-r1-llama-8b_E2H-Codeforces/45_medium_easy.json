There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The main rule is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one. So, for example, if one has played 2 games, the other must have played either 1 or 2 as well.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play. We need to write a program that takes an integer n (number of players) and outputs this maximum.\n\nHmm, let's think about the structure here. Since it's a knockout tournament, each loss eliminates a player. So the winner has to win all their matches. The key is to arrange the matches such that the winner can play as many games as possible while respecting the rule.\n\nWait, how do the number of games played affect the next match? Let me think with some examples.\n\nFor example, when n=2: there's only one game, so the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nWhen n=3: the winner can play two games. Like, first play against someone (game 1), then play against the next person (game 2). So the sequence is two games.\n\nWhen n=4: the maximum is 2. Because if the winner plays two games, but after that, they can't play a third because there's no one left with a difference of at most one in games played. Wait, why not three? Oh right, because the initial setup would require that each time, the opponents are allowed to play.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a binary tree. Each round halves the players until you get to the winner. But that might not directly help because the arrangement of matches affects the number of games the winner plays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding the maximum depth of a binary tree where each node has children that satisfy the game condition. Or maybe it's a matter of building a Fibonacci-like sequence since the allowed differences are limited.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's model the maximum number of games as a function f(n). For n=2, f(2)=1. For n=3, f(3)=2. For n=4, f(4)=2. Hmm, but wait, what about n=10? The sample says f(10)=4.\n\nWait, maybe f(n) relates to the Fibonacci sequence. Because the way the winner accumulates games depends on adding layers where each step allows certain possibilities based on previous steps.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a tournament where the winner plays k games. To get k, each step before that must allow the opponent to have either k-1 or k games. Because the opponent must have played a number differing by at most one.\n\nSo, for each game the winner plays, the opponent must have played either one less or one more game than the winner at that point.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the number of players required to reach k games.\n\nFor k=1: You need at least 2 players. So n >=2.\n\nFor k=2: How many players? Let's see. The winner plays two games. So in the first game, the opponent could have played 0 games (since they just entered), and the winner has 1. Then, the next opponent could have played 0 or 1. Wait, but the second opponent has to have played at most one game.\n\nWait, but for the second game, the opponent must have played either 1 or 2-1=1 game. So the second opponent could have played 1 game. So, for the second game, the opponent has one game, which means they had to have won once.\n\nSo, for the winner to play two games, how many players do we need?\n\nWell, for the first game: 1 vs 2. After that, the winner has 1 game, and needs to play against someone else who has either 0 or 1 games. If they play against someone with 0, that's two games for the winner. But that's just two players, but that's the same as the first case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the minimal number of players needed for a winner to have k games is f(k+1), where f is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's think for k=1: we need 2 players. So f(2) = 2.\n\nk=2: We need 3 players. Because:\n\nIn the first game, the winner plays someone (1 game). Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. If the second opponent has played 1, that implies they came from a game where they had 1. So the total players would be 3.\n\nYes, because in that case, the first game is between A and B, winner A goes on. Then, in the second game, A plays C, who also had one game. So total players is 3.\n\nWait, but for n=3, the sample shows f(3)=2, which aligns with this.\n\nWhat about k=3: How many players do we need?\n\nEach step, the number of players needed increases.\n\nWait, for k=3, the winner plays 3 games.\n\nFirst game: 1 game.\n\nSecond game: opponent has 0 or 1.\n\nThird game: opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nWait, but how do we arrange this?\n\nLet me try to build the scenario.\n\nAfter the first game, the winner has 1 game.\n\nFor the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1. Let's say they have 1.\n\nThen, for the third game, the opponent must have played 1 or 2.\n\nBut in this case, the winner has 2 games, so the opponent must have 1 or 2.\n\nIf the opponent has 2, that implies that in their path, they had to win two games.\n\nBut how many players does this require?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players for k games is f(k+2), where f is the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, etc.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nk=1: requires 2 players. So f(3) is 2? Or maybe my indexing is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for k games is f(k+1), with f(1) = 2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, etc.\n\nBecause for k=1, we need 2 players (f(2)=2).\n\nFor k=2, we need 3 players (f(3)=3).\n\nFor k=3, we need 5 players (f(4)=5).\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIf k=3, the minimal n is 5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nPlayers: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nRound 1: A vs B → A wins (1 game). Round 2: A vs C (A has 1, C has 0) → A wins (2 games). Round 3: A vs D (D has 0). So A can't play a third game because D has 0, but A has 2, which is a difference of 2, which is invalid. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right arrangement.\n\nAlternative approach: Arrange the matches so that in the third game, A plays someone who has 1 or 2 games.\n\nSo after two wins, A has two games.\n\nSo the third opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nIf the opponent has 1 game, that means they won once, but lost once as well. But how did they get to 1 game?\n\nHmm, perhaps in a previous match.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is a Fibonacci-like tournament.\n\nWait, another idea: The minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is equal to the (k+2)-th term in the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence starts with F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, F(4)=8, etc.\n\nBecause for k=1, F(3) is 2; for k=2, F(4)=3; for k=3, F(5)=5; for k=4, F(6)=8, etc.\n\nWait, let's check for k=3. F(5) is 5.\n\nSo for n=5, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes.\n\nLet me see:\n\nPlayers: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nArrange the matches such that:\n\n- A plays B → A wins (1 game).\n- Then, A plays C, who has played 0 games → A wins (2 games).\n- Next, A plays D, who has played 0 → no, that's a difference of 2, which is invalid.\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternative arrangement:\n\nWait, perhaps the second game is against someone who has played 1 game.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe the tournament is arranged as a chain, where each step alternates between even and odd games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using a recursive approach.\n\nLet me think: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the minimal number of players needed is <=n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k where the minimal players required is <=n.\n\nSo how do we calculate the minimal players for each k?\n\nLooking for a pattern:\n\nk | minimal players\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n5 | 13\n...\n\nYes, this seems like the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2,3,5,8, etc.\n\nSo the minimal players for k is fib(k+1), where fib is defined as:\n\nfib(1)=2, fib(2)=3, fib(3)=5, fib(4)=8, etc.\n\nSo for each k, the minimal n is fib(k+1).\n\nThus, our goal is to find the maximum k such that fib(k+1) <= n.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where fib(m) exceeds n, then k is m-1.\n\nWait, let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input: 2\n\nWe need to find the largest k where fib(k+1) <=2.\n\nfib(2)=3>2. So k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input:3\n\nfib(3)=5>3. So check k=2. fib(3)=5>3, so k=2.\n\nWait, no: wait for k=2, fib(3)=3<=3, so k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input:4.\n\nWe look for the largest k where fib(k+1) <=4.\n\nfib(3)=5>4. So check k=2: fib(3)=3<=4. So k=2.\n\nSample Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother sample input is 10.\n\nCompute fib terms:\n\nfib(1)=2\n\nfib(2)=3\n\nfib(3)=5\n\nfib(4)=8\n\nfib(5)=13>10.\n\nSo the largest k where fib(k+1)<=10 is k=4, because fib(5)=13>10.\n\nWait, wait: fib(5)=13>10, so the maximum k is 4, since fib(5)=13>10, but fib(4)=8<=10.\n\nYes, sample output for n=10 is 4, which matches.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where fib(m) exceeds 1018 (since n can be up to 1018).\n\n2. For a given n, find the maximum k such that fib(k+1) <=n.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where fib(m) >1018.\n\n- For each input n, find the largest k where fib(k+1) <=n.\n\n- The maximum number of games is k.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, precompute the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nInitialize fib as a list.\n\nStart with fib[0]=1, fib[1]=2, fib[2]=3, fib[3]=5, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to index differently.\n\nWait, the minimal players for k games is fib(k+1). So for k=1, it's fib(2)=2.\n\nSo perhaps the list should start with fib[0]=1, fib[1]=2, fib[2]=3, fib[3]=5, etc.\n\nSo for k=0, it's 1 player, which isn't possible since the problem requires at least two players.\n\nBut in our case, the problem states n>=2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCompute fib sequence until fib[m] >n_max (1018).\n\nOnce we have this list, for each n, find the maximum k where fib[k+1] <=n.\n\nSo, for example, for n=10, the fib sequence up to m=5 is 2,3,5,8,13.\n\nCheck for k=4: fib[5]=13>10. So k=4 is the maximum.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Find the largest k where fib[k+1] <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprecompute the fib list.\n\nfor each n in input:\n\n   find the maximum k such that fib[k+1] <=n.\n\n   print k.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nBut wait, what if n is exactly equal to fib[m]? Then k=m-1.\n\nSo, the code will loop through the fib list and find the maximum k.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, generate the fib list.\n\nStart with fib = [2,3]\n\nthen keep adding next fib as sum of last two.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nfib = []\n\na, b = 2,3\n\nfib.append(a)\n\nfib.append(b)\n\nthen for next terms:\n\nc = a + b\n\nappend c, then a = b, b = c.\n\nContinue until c >1018.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nmax_n = 1018\n\nfib = []\n\na, b = 2, 3\n\nfib.append(a)\n\nfib.append(b)\n\nwhile True:\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    if c > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(c)\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\nSo, now, for each n, find the maximum k where fib[k+1] <=n.\n\nWait, the list is 2,3,5,8,13,... So for k=1, it's 2; k=2, 3; k=3,5, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, the minimal players is 2. So fib[0]=2, which corresponds to k=1.\n\nSo the list is indexed as follows:\n\nindex 0: k=1, players=2\n\nindex 1: k=2, players=3\n\nindex 2: k=3, players=5\n\nand so on.\n\nSo for a given n, we can iterate through the fib list and find the largest k such that fib[i] <=n. The corresponding k is i+1.\n\nWait, no. Because for i=0, fib[0]=2, which is for k=1. So for fib[i], it's k=i+1.\n\nSo, for example, if n is 5, which is fib[2]=5, then k=3.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=3, the minimal players is 5, so if n=5, the maximum k is 3.\n\nSo, the code is: for each fib[i], if fib[i] <=n, then k=i+1.\n\nSo, for n=5, the largest i where fib[i] <=5 is 2 (since fib[2]=5), so k=3.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfib = [2,3,5,8,13,21,...]\n\nfor n in input:\n\n    max_k = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(fib)):\n\n        if fib[i] <=n:\n\n            max_k = i +1\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\n    print(max_k)\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because for fib[i], it's the minimal players for k=i+1. So for fib[i] <=n, the maximum possible k is i+1.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code needs to precompute the fib list, then for each n, find the largest i where fib[i] <=n, then the maximum k is i+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose n=4.\n\nfib list is [2,3,5,...].\n\nSo for i=0: 2<=4 → yes, k=1.\n\ni=1:3<=4 → yes, k=2.\n\ni=2:5>4 → stop.\n\nSo maximum k is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nFirst, precompute the fib list.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nCompute the fib list.\n\nLoop through fib, and for each element, if it's <=n, increment the max_k.\n\nElse, break.\n\nPrint max_k.\n\nWait, but wait, the fib list may not contain elements beyond a certain point. So for n larger than the last fib element, we still need to find the maximum i where fib[i]<=n.\n\nWait, for example, if n is 100, which is larger than 89 (fib[6]=21, 34, 55, 89, 144). Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the fib list correctly.\n\nWait, initial a=2, b=3.\n\nfib = [2,3]\n\nnext c=2+3=5 → add.\n\nfib becomes [2,3,5]\n\nc=3+5=8 → add.\n\nfib is [2,3,5,8]\n\nc=5+8=13 → add.\n\nfib is [2,3,5,8,13]\n\nc=8+13=21 → add.\n\nfib is [2,3,5,8,13,21]\n\nc=13+21=34 → add.\n\nfib is [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]\n\nc=21+34=55 → add.\n\nfib is [...,34,55]\n\nc=34+55=89 → add.\n\nfib includes 89.\n\nc=55+89=144 → add.\n\nNow, 144>1018? No, 144<1018.\n\nSo continue.\n\nc=89+144=233 → add.\n\nc=144+233=377 → add.\n\nc=233+377=610 → add.\n\nc=377+610=987 → add.\n\nc=610+987=1597 → which is greater than 1018.\n\nSo for n=1018, the fib list goes up to 987, then 1597 is beyond.\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum fib[i] is 987, which is for i= len(fib)-1.\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum k is i+1 = len(fib) -1 +1 = len(fib). Wait, no, because len(fib) is the count of elements, including 2,3,5...987.\n\nWait, for example, for fib list [2,3,5], len is 3. For n=5, the max k is 3, which is len(fib) → no, len(fib) is 3, but k=3 comes from i=2.\n\nSo for fib[i], i is 2, which is len(fib)-1. So for a given n, the code should iterate through the fib list, and for each i, if fib[i] <=n, set max_k to i+1. Else, break.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be something like:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [2, 3]\n\na, b = 2, 3\n\nwhile True:\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    if c > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(c)\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\n# Now, for the given n, find the maximum k.\n\nmax_k = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <= n:\n\n        max_k = i +1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_k)\n\nWait, but wait: What if n is larger than the last fib number?\n\nFor example, n=987+610=1597>1018.\n\nBut in our code, the fib list ends at 987.\n\nSo for n=987, it's acceptable. For n=987 +1=988, the code will take the last fib[i]=987, so max_k= i+1 = len(fib) → len(fib) is 14, since initial [2,3], then 5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597>1018.\n\nWait, let's compute the fib list correctly.\n\nWait, initial a=2, b=3.\n\nfib = [2,3]\n\nnext c=5 → append.\n\nfib becomes [2,3,5]\n\nc=8 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8]\n\nc=13 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13]\n\nc=21 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13,21]\n\nc=34 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]\n\nc=55 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]\n\nc=89 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]\n\nc=144 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144]\n\nc=233 → append.\n\nfib: [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233]\n\nc=377 → append.\n\nfib: [...,233, 377]\n\nc=610 → append.\n\nfib: [...,377,610]\n\nc=987 → append.\n\nfib: [...,610,987]\n\nc=987 + 610 = 1597 → which is >1018, so break.\n\nSo the fib list is [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987].\n\nSo len(fib) is 14.\n\nSo for n=987, i=13, fib[13]=987 <=987 → max_k=14.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier reasoning, the maximum k is the largest where fib[i] <=n. So for n=987, the maximum k is 14.\n\nBut wait, according to our initial mapping, fib[i] is the minimal players for k=i+1.\n\nSo for i=13, fib[i]=987 → k=14.\n\nSo for n=987, the maximum is 14.\n\nBut what about n=988?\n\nIn this case, the code will loop through the fib list and for each i, check fib[i] <=988.\n\nAll the way to i=13, fib[13]=987<=988 → max_k=14.\n\nIf n=1597, which is beyond the limit, but in our code, the fib list stops at 987.\n\nSo for n=987, the code returns 14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 2 → fib[0]=2<=2 → max_k=1.\n\nSample Input 3: 3 → fib[1]=3<=3 → max_k=2.\n\nSample Input 4:4 → fib[1]=3<=4 → max_k=2.\n\nSample Input 10: fib[3]=8<=10, fib[4]=13>10 → max_k=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nfib[2]=5<=5 → max_k=3.\n\nSo the output is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nfib[3]=8>6 → so the maximum is 3, because fib[2]=5<=6.\n\nSo output is 3.\n\nWait, but for n=6, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nBecause fib[3]=8>6, but fib[2]=5<=6.\n\nSo yes, because 5<=6, which is for k=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that each game can only be played between players who have either the same number of games played or differ by exactly one game.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the `(k+1)`-th term in a Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 3. This sequence is derived from the observation that each subsequent game depends on the sum of the previous two terms, ensuring the rule about the difference in games played is satisfied.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: We precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the next term exceeds the maximum possible number of players (1018). This helps us quickly determine the maximum number of games for any given input.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: For each input `n`, we find the largest `k` such that the `(k+1)`-th term in the precomputed Fibonacci sequence is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [2, 3]\na, b = 2, 3\n\nwhile True:\n    c = a + b\n    if c > 1018:\n        break\n    fib.append(c)\n    a, b = b, c\n\nmax_k = 0\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n    if fib[i] <= n:\n        max_k = i + 1\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(max_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Terms**: We start with the initial terms 2 and 3. Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms, continuing until the term exceeds 1018.\n2. **Iterate Through Precomputed Terms**: For each input `n`, we check each term in the precomputed Fibonacci sequence. The largest index `i` where the term is less than or equal to `n` gives us the maximum number of games `k` as `i + 1`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games the winner can play by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 1018 players.",
