    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about the Number Games in Panel. Each district has a contestant, and the number of fans is 2^i for district i. The president wants to remove k contestants such that all remaining districts form a connected component. He also wants to maximize the total fans left. So, I need to find which k districts to remove.\n\nHmm, the key points are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree because there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining must form a connected subtree.\n3. The goal is to maximize the sum of 2^i for each remaining district.\n\nWait, but how do I choose which districts to remove? Because removing certain ones would split the tree into parts, but we want the largest possible sum.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since 2^i grows exponentially, the higher-numbered districts contribute more to the sum. So, to maximize the sum, we should keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the approach might be to find a subtree that includes the highest possible districts and exclude the ones with lower values.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn idea: The optimal solution is to find the smallest possible subtree (in terms of the number of nodes) that includes as many high nodes as possible. Or perhaps, find a central point where we can include as many high nodes as possible, and exclude the lower ones.\n\nWait, another way: the maximum sum is achieved by keeping the largest possible set of nodes that form a connected subtree. So, the strategy is to find a subtree consisting of the highest possible nodes, and then remove the minimal number of nodes from the rest to ensure connectivity.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be rephrased as finding a subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is exponential, the subtree must include as many large i's as possible.\n\nSo, the best way is to select a root node, and then include all its children, but wait, no. Wait, perhaps the subtree can be a star-shaped tree where the root is a certain node, and all other nodes are its descendants. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of choosing which nodes to keep. We want to keep a connected set of nodes, which implies that they form a subtree. To maximize the sum, we need as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nAnother thought: in a tree, the subtree that includes the maximum number of high-numbered nodes is likely to be the subtree that starts at some node and includes all higher-numbered nodes in its subtree. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to choose a node u, and keep all descendants of u that are higher than u. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a node u, such that the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at u is exactly (n - k), and among all such possible subtrees, the one with the highest sum. Then, we remove the k nodes outside of it.\n\nBut how do I find such a node u quickly?\n\nWait, let's think differently. The problem requires that the remaining nodes form a connected component. So, after removing k nodes, the remaining must form a subtree. The maximum sum is achieved by including as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the idea is to find a subtree that contains the largest possible sum of 2^i, which would mean including the highest possible nodes.\n\nIn a tree, the subtree with the largest sum of 2^i would be the one that includes all the highest-numbered nodes. So perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain of the highest-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, but the tree is arbitrary. So perhaps the best approach is to find the subtree that consists of the nodes with the highest values and forms a connected component.\n\nWait, another angle: the sum of 2^i is maximized when we include as many high i's as possible. So, the optimal subtree will consist of a set of nodes where all are connected, and include as many high i's as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find a subtree where the root is some node, and all nodes in the subtree are higher than the root. That way, the root is as small as possible, allowing more higher-numbered nodes to be included.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input:\n\n6 3\n\nThe tree is built as follows:\n\nEdges:\n2-1\n2-6\n2-3\n4-2\n5-6\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 3, 4, and 6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the initial tree looks like:\n\n1 is a child of 2, 3 is a child of 2, 4 is a child of 2, 6 is a child of 2, and 5 is a child of 6.\n\nThe sample output is removing 1,3,4. So the remaining districts are 2,5,6.\n\nWait, but 2 is connected to 6, which connects to 5. So they form a connected component.\n\nThe sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n\nIf we didn't remove 1,3,4, the sum would be higher, but the subtree would be larger. Wait, but we have to remove exactly k=3 nodes.\n\nSo the problem is to find a subtree of size (n-k) nodes, and within that, include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each possible subtree of size m = n - k, compute the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the subtree. Choose the subtree with the maximum sum.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e6, we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as selecting a subtree, and the subtree must be connected. We need to select the subtree with the maximum sum of 2^i, which is equivalent to including as many high i's as possible.\n\nSo, the optimal subtree is the one where all the nodes in the subtree are as large as possible.\n\nThus, the subtree can be represented by a contiguous sequence of nodes in the tree when ordered by their value. But since the tree is arbitrary, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree is a chain where the nodes are arranged in decreasing order of their values. So, the root is the smallest node in the subtree, and each child is larger than the root, and so on.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nAnother idea: the subtree that gives the maximum sum is the one that is centered around a node u, where u is the smallest node in the subtree, and all nodes in the subtree are in the subtree of u. So, the subtree is the entire subtree rooted at u, but only including those nodes that are higher than u. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree that consists of a single path where the highest possible nodes are included. So, for each node u, the subtree that includes all nodes in the path from u down to some leaves, but only those with higher numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the subtree that includes as many of the top (highest i) nodes as possible, forming a connected component.\n\nTo do this, perhaps we can perform a post-order traversal of the tree, and for each node, calculate the sum of the subtree. Then, for each possible subtree, determine whether it's a candidate.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the maximum sum is achieved when the subtree consists of all the highest (n - k) nodes, but they must form a connected component. So the problem reduces to finding a set of (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree and have the highest possible 2^i values.\n\nBut how to find such a set.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain of the highest (n -k) nodes, but that's not necessarily the case because the tree structure may not allow that.\n\nAlternatively, the subtree is formed by choosing a root, and then including all possible descendants, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the subtree of size m = n -k, and among all possible such subtrees, the one with the maximum sum of 2^i. So, for each possible subtree of size m, compute the sum, and pick the maximum.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, enumerating all possible subtrees is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the optimal subtree.\n\nThe sum of 2^i is maximized when the subtree includes as many high i's as possible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal subtree will include all the highest possible nodes in a connected component.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree that includes all the nodes in a certain range, say, from x to n, and x is chosen such that the subtree includes as much of the higher nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: the subtree must form a connected component. So, the subtree must consist of a set of nodes where every node is reachable from a central node.\n\nSo, the optimal subtree will have the central node as small as possible, so that as many higher nodes as possible can be included.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in the tree except for the k smallest ones. But that's not correct because the remaining nodes may not form a connected component.\n\nFor example, if you remove the first k nodes, the remaining might be scattered.\n\nSo, that approach won't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding a centroid in a tree. A centroid is a node where all its subtrees have size <= n/2. Maybe that's a direction.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all nodes except the k smallest ones. But again, the remaining nodes must be connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal way to connect the remaining nodes is to have them form a connected subtree. So, the problem reduces to finding a subtree of size m = n -k, with maximum sum.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes all the highest (n -k) nodes, but it's connected.\n\nWait, in the sample input, n=6, k=3. So m=3. The highest 3 nodes are 5,6,2? No, wait, 2 is smaller than 5 and 6.\n\nWait, wait, the highest node is 6, then 5, then 2, etc.\n\nSo, the highest 3 nodes are 6,5,2.\n\nBut in the sample solution, the remaining nodes are 2,5,6, which form a connected component. So that's indeed the case.\n\nSo, the optimal subtree includes the three highest nodes, but 2 is their parent.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach is to find a node u, and include all the nodes in the subtree of u that are >= u.\n\nWait, but how to choose u.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes as many high nodes as possible, starting from some u, and including all its descendants.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain of the highest possible nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a node u, and include all nodes in the subtree of u that are >= u, and the size of this subtree is m = n -k.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to model the problem as selecting a subtree that forms a connected component, and within that, the nodes have the highest possible values.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. Sort all the nodes in decreasing order of their value (since higher i contributes more to the sum).\n\n2. Find the earliest point in this sorted list where the subtree including these nodes is connected.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the process of building the subtree. We want to include as many high nodes as possible, but they must form a connected component.\n\nSo, the strategy is to include all the highest possible nodes, and make sure that they are connected.\n\nHow can we ensure that?\n\nWe can start from the highest node and see how far down we can include nodes in such a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nStart with the highest node, say h.\n\nThen, include all nodes in its subtree that are >= h, but only if including them doesn't require including any nodes below h that are not needed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest (n -k) nodes, but this may not always be possible due to the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find a node u such that the number of nodes in the subtree of u (including u) is m = n -k, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut how to find such u.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to precompute for each node u the size of its subtree. Then, for each node u, if the size is m, we can consider u as the root of the subtree.\n\nBut even then, we need to find the u with the maximum sum of 2^i in the subtree.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a post-order traversal, computing for each node u the sum of 2^u plus the sum of its children's subtrees.\n\nBut that seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Build the tree structure.\n\n2. For each node u, compute the sum of 2^u plus the sum of the sums of its children's subtrees.\n\n3. For each node u, if the size of the subtree rooted at u is exactly m = n -k, then the sum is the sum computed in step 2.\n\n4. Among all such u, choose the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut wait, the subtree rooted at u may have a size greater than m. So, perhaps we need to find all subtrees of size m, and among them, the one with maximum sum.\n\nBut for each node, we can compute the sum of its subtree. If the subtree size is m, we can consider it as a candidate.\n\nBut wait, the size of the subtree is the number of nodes, not the sum. So, we need to track both.\n\nSo, during the traversal, for each node, we can track the sum and the size of its subtree.\n\nOnce we have for each node, the sum and the size, we can look for all nodes where the size is m, and then select the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut what if multiple nodes have a subtree size of m? We choose the one with the highest sum.\n\nBut how do I compute the sum and size for each subtree.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read the tree, build an adjacency list.\n\n- Perform a post-order traversal to compute for each node u:\n\n   sum_u = 2^u + sum of sum_v for each child v.\n\n   size_u = 1 + sum of size_v for each child v.\n\n- For each node u, if size_u == m, then sum_u is a candidate for the maximum.\n\n- The node(s) with the maximum sum_u will form the subtree.\n\n- The nodes to remove are all the nodes not in this subtree.\n\nBut wait, how do I collect all the nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nWait, because the subtree is rooted at u, and includes all descendants in the subtree.\n\nSo, for each node, we can mark whether it's in the subtree of u.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, storing a boolean array for each possible u is not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps during the traversal, we can record for each node u, the list of nodes in its subtree.\n\nBut that's not practical either.\n\nAlternative approach: once we find the node u with the maximum sum among those with size m, the subtree of u is the desired subtree.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nWait, suppose there are two nodes u and v, both with size m, and u's subtree sum is higher than v's. Then, u's subtree is the one to choose.\n\nBut what if u's subtree is not the only possible one. Are there other subtrees of size m with a higher sum?\n\nWell, perhaps, but it's unlikely because the sum increases with higher nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the node u that contributes to the maximum sum is the one whose subtree is the one that includes as many high nodes as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- Compute for each node u, the sum and size of its subtree.\n\n- Find all u where size_u == m.\n\n- Among these, select the one with the maximum sum.\n\n- The nodes to remove are all nodes not in the subtree of u.\n\nBut how to collect the nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtree is a single path, and the nodes in it are the ones that are part of the subtree of u.\n\nWait, but how to represent that.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another observation: the subtree we want is the one that is a connected component and has the maximum sum of 2^i. So, the subtree must include all the nodes that are in the path between the highest node and some root.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is the subtree of u, where u is the root of a chain of nodes, each higher than the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a straight line from some node to the root, but that depends on the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a star, centered at a certain node, and includes all higher nodes in its subtree.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose we decide to remove the k smallest nodes. Then, the remaining nodes form a subtree. But this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nWait, for example, if the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4-...-n. Then, the optimal is to remove the first k nodes, leaving the last (n -k) nodes. Their sum is 2^{n} + ... + 2^{n -k +1}, which is the maximum possible.\n\nBut in a general tree, it's not that simple.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes all nodes from x to n, where x is as small as possible such that the subtree is connected.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the smallest possible x such that the subtree from x to n is connected.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes that are in the paths from some node u to the root.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the union of all the paths from u to the root, for some u.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that is the minimal subtree containing all the nodes except the k smallest ones. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem can be seen as selecting a subtree of size m = n -k. Within this subtree, we want the sum of 2^i to be maximum.\n\nSince 2^i is an increasing function, the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many high i's as possible.\n\nThus, the subtree must consist of a set of nodes that are connected and have the highest possible i's.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a subtree where all the nodes are as high as possible, and form a connected component.\n\nHow to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for each node, we can compute the maximum number of nodes in its subtree that can be kept, and the maximum sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain where the nodes are in decreasing order.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Find the longest possible path in the tree where the nodes are in decreasing order, and the length is m = n -k.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to find a node u, such that the subtree rooted at u has exactly m nodes, and the sum of 2^i in the subtree is maximum.\n\nThen, the nodes to remove are all nodes not in this subtree.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Compute for each node u, the sum and size of its subtree.\n\n- Find all u where size_u = m.\n\n- Among these, select the u with the maximum sum.\n\n- Collect all nodes in the subtree of u.\n\n- These nodes form the remaining contestants.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\na) Build the tree.\n\nb) For each node, compute sum_subtree[u] and size_subtree[u].\n\nc) Find all u where size_subtree[u] == m.\n\nd) Among these, select the u with the maximum sum_subtree[u].\n\ne) Collect all nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nf) Output the nodes not in this subtree, sorted.\n\nBut the challenge is, how to collect all the nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nWait, perhaps during the traversal, for each node u, we can record the in-time and out-time using a DFS, so that the subtree of u can be represented as a contiguous range in the in-time ordering.\n\nThat's a common technique in tree problems.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Build the tree.\n\n2. Perform a DFS to compute:\n\n   a) in-time and out-time for each node, representing the interval [in[u], out[u]] where the subtree of u is covered.\n\n   b) sum_subtree[u] and size_subtree[u].\n\n3. For each node u, if size_subtree[u] == m, consider it as a candidate.\n\n4. Among all such candidates, select the one with the maximum sum_subtree[u].\n\n5. The selected u's subtree is the one to keep.\n\n6. The nodes to remove are all nodes not in u's subtree.\n\n7. Collect those nodes, sort them, and output.\n\nYes, that seems feasible.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nLet's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, reading the input.\n\nn and k are given.\n\nThen, n-1 edges.\n\nWe can represent the tree as an adjacency list. Since the tree is undirected, each edge is added twice.\n\nThen, perform a post-order traversal to compute the sum_subtree and size_subtree for each node.\n\nWait, but the traversal can be done in a recursive manner, but for n up to 1e6, recursion depth can cause stack overflows.\n\nThus, an iterative post-order traversal is better.\n\nAlternatively, a standard DFS with a stack, tracking visited nodes.\n\nWait, but for a tree with 1e6 nodes, a recursive approach would hit the recursion limit, so an iterative approach is necessary.\n\nSo, implement an iterative DFS.\n\nDuring the traversal, for each node u:\n\nsum_subtree[u] = 2^u + sum of sum_subtree of children.\n\nsize_subtree[u] = 1 + sum of size_subtree of children.\n\nWait, but 2^u can be very large, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nOnce sum_subtree and size_subtree are computed, we can proceed.\n\nThen, compute the in-time and out-time for each node via a DFS, to represent the subtree as a range.\n\nOnce that's done, for each u, if size_subtree[u] == m (m = n -k), we can note the sum_subtree[u], and keep track of the maximum sum.\n\nOnce the maximum sum is found, we collect all nodes u where size_subtree[u] == m and sum_subtree[u] == max_sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps multiple u's can have the same size and sum. In that case, any of them can be chosen, as their subtree will contain the same nodes.\n\nWait, no, because the subtree can vary depending on u. Wait, no, if two different u's have the same sum and size, but different subtrees, then we need to choose the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut in reality, the sum is unique for the subtree.

But in that case, which one to choose?\n\nBut perhaps, the way the traversal is done, the in-time and out-time ensure that each subtree is uniquely identified.\n\nBut regardless, the process is:\n\n- For each u where size_subtree[u] == m, collect the sum_subtree[u].\n\n- Find the maximum sum among these.\n\n- Then, among all u with size_subtree[u] == m and sum_subtree[u] == max_sum, collect their in-time ranges.\n\nWait, perhaps the in-time range is a unique identifier for the subtree.\n\nBut in practice, for our problem, it's sufficient to collect all nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nSo, the next step is to collect all nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nWhich can be done by iterating through all nodes and checking if in[u] >= in[u_selected] and out[u] <= out[u_selected].\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, but n is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nCompute m = n -k.\n\nBuild the tree.\n\nCompute sum_subtree and size_subtree for each node.\n\nCompute in-time and out-time for each node.\n\nCollect all u where size_subtree[u] == m.\n\nAmong these, find the u with maximum sum_subtree[u].\n\nCollect all nodes in the subtree of u.\n\nThese nodes are the ones to keep.\n\nThe nodes to remove are all others.\n\nSort them, print.\n\nBut wait, the nodes to remove are the ones not in the subtree of u.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be something like:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nedges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    edges[a].append(b)\n\n    edges[b].append(a)\n\nsum_subtree = [0]*(n+1)\n\nsize_subtree = [0]*(n+1)\n\nin_time = [0]*(n+1)\n\nout_time = [0]*(n+1)\n\ntime = 0\n\nstack = []\n\nvisited = [False]*(n+1)\n\nstack.append( (1, False) )\n\nparent = [0]*(n+1)\n\nwhile stack:\n\n    u, processed = stack.pop()\n\n    if processed:\n\n        # Process the node after children are processed\n\n        sum_subtree[u] = (1 << u)  # 2^u\n\n        size_subtree[u] = 1\n\n        for v in edges[u]:\n\n            if v != parent[u]:\n\n                sum_subtree[u] += sum_subtree[v]\n\n                size_subtree[u] += size_subtree[v]\n\n                parent[v] = u\n\n                # Update in and out times\n\n                in_time[u] = time\n\n                out_time[u] = time\n\n                time += 1\n\n        # Now, set the in and out times for u\n\n        # Wait, no.

Each district's number of fans is given by \\(2^i\\) where \\(i\\) is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: To maximize the total number of fans, we need to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring they form a connected component.\n3. **Subtree Selection**: The optimal subtree will be the one that includes the highest possible nodes and forms a connected component. We compute the sum of fans for each possible subtree rooted at each node.\n4. **DFS Traversal**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute the size and sum of fans for each subtree. Track in-time and out-time to represent the range of nodes in each subtree.\n5. **Identify Candidates**: For each node, check if its subtree size matches the required size (n - k). Among these candidates, select the one with the maximum sum of fans.\n6. **Collect Results**: Determine which nodes are not part of the selected subtree and output them as the districts to be removed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    m = n - k\n\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n\n    in_time = [0] * (n + 1)\n    out_time = [0] * (n + 1)\n    sum_subtree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    size_subtree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    time = 0\n\n    stack = [(1, False)]\n    while stack:\n        u, processed = stack.pop()\n        if not processed:\n            in_time[u] = time\n            time += 1\n            stack.append((u, True))\n            for v in reversed(edges[u]):\n                if v != parent[u]:\n                    parent[v] = u\n                    stack.append((v, False))\n        else:\n            out_time[u] = time - 1\n            sum_subtree[u] = (1 << u)\n            size_subtree[u] = 1\n            for v in edges[u]:\n                if v != parent[u]:\n                    sum_subtree[u] += sum_subtree[v]\n                    size_subtree[u] += size_subtree[v]\n\n    candidates = []\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        if size_subtree[u] == m:\n            candidates.append(u)\n\n    max_sum = -1\n    best_u = None\n    for u in candidates:\n        if sum_subtree[u] > max_sum:\n            max_sum = sum_subtree[u]\n            best_u = u\n\n    removed = []\n    for node in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not (in_time[node] >= in_time[best_u] and out_time[node] <= out_time[best_u]):\n            removed.append(node)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, removed)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts and the number of contestants to remove.
