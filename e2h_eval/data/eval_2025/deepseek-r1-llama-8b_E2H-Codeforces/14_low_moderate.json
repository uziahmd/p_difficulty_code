He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and the list of those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher multiples contribute more. So, the formula for trailing zeros is sum(n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...) until the division is zero.\n\nSo, my first task is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But since each n increases the count by some amount, there might be a range of n's that all give the same m. For example, when m=5, the example shows that n can be 5,6,7,8,9. So, the next number after 9 would be 10, which adds another zero, so 10! has 6 trailing zeros.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the example says m is 5, and the output includes 5,6,7,8,9. Let me check:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 2?\nWait, wait no. Let me calculate correctly. Oh wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me compute the trailing zeros correctly.\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in n! is calculated as:\n\ncount = 0\nwhile n >=5:\n    n = n //5\n    count +=n\n\nSo for 5: 5//5=1, count=1.\nFor 6: 6//5=1, same count.\nSame for 7,8,9: all contribute 1 each.\nBut 10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0. So total 2.\n\nWait, but according to the example, when m=1, the output is 5, and when m=5, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So perhaps for m=5, the numbers are 5 through 9, because their counts are 5//5 + ... ?\n\nWait, no, let's calculate for n=5: 5/5=1, 5/25=0 → total 1 zero.\n\nWait, but then in the example, when m is 5, it's looking for n where the count is 5? Or wait, wait, the example input is '1' and '5'—does that mean two test cases?\n\nWait the sample input is ['1', '5'], and the output is two lines. The first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', meaning for m=1, the answer is 5. For m=5, the answer is 5 numbers: 5-9 inclusive.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because 5! has 1 zero, not 5. So perhaps I misunderstood the sample.\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is two lines, each being a separate m. So for m=1, the output is 5, and for m=5, the output is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). So let me check the counts again.\n\nWait, for n=5: trailing zeros are 1.\nn=6: same, 1.\nn=7: same, 1.\nn=8: same, 1.\nn=9: same, 1.\nn=10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0 → 2 zeros.\n\nWait, so for m=1, only n=5 satisfies. For m=2, n can be 6,7,8,9,10. Because 6! has 2 zeros (6//5=1, 6//25=0), but wait no, 6//5 is 1, so count is 1.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the function that calculates the number of trailing zeros is different. Let me re-calculate.\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in n! is the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for n=5: 5/5=1, 5/25=0 → sum is 1.\nn=6: same as 5, sum is 1.\nn=9: same, sum is 1.\nn=10: 10/5=2, 10/25=0 → sum is 2.\nn=15: 15/5=3, 15/25",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the count of factors of 10 in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Factors of 5**: For a given \\( n \\), the number of trailing zeros can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until \\( \\frac{n}{5^k} \\) becomes zero.\n\n3. **Finding Range for \\( n \\)**: For each \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest and largest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\). This range will include all consecutive integers starting from the smallest \\( n \\) up to the largest \\( n \\) that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using binary search, we can efficiently find the lower and upper bounds of \\( n \\) for a given \\( m \\). This ensures that our solution is both optimal and handles large values of \\( m \\) efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_ns(m):\n    low = 5\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, might need to increase\n    \n    while True:\n        current = count_trailing_zeros(high)\n        if current < m:\n            high *= 2\n        else:\n            break\n    # Binary search between low and high\n    left, right = low, high\n    result = []\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt == m:\n            result.append(mid)\n            left = mid + 1\n        elif cnt < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n            \n    return sorted(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m_list = list(map(int, input))\n    for m in m_list:\n        ns = find_ns(m)\n        print(len(ns))\n        if len(ns) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **find_ns Function**: This function uses binary search to efficiently determine the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. It starts with an initial estimate and adjusts the search range based on whether the count is less than or greater than \\( m \\).\n\n3. **main Function**: This reads input, processes each \\( m \\) value, and prints the results. For each \\( m \\), it calls `find_ns` to get the list of valid \\( n \\) values and prints the count followed by the values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the required \\( n \\) values even for large inputs, leveraging binary search for optimal performance.",
