He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I need to output how many such numbers there are and list them in order.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and higher multiples contribute more. So, the formula for trailing zeros is sum(n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...) until the division is zero.\n\nSo, my task is to find all n's where this sum equals m. But wait, it's possible that multiple consecutive n's give the same count. For example, after 5!, which gives 1 zero, 6! also gives 1, but 7! still gives 1 as well. So there might be a range of n's that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe approach would be to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros are equal to m, and then check if the next numbers also give the same count. The question is, how far can this go?\n\nI think the idea is to use binary search to find the starting point. Because the trailing zero count increases as n increases, but not strictly; it sometimes jumps by more than one. So, for a given m, there might be a range of n's where the count is m.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for each m, the set of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros could consist of either a single number or a range of consecutive numbers. Like, for m=5, 25! has more than 5 zeros. Wait, maybe I should think about how the count changes with each increment of n.\n\nLet me think: when you increase n by 1, the count increases by the number of times 5 divides into (n+1). So for example, if n+1 is 25, you add 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So, the count can increase by 0, 1, 2, etc., depending on the factors of 5 in n+1.\n\nThis means that for some m, there are multiple consecutive n's that result in the same count. So, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count equals m.\n\nHow do I find these n's efficiently?\n\nI think the steps are:\n\n1. For a given m, find the lower bound where the count is >= m.\n2. Then, check consecutive numbers above that lower bound to see how many also give exactly m.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the lower bound? Using binary search makes sense because the function (number of trailing zeros) is monotonic.\n\nSo, first, I'll write a helper function that, given n, returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, perform a binary search between low=0 and high=some upper limit (like 5*m or something) to find the smallest n where the count is >=m. Let's call this n_min.\n\nOnce I have n_min, I need to check if the count at n_min is exactly m. If it's greater, then there are no solutions.\n\nIf it's equal, then I need to find the largest n_max where the count is still m. How?\n\nWell, since the count increases as n increases, once the count exceeds m, we can stop looking. So, starting from n_min, I can keep checking n_min, n_min+1, etc., until the count becomes m+1. All n's from n_min up to the last one where count is m are part of the solution.\n\nWait, but that might be inefficient if m is large. So perhaps another binary search is needed for the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, for the upper bound, we can find the maximum n where the count is m.\n\nWait, let's think: the function f(n) = trailing zeros is non-decreasing. So, for m, the possible n's form a contiguous range [a, b], where a is the smallest n with f(n)=m and b is the largest n with f(n)=m.\n\nSo, once I find a, I can find b by finding the smallest n where f(n) > m, then subtract 1.\n\nYes, that's a better approach.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Implement the helper function count_trailing_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n2. Use binary search to find the minimal n where count >= m. Let's call this a.\n\n3. Check if count(a) != m: if so, output 0.\n\n4. Else, find the maximal b where count(b) = m. This can be done by finding the first n where count(n) > m, then set b = n-1.\n\n5. The numbers from a to b inclusive are the solutions. So the count is b - a + 1, and the list is a, a+1, ..., b.\n\nWait, but what if a is 0? Or maybe not, because n starts from 1.\n\nWait, the problem says positive integers, so n starts from 1.\n\nSo, let's adjust step 2 accordingly. We can't have n=0, so our lower bound for binary search should be 1, but perhaps the function will handle it.\n\nNow, for the binary search:\n\nInitialize low = 0 (but n must be positive), high = something like 5*m (since 5*m is an upper estimate for the maximum n that could give m zeros). But perhaps higher is better, but for efficiency, maybe 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. Let me see: the number of trailing zeros in (5e5)! is much larger than 1e5. Hmm, perhaps a higher initial high is needed. Maybe high can be 5e5 for m=1e5, but perhaps that's not enough.\n\nWait, for example, for m=1e5, the minimal n is probably around 5e5 or less? Not sure. Alternatively, we can compute an upper bound based on the count function.\n\nAlternatively, use a high that's sufficiently large. Since each time you multiply by 5, the count increases by 1. So for m, the maximum possible n is 5*m. Because 5*m! has at least m/5 + m/25 + ... which is roughly m /4, which may not be enough. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\nFor example, for n=5, it's 1.\n\nn=25: 6.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=1e5, the minimal n is about 5e5. But maybe 5e5 is enough as the upper bound.\n\nWait, let's test for m=1e5. The minimal n is somewhere. Let's see: 5e5 /5=1e5, but then 5e5/25=2e4, adding up to 12e4, which is way beyond 1e5. So perhaps my initial high isn't sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute an upper bound for the binary search.\n\nWait, the function f(n) is increasing, but not strictly. So for any n, f(n+1) >= f(n). So, for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where f(n) >= m, and the maximal n is the largest where f(n) <= m.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.\n\nImplementing the helper function:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, for binary search to find the minimal a where count >= m.\n\nWait, but what if m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\nSo, the binary search will be in the range [low, high]. Low can be 0, high can be something like 5e5, but perhaps higher.\n\nWait, but for m=1, the minimal a is 5.\n\nWait, let's see: for n=5, count is 1. So for m=1, a=5. So 5,6,7,8,9 all have count 1.\n\nWait, no. 5! is 120: 1 zero. 6! is 720: 1. 7! is 5040: 1. 8! is 40320: 1. 9! is 362880: 1. 10! is 3628800: 2. So for m=1, the a is 5, and the b is 9. So the count is 5,6,7,8,9: 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the binary search would find a=5 as the minimal n where count >=1. Then, find the maximum n where count <=1. That would be 9, since 10 gives 2.\n\nSo, the plan is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Binary search for a, the smallest n where count >= m.\n\n- Check if count(a) is exactly m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find b as the largest n where count(b) == m.\n\nHow to find b? One approach is to start from a and increment until count exceeds m, then set b to the previous n.\n\nBut for large m, this could take a long time. So, perhaps a binary search is more efficient.\n\nWait, yes. Because the function f(n) is non-decreasing, once you find a, the next step is to find the maximum n where f(n) = m.\n\nSo, we can perform another binary search between a and some high value, say, 5e5, to find the first n where f(n) > m. Then, the maximum n with f(n)=m is n-1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Read m.\n\n2. Find a via binary search, the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\n3. Check if f(a) != m: if so, output 0.\n\n4. Else, find b via binary search, the minimal n where f(n) > m. Then, b = n-1.\n\n5. The numbers from a to b are the solutions.\n\n6. Output the count (b - a + 1) followed by the numbers.\n\nWait, but what if a is 0? No, because m is at least 1, so a must be at least 5.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: for m=1, a is 5. For m=0, but m starts from 1.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute a via binary search.\n\nIf a's count is not m, output 0.\n\nElse, find b as the first n where count > m. So, b = n-1.\n\nThe numbers are a, a+1, ..., b.\n\nSo, for example, when m=5, what happens?\n\nLet me see:\n\nn=24: 24//5=4, 24//25=0. Total 4.\n\nn=25: 5 + 1 =6.\n\nWait, so for m=5, does any n give 5 trailing zeros?\n\nWait, let's compute for n=24: 4 zeros. n=25:6. So there's no n where f(n)=5. So the output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample input where '5' is one of the inputs, and the output is 0.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle this.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nLooking for a, the minimal n where f(n)>=5.\n\nf(24)=4, f(25)=6. So a is 25. But f(25)=6>5, so output 0.\n\nThus, the code would correctly output 0.\n\nSo, the code needs to implement this.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the binary search.\n\nImplementing a binary search for a:\n\nWe can have low = 0, high = some upper bound.\n\nBut since n can be up to 5e5 for m=1e5, perhaps setting high initially to 5e5 is enough, but for larger m, perhaps higher is needed.\n\nWait, but 5e5 is 500,000. For m=1e5, the minimal n is around 5e5. Let's see: f(5e5) is 5e5 /5 = 1e5, plus 5e5 /25 = 2e4, 5e5/125=4e3, 5e5/625=800, 5e5/3125=160, 5e5/15625=32, 5e5/78125=6. So total is 1e5 + 2e4 +4e3 +800 +160 +32 +6 = 124,998. Which is more than 1e5. So for m=1e5, a is less than 5e5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute a better upper bound.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, setting high to 5e5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, in the binary search for a:\n\nlow = 0, high = 5e5.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the correct a is 199,999? Or perhaps I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the initial high is too low. So perhaps a better approach is to compute a dynamic upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a higher initial high, like 1e6.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps 5e5 is sufficient.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search for a:\n\ndef find_a(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    a = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt < m:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            a = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    if a is None:\n\n        # didn't find anything, but m=0 is not allowed\n\n        return None\n\n    return a\n\nWait, but in this case, for m=1, the function would find a=5.\n\nSimilarly, for m=5, the function would find a=25, since f(25)=6 >=5.\n\nThen, in the code, we check if f(a) is m. If a is 25, and m=5, f(25) is 6, which is >5. So we output 0.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nSimilarly, for m=6, a is 25. f(25)=6, so we proceed to find b.\n\nTo find b, we perform another binary search for the first n where f(n)>6. Let's see:\n\nf(25)=6, f(26)=6, f(27)=6, f(28)=6, f(29)=6, f(30)=7.\n\nSo, the first n where f(n) >6 is 30. So b is 29.\n\nThus, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nSo, now the code structure is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute a via binary search.\n\nIf f(a)!=m, print 0.\n\nElse, compute b via binary search, which is the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nSet b = n-1.\n\nThe numbers are from a to b, inclusive.\n\nSo, the output is (b -a +1) followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for the binary search functions.\n\nLet me write the helper function.\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n >0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the binary search for a.\n\ndef find_a(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m  # initial guess, may need to increase\n\n    a = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt < m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            a = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    if a is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    return a\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct.\n\nWhat about for m=100000?\n\nWait, 5*100000=500000, but as we saw earlier, f(500000) is 124,998, which is more than 1e5. So the function will find a lower a.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the correct a is around 199,999.\n\nBecause f(199999) is 1e5 + 199999//25 + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute f(200000).\n\nf(200000) = 200000/5=40000, 200000/25=8000, 200000/125=1600, 200000/625=320, 200000/3125=64, 200000/15625=12.8=>12, 200000/78125=2.56=>2, 200000/390625=0.\n\nAdding: 40000 + 8000 =48000; +1600=19600; +320=19920; +64=19984; +12=19996; +2=19998.\n\nSo, 19998, which is less than 1e5.\n\nWait, no, 19998 is way less than 1e5. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, 200000 /5 is 40,000.\n\n40,000 + 200000//25=8000: total 48,000.\n\n+ 200000//125=1600: 49,600.\n\n+200000//625=320: 49,920.\n\n+200000//3125=64: 49,984.\n\n+200000//15625=12: 49,996.\n\n+200000//78125=2: 49,998.\n\nSo, total is 49,998.\n\nWhich is less than 1e5 (100,000). So for m=1e5, a is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute f(250000):\n\n250000//5=50,000.\n\n250000//25=10,000 → total 60,000.\n\n250000//125=2000 → 62,000.\n\n250000//625=400 → 62,400.\n\n250000//3125=80 → 62,480.\n\n250000//15625=16 → 62,496.\n\n250000//78125=3 → 62,499.\n\nSo, f(250000) is 62,499, which is more than 1e5.\n\nThus, a is somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better upper bound is needed for the binary search.\n\nBut for the purposes of the code, perhaps setting high to 5e5 is sufficient.\n\nWait, 5e5 is 500,000.\n\nf(500000) is:\n\n500000 /5 =100,000.\n\n500000/25=20,000 → 120,000.\n\n500000/125=4,000 →124,000.\n\n500000/625=800 →124,800.\n\n500000/3125=160 →124,960.\n\n500000/15625=32 →124,992.\n\n500000/78125=6 →124,998.\n\n500000/390625=1 →124,999.\n\nSo, f(500000)=124,999.\n\nWhich is less than 1e5? No, it's 124,999, which is more than 1e5.\n\nWait, 124,999 is 124 thousand, which is less than 1e5? No, 1e5 is 100,000.\n\nWait, wait, 1e5 is 100,000. So 124,999 is larger than 1e5.\n\nSo, for m=1e5, a is the minimal n where f(n)>=1e5.\n\nSo, binary search between 0 and 5e5 will find a.\n\nBut for m=1e5, the a is 199999.\n\nWait, let's compute f(199999):\n\n199999 //5=39999.\n\n199999//25=7999 →39999+7999=47998.\n\n199999//125=1599 →47998+1599=49597.\n\n199999//625=319 →49597+319=49816.\n\n199999//3125=63 →49816+63=49879.\n\n199999//15625=12 →49879+12=49891.\n\n199999//78125=2 →49891+2=49893.\n\nTotal is 49,893, which is less than 1e5.\n\nSo, a must be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that 1e5 is 100,000. So, for m=1e5, the required a is somewhere higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute for n=250,000: as before, f(250,000)=62,499.\n\nStill less than 1e5.\n\nn=300,000:\n\n300,000//5=60,000.\n\n300,000//25=12,000 →72,000.\n\n300,000//125=2,400 →74,400.\n\n300,000//625=480 →74,880.\n\n300,000//3125=96 →74,976.\n\n300,000//15625=19 →74,995.\n\n300,000//78125=3 →74,998.\n\nSo, f(300,000)=74,998, which is more than 1e5.\n\nSo, a is between 250,000 and 300,000.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a higher initial high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set high to 5e5, which is 500,000, as before.\n\nBut in any case, the binary search should find a.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nCompute a = find_a(m).\n\nIf a is None or count_trailing_zeros(a)!=m, output 0.\n\nElse, find b via another binary search.\n\nImplementing find_b(m) which returns the minimal n where f(n) >m.\n\ndef find_b(m):\n\n    low = a\n\n    high = 5e5  # arbitrary high value\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cnt > m:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but this function returns the minimal n where f(n) >m.\n\nSo, the maximum n where f(n)==m is high.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think:\n\nWe are searching for the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nOnce found, the maximum n where f(n)==m is n-1.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample where m=5, a=25, f(25)=6>5, so the function returns 25.\n\nThen, b=25-1=24.\n\nBut f(24)=4<5, so the numbers from a=25 onwards don't include 24. Thus, the solution is empty.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter computing a, if f(a)!=m, output 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where f(n) >m. Then, b =n-1.\n\nSo, the numbers from a to b are the solutions.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute a = find_a(m).\n\nif f(a)!=m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute b = find_first_greater(m)\n\n    b -=1\n\n    if b <a:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        count = b -a +1\n\n        print(count)\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b+1))))\n\nWait, but wait. What if a is 5, and b is 4, which is impossible. Because a is the minimal n where f(n)>=m, and f(a) is m. So, in that case, the only n is a, and b would be a.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, for m=1, a is 5, and find_first_greater(1) returns 10, because f(10)=2>1. So, b=9.\n\nThus, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo, in code, the logic is:\n\nif f(a) !=m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n    find the minimal n where f(n)>m. Let's call it n_first_greater.\n\n    b = n_first_greater -1.\n\n    if b <a: which can't happen since a is the minimal n where f(n)>=m, and f(a)=m.\n\n    So, the numbers are a, a+1, ..., b.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for big numbers, the binary search may have issues with performance. But given that m can be up to 1e5, and each step of the binary search is O(log(5e5)) which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, read m.\n\nThen, compute a.\n\nIf a is None or f(a)!=m: print 0.\n\nElse, compute n_first_greater.\n\nBut wait, for find_b, perhaps it's better to write a separate function.\n\nAlternatively, just compute it inline.\n\nAlternatively, implement a helper function.\n\nSo, here's the code:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_a(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    a = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            a = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n    return a\n\ndef find_max_b(m, a):\n    low = a\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\na = find_min_a(m)\nif a is None or count_trailing_zeros(a) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    b = find_max_b(m, a)\n    if b < a:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = b - a + 1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b+1))) + '\\n')\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when m=1, a is 5, and find_max_b returns 10, so b=9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nfind_min_a returns 25, which has count 6>5.\n\nSo, a is 25, but count(a) is 6 !=5. So, output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nfind_min_a returns 25, count=6==m.\n\nfind_max_b finds the first n where count>6, which is 30. So, b=29.\n\nSo, the numbers are 25-29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code should output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, when m is given as input, the code reads it as an integer.\n\nIn the sample input, the input is ['1', '5'], but in the code, m is read as an integer. So, in the code, m is correctly read as 1 and 5.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input is a single line containing m as an integer.\n\nSo, in the code, reading m = int(input()) is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTesting it.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\nSample Output:\n\n5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, the code would compute a=5, then find_max_b(1,5)=10, so b=9.\n\nThus, output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother Sample Input:\n\n5\n\nOutput: 0.\n\nWhich the code correctly outputs.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nThe numbers are 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nn=5: 1 zero.\n\nn=6:1.\n\nn=7:1.\n\nn=8:1.\n\nn=9:1.\n\nn=10:2.\n\nSo, for m=2, a=10.\n\nfind_max_b(2,10) looks for the first n where count>2.\n\ncount(10)=2, count(11)=2, count(12)=2, ..., count(14)=2, count(15)=3.\n\nSo, find_max_b returns 15, b=14.\n\nThus, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14: 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in \\( n! \\), the number of trailing zeros is effectively determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., until the division result is zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: \n   - **Lower Bound (a)**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (b)**: Use another binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\). This is done by finding the first \\( n \\) where the trailing zeros exceed \\( m \\) and then adjusting the upper bound accordingly.\n\n4. **Result Compilation**: After determining the bounds, if valid, compile the list of integers between the lower and upper bounds inclusive, which all have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros in their factorials.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_a(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate for upper bound\n    a = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            a = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n    return a\n\ndef find_max_b(m, a):\n    low = a\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate for upper bound\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\na = find_min_a(m)\nif a is None or count_trailing_zeros(a) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    b = find_max_b(m, a)\n    if b < a:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = b - a + 1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(a, b + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by 5 and summing the quotients.\n- **find_min_a(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **find_max_b(m, a)**: This function finds the largest integer \\( b \\) such that \\( b! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros by searching for the first integer where the trailing zeros exceed \\( m \\).\n\nThe main logic reads the input \\( m \\), checks if it's possible to find such integers using the helper functions, and prints the results accordingly. This approach ensures efficiency even for large values of \\( m \\) by leveraging binary search to quickly narrow down the possible values of \\( n \\).",
