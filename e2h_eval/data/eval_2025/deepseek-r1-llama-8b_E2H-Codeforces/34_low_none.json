And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Hmm.\n\nSo, the input consists of two integers n and k. Then a sequence of n integers representing the sleep times for each day. We need to find the average of the sums of each consecutive k-day window, right?\n\nWait, let me think. For example, if n=3 and k=2, then there are 3-2+1 = 2 weeks. The weeks would be [a1,a2], [a2,a3]. So the sum for each week is a1+a2 and a2+a3. Then the average is (sum1 + sum2)/2.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute the sum of each window of size k, add all these sums together, then divide by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n\nBut wait, what about when n is large? Like up to 2e5. Oh right, because in that case, we can't compute each window naively by sliding a for loop, as that would be O(nk) time, which could be up to 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all k-length windows.\n\nI remember there's a method using prefix sums. Let me recall how that works.\n\nThe prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing. So maybe we can use that here.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n2. For each window starting at i (0-based), the window spans from i to i + k -1. The sum for this window is the prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n3. Sum all these window sums and divide by the number of windows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. And computing the prefix sum is straightforward.\n\nSo, first, I'll read the input. Let's see: the first line is n and k. The second line is n numbers.\n\nThen, I'll compute the prefix sum. Let's say we have a list called prefix where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], and so on until prefix[n] = sum of all a.\n\nWait, no, actually, the standard prefix sum is such that prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements of the array. So for a zero-based array a, prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nSo for a window starting at index i (in the original array, which is zero-based) and of length k, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nSo, for each i from 0 to (n - k), inclusive, the window starts at i and ends at i + k -1, so the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nWe need to iterate over all possible i's, compute each sum, add them all, then divide by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nThat sounds manageable. Now, considering that n can be up to 2e5, this approach is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the list of a's.\n- Compute the prefix sum array.\n- Iterate through each window, compute sum for each, accumulate the total.\n- Compute average by dividing total by (n -k +1).\n- Output the result with enough decimal precision.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, reading the input is straightforward. But since the second line can have up to 2e5 numbers, we need to read it efficiently. Using input().split() should work, but for very large inputs, sometimes using sys.stdin.readline is better. However, in practice, for code submission, it's probably okay.\n\nCompute the prefix sum. Let's create a list of length n+1, where prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1] for i >=1.\n\nOnce that's done, for each i in 0..(n-k), compute the sum as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i], add to total.\n\nThen, average = total / m, where m = n -k +1.\n\nNow, output the average with at least 6 decimal places.\n\nBut wait, the output requires that the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So, perhaps formatting the output to 10 decimal places would suffice, as in the examples.\n\nIn terms of data types, in Python, using floating",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of k days, and we need to find the average of these weekly sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of n integers representing daily sleep times. We need to find the average of the sums of each consecutive k-day window. The number of such windows is (n - k + 1).\n\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Calculating the sum of each window naively would be inefficient for large n. Instead, we use prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after an initial O(n) preprocessing step.\n\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the input array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray from index i to j in constant time using the formula `prefix[j] - prefix[i]`.\n\n4. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, iterate through each possible window of size k. For each window starting at index i, compute the sum using the prefix sum array and accumulate the total sum of all windows.\n\n5. **Compute Average**: Divide the total sum of all windows by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sum\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    total = 0\n    m = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(m):\n        end = i + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[i]\n    \n    average = total / m\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially for large inputs. The values of n and k are read first, followed by the sequence of sleep times.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i is the sum of the first i elements of the input array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each consecutive k-day window. For each window starting at index i, the sum is computed as `prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]`.\n\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all windows is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure accuracy within the required error margin.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired average in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
