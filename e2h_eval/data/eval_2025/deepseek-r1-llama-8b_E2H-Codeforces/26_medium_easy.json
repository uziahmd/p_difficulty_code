Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered such that x ≤ y ≤ z (due to the way the ranges are set up), the main condition we need to check is x + y > z.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Because in the problem statement, the order isn't explicitly stated beyond the ranges. Let me recheck: The problem says A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts from C. So, for example, x can be 2, y can be 3, z can be 4. So the ordering is x ≤ y ≤ z? Not necessarily. Because x could be 2, y could be 3, but z could be 5. So in that case, x ≤ y < z. So the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, if x ≤ y ≤ z, then the triangle condition is x + y > z. Because z is the largest side. So, yes, that's the only condition we need to check.\n\nSo the plan is: iterate over all possible x, y, z within the given ranges, count those triples where x <= y, y <= z, x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, the ranges can be up to 5e5, so a brute force approach is impossible. We need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's note that for each z, we can find the possible x and y that satisfy the conditions.\n\nSince x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from max(B, x) to min(C, D). Wait, no: y is at least B (since y >= B) and at most C. And z is at least C and at most D.\n\nSo for each z in [C, D], we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nand x ≤ y,\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nHmm. So for each z, we can compute the number of valid (x, y) pairs, and sum this over all z.\n\nBut even this might be too slow if not optimized, since D can be up to 5e5.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nFor a fixed z, what is the range of x and y?\n\nx can be from A to B.\n\ny can be from B to C.\n\nBut also, y must be >= x (since x <= y), and x + y > z.\n\nSo for each z, I need to calculate the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [max(x, B), C], and x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Because y is already >= B, but x can be less than B. So y is between B and C, and x is between A and B. But x can be less than y or equal.\n\nWait, but in the original condition, x can be as low as A, but y is at least B. So x can be less than B, but y is at least B. So x can be less than y or greater. Wait, no. Since x can be up to B, and y can be as low as B. So for x= B, y can be B or higher. For x less than B, say x = A where A < B, then y can be from B to C, which is higher than x. So in this case, y is always >= x.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose x is 2, and B is 3. Then y is from 3 to C. So y is always >= x. So in all cases, y >= x is automatically satisfied because y is in [B, C], and x is in [A, B]. So since A <= B <= C, y is at least B, which is >= x, regardless of x's value. So y >= x is always true.\n\nThat's a helpful observation. So for a given z, the x and y must satisfy:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\n\ny ∈ [B, C]\n\nx + y > z\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each z, count the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], and x + y > z.\n\nNow, the question is: How can we efficiently compute, for each z, the number of (x,y) pairs satisfying these conditions?\n\nLet's consider that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So for each x, y can range from max(B, something) to C, but since x can be as low as A, and y starts at B, which may be higher than x.\n\nSo for each z, we can model the condition as x + y > z.\n\nWe can think of x and y as two variables. Let's fix x and find the minimal y that satisfies x + y > z.\n\nGiven that y >= B, the minimal y is max(B, z - x + 1). But since y can't exceed C, the lower bound is max(B, z - x + 1) and upper bound is C.\n\nBut for y to exist, we need max(B, z -x +1) <= C. So for each x, the condition is z -x + 1 <= C.\n\nWhich simplifies to x >= z - C + 1.\n\nBut x is in [A, B], so for each x, whether there exists y depends on whether x >= z - C + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each z, find all x in [A,B] such that x > z - C, because then y can be at least B, and x + B > z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of ranges.\n\nSo, for a fixed z, the condition x + y > z can be rewritten as y > z -x.\n\nBut y is at least B, so y must be > max(z -x, B -1). Because y is an integer, so y >= max(z -x + 1, B).\n\nBut y can't exceed C. So for each x, the number of valid y's is max(0, C - max(B, z -x + 1) + 1).\n\nWait, because y can take values from max_val to C, inclusive. So the count is max(0, C - max_val + 1).\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], the count is:\n\nlow = max(B, z - x + 1)\n\nif low > C: no contribution.\n\nelse: count += (C - low + 1)\n\nSo the total for a particular z is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - max(B, z -x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive if done naively, as for each z, iterating through x from A to B could take O(B-A+1) time, which could be up to 5e5 per z, and with z being up to 5e5, that's 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of iterating z, perhaps find a mathematical expression that allows us to compute the sum for all z in [C, D] quickly.\n\nAnother thought: For each z, the sum can be split into two regions based on x. For example, when x is small enough that z -x +1 <= B, so y must be >= B. Otherwise, when x is larger, then y must be >= z -x +1.\n\nWait, let's think about for each x, the minimal y needed is max(B, z -x +1). So for a given x, if z -x +1 <= B, then y can start at B. Otherwise, y starts at z -x +1.\n\nBut z is fixed, so for each x, we can compute whether z -x +1 is above or below B.\n\nLet me rephrase: For a given z, the condition x + y > z can be expressed as y > z -x.\n\nBut since y >= B, we have y >= max(B, z -x + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound for y is L = max(B, z -x + 1).\n\nThe number of y's is max(0, C - L + 1) if L <= C; else 0.\n\nSo for each z, the total count is sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - max(B, z -x +1) +1).\n\nThis sum can be split into two parts:\n\nCase 1: z -x +1 <= B → max(B, ...) is B. So the number of y's is C - B + 1, provided that C >= B.\n\nOtherwise, if C < B, then no y's.\n\nCase 2: z -x +1 > B → then max is z -x +1. So the number of y's is max(0, C - (z -x +1) +1) = max(0, C - z + x -1 +1) = max(0, C - z +x).\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is either (C - B + 1) if x >= z - B +1, or (C - z + x) otherwise.\n\nWait, let's see: For case 1, when x >= z - B + 1, then z -x +1 <= B.\n\nBecause x >= z - B +1 → z -x +1 <= B.\n\nSo in case 1, the contribution is (C - B +1) if C >= B.\n\nElse, it's zero.\n\nIn case 2, when x < z - B +1 → z -x +1 > B.\n\nSo contribution is (C - (z -x +1) +1) = C - z + x.\n\nBut if C < z -x +1, then this is negative, so we add zero.\n\nSo for each z, the sum can be computed as:\n\nsum_x = sum_{x in [A, B]} [ if x >= (z - B +1) → (C - B +1) else (max(0, C - z + x)) ]\n\nSo let's define:\n\nLet s = z - B + 1.\n\nThen for x >= s, the contribution is t1 = max(0, C - B +1) if C >= B, else 0.\n\nFor x < s, the contribution is t2 = max(0, C - z + x).\n\nSo the total for z is:\n\ncount_z = (number of x >= s) * t1 + sum_{x < s} t2.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of x >= s in [A, B].\n\ns can be calculated as s = z - B + 1.\n\nBut x has to be in [A, B], so the lower bound is max(s, A), and upper bound is B.\n\nIf lower > B → no x in this region, so contribution is 0.\n\nElse, the count is B - lower + 1.\n\nSo for t1, it's (C >= B) ? (C - B +1) : 0. Let's denote t1 = max(0, C - B + 1).\n\nSimilarly, for the sum over x < s:\n\nx ranges from A to min(s-1, B).\n\nBut again, x must be >= A.\n\nSo x starts at A, ends at min(s-1, B).\n\nIf A > min(s-1, B), then no contribution.\n\nElse, the number of terms is min(s-1, B) - A + 1.\n\nEach term in the sum is (C - z + x). So the sum is sum_{x=A to X} (C - z + x), where X is min(s-1, B).\n\nWe can compute this sum as follows:\n\nsum = (C - z)*(X - A + 1) + sum_{x=A to X} x.\n\nSum of x from A to X is (X*(X+1)/2) - ((A-1)*A/2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ncount_z = (count_ge_s) * t1 + sum_t2.\n\nWhere:\n\ncount_ge_s = max(0, B - max(s, A) + 1) if max(s, A) <= B, else 0.\n\nsum_t2 = (C - z)*(X - A + 1) + (X*(X+1) - (A-1)*A)/2, where X = min(s-1, B).\n\nBut wait, s = z - B + 1.\n\nSo for each z, we can compute s and proceed as above.\n\nNow, the next thing is to find the range of z for which this approach is applicable.\n\nBut wait, what is the possible range of z? It's from C to D.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop z from C to D.\n\nFor each z:\n\nCompute s = z - B + 1.\n\nCompute the contributions as described above.\n\nSum all count_z across z in [C, D].\n\nBut this would require O(D - C + 1) iterations, each taking O(1) time if the calculations are efficient.\n\nBut D can be up to 5e5, which is manageable as 5e5 iterations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the problem now reduces to implementing this logic correctly.\n\nLet's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nWe need to loop z from 3 to 4.\n\nCase z=3:\n\ns = 3 -2 +1 = 2.\n\nt1 = 3-2+1=2.\n\ncount_ge_s: x >=2 in [1,2]. x can be 2.\n\nNumber of x's: 1.\n\nSo part1 = 1*2=2.\n\nsum_t2: x < s → x <2. x can be 1.\n\nsum_t2 = (3-3 +1) =1.\n\nsum_t2 = 1.\n\nSo total count_z = 2 +1 =3.\n\nBut wait, let's see what the actual possible triples are for z=3.\n\nPossible x in [1,2], y in [2,3], with x+y>3.\n\nFor x=1: y needs to be > 2. Since y is >=2 and <=3. So y can be 3.\n\nSo one pair (1,3).\n\nFor x=2: y can be 2 or 3.\n\nBut 2+2=4>3, 2+3=5>3.\n\nSo two pairs: (2,2), (2,3).\n\nTotal for z=3: 3 pairs.\n\nWhich matches the calculation.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for z=3 gave 2+1=3, which is correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother sample input: second example: 1 2 2 5.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo z can be 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut wait, no: z must be >=C, which is 2.\n\nSo z ranges from 2 to5.\n\nWait, but wait, the output is 3.\n\nLet's see for each z:\n\nz=2:\n\ns =2 -2 +1=1.\n\nt1=2-2+1=1.\n\ncount_ge_s: x>=1 in [1,2]. All x.\n\nSo count_ge_s is 2-1+1=2.\n\nPart1: 2*1=2.\n\nsum_t2: x <1 → none. So 0.\n\nTotal count_z=2.\n\nz=3:\n\ns=3-2+1=2.\n\nt1=1.\n\ncount_ge_s: x >=2 in [1,2]. x=2: 1 term.\n\nPart1:1*1=1.\n\nsum_t2: x<2 → x=1.\n\ny must be >3-1=2.\n\nBut y is <=2.\n\nSo y>2 implies y=3, but y can't be more than 2. So no contribution.\n\nSo sum_t2=0.\n\nTotal count_z=1.\n\nz=4:\n\ns=4-2+1=3.\n\nt1=1.\n\ncount_ge_s: x>=3 in [1,2]. No x. So part1=0.\n\nsum_t2: x<3 → x=1,2.\n\nFor x=1: y must be>4-1=3. But y<=2. No.\n\nFor x=2: y>4-2=2. So y>2 → y=3, but y<=2. No.\n\nSo sum_t2=0.\n\ncount_z=0.\n\nz=5:\n\ns=5-2+1=4.\n\nt1=1.\n\ncount_ge_s: x >=4 in [1,2]. No x.\n\nsum_t2: x<4 → x=1,2.\n\nx=1: y>5-1=4. y can't be >4, but y<=2. No.\n\nx=2: y>5-2=3. y can't be >3. No.\n\nSo count_z=0.\n\nSo total is 2+1+0+0=3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to handle all z in [C, D], including when C > D. But according to the input constraints, C <= D, so it's okay.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D.\n\n2. Initialize the result as 0.\n\n3. For each z in [C, D]:\n\n   a. Compute s = z - B + 1.\n\n   b. Compute t1 = max(0, C - B + 1) if C >= B, else 0.\n\n   c. Compute the lower and upper bounds for x in [A, B] where x >= s.\n\n      i. lower_x = max(A, s)\n      ii. if lower_x > B: count_ge_s = 0\n      else: count_ge_s = B - lower_x + 1\n      part1 = count_ge_s * t1\n\n   d. Compute the sum for x < s:\n\n      i. upper_x = min(s -1, B)\n      ii. if upper_x < A: sum_t2 = 0\n      else:\n          num_terms = upper_x - A + 1\n          sum_x = (upper_x * (upper_x + 1) // 2) - ((A -1)*A//2)\n          sum_y_part = (C - z) * num_terms\n          sum_t2 = sum_y_part + sum_x\n   e. Add part1 + sum_t2 to the result.\n\n4. After processing all z, output the result.\n\nWait, but for sum_t2, the calculation is:\n\nfor x from A to X, where X = min(s-1, B):\n\nsum (C - z + x) = sum (C - z) + sum x.\n\nWhich is (C - z) * (X - A + 1) + (sum from x=A to X of x).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsum_t2 = (C - z) * (X - A + 1) if X >= A else 0\n\nplus the sum of x from A to X.\n\nBut wait, when X < A, then sum_t2 is zero.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nCase where C < B: then t1 is zero.\n\nSo, for example, if A=1, B=3, C=2, D=5.\n\nThen for any z, t1 is 0.\n\nBut for sum_t2, we have to compute whether x + y > z.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nAnother edge case: when B > C.\n\nWait, no. According to the input constraints, A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So B can't be larger than C. So t1 will be zero only when C < B, but according to constraints, that's not possible. So t1 is always (C - B +1) when C >= B, else zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So B can't be larger than C. So t1 is (C - B +1) when C >= B, else 0. But since B <= C, t1 is (C-B+1) when C >= B, which is always true except when B=C.\n\nWait, when B=C, then t1 is 1.\n\nSo in code, t1 is max(0, C - B +1).\n\nWhich handles all cases.\n\nAnother edge case: when A > B. But according to the problem statement, A <= B.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when s is larger than B. So count_ge_s is zero.\n\nSo, now, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, considering the constraints, with D up to 5e5, the code must process 5e5 iterations, each taking O(1) time.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: '1 2 3 4'\n\nz runs from 3 to4.\n\nFor z=3:\n\ns =3-2+1=2.\n\nt1=3-2+1=2.\n\nlower_x = max(1, 2)=2. B=2. So count_ge_s=1.\n\npart1=1*2=2.\n\nX = min(2-1, 2) =1.\n\nsum_t2: X >=A (1 >=1). num_terms=1-1+1=1.\n\nsum_x=(1*2//2) - (0*1//2) = 1.\n\nsum_y_part=(3-3)*1=0.\n\nsum_t2=1.\n\ntotal for z=3: 2+1=3.\n\nz=4:\n\ns=4-2+1=3.\n\nt1=3-2+1=2.\n\nlower_x = max(1,3)=3. B is 2. So count_ge_s=0.\n\nX = min(3-1,2) =2.\n\nsum_t2: x from 1 to2.\n\nsum (C-z +x) = (3-4 +1) for x=1: 0.\n\nx=2: (3-4+2)=1.\n\nsum_t2 =0 +1=1.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait, for z=4, t1 is 2.\n\ncount_ge_s is x >=3, but x is up to 2. So count_ge_s is zero.\n\nsum_t2: x <3 → x can be 1,2.\n\nFor x=1: y must be >4-1=3. But y can be up to 3. So y>3 → y=4, but y can't exceed 3. So no contribution.\n\nFor x=2: y>4-2=2. So y>2 → y=3.\n\nSo y can be 3.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3.\n\nSo sum_t2 is 1.\n\nThus, count_z=0*2 +1=1.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for z=4 in the first sample was 1, but the overall sample output was 4.\n\nWait, let me recount all z's.\n\nWait, sample 1 output is 4.\n\nWait, let's recalculate for each z:\n\nz=3:\n\ncount_z=3.\n\nz=4:\n\ns=4-2+1=3.\n\nt1=3-2+1=2.\n\ncount_ge_s: x >=3 in [1,2]. None. part1=0.\n\nsum_t2: x <3 → x=1,2.\n\nFor x=1: y>3 → y=4, but y is up to 3. So no.\n\nx=2: y>2 → y=3.\n\nSo y=3.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3: 2+3>4.\n\nSo count is 1.\n\nSo z=4 contributes 1.\n\nSo total is 3 +1=4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother sample is the third case:\n\nInput:500000 500000 500000 500000\n\nSo A=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nz=5e5.\n\ns=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\nt1=5e5-5e5 +1=1.\n\ncount_ge_s: x >=1 in [5e5,5e5]. x=5e5.\n\ncount_ge_s=1.\n\npart1=1*1=1.\n\nsum_t2: x <1 → none.\n\nSo total for z=5e5 is 1.\n\nSo output is 1, which is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with four numbers.\n\nSo, read the input line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the result as 0.\n\nLoop z from C to D.\n\nFor each z:\n\nCompute s = z - B +1.\n\nCompute t1 = max(0, C - B +1).\n\nCompute lower_x = max(A, s).\n\nif lower_x > B:\n\n    count_ge_s =0\n\nelse:\n\n    count_ge_s = B - lower_x +1\n\npart1 = count_ge_s * t1.\n\nCompute X = min(s-1, B).\n\nif X < A:\n\n    sum_t2=0\n\nelse:\n\n    num_terms = X - A +1\n\n    sum_x = (X*(X+1)//2) - ( (A-1)*A //2 )\n\n    sum_y_part = (C - z) * num_terms\n\n    sum_t2 = sum_y_part + sum_x\n\ncount_z = part1 + sum_t2\n\nAdd count_z to the result.\n\nAfter all z's, print the result as a string.\n\nWait, but in Python, for large numbers, this should be okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in some cases, C - z can be negative, leading to sum_y_part being negative. But in that case, sum_t2 is added as a positive or zero.\n\nWait, no. Because if (C - z) is negative, and num_terms is positive, then sum_y_part is negative. But when (C - z) is negative, then C < z.\n\nBut in the sum_t2, the condition is y >= max(B, z -x +1).\n\nBut if z -x +1 > C, then y can't be >= that, so the contribution is zero.\n\nBut in the code, when sum_t2 is computed, it adds (C - z +x) for x in A to X.\n\nBut if C < z, then (C - z +x) can be negative.\n\nBut in that case, the code adds max(0, ...), but in the current code, it's not handled. So this can lead to negative contributions.\n\nWait, this is a bug.\n\nBecause in the sum_t2, for each x, the number of y's is max(0, C - max(B, z -x +1) + 1). But in the code, when C < z -x +1, then the contribution is zero. So in the code, the sum_t2 should be the sum of max(0, C - z +x) for x in A to X.\n\nWait, but in the code, it's adding (C - z +x) regardless of whether it's positive.\n\nSo in cases where C < z, and x is such that z -x +1 <= C, then (C - z +x) could be negative.\n\nWait, no. Because if z -x +1 <= C, then:\n\ny >= z -x +1 → but since y can be up to C.\n\nSo the number of y's is C - (z -x +1) + 1 = C - z +x.\n\nBut if C < z, then C - z +x could be negative.\n\nWhich would imply that the contribution is zero.\n\nSo in the code, for sum_t2, each term is max(0, C - z +x).\n\nBut in our code, it's just (C - z +x), which could be negative, leading to negative sums.\n\nSo, the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is a mistake.\n\nSo the sum_t2 is the sum of max(0, C - z +x) for x in [A, X].\n\nBut in the code, we're adding (C - z +x) without checking if it's positive.\n\nThus, the code can subtract from the result in some cases, which is wrong.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute for each x in [A, X], the term is max(0, C - z +x), and sum them.\n\nThus, in the code, for sum_t2, the sum is the sum of max(0, C - z +x) for x from A to X.\n\nSo, to compute this, for each x in [A, X], compute t = C - z +x, and if t >0, add t to the sum.\n\nBut this can't be done in O(1) time directly, unless we find a way to express the sum as a function of x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should compute sum_t2 as the sum of max(0, C - z +x) for x in [A, X].\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_t2 = sum_{x in [A, X]} max(0, (C - z) + x )\n\nWhich is equivalent to sum_{x in [A, X]} max(0, x + (C - z)).\n\nSo, the term inside max is x + (C - z).\n\nWe can denote K = C - z.\n\nSo sum_t2 = sum_{x in [A, X]} max(0, x + K).\n\nSo, depending on K, the sum varies.\n\nNow, K can be positive or negative.\n\nCase 1: K >=0.\n\nThen x + K >=x >=A >=1.\n\nSo sum_t2 = sum x from A to X.\n\nWhich is (X*(X+1)//2) - (A-1)*A//2.\n\nCase 2: K <0.\n\nThen x + K can be negative for small x.\n\nSo for x <= (-K -1), x + K <=0.\n\nSo for x from A to X, the sum is:\n\nsum_{x=A to X} max(0, x + K) = sum_{x= max(A, -K)}^{X} (x + K).\n\nBecause for x < (-K), the term is zero.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\nnumber_of_terms = max(0, X - max(A, -K) + 1)\n\nif number_of_terms <=0: sum is zero.\n\nelse:\n\nsum = (X + K) * number_of_terms - (max(A, -K) -1 + K) * (max(A, -K) - A +1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the starting point.\n\nLet me think.\n\nWhen K is negative, say K = -m, m>0.\n\nThen x + K = x -m.\n\nWe need x -m >0 → x > m.\n\nSo, for x >= m +1, the term is x -m.\n\nFor x <= m, the term is zero.\n\nSo, in the interval [A, X], the sum is:\n\nsum from x = max(A, m+1) to X of (x - m).\n\nIf max(A, m+1) > X → sum is zero.\n\nElse:\n\nnumber of terms = X - max(A, m+1) +1.\n\nsum = (number_of_terms) * ( (max(A, m+1) - m) + (X - m) ) / 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nsum = number_of_terms * ( (max(A, m+1) + X - 2m )) / 2.\n\nBut this requires handling multiple cases.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find an alternative approach.\n\nAnother approach: For a given K, the sum is the sum of max(0, x + K) for x in [A, X].\n\nThis can be written as sum_{x=A}^X max(0, x + K).\n\nWe can compute this by finding the x where x + K > 0.\n\nLet’s find the smallest x where x > -K.\n\nWhich is x_min = max(A, -K + 1).\n\nWait, because x must be integer.\n\nWait, x + K > 0 → x > -K.\n\nSo x >= floor(-K) +1.\n\nBut since x is integer, x_min = ceil(-K) if -K is not integer, else x_min = -K +1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute x_min as:\n\nx_min = max(A, math.ceil( (-K) )) ).\n\nNo, perhaps:\n\nx_min = max( A, math.floor( -K ) + 1 )\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nSuppose K = -5.\n\nSo x must be >5 → x >=6.\n\nSo x_min is max(A,6).\n\nIf K =-3.2 → x must be >3.2 → x >=4.\n\nSo x_min is max(A,4).\n\nSo, general formula: x_min = max(A, math.floor( -K ) + 1 )\n\nWait, because -K can be a float, but x is integer.\n\nWait, perhaps in code, it's better to compute x_min as:\n\nx_min = max(A, math.ceil( (-K) ) )\n\nWait, for K=-5:\n\nceil(-(-5))=ceil(5)=5.\n\nBut x needs to be >5 → x >=6.\n\nSo x_min = max(A,5+1=6).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code, for K = C - z:\n\nx_min = max( A, math.ceil( (-K) ) )\n\nBut since K can be negative, we can compute x_min as:\n\nif K >=0:\n\n    x_min = A\n\nelse:\n\n    x_min = max(A, math.ceil( (-K) ) )\n\nWait, no. Because when K >=0, all x in [A, X] contribute x + K, which is positive.\n\nSo x_min = A.\n\nWhen K <0, x_min is max(A, ceil( (-K) )).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif K >=0:\n\n    sum_t2 = sum_x_from_A_to_X = (X*(X+1)//2) - ((A-1)*A//2)\n\nelse:\n\n    # compute x_min = max(A, ceil( (-K) ) )\n\n    x_min = max( A, math.ceil( -K ) )\n\n    if x_min > X:\n\n        sum_t2 =0\n\n    else:\n\n        num_terms = X - x_min +1\n\n        a = x_min\n\n        b = X\n\n        sum_contribution = (a + b) * num_terms // 2\n\n        sum_t2 = sum_contribution - (a -1 + K) * (num_terms)\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for K <0:\n\nsum = sum_{x=x_min}^X (x + K) \n\n= sum x from x_min to X + K * (X - x_min +1 )\n\nsum_x = (X*(X+1)//2) - ( (x_min -1)*x_min//2 )\n\nsum_contribution = sum_x + K * (X - x_min +1 )\n\nBut only if x_min <=X.\n\nElse, sum_contribution is zero.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif K >=0:\n\n    sum_t2 = sum_x(A, X)\n\nelse:\n\n    x_min = max(A, math.ceil( (-K) ) )\n\n    if x_min > X:\n\n        sum_t2 =0\n\n    else:\n\n        num_terms = X - x_min +1\n\n        sum_x = (X*(X+1) //2) - ( (x_min -1)*x_min //2 )\n\n        sum_contribution = sum_x + K * num_terms\n\n        sum_t2 = sum_contribution\n\nBut wait, since K is negative, adding K * num_terms may make the sum smaller, but the individual terms are positive.\n\nWait, but in this case, for K =-5, x ranges from 6 to X.\n\nEach term is x -5.\n\nSo sum_contribution is sum (x -5) for x=6 to X.\n\nWhich is sum x from 6 to X minus 5*num_terms.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle this.\n\nThus, the code for sum_t2 is as follows:\n\nif K >=0:\n\n    sum_t2 = sum from A to X of x.\n\nelse:\n\n    x_min = max( A, math.ceil( -K ) )\n\n    if x_min > X:\n\n        sum_t2 =0\n\n    else:\n\n        num_terms = X - x_min +1\n\n        sum_x = (X*(X+1)//2) - ( (x_min -1)*x_min //2 )\n\n        sum_contribution = sum_x + K * num_terms\n\n        sum_t2 = max( sum_contribution, 0 )\n\nWait, but sum_contribution could be negative if K is very negative.\n\nWait, no. Because when K is negative, x ranges from x_min upwards.\n\nEach term x + K is positive, since x >=x_min = max(A, ceil( -K )).\n\nSo x",
