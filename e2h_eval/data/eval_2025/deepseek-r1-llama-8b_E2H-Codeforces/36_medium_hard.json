The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2 each, independently. Then, we need to assign signal powers to these towers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Every town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the probability that such an assignment is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So, the steps are: first, figure out for a given subset of built towers (those present in towns 1..n), whether there's a way to assign their powers so that all constraints are met. Then, compute the total probability over all possible subsets.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e5, enumerating all subsets is impossible. So, we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the valid configurations.\n\nEach tower's signal must cover some range. The coverage is determined by its position i and power p: it covers [i - p +1, i + p -1], but wait, the problem says |c - i| < p, which means c ranges from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). Wait, because |c -i| < p implies that c is in (i - p, i + p). Since c is integer, this translates to c >= i - p +1 and c <= i + p -1.\n\nWait no: For example, if p=1, then |c -i| <1 implies c =i only. For p=2, |c-i| <2 implies c can be i-1, i, i+1.\n\nSo, each tower at i with power p covers exactly 2p-1 towns: from i-p+1 to i+p-1, inclusive.\n\nOur goal is to select a set of towers S (those present), and assign each tower in S a power p_i such that:\n\n- The coverage of the towers exactly covers {1,2,...,n}, with each town covered exactly once.\n- Town 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n\nSo, each town in 1..n is covered exactly once.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling the line from 1 to n with intervals, each centered at a tower, and each interval is of length 2p-1, where p is the tower's power.\n\nMoreover, the intervals must not overlap, except perhaps on the edges, but actually, they must partition the line.\n\nWait, no. Because each town must be covered exactly once, so the intervals must form a partition of the line segments.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a set of centers (towers) and assigning each a radius such that the union of their intervals is exactly [1, n], and they don't overlap.\n\nWait, more precisely, the coverage areas must form a perfect partition of [1, n], without overlapping or leaving any gaps.\n\nNow, how can this happen?\n\nI think this is equivalent to having the set of towers' coverage intervals forming a non-overlapping, complete partition of [1, n]. Each interval is of the form [a_j, b_j], where a_j = i_j - (p_j -1), b_j = i_j + (p_j -1), and the intervals must exactly cover [1, n] without overlaps.\n\nSo, the question is: for a given subset S of towers, can we find a way to assign p_i's such that the above holds?\n\nWe need to count the number of subsets S where such an assignment is possible. Then, the probability is (number of valid S) / (2^n), since each tower is included with probability 1/2.\n\nBut again, with n up to 2e5, we can't process each subset individually. So, we need a way to model the valid subsets mathematically.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a valid configuration.\n\nFor a valid configuration, the coverage intervals must form a partition of [1, n]. So, each interval starts where the previous one ends +1.\n\nThis is similar to a tiling problem, where each tile is of odd length (since 2p-1 is always odd). Because each interval's length is 2p-1, which is an odd number.\n\nWait, yes. Because p can be any integer >=1, 2p-1 is 1,3,5, etc. So each interval's length is odd.\n\nSo, the entire segment [1,n] is being tiled by odd-length intervals. But the sum of odd numbers can be even or odd, depending on the number of terms. Wait, but the sum of k odd numbers is k mod 2. So, for the sum to be n-1 (since the total length is n-1, since 1..n is n elements), we have that n-1 must be expressible as a sum of odd numbers. Which is always true except when n-1 is even? No, wait, for example, 3=1+2 (but 2 is even, but no, each term is odd). Wait, no, if you have k odd numbers, their sum is congruent to k mod 2. So, if n-1 is even, then k must be even; if n-1 is odd, k must be odd.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the lengths of the intervals is exactly n-1, since each interval covers some consecutive towns, and together they cover all n towns without overlapping.\n\nSo, the sum of (2p_i -1) for all i is n-1.\n\nBut each (2p_i-1) is odd, so the sum is equal to the number of intervals multiplied by 1 (mod 2). So, the sum is k mod 2, where k is the number of intervals.\n\nThus, for the sum to be n-1, which is either even or odd, we must have k ≡ (n-1) mod 2.\n\nSo, the number of intervals k must be congruent to (n-1) mod 2.\n\nThis is a necessary condition for any valid configuration.\n\nBut beyond that, the specific positions and intervals matter.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: the intervals must form a contiguous, non-overlapping partition. So, the start of each interval must follow the end of the previous one.\n\nThis suggests that the configuration has a certain recursive structure.\n\nPerhaps the valid configurations can be characterized by certain properties, like the placement of the intervals.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal case.\n\nIf n=1: then there is only one town, 1. So, we need a tower in 1 with power 1. So, the probability is 1/2.\n\nIf n=2: the towns are 1,2.\n\nWe need to assign powers such that 0 and 3 are not covered. So, 1 and 2 must each be covered exactly once.\n\nPossible options:\n\nCase 1: both towers (1 and 2) are built.\n\nWe can assign each a power 1. Their coverage is just themselves. So, 1 and 2 are covered, and 0 and 3 are not.\n\nCase 2: only tower 1 is built. Then, it needs to cover both 1 and 2. So, power must be 2. Then, 0 is not covered, 1 and 2 are covered, 3 is not. So, valid.\n\nSimilarly, if only tower 2 is built, it can have power 2, covering 1,2,3. But 3 is town n+1=3, which is not allowed. So, no.\n\nSo, for n=2, the valid subsets are {1}, {1,2}.\n\nProbability is (number of valid subsets) / 4.\n\nNumber of valid subsets is 2: when only 1 is built, and when both 1 and 2 are built.\n\nSo, 2/4 = 1/2? Wait, but according to the sample input, when n=2, the output is 748683265 which is 1/4.\n\nWait, wait. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the sample input for n=2 is '2', and the output is 748683265 which is 1/4. According to my analysis, the valid subsets would be when both towers are present, or when only tower 1 is present.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is 2. Since each subset has probability (1/2)^2=1/4, the total probability is (2 * 1/4) = 1/2.\n\nBut the sample says the answer is 1/4. So, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that for n=2, the real answer is 1/4, which occurs when both towers are built, and each has power 1. Or when only tower 1 is built and has power 2.\n\nWait, but wait: when only tower 1 is built, its power is 2, so it covers [1-1, 1+1] → 1,2. So, town 2 is covered by tower 1, and town 1 is also covered. So, that's valid. So, the subset {1} is valid.\n\nSimilarly, subset {2}: tower 2's power must be 2, which would cover [2-1, 2+1] → 1,2,3. But 3 is town n+1, which is invalid. So, subset {2} is not valid.\n\nSo, the valid subsets are {1} and {1,2}.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is 2. The total possible subsets are 4 (each tower is present or not).\n\nSo, the probability is 2/4 = 1/2, but the sample says 1/4. That's a contradiction. So, I must have misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the signal from a tower i with power p reaches every city c where |c -i| < p. So, for p=2, the coverage is from i-1 to i+1, inclusive.\n\nWait, in the case where only tower 1 is built, and p=2: coverage is 0,1,2. Town 0 is invalid, and town 2 is covered. So, town 0 is getting a signal, which violates the first condition. So, that subset is invalid.\n\nAh! So, my mistake was thinking that tower 1's coverage is [1-1, 1+1], which includes 0, but that's not allowed.\n\nSo, in that case, the subset {1} is invalid because tower 1 with p=2 covers 0, which is town 0. So, it's forbidden.\n\nSo, the only valid subset is when both towers are built, and each has p=1. Then, each covers only themselves, and 0 and 3 are not covered.\n\nThus, the number of valid subsets is 1. So, probability is 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, okay. So, the initial reasoning was wrong because I didn't account for the fact that the coverage could extend beyond the valid area.\n\nSo, for a subset S, we must make sure that the coverage does not include town 0 or town n+1.\n\nSo, in the case where a tower is at position i, its power p cannot be such that i - p +1 ≤ 0, because that would cover town 0. Similarly, i + p -1 ≥ n+1 would cover town n+1.\n\nSo, for each tower in position i, its power p must satisfy:\n\ni - (p-1) ≥ 1\n\nand\n\ni + (p-1) ≤ n.\n\nBecause if i - (p-1) <1, then the coverage would include town 0. If i + (p-1) >n, then it includes n+1.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. So, for it not to include 0, we must have i - (p-1) ≥1. Similarly, for it not to include n+1, i + (p-1) ≤n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for a tower at i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 -i). Because:\n\ni - (p-1) ≥ 1 → p-1 ≤ i-1 → p ≤i.\n\ni + (p-1) ≤n → p-1 ≤n -i → p ≤n -i +1.\n\nSo, p can be at most min(i, n -i +1).\n\nWait, wait:\n\ni - (p-1) ≥ 1 → p ≤i.\n\ni + (p-1) ≤n → p ≤ (n -i +1).\n\nSo, the maximum possible p for tower i is min(i, n -i +1).\n\nSo, for each tower i, p can be from 1 to m_i, where m_i is min(i, n -i +1).\n\nBut in addition, the intervals assigned by the towers must form a partition of [1..n], each interval is of length 2p-1, and they don't overlap.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of towers and assigning p_i to each, such that:\n\n- For each i in S, p_i ≤ m_i.\n\n- The coverage intervals form a partition of [1..n].\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nIt's challenging. Maybe we can model this using dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think about the DP state.\n\nLet dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i towns, considering whether a tower is present or not at position i, and what power it has.\n\nBut that might be too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as finding a valid tiling of the interval [1..n], where each tile is an interval of length 2p-1, and each tile is centered at some position i, which must have a tower present with p.\n\nAdditionally, each tile's center i must satisfy i - (p-1) ≥1 and i + (p-1) ≤n.\n\nWait, but the tiles are placed consecutively, starting from 1 and ending at n.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for a given subset S, the configuration is valid iff the intervals can be arranged in a way that covers [1..n] without overlapping.\n\nBut since n is large, it's impossible to process each subset. So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the number of tilings that can be formed by selecting certain centers and assigning p_i, ensuring that the coverage doesn't include 0 and n+1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAn alternative idea: each valid configuration corresponds to a way to cover [1..n] with intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower that exists in S, and the intervals do not overlap and exactly cover [1..n].\n\nEach interval is centered at some i ∈ S, and has length l_i = 2p_i -1, which is an odd number.\n\nMoreover, the intervals must be placed in such a way that their coverage doesn't include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to tiling [1..n] with non-overlapping, contiguous, odd-length intervals, each centered at a tower that is present.\n\nBut the presence of towers is random, and we have to count the number of subsets S and assignments of p_i that satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, but the problem is not about the number of tilings, but rather the number of subsets S for which such a tiling exists.\n\nSo, for a given S, can we arrange the p_i's such that the coverage forms a partition of [1..n], with all intervals centered at i ∈ S.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAnother thought: the problem may have a recursive structure.\n\nSuppose we have a valid configuration for the first k towns. How can we extend it to k+1 towns?\n\nWait, perhaps not directly, but let's consider that each interval has a certain length and must end at a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using combinatorial mathematics, considering that each interval must be of odd length and that their centers must lie within certain bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid configurations is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's see for small n:\n\nn=1:\n\nOnly possible configuration is to have a tower at 1 with p=1.\n\nSo, number of valid subsets: 1.\n\nn=2:\n\nOnly possible when both 1 and 2 are present, each with p=1. So, 1 subset.\n\nn=3:\n\nWe need to cover 1,2,3.\n\nPossible options:\n\nOption 1: Use tower 2 with p=3. Then, it covers 1-2-3, but wait, p=3 gives coverage from 0 to 4. Which includes 0, which is invalid. So, p can't be 3.\n\nWait, m_2 = min(2, 3-2+1)= min(2,2) =2. So, p can be 1 or 2.\n\nIf p=2: coverage is 1,2,3. Does that include 0? No, since 2-1=1, so coverage starts at 1. So, 0 is not covered. And coverage ends at 3, which is n=3. So, that works.\n\nSo, tower 2 with p=2 covers all three towns.\n\nAnother option: use tower 1 with p=1 and tower 3 with p=1. Coverage is 1 and 3, but 2 is uncovered. So, invalid.\n\nAnother option: use tower 1 with p=2: coverage is 0,1,2. Includes 0, invalid.\n\nTower 3 with p=2: coverage is 2,3,4. Includes 4, which is n+1=4, invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid configuration is using tower 2 with p=2.\n\nThus, the subset S is {2}, and p=2. So, the number of valid subsets is 1.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities?\n\nWait, what if we have towers 1 and 3, but assign p=1 each. Then, coverage is 1 and 3. Town 2 is not covered. So, invalid.\n\nWhat if we have tower 1 with p=2 and tower 3 with p=2? Coverage is 0-1-2 and 2-3-4. But 0 and 4 are invalid, and town 2 is covered twice. So, invalid.\n\nSo, for n=3, the only valid subset is {2}.\n\nThus, the probability is 1/(2^3) = 1/8? But the sample input for n=3 says the output is 748683265, which is 1/4. Wait, no, the sample input for n=3 is the second entry, which is 748683265, which is 1/4. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=3, there's another valid configuration.\n\nWait, what if we have towers 1, 2, 3.\n\nAssign p=1 to 1, p=1 to 2, p=1 to 3. Then, coverage is 1,2,3. No overlaps, and 0 and 4 are not covered. So, this is valid.\n\nSo, the subset {1,2,3} is also valid.\n\nSo, for n=3, there are two valid subsets: {2}, and {1,2,3}.\n\nSo, the probability is (2) / 8 = 1/4. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, for n=3, the number of valid subsets is 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, for n=1: 1 subset.\n\nn=2: 1 subset.\n\nn=3: 2 subsets.\n\nWhat about n=4?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWe need to cover 1,2,3,4.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n1. Use tower 2 with p=3. But p can be up to min(2,4-2+1)=2. So, p can't be 3. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, m_2 is 2.\n\nSo, p can be 1 or 2.\n\np=2: coverage is 1,2,3. Leaves 4 uncovered.\n\nBut then, perhaps add a tower at 4 with p=1. Coverage is 4. So, combined, coverage is 1-3 and 4. So, total coverage is 1-4, but the intervals are 1-3 and 4. Are they non-overlapping? Yes. So, that's valid.\n\nSo, subset {2,4} with p=2 and p=1.\n\nAnother option: tower 2 with p=2, and tower 3 with p=1. Coverage would be 1-3 and 3. So, 3 is covered twice. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: tower 2 with p=2, tower 4 with p=1. So, coverage is 1-3 and 4. So, that's valid.\n\nAnother option: use tower 4 with p=2. Coverage is 3-5. But 5>4, which is n=4. So, 5 is town 5, which is n+1, invalid.\n\nSo, p for tower 4 can be at most 2, but coverage is 3-5. So, invalid.\n\nAnother option: use tower 1 with p=2: coverage is 0-2. But 0 is invalid.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAnother option: use tower 3 with p=2: coverage is 2-4. So, 2-4, which leaves 1 uncovered.\n\nThen, add tower 1 with p=1: coverage is 1. So, overall coverage is 1 and 2-4. Valid.\n\nSo, subset {1,3}, with p=1 and p=2.\n\nAnother option: tower 3 with p=2, and tower 4 with p=1: coverage is 2-4 and 4. Overlap at 4. So, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, tower 3 with p=2, and tower 4 with p=1: 2-4 and 4. Overlap, so invalid.\n\nSo, now, for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\n1. {2,4} with p=2 and 1.\n\n2. {1,3} with p=1 and 2.\n\nAre there others?\n\nWhat about using four towers, each with p=1. Coverage is 1,2,3,4. No overlaps, and 0 and 5 are not covered. So, subset {1,2,3,4} is valid.\n\nSo, that's another subset.\n\nWait, so for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {2,4}: p=2 and 1.\n\n- {1,3}: p=1 and 2.\n\n- {1,2,3,4}: each p=1.\n\nSo, that's 3 subsets.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another possibility.\n\nIs there a way to have tower 2 with p=2, and tower 4 with p=1, as before.\n\nAnother way: tower 2 with p=2, tower 4 with p=1.\n\nYes.\n\nTower 1 with p=2 is invalid because coverage includes 0.\n\nTower 3 with p=2: coverage is 2-4. So, if used alone, coverage is 2-4, leaving 1 uncovered. So, must have tower 1 with p=1. So, subset {1,3}.\n\nTower 4 with p=2: coverage is 3-5, which is invalid.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAnother option: tower 4 with p=1: coverage is 4.\n\nSo, then, for coverage, we need to cover 1-3. How?\n\nMaybe tower 2 with p=2: coverage 1-3. So, subset {2,4}.\n\nSo, that's another valid subset.\n\nSo, for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\n1. {2,4}\n\n2. {1,3}\n\n3. {1,2,3,4}\n\nSo, 3 subsets.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, what about subset {2,3,4}?\n\nIf tower 2 has p=1, tower 3 has p=2, tower 4 has p=1.\n\nCoverage:\n\n2: 2.\n\n3: 2-4.\n\n4:4.\n\nSo, coverage is 2, 2-4, 4. This includes 2 twice and 4 twice. So, invalid.\n\nNo, that's not allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, for n=4, there are 3 valid subsets.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input for n=200000, the output is 202370013, which is the inverse of 31/32, since 31 * 32^{-1} mod 998244353 is 202370013.\n\nWait, 32 inverse mod 998244353 is 310810596, but 31 * 310810596 mod MOD is 31*310810596= 96458155816 → wait, but 31*inv(32) is 31 * inv(32) mod MOD.\n\nWait, 32^{-1} mod MOD is computed as pow(32, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nMOD is 998244353, which is prime.\n\npow(32, MOD-2, MOD) is 310810596.\n\nSo, 31 * 310810596 = 96458155816 → mod MOD.\n\nCompute 96458155816 mod 998244353.\n\nBut 998244353 × 97 is approximately 96,739,  998244353 × 97 = 96,739,  998244353 × 97 = 96,739,  no, perhaps I should compute it differently.\n\nBut regardless, the sample for n=200000 is 202370013, which is 31/32 mod MOD.\n\nWhich suggests that for n=200000, the number of valid subsets is 31 * 2^{200000} / 32 * ... Wait, no. Wait, the probability is (number of valid subsets) / 2^n.\n\nSo, if for n=200000, the probability is 31/32, then the number of valid subsets is 31 * 2^{200000} / 32, but that's not an integer. So, perhaps the number of valid subsets is F(n), and the probability is F(n) / 2^n.\n\nSo, for n=1: F(1)=1 → 1/2.\n\nn=2: F(2)=1 → 1/4.\n\nn=3: F(3)=2 → 2/8=1/4.\n\nn=4: F(4)=3 → 3/16.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis for n=4 gave 3 subsets, but the sample for n=5 is 5/32. So, perhaps F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number plus something.\n\nWait, for n=1, F=1.\n\nn=2, F=1.\n\nn=3, F=2.\n\nn=4, F=3.\n\nn=5, F=5.\n\nYes, that fits the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps F(n) is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but let's check.\n\nWait, for n=1: 1.\n\nn=2: 1.\n\nn=3: 2.\n\nn=4: 3.\n\nn=5:5.\n\nYes, that's the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets for a given n is F(n), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2).\n\nWait, but for n=4, F(4)=3, which matched our earlier analysis.\n\nSo, the hypothesis is that the number of valid subsets is equal to the nth Fibonacci number, and thus the probability is F(n)/(2^n).\n\nSo, for n=5, F(5)=5 → 5/32, which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute F(n) / 2^n mod 998244353.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm for n=4:\n\nF(4)=3.\n\nSo, 3/16 is the probability.\n\nEarlier analysis found 3 valid subsets, which is 3/16.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing the nth Fibonacci number, then dividing by 2^n, modulo 998244353.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute F(n), the nth Fibonacci number, where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\n2. Compute 2^n mod MOD.\n\n3. Compute the modular inverse of 2^n, multiply by F(n), then output F(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the probability is F(n) / 2^n, which is F(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nSo, we need to compute inv_2_pow_n = pow(2, n, MOD) → then inv(pow(2, n)).\n\nWait, inv(2^n) is equal to pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)^n mod MOD.\n\nBecause 2^x mod MOD has inverse equal to (2^(MOD-2))^x mod MOD.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nCompute Fib(n) as per the sequence F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2).\n\nCompute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\nMultiply Fib(n) by inv_2_pow_n mod MOD.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute Fib(n) mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\nResult = (Fib(n) * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD.\n\nPrint result.\n\nNow, the key is to compute Fib(n) efficiently, up to n=2e5.\n\nThat's manageable with a loop.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelif n ==1:\n    print(1 * pow(2, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD)\nelse:\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n+1):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % MOD\n    fib_n = b\n    inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n    res = (fib_n * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(res)\n\nWait, but let's test for n=1.\n\nFor n=1, the output is 1/2, which is 499122177 mod MOD.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting for n=2: F(2)=1. 1/4 = 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nn=3: F(3)=2. 2/8=1/4=748683265.\n\nYes.\n\nn=5: F(5)=5. 5/32 = 5 * inv(32) mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 5 * 310810596 = 1554052980 mod MOD.\n\nCompute 1554052980 mod 998244353.\n\nWait, 998244353 × 1 = 998244353.\n\n1554052980 - 998244353 = 556,809,627.\n\nSo, 5/32 mod MOD is 556809627.\n\nBut the sample output for n=5 is 842268673.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hypothesis.\n\nWait, for n=5, the sample output is 5/32. Let's compute 5/32 mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_32 = pow(32, MOD-2, MOD).\n\npow(32, MOD-2, MOD) is 310810596.\n\nSo, 5 * 310810596 = 1554052980.\n\nNow, compute 1554052980 mod MOD.\n\nCompute 1554052980 divided by MOD.\n\nMOD is 998244353.\n\nCompute how many times MOD fits into 1554052980.\n\nCompute 998244353 × 1 = 998244353.\n\nSubtract: 1554052980 - 998244353 = 556,809,627.\n\nCheck if 556,809,627 is less than MOD.\n\nYes, 998,244,353 is larger. So, 5/32 mod MOD is 556,809,627.\n\nBut the sample output for n=5 is 842268673.\n\nSo, this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. So, the initial assumption that F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number may be incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid subsets is not F(n), but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid subsets is the same as the number of compositions using certain parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's reevaluate the problem for small n.\n\nn=1:\n\nOnly one possible subset: {1} with p=1.\n\nSo, F(1)=1.\n\nn=2:\n\nValid subsets are {1,2}.\n\nSo, F(2)=1.\n\nn=3:\n\nValid subsets are {2}, {1,2,3}.\n\nSo, F(3)=2.\n\nn=4:\n\nValid subsets are {2,4}, {1,3}, {1,2,3,4}.\n\nSo, F(4)=3.\n\nn=5:\n\nLooking for all possible valid subsets.\n\nHmm.\n\nFor n=5, what are the valid subsets?\n\nLet's think recursively.\n\nWe can have a tower in the middle (position 3) with p=3. Wait, m_3 = min(3, 5-3+1)= min(3,3)=3. So, p can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWait, p=3: coverage is 1-5. So, that covers all towns, and doesn't include 0 or 6. So, subset {3} is valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can have multiple towers.\n\nFor example, {1,3,5}:\n\nAssign p=1 to 1, p=2 to 3, p=1 to 5.\n\nCoverage: 1, 2-4, 5.\n\nSo, that's a valid subset.\n\nAnother option: {2,4}.\n\nAssign p=2 to 2, p=2 to 4.\n\nCoverage: 1-3 and 3-5. But that's overlapping at 3. So, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, assign p=2 to 2, p=1 to 4, p=1 to 5. Coverage is 1-3, 4, 5. That's valid.\n\nWait, but 3 is covered by 2's p=2 and 4 is covered by itself.\n\nNo, 2's coverage is 1-3, and 4's is 4, 5's is 5.\n\nSo, that's valid.\n\nSo, subset {2,4,5}.\n\nAnother option: {1,3,5}.\n\nSo, for n=5, the valid subsets include:\n\n1. {3}: p=3.\n\n2. {1,3,5}: p=1, p=2, p=1.\n\n3. {2,4,5}: p=2, p=1, p=1.\n\n4. {2,3,5}: p=2, p=2, p=1. Coverage: 1-3, 3-5, 5. But 3 is covered twice. Invalid.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAnother option: {1,3,4}.\n\np=1, p=2, p=1.\n\nCoverage: 1, 2-4,4. Overlap at 4. Invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother option: {1,2,4,5}.\n\np=1, p=1, p=1, p=1. Coverage is 1,2,4,5. But 3 is uncovered. So, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, {1,2,4}: p=1, p=1, p=1. Coverage is 1,2,4. 3 is uncovered. Invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps for n=5, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {3}\n\n- {1,3,5}\n\n- {2,4,5}\n\n- {1,2,3,4,5}\n\nWait, {1,2,3,4,5} with p=1 for all. Coverage is 1,2,3,4,5. So, valid.\n\nSo, that's another subset.\n\nSo, for n=5, F(5) is 5.\n\nWhich would match the sample.\n\nSo, the initial hypothesis that F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number holds.\n\nSo, for n=5, F(5)=5, so probability is 5/32.\n\nWhich is 5 * inv(32) mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 5 * 310810596 = 1554052980 mod MOD.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output for n=5 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.
