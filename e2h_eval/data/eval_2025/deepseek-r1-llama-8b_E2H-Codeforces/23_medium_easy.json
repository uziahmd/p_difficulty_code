In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Japanese mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). \n\nHmm, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' means suit s, number 1. The output should be three integers: for each of the three input tiles, the minimal number of draws needed so that after adding those, the entire collection contains at least one mentsu. Or wait, no—wait, the output is three numbers corresponding to each input line, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, looking back, the sample input is three lines, but the output is three numbers, like ['0', '0', '1'], which seems to correspond to each of the three initial hands. So I think the problem is, for each of the three initial hands, compute how many tiles need to be drawn to get a mentsu in that particular hand, considering all possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem statement is asking, given her current three tiles, what is the minimal number of additional tiles she needs to draw so that across all her tiles (current plus drawn), there exists at least one mentsu. But the output is three numbers, one for each initial tile? No, that can't be right. Looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo for the first case, she already has a shuntsu (1s,2s,3s). So she needs 0 more. The second case is three 9m's, which is a koutsu, so 0 more. The third case is 3p, 9m, 2p. She can add 1p or 4p to complete a shuntsu (like 2p,3p,4p or 1p,2p,3p). So the output is 1 for the third tile.\n\nWait, but that's per initial tile? Or per the entire set? No, that makes no sense. Oh, perhaps the output is for each of the three initial tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles to add to just that single tile to form a mentsu. But that also doesn't fit the sample.\n\nWait, no, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three initial hands. So each initial hand is considered separately. So for each of the three initial hands, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that within that initial hand plus added tiles, there exists a mentsu. But since the initial hand is just three tiles, adding some tiles will increase the total, but each tile can be any of the 108 possible tiles.\n\nWait, but the output in the sample is for each initial hand, the minimal draws needed. So for each of the three initial sets, compute the minimal number of draws required such that the combined set (original + new) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Because the original hand is three tiles. Adding zero, one, two, etc. tiles. So for the third initial hand, [3p,9m,2p], adding one tile (either 1p or 4p) gives four tiles. Now, does that four-tile set contain a mentsu? Because the four tiles would include 2p,3p, and the added tile (say, 1p or 4p). So 1p,2p,3p forms a shuntsu, and 2p,3p,4p also forms a shuntsu. So yes, with one addition.\n\nBut why is the output 1 for that third case? Because after adding one, she can form a mentsu. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the problem is: for each of the three initial hands, determine the minimal number of tiles she needs to add to her current hand to form at least one mentsu. Then, output three numbers, each being the minimal for each initial hand.\n\nWait, no. Because when you add tiles, it's not per hand, but the total. So perhaps the problem is, she has three tiles. She can add any number of tiles (including none), and then among all her tiles, including the added ones, check if there's any mentsu. We need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that this condition is met. And then, the output is three numbers: for each of the three initial tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles that need to be added so that that particular tile is part of a mentsu in the overall set.\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the output is for each of the three initial tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles that need to be added so that that specific tile is part of a mentsu in the overall set. That might explain the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the third initial tile is 2p. Adding one tile (like 1p) allows 1p,2p,3p. So for the 2p tile, the minimal is 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: print a single integer—the minimal number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three integers, as seen in the sample. So the problem must be, for each of the three initial tiles, compute the minimal number of tiles that need to be added so that in the combined set, that tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nNo, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that each initial hand is treated as a separate scenario, and for each, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to that initial hand to form a mentsu. So the output is three numbers, each representing the minimal for each of the three initial hands.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that the hand (after adding) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, for example, the first initial hand is 1s,2s,3s. It's already a shuntsu, so the answer is 0.\n\nThe second initial hand is three 9m's. It's a koutsu, so 0.\n\nThe third initial hand is 3p,9m,2p. So she has 3p, 2p, and 9m. So the three tiles are in different suits except 3p and 2p are both p. So to form a shuntsu, she needs to add either 1p or 4p. So adding one tile is sufficient.\n\nSo the output is 0, 0, 1.\n\nSo the task is: for each of the three input hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to that hand so that the resulting collection has at least one mentsu.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the three input hands, process them as follows.\n\n2. For each hand, generate all possible ways to add 0, 1, 2, ... tiles, up to maybe 4 or 5, because beyond that, the minimal is likely found.\n\n3. For each possible addition, check whether the combined set contains any mentsu.\n\n4. Find the minimal number of tiles needed to reach such a state.\n\nBut since the number of possible tiles is 108, and adding up to, say, 4 tiles, the approach can be manageable.\n\nBut for each hand, the initial set is three tiles. So the maximum number of tiles after adding is 3+4=7. But considering that in the worst case, the minimal could be 4.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each hand, the minimal number of additions can be up to 4. Because in the worst case, you need to add 4 tiles to form a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal can be found by checking all possible combinations.\n\nBut let's think about how to represent the current hand.\n\nEach hand is a list of three tiles. For each possible number of added tiles (from 0 to, say, 4), we can try all possible combinations of tiles (each tile can be any of the 108 possibilities), and see if any of the resulting sets (original plus added) has a mentsu.\n\nBut trying all possibilities for each possible added count is computationally expensive.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu), determine the minimal number of tiles needed to be added to the current hand to include that mentsu. Then, take the minimal across all possible mentsus.\n\nSo for each mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing from the current hand, then the minimal number of tiles to add is the number of missing tiles.\n\nThen, the overall minimal is the smallest number of tiles needed across all possible mentsus.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), check how many tiles from the current hand match any part of the mentsu. Then, the number of tiles needed to add is the number of tiles in the mentsu not present in the current hand.\n\nThe minimal such number across all mentsus is the answer for the hand.\n\nSo for each hand, the process is:\n\n- Enumerate all possible mentsus.\n\n- For each mentsu, calculate the size of the intersection between the mentsu and the current hand.\n\n- The required tiles to add is 3 minus this size.\n\n- Find the minimal required tiles across all mentsus.\n\nBut wait, this is not entirely correct. Because the current hand may already have some tiles of the mentsu. For example, if the current hand has two tiles of a mentsu, then adding one more will complete it.\n\nSo for each mentsu, the minimal number of tiles to add is 3 minus the count of how many tiles in the current hand are part of the mentsu.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the current hand has more than three tiles after adding, but the mentsu is only three, so the other tiles don't affect.\n\nSo for example, the current hand is [1m, 2m, 3m]. Any mentsu that is a subset of this will require zero adds.\n\nAnother example: current hand is [1m, 1m, 2m]. The triplet mentsu 1m x3 requires 1 more 1m. The sequence mentsu 1m,2m,3m requires 1m,2m,3m. The current hand has 1m and 2m, so two tiles, so need one more (3m).\n\nSo for each possible mentsu, compute the number of tiles in the current hand that are in the mentsu. Then, the required tiles to add is max(0, 3 - count). The minimal across all mentsus is the answer.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor a given hand, iterate through all possible mentsus.\n\nFor each mentsu, compute how many tiles in the hand are part of the mentsu.\n\nCompute 3 - count.\n\nTake the minimal value of (3 - count) across all mentsus.\n\nBut this is not correct because, for a mentsu, you can have multiple copies. For example, a koutsu (three same tiles) requires exactly three of that tile. So if the current hand has two, you need one more.\n\nA shuntsu requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for a given sequence, you need to have all three, possibly in any order.\n\nBut wait, the mentsu is a set. So the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo, for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), check how many of its tiles are present in the current hand.\n\nThe minimal number of tiles to add is 3 minus that count.\n\nBut how do I represent all possible mentsus?\n\nLet me think about generating all possible mentsus.\n\nKoutsu: for each suit (m, p, s), and each number (1-9), create a triplet of that tile.\n\nShuntsu: for each suit, and for each starting number (1-7), create a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nWait, starting number can be 1 to 7 because 7+2=9.\n\nSo the total number of mentsus is 3 * 9 (for koutsu) + 3 * 7 (for shuntsu) = 27 + 21 = 48 mentsus.\n\nThat's manageable.\n\nSo for each hand, for each of the 48 mentsus, compute how many tiles in the hand are in the mentsu. Then, the minimal required is min(3 - count) over all mentsus.\n\nWait, no. Because for a koutsu, the mentsu consists of three identical tiles. So for a koutsu, the count is the number of times that tile appears in the hand. So for a koutsu of 1m, the count is the number of 1m tiles in the hand.\n\nFor a shuntsu, the mentsu consists of three distinct tiles: x, x+1, x+2 of the same suit. So the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are part of this sequence. So even if the hand has two of x, one of x+1, and none of x+2, the count is 3.\n\nWait, no. Because the mentsu is a set. So for a shuntsu, the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu. So for example, if the hand has two x, one x+1, and none of x+2, then the count is 3 (x, x+1, and x again?), but no—wait, the count is the number of unique tiles in the hand that are part of the shuntsu. Or wait, no, the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are part of the mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Each mentsu is a set of exactly three tiles. For a koutsu, it's three identical tiles. For a shuntsu, it's three distinct tiles. So for the current hand, the count for a mentsu is the number of tiles in the hand that are part of that mentsu. So for a koutsu, it's the number of tiles equal to the mentsu's tile. For a shuntsu, it's the number of tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu.\n\nWait, but the hand can have multiple tiles of the same type. So for a koutsu, say, 1m, the count is the number of 1m tiles in the hand.\n\nFor a shuntsu, say, 1m,2m,3m, the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are 1m, 2m, or 3m. Even if the hand has multiple 1ms, it's counted once. Or wait, no—no, because the mentsu is a set. So for the purpose of forming the mentsu, you need all three tiles, regardless of how many you have. So for the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m, the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are either 1m, 2m, or 3m. So if the hand has two 1ms, one 2m, and one 3m, then the count is 4, but the mentsu requires three. So the required addition is 3 - (number of unique tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the mentsu is a set, so for a shuntsu, you need exactly one of each tile. So the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu, but considering each tile only once.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nFor a koutsu, the mentsu is {t}, where t is a tile. To form the mentsu, the hand must have at least three t's. So the count is the number of t's in the hand, and the required is 3 - count.\n\nFor a shuntsu, the mentsu is {a, b, c}, where a, b, c are consecutive. The hand must contain at least one of each a, b, c. So the count is the number of distinct tiles in the hand that are in {a, b, c}. The required is max(0, 3 - count).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for a shuntsu, you need one of each a, b, c. So if the hand has two a's and one b, the count is 2, so you need 1 more tile (c). If the hand has a, a, b, c, the count is 3, so no more needed.\n\nSo for each mentsu, the required is:\n\nif it's a koutsu: 3 - number of tiles in the hand equal to the mentsu's tile.\n\nif it's a shuntsu: 3 - number of distinct tiles in the hand that are part of the shuntsu.\n\nWait, but in code, how do I represent this?\n\nLet me outline the steps for processing a single hand:\n\n1. Read the three tiles as a list.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu:\n\n   a. If it's a koutsu:\n\n      i. Check how many tiles in the hand match the tile of the koutsu.\n\n      ii. Required tiles to add: 3 - count.\n\n   b. If it's a shuntsu:\n\n      i. Collect the three tiles of the shuntsu (e.g., 1m,2m,3m).\n\n      ii. For each of these three tiles, check if the hand contains at least one of each.\n\n      iii. Count the number of distinct tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu.\n\n      iv. Required tiles to add: 3 - count.\n\n3. Keep track of the minimal required across all mentsus.\n\n4. The minimal required is the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut wait, for a shuntsu, the required is 3 minus the number of distinct tiles in the hand that are part of the shuntsu.\n\nWait, no. Because for a shuntsu, you need all three tiles in the set. So if the hand has, say, two of a and one of b, but none of c, then the count is 2 (a and b), so required is 1 (add c). If the hand has a, b, c, then required is 0.\n\nIf the hand has a, a, a, then the count is 1 (only a), so required is 2.\n\nSo yes, for a shuntsu, the required is 3 minus the number of distinct tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu.\n\nWait, but suppose the hand has a, a, b, b, c. Then for the shuntsu a, b, c, the count is 3 (since a, b, c are all present). So required is 0.\n\nSo, in code, for each mentsu, whether koutsu or shuntsu:\n\n- For koutsu: count the occurrences of the tile in the hand. required = 3 - count.\n\n- For shuntsu: create a set of the three tiles in the shuntsu. count how many of these tiles are present in the hand (each tile is considered once, regardless of how many copies are present). required = 3 - count.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each hand:\n\n   Initialize min_draws to a large number.\n\n   For each mentsu in all_mentsus:\n\n       if mentsu is koutsu:\n\n           tile = mentsu_tile\n\n           count = number of times tile appears in the hand.\n\n           required = 3 - count\n\n       else:\n\n           shuntsu_tiles = sorted([x, x+1, x+2])  # assuming x is the start, but need to handle order.\n\n           # actually, for a shuntsu, it's a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n           # for each of the three tiles in the shuntsu, check if the hand contains at least one.\n\n           present = 0\n\n           for tile in shuntsu_tiles:\n\n               if tile is present in the hand's tiles (regardless of count):\n\n                   present += 1\n\n           required = 3 - present\n\n       if required < min_draws:\n\n           min_draws = required\n\n   After checking all mentsus:\n\n       return min_draws\n\nWait, but wait: for the shuntsu, the order of the tiles doesn't matter. So for a shuntsu, the tiles are a, a+1, a+2. So in the code, for a given shuntsu, we can collect all three tiles, and for each, check if the hand contains any copy of that tile.\n\nBut wait, the hand is a list of three tiles. So for each shuntsu, we can create a set of the three tiles, then count how many are in the hand's set.\n\nBut the hand's set is the unique tiles in the hand.\n\nSo for a shuntsu, the required is 3 minus the size of the intersection between the shuntsu's tiles and the hand's tiles.\n\nWait, no: because the shuntsu's tiles are exactly three, and the hand's set may have some of them. The required is 3 minus the number of tiles in the shuntsu that are present in the hand.\n\nSo, for a shuntsu, the count is the number of tiles in the shuntsu that are present in the hand.\n\nSo for a shuntsu, required is 3 - count.\n\nSo the steps for each shuntsu:\n\n   Create a set s of the three tiles in the shuntsu.\n\n   Create a set h of the three tiles in the hand.\n\n   count = len(s.intersection(h))\n\n   required = 3 - count\n\nSimilarly, for a koutsu, the count is the number of times the tile appears in the hand.\n\nWait, no. For a koutsu, the mentsu is three identical tiles. So the count is the number of tiles in the hand that are equal to that tile. So for a koutsu of '1m', count is the number of '1m's in the hand.\n\nSo for a koutsu:\n\ntile = '1m'\n\ncount = sum(1 for t in hand if t == tile)\n\nrequired = 3 - count\n\nSo in code:\n\nFor a given hand:\n\nhand_set = set(hand)\n\nhand_counts = Counter(hand)\n\nall_mentsus = []\n\n# Koutsu mentsus\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        all_mentsus.append(tile)\n\n# Shuntsu mentsus\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 8):  # since 7+2=9\n        a = num\n        b = num + 1\n        c = num + 2\n        tiles = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{b}{suit}\", f\"{c}{suit}\"]\n        all_mentsus.append(tiles)\n\nWait, no. Because for each shuntsu, it's a triplet, so each shuntsu is a list of three tiles.\n\nBut perhaps in code, for each shuntsu, the triplet is a tuple or a list.\n\nSo, in code, for each shuntsu, it's a triplet of three tiles. So for each triplet, we can process it.\n\nWait, but in Python, it's easier to represent each mentsu as a list of three tiles.\n\nSo, for each mentsu in all_mentsus:\n\n   if it's a koutsu:\n\n       tile = mentsu[0]\n\n       count = number of times tile appears in the hand.\n\n   else:\n\n       s = set(mentsu)\n\n       count = number of tiles in s that are in hand_set.\n\nThen, required is 3 - count.\n\nWait, but for a koutsu, the mentsu is represented as a list of three identical tiles, e.g., ['1m', '1m', '1m'].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor mentsu in all_mentsus:\n\n    if isinstance(mentsu, list) and len(mentsu) ==3 and all(t == mentsu[0] for t in mentsu):\n\n        # it's a koutsu\n\n        tile = mentsu[0]\n\n        count = sum(1 for t in hand if t == tile)\n\n    else:\n\n        # it's a shuntsu, represented as a list of three distinct tiles\n\n        s = set(mentsu)\n\n        count = len(s & hand_set)\n\n    required = 3 - count\n\n    if required < min_draws:\n\n        min_draws = required\n\nSo, in code, the process is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three input lines, each line is a string of three tiles.\n\n- For each of these three hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\n- Output the three numbers.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this correctly.\n\nSo, the steps for each hand:\n\n1. Parse the hand into a list of three tiles.\n\n2. Precompute the hand_set as a set of the three tiles.\n\n3. For each of the 48 possible mentsus:\n\n   a. If it's a koutsu, count the number of tiles in the hand equal to the koutsu's tile.\n\n   b. If it's a shuntsu, count the number of distinct tiles in the hand that are in the shuntsu.\n\n4. Compute the required tiles as 3 - count.\n\n5. Keep track of the minimal required.\n\n6. After all mentsus are processed, the minimal required is the answer for this hand.\n\nSo, now, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nInput is three lines, each line is three tiles separated by spaces. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nhands = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    tiles = line.split()\n    hands.append(tiles)\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1s 2s 3s', ...], so each line is a string of three tiles.\n\nWait, no, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWhich is three lines, each representing a hand.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says, \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" So the input is a single line containing three strings, each representing a tile. No, wait, no. Because in the sample input, it's written as ['1s 2s 3s', ...], implying that the input is a list of three strings, each being a hand of three tiles.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says, the input is \"the only line contains three strings\". So the input is a single line, which is split into three parts, each being a hand. Each hand consists of three tiles.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input is:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\"\n\nWhich is a single line, split into three hands, each having three tiles.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\nSo for the sample input, tiles would be a list of 9 elements: ['1s', '2s', '3s', '9m', '9m', '9m', '3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nThen, group them into three hands:\n\nhand1 = tiles[0:3]\n\nhand2 = tiles[3:6]\n\nhand3 = tiles[6:9]\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\nhand1 = tiles[0:3]\n\nhand2 = tiles[3:6]\n\nhand3 = tiles[6:9]\n\nThen, process each hand.\n\nSo, function to process a single hand:\n\ndef compute_min Draws(hand):\n    # hand is a list of three strings, e.g., ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\n    # precompute the set of tiles in hand\n    hand_set = set(hand)\n    hand_counts = {}\n    for t in hand:\n        if t in hand_counts:\n            hand_counts[t] +=1\n        else:\n            hand_counts[t] = 1\n\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n\n    # generate all mentsus\n    # koutsus and shuntsus\n\n    # koutsus\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            # count how many times this tile appears in hand\n            count = hand_counts.get(tile, 0)\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n\n    # shuntsus\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n            a = num\n            b = num +1\n            c = num +2\n            tiles = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{b}{suit}\", f\"{c}{suit}\"]\n            # count how many unique tiles in hand are in this shuntsu\n            present = 0\n            for t in tiles:\n                if t in hand_set:\n                    present +=1\n            required = 3 - present\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n\n    return min_draws if min_draws != float('inf') else 0  # but min_draws will never be inf\n\nWait, but what if a shuntsu is not properly formed? Like, for num=7, a=7, b=8, c=9.\n\nSo for each shuntsu, the three tiles are a, a+1, a+2.\n\nSo the code for shuntsus is correct.\n\nNow, testing the function with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHand 1: 1s, 2s, 3s\n\nProcessing:\n\nhand_set = {'1s', '2s', '3s'}\n\nFor koutsus:\n\nCheck each of the 9 tiles (1m, ..., 9s).\n\nFor 1s: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nFor 2s: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nFor 3s: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nOther koutsus have 0 or 1.\n\nFor shuntsus:\n\nEach shuntsu is a triplet.\n\nFor 1s,2s,3s: present is 3 → required 0.\n\nSo min_draws is 0.\n\nThus, the function returns 0.\n\nSecond hand: 9m,9m,9m.\n\nhand_set is {'9m'}, counts: 9m:3.\n\nFor koutsus:\n\nTile 9m: count is 3 → required 0.\n\nThus, min_draws is 0.\n\nThird hand: 3p,9m,2p.\n\nhand_set is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}.\n\nFor koutsus:\n\nCheck each tile. 3p: count 1 → required 2.\n\n9m: count 1 → required 2.\n\n2p: count 1 → required 2.\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nFor shuntsus:\n\nLooking for sequences in p.\n\nCheck for num=1: 1p,2p,3p.\n\nCheck if all three are present in hand_set.\n\nHand has 2p, 3p, but not 1p. So present is 2 → required 1.\n\nnum=2: 2p,3p,4p.\n\nHand has 2p,3p, but not 4p. Present 2 → required 1.\n\nnum=3: 3p,4p,5p → present 1 (3p) → required 2.\n\nSo the minimal required is 1.\n\nThus, the function returns 1.\n\nSo the output is 0,0,1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m','1m','2m'].\n\nFor koutsus:\n\n1m: count 2 → required 1.\n\n2m: count 1 → required 2.\n\nFor shuntsus:\n\nCheck 1m,2m,3m: present 2 → required 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m','2m','4m'].\n\nShuntsus:\n\n1m,2m,3m: present 2 → required 1.\n\n2m,3m,4m: present 2 → required 1.\n\n4m,5m,6m: present 1 → required 2.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: hand is ['1m','3m','5m'].\n\nShuntsus: none present, so required 3.\n\nBut koutsus: none, so required 3.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nWait, but wait: the hand has 1m,3m,5m.\n\nFor shuntsus 1m,2m,3m: present 2 (1m and 3m) → required 1.\n\nSimilarly, 3m,4m,5m: present 2 → required 1.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, because adding 2m or 4m would allow a shuntsu.\n\nSo the function correctly finds that.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nThe code will:\n\n- Read the input line into a list of 9 tiles.\n\n- Split into three hands.\n\n- For each hand, compute the minimal required.\n\n- Print the three results, space-separated.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead the input:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nhand1 = tiles[0:3]\nhand2 = tiles[3:6]\nhand3 = tiles[6:9]\n\nFunction to compute minimal draws for a hand.\n\nImplement that function.\n\nThen, print the three results.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ndef compute_min_draws(hand):\n    hand_set = set(hand)\n    hand_counts = {}\n    for t in hand:\n        if t in hand_counts:\n            hand_counts[t] += 1\n        else:\n            hand_counts[t] = 1\n\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n\n    # Check all koutsu\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            count = hand_counts.get(tile, 0)\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n\n    # Check all shuntsu\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 8):\n            a = num\n            b = num + 1\n            c = num + 2\n            tiles = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{b}{suit}\", f\"{c}{suit}\"]\n            present = 0\n            for t in tiles:\n                if t in hand_set:\n                    present += 1\n            required = 3 - present\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n\n    return min_draws\n\ntiles = input().split()\nhand1 = tiles[0:3]\nhand2 = tiles[3:6]\nhand3 = tiles[6:9]\n\nresults = []\nresults.append(compute_min_draws(hand1))\nresults.append(compute_min_draws(hand2))\nresults.append(compute_min_draws(hand3))\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nAfter splitting, tiles is:\n\n['1s', '2s', '3s', '9m', '9m', '9m', '3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nhand1 is ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\nhand2 is ['9m', '9m', '9m']\n\nhand3 is ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nCompute for each:\n\nhand1: returns 0.\n\nhand2: returns 0.\n\nhand3: returns 1.\n\nSo the output is '0 0 1'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nProcessing:\n\nhand_counts: 1m:1, 2m:1, 4m:1.\n\nFor koutsus: none have count >=3.\n\nFor shuntsus:\n\nCheck 1m,2m,3m: present 2 → required 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m','1m','2m'].\n\nFor koutsus:\n\n1m: count 2 → required 1.\n\n2m: count 1 → required 2.\n\nFor shuntsus:\n\n1m,2m,3m: present 2 → required 1.\n\nThus, minimal is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m','3m','5m']",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (triplet or sequence) in her hand. Each tile is represented by a combination of a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimal number of draws for each of the three given initial hands.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Mentsu**: A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). A koutsu consists of three identical tiles, while a shuntsu consists of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsus**: There are 48 possible mentsus (9 koutsus per suit and 7 shuntsus per suit).\n3. **Check Each Hand**: For each of the three hands, check all possible mentsus to determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu.\n4. **Count Tiles Efficiently**: For each mentsu, count how many of its tiles are already present in the hand. Calculate the required tiles as 3 minus this count.\n5. **Determine Minimum Draws**: Track the minimum number of draws required across all mentsus for each hand.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_draws(hand):\n    hand_set = set(hand)\n    hand_counts = {}\n    for t in hand:\n        if t in hand_counts:\n            hand_counts[t] += 1\n        else:\n            hand_counts[t] = 1\n\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n\n    # Check all koutsu\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            count = hand_counts.get(tile, 0)\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n\n    # Check all shuntsu\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 8):\n            a = num\n            b = num + 1\n            c = num + 2\n            tiles = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{b}{suit}\", f\"{c}{suit}\"]\n            present = 0\n            for t in tiles:\n                if t in hand_set:\n                    present += 1\n            required = 3 - present\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n\n    return min_draws\n\ntiles = input().split()\nhand1 = tiles[0:3]\nhand2 = tiles[3:6]\nhand3 = tiles[6:9]\n\nresults = []\nresults.append(compute_min_draws(hand1))\nresults.append(compute_min_draws(hand2))\nresults.append(compute_min_draws(hand3))\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line of nine tiles, which are then split into three hands of three tiles each.\n2. **Function `compute_min_draws`**: This function processes each hand to determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed. It checks both koutsu and shuntsu mentsus.\n3. **Koutsu Check**: For each suit and number, it counts how many times the tile appears in the hand and calculates the required draws.\n4. **Shuntsu Check**: For each possible sequence in each suit, it checks how many tiles of the sequence are present in the hand and calculates the required draws.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The function returns the minimum number of draws required for each hand, which are then printed as the final result.",
