There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm. The input gives n spots, each can have a height between 0 and h. For each spot, if it's set to a, we gain a². The restrictions are that in each range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a problem where for each spot, I choose a height, but the constraints are that within any of the m ranges, the maximum is at most x_i. Also, each spot can't exceed h, but some restrictions may force it to be lower.\n\nWait, but the constraints are all about the maximums in their respective ranges. So the problem is about ensuring that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. And then maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis seems similar to constraints where variables (spot heights) are subject to max constraints in intervals. How can I model this?\n\nI think dynamic programming could be useful here. Because for each position, the choice of height depends on previous choices and the constraints that apply.\n\nLet me think about the possible approach.\n\nEach spot i can have a height from 0 to h, but also, any restriction that includes i might impose a maximum. But since multiple restrictions can include the same spot, the maximum allowed height for that spot is the minimum of all x_j where the restriction j covers i.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction is a range. So for spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x among all restrictions that cover i. Because if any restriction says that in a range containing i, the maximum is at most x_i, then the spot's height must be <= x_i for that restriction. So the effective maximum for spot i is the minimum of all x_j where l_j <=i <=r_j.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because the restrictions could overlap, and the effective maximum for i is the minimum of all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j]. Because, for example, if one restriction says that i can be at most 3, and another says it can be at most 5, then the maximum allowed is 3.\n\nSo for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum x_i over all restrictions that include i. If there are no restrictions covering i, then the maximum is h.\n\nSo first, for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height, which is the minimum x across all applicable restrictions. Then, the problem reduces to choosing a height for each spot, up to this maximum, such that all the restrictions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because the restrictions themselves are about the maximum in their ranges. So even if each spot's height is within its allowed maximum, the maximum in the range could be higher than x_i. So that approach would miss some constraints.\n\nOh right, because for a particular restriction, the maximum in its range is determined by all the spots in that range. So even if each spot's maximum is within the restriction's x, the maximum could still be higher than x.\n\nWait, no. Because if each spot in the range is at most x, then the maximum in the range is at most x. So, if for each spot i in [l_i, r_i], the height is <= x_i (the restriction's x), then the maximum in that range will be <= x. So the initial approach of computing for each spot i the minimum x across all restrictions that include i and then setting the height to that, is actually sufficient.\n\nWait, no. Because the x_i of a restriction might be higher than the minimum. For example, suppose a spot is covered by two restrictions: one with x=5 and another with x=10. Then the maximum allowed height for that spot is min(5,10)=5. But if I set it to 5, that satisfies both restrictions. However, what if another restriction covers a different spot in the same range? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j]. Because each such x_j requires that in their range, the maximum is <= x_j. So for spot i, to satisfy all the x_j's for which it's in their ranges, the height must be <= x_j for each such j. Therefore, the maximum possible height for i is the minimum of all x_j where j covers i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each spot i, the allowed height is the minimum of x_j across all restrictions j where l_j <=i <=r_j.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and each restriction limits the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each restriction specifies a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum height `x_i`. The goal is to ensure that the tallest house in each specified range does not exceed `x_i`.\n2. **Determine Effective Heights**: For each spot, the effective maximum height is determined by the minimum value of `x_i` across all restrictions that include the spot. This ensures that each spot's height does not violate any of the applicable restrictions.\n3. **Maximize Profit**: Once the effective maximum heights for each spot are determined, we aim to maximize the sum of squares of these heights. This can be efficiently computed using dynamic programming.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    h = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n\n    spots_heights = [h] * (n+1)  # 1-based indexing\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n        r = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n        x = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n        if x < spots_heights[l]:\n            spots_heights[l] = x\n        if x < spots_heights[r]:\n            spots_heights[r] = x\n        # Also, for all spots between l and r, check if any restriction lowers their max\n        # So for each spot in l..r, the max allowed is min(current_max, x)\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            if x < spots_heights[i]:\n                spots_heights[i] = x\n\n    # Now, compute the maximum possible heights considering all constraints\n    # For each spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum x across all restrictions that cover it\n    # But wait, the above code may not capture all overlapping restrictions correctly\n    # Let me recompute for each spot the min x among all restrictions covering it\n    effective_max = [h]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        min_x = h\n        for j in range(m):\n            l_j = input[j*3]\n            r_j = input[j*3+1]\n            x_j = input[j*3+2]\n            if l_j <= i <= r_j:\n                if x_j < min_x:\n                    min_x = x_j\n        effective_max[i] = min_x\n\n    # Now, the problem is to choose heights a_1, a_2,...a_n where 0<=a_i<=effective_max[i], such that the sum of squares is maximized\n    # Additionally, within any restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i.
