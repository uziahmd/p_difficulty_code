The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be at house ai, and all tasks with numbers less than i must be completed before the i-th task. So, the order matters as per their indices, not their values.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Oh right, so the tasks are processed in the order of their indices. So first, task 1, then task 2, up to task m. Each task requires her to be present at a certain house, but the earlier tasks can be done while moving around.\n\nBut since she has to do them in order, perhaps the way to model this is to determine the earliest possible times she arrives at each required house for each task.\n\nHmm. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3\n\nThe tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\nShe starts at 1 (time 0).\n\nTask 1: needs to be at 3. So she moves from 1 to 2 to 3. Time taken: 2 units. Now time is 2.\n\nThen, Task 2: needs to be at 2. But since she's already at 3, she needs to move back to 2. So from 3 to 2 is 1 unit, time becomes 3.\n\nWait, no. Because after completing task 1, she is at 3. Then, she has to do task 2, which is at 2. So she must go from 3 to 2, which is one step, taking 1 unit of time. So time increases by 1 to 3.\n\nThen, task 3: again at 3. She can just stay there, so no movement needed. So total time is 3 + 0 = 3? But the sample output says 6. Hmm, I must have misunderstood.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says the sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's count steps: 1 to 2 is +1, 2 to 3 is +1 (total 2), 3 to 4 is +1 (3), 4 to 1 is +1 (4), 1 to 2 is +1 (5), 2 to 3 is +1 (6). So total 6 steps.\n\nWait why is that the case? Because perhaps the tasks are done in the order of their indices, but when processing each task, she must be present at that house, but in between, she can move as needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't that she does each task sequentially, but that for each task i, she must arrive at a_i, and then do all tasks j < i at their respective a_j's, but in any order. Or maybe not. No, the problem says \"needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So I think the correct interpretation is that for each i, after doing the i-th task, all previous tasks (j < i) have been done.\n\nWait, no. Maybe it's that for each task i, she must be at a_i at some point before starting task i+1. So the order is strict: task 1, then task 2, ..., then task m. Each task is done when she arrives at a_i, but she can process them in any order as long as all j < i are done before i.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the problem statement.\n\nThe initial position is house 1. She needs to perform m tasks in the order 1, 2, ..., m. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, and she must have completed all tasks j where j < i before proceeding to i. So, the tasks must be done in order, and for each i, she must be at a_i at some point during processing.\n\nSo, the process is: process task 1, then task 2, etc., up to task m. For each task i, she must be at a_i when she processes it.\n\nBut how does this affect her movement?\n\nI think the key is to model the earliest possible time she arrives at each a_i, considering the constraints of moving clockwise along the ring.\n\nEach house is arranged in a ring, so the distance between two houses x and y can be calculated as (y - x) if y >=x, else (n -x + y). Because the ring is circular.\n\nWait, no. For example, if x is 4 and y is 1, the distance is 2 (since 4 →1 is two steps clockwise). So the general formula is min( (y - x) mod n, (x - y) mod n ), but since movement is only allowed in one direction, the distance is always (y -x) mod n, but wait, no.\n\nWait, in this problem, the ring is directed. So the movement is strictly clockwise. So, the path from x to y is the minimal number of steps in the clockwise direction. So the distance is (y - x) mod n, but if y >=x, then it's y -x, else it's n - (x - y).\n\nAlternatively, the distance can be computed as (y -x + n) % n.\n\nWait, yes. Because if x is 4, y is 1, (1-4 +4) mod4 = (1) mod4 =1, which is correct.\n\nSo, to find the minimal steps to get from x to y in the ring, it's (y -x) %n.\n\nBut wait, because the movement is always clockwise, you can't take a shorter path by going counter-clockwise. So the distance from x to y is indeed (y -x) mod n.\n\nSo, now, let's model the problem.\n\nWe have m tasks, in order 1..m. For each i, she must be at a_i when processing task i.\n\nWe need to find the minimal time to process all tasks.\n\nInitially, she's at house 1 at time 0.\n\nFor each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She must be at a_i at some time t_i, and this t_i must be >= t_{i-1} + distance from previous position to a_i.\n\nWait, no. Because she can arrive earlier, but she can't leave until she's ready.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to track her current position and the current time. For each task i, she must reach a_i exactly at some time t_i, which is equal to or later than the time when she arrived at a_i.\n\nWait, but how to model the arrival times for each a_i.\n\nLet me think of it as a series of events. She starts at position 1 at time 0.\n\nFor each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She needs to be at a_i at some time t_i, which must be >= the time she arrives at a_i after moving from her previous position.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is to compute the latest possible time she can arrive at a_i, given the previous positions and the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to arrange that she arrives as late as possible at each a_i, thus allowing more flexibility for future tasks. Because arriving later gives her more time to move to the next a_i.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Because if she arrives earlier at a_i, she might have to leave earlier, which could lead to more waiting time for subsequent tasks.\n\nWait, for example, if she arrives early at a_i, she might have to wait a long time to get to a_j, which is far away.\n\nSo, the idea is to schedule each arrival as late as possible.\n\nSo, for each task i, the arrival time at a_i is the maximum between the earliest possible arrival time (based on previous position) and the latest possible arrival time based on the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the arrival time t_i for each a_i.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- prev_time: the time when she arrives at the previous position (after processing task i-1).\n- prev_pos: the position after processing task i-1.\n\nFor task i, she needs to be at a_i at some time t_i >= prev_time.\n\nThe earliest she can arrive at a_i is the time it takes to move from prev_pos to a_i.\n\nWhich is (a_i - prev_pos) mod n.\n\nSo, the earliest arrival time is prev_time + (a_i - prev_pos) mod n.\n\nBut if this is too early, perhaps she can delay her arrival to a_i to allow more time for other tasks.\n\nWait, but she can't delay beyond the time she arrives at a_i because she has to process the task.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal arrival time at a_i is the maximum between the earliest time (prev_time + distance) and the sum of all previous times plus the distances up to a_i.\n\nNo, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrival time at a_i is the latest possible time such that all the constraints are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the arrival time at a_i should be as large as possible, but not earlier than the time when she arrives there.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to keep track of the latest possible time she can arrive at a_i, given that she must arrive at a_i no earlier than the time she would arrive if she took the direct path from the previous position.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows.\n\nWe'll process each task in order, and for each, calculate the earliest and latest possible arrival time.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo, the tasks are a1=3, a2=2, a3=3.\n\nInitial position is 1, time 0.\n\nTask 1: a1=3.\n\nEarliest arrival time is 0 + (3-1) mod4 = 2.\n\nSo she arrives at 3 at time 2.\n\nTime is 2.\n\nBut perhaps she can delay arrival? No, because task 1 is the first task, so she must arrive at 3 as soon as possible.\n\nSo, she arrives at 3 at time 2.\n\nTask 2: a2=2.\n\nShe needs to arrive at 2 at some time >=2.\n\nWhat is the earliest time she can arrive at 2 from 3?\n\nIt's (2-3) mod4 = ( -1 ) mod4 = 3.\n\nSo, earliest arrival is 2 + 3 =5.\n\nBut wait, no. Because (2-3) mod4 is (4-3 +2) mod4? Wait, (2-3) is -1, mod4 is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo from 3 to 2, it's 3 steps.\n\nSo, arrival time is 2 (previous) +3 =5.\n\nBut wait, perhaps she can wait at 3 until a later time to arrive at 2, but that doesn't help because she can't be in two places at once.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal is to arrive as late as possible at each a_i, but that's not necessarily clear.\n\nWait, maybe another way: for each i, the arrival time at a_i is the maximum of:\n\n- The arrival time based on the previous task's end time plus the distance from the previous position.\n\nOR\n\n- The arrival time based on the sum of the distances from the initial position to a_i, but considering the order of the tasks.\n\nNo, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal arrival time at a_i is the sum of all the distances from 1 to a_1, a_1 to a_2, etc., up to a_{i-1} to a_i}, but that would ignore the order.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the problem of scheduling jobs on a timeline with precedence constraints, and trying to minimize the completion time.\n\nBut in this case, the jobs are ordered, and each job must be processed at a specific location.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the tasks as points on the ring, and find the order in which they are visited, ensuring that for each i, a_i is visited after all a_j where j <i.\n\nWait, but the order is fixed as per the task indices. So task 1 must be done before task 2, which must be done before task 3, etc.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining the order of visiting the required a_i's, ensuring that a_i is visited after a_j for j <i, and finding the minimal total time.\n\nBut in the ring, it's possible that a_i is behind a_j in the ring, but according to the task order, a_i must be visited after a_j.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal time is achieved by arranging the path such that she passes through the a_i's in the order dictated by the task indices, but also considering the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, including from the initial position to a_1, a_1 to a_2, etc., and from a_m back to 1 (if necessary?), but that's unclear.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the a_i's are 3,2,3.\n\nSo, the path is 1 →3 →2 →3.\n\nBut the distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps, 3 to 2 is 3 steps, 2 to 3 is 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1 =6, which matches the sample.\n\nBut what about the order? Because the tasks are 3,2,3.\n\nSo, task 1 is 3, task 2 is 2, task 3 is 3.\n\nSo, the order of visiting is 3, then 2, then 3 again.\n\nSo, the total distance is 2 (from 1 to3) + 3 (3 to2) +1 (2 to3) =6.\n\nSo, the total is 6.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal time is the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair of a_i's, including the distance from the starting point to a_1, and from a_m back to 1? Or wait, no. Because in the sample, after processing the third task, she can stop.\n\nWait, no. Because she has to process all m tasks. Once all tasks are done, she can stay wherever she is.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of the distances between the positions of the a_i's in order, plus the distance from the last a_m back to 1 if needed, but perhaps not, since she can just stop.\n\nWait, but in the sample, after the third task, she is at 3. Since all tasks are done, she doesn't need to move anywhere else. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, starting from 1 to a_1, a_1 to a_2, ..., a_{m-1} to a_m}.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, considering the circular nature of the ring, starting from 1, then a_1, a_2, ..., a_m.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where a_i comes before a_j in the ring, but j < i?\n\nFor example, suppose a_1 is 4, a_2 is 1, and n=4.\n\nIn this case, the order of visiting would require going from 1 to 4, then from 4 to 1.\n\nSo the distance is 1 (from 1 to4) + 4-1=3 steps (from4 to1), totaling 4 steps.\n\nBut in the problem, since task 1 is 4, then task 2 is 1, the order is 4, then 1.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let me compute the distances:\n\nFrom 1 to4: (4-1)=3 steps.\n\nFrom4 to1: (1-4 +4) mod4=1 mod4=1 step.\n\nSo total is 4 steps.\n\nSo, the sum is 3+1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to compute the sum of the distances between the starting point (1) and a_1, a_1 and a_2, a_2 and a_3, etc., up to a_{m-1} and a_m.\n\nBecause after the last task, she doesn't need to return to 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the last a_m is 3, and the sum is 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case in the sample:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the a's are 2,3,3.\n\nSo, the a_i's are 2,3,3.\n\nSo the order is 2,3,3.\n\nCompute the distances:\n\nFrom 1 to2: (2-1)=1.\n\nFrom2 to3: (3-2)=1.\n\nFrom3 to3: 0.\n\nSum is 1+1+0=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Compute the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, starting from 1 to a_1, then a_1 to a_2, etc., up to a_{m-1} to a_m.\n\n- The total time is this sum.\n\nBut wait, how about when a_i is the same as a_{i+1}? Like in the second sample, a_3 is 3, same as a_2.\n\nIn that case, the distance from a_2 to a_3 is zero, so it doesn't add anything.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the tasks in the order of their indices (1 to m).\n\n2. For each consecutive pair (including from 1 to a_1), compute the distance between them in the ring (clockwise direction).\n\n3. Sum all these distances.\n\nThat sum is the minimal time.\n\nWait, but why is that the case?\n\nBecause she must visit each a_i in the order of their indices, and each a_i must be visited after all a_j where j <i.\n\nBut in the ring, the path may involve moving backwards, but the order is enforced by the task indices.\n\nSo, the minimal time is the sum of the distances between the required a_i's in the order they are processed, including the initial step from 1 to a_1.\n\nBut is that always the case?\n\nLet me think of another example.\n\nSuppose n=5, m=4.\n\na = [3,1,4,5].\n\nSo, the order is 3,1,4,5.\n\nCompute the distances:\n\n1 to3: 2 steps.\n\n3 to1: (1-3 +5) mod5 = 3 steps.\n\n1 to4: 3 steps.\n\n4 to5:1 step.\n\nTotal: 2+3+3+1=9.\n\nIs that the minimal time?\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nWait, after reaching 3, she needs to go back to 1, which is 3 steps, then to4, then to5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the sum is 2+3+3+1=9.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=2.\n\na = [5,3].\n\nDistances:\n\n1 to5:4 steps.\n\n5 to3: (3-5 +5) mod5 =3 steps.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if the a_i's are arranged in a way that allows taking a shortcut when returning?\n\nLike, suppose a_1 is 4, a_2 is 2.\n\nn=5.\n\nSo, the sum is (4-1)=3 steps from 1 to4, then (2-4 +5)=3 steps from4 to2.\n\nTotal 6.\n\nBut in reality, the minimal path is 1→4→3→2, which is 3+2=5 steps. Wait, that's better than the sum.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, in this scenario, the a_i's are 4 (task1) and 2 (task2).\n\nSo, after task1, she is at4. Then, for task2, she needs to be at2.\n\nSo, the distance from4 to2 is (2-4) mod5 = ( -2 ) mod5=3 steps. So 4→5→1→2: 3 steps.\n\nSo, total 3+3=6 steps.\n\nBut wait, the alternative path is 1→4→3→2, which is 3 steps (1→4) and then 3 steps (4→3→2). That's 3+3=6 steps as well.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum is 3+3=6.\n\nBut the alternative path is same as the sum.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach still holds.\n\nAnother example: n=5, a=[4,2].\n\nSum is 3 (1→4) +3 (4→2) =6.\n\nBut perhaps another path exists.\n\nWait, what's the minimal path?\n\nShe starts at1, goes to4 (3 steps), then to2 (3 steps), total 6.\n\nAlternatively, could she find a shorter path?\n\nNo, because the movement is strictly clockwise. So, from4, the path to2 is via5,1,2: 3 steps.\n\nSo, the sum approach is correct.\n\nWait, another example: n=6, a = [5,3].\n\nSo, sum is (5-1) =4 steps (1→2→3→4→5), then (3-5) mod6= ( -2 ) mod6=4 steps (5→6→1→2→3). Total 8 steps.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a more efficient path exists.\n\nWait, after 5, she can go directly to3 via 6,1,2,3: 4 steps. So same as sum.\n\nNo, no shortcut here.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, a=[2,4,1].\n\nSum is:\n\n1→2:1.\n\n2→4:2.\n\n4→1: (1-4 +5) mod5=2 steps.\n\nTotal 1+2+2=5.\n\nBut the actual path is 1→2→3→4→5→1: 5 steps.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in all these examples, the sum approach seems to give the correct result.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is simply to compute the sum of the distances between the consecutive a_i's, including from the initial position to a_1.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a_i's are in a certain order that allows for overlapping paths.\n\nWait, another example: n=5, a = [5,5,5].\n\nThen, the sum is:\n\n1→5:4 steps.\n\n5→5:0.\n\n5→5:0.\n\nTotal 4 steps.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [5,4,3,2,1].\n\nSum is:\n\n1→5:4 steps.\n\n5→4: (4-5 +5) mod5=4 steps.\n\n4→3:1 step.\n\n3→2:1 step.\n\n2→1:1 step.\n\nTotal 4+4+1+1+1=11.\n\nBut the actual path is 1→2→3→4→5→1→2→3→4→5→1→2→3→4→5→1, which is way longer.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because in this case, the a_i's are 5,4,3,2,1.\n\nSo, the order of visiting is 5, then4, then3, etc.\n\nWait, but she can't go from5 to4 directly; she has to move clockwise, so from5, she can only go to1, then2, then3, then4.\n\nSo, from5 to4 is 4 steps.\n\nSo the sum approach is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, starting from 1 to a_1, a_1 to a_2, ..., a_{m}.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, we considered a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nWait, the initial position is 1.\n\nThen, for each i from1 to m, compute the distance from the previous position to a_i.\n\nWait, no. The previous position is the position after the previous a_i.\n\nWait, the initial position is 1. Then, for i=1, the a_i is a_1, so the distance is from 1 to a_1.\n\nFor i=2, it's from a_1 to a_2.\n\nFor i=3, from a_2 to a_3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read n, m.\n\n2. Read the list a as a list of integers.\n\n3. Initialize prev_position to 1.\n\n4. Initialize total_time to 0.\n\n5. For each i in 0 to m-1:\n\n   a. current_a = a[i]\n\n   b. distance = (current_a - prev_position) %n\n\n   c. total_time += distance\n\n   d. prev_position = current_a\n\n6. Output total_time.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1:\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0, current_a=3.\n\ndistance = (3-1) mod4= 2. total_time=2.\n\nprev_position=3.\n\ni=1, current_a=2.\n\ndistance=(2-3) mod4= ( -1 ) mod4=3. total_time=5.\n\ni=2, current_a=3.\n\ndistance= (3-2) mod4=1. total_time=6.\n\nSo correct.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\na = [2,3,3]\n\ni=0: current_a=2.\n\ndistance= (2-1)=1. total=1.\n\ni=1: current_a=3.\n\ndistance= (3-2)=1. total=2.\n\ni=2: current_a=3.\n\ndistance=0. total remains 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=[5,3], n=5.\n\ni=0: current_a=5. distance=4. total=4.\n\ni=1: current_a=3. distance=(3-5) mod5= ( -2 ) mod5=3. total=7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a as a list of integers.\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor each x in a:\n\n    d = (x - prev) %n\n\n    total +=d\n\n    prev =x\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about the initial position being 1, and the first x is a[0], which is a_1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this logic against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\na = [3,2,3].\n\nprev=1.\n\nx=3: d=2, total=2.\n\nx=2: d=(2-3)%4= 3, total=5.\n\nx=3: d=1, total=6. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\na = [2,3,3].\n\nx=2: d=1, total=1.\n\nx=3: d=1, total=2.\n\nx=3: d=0, total=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a = [4,2], n=5.\n\nx=4: d=3, total=3.\n\nx=2: d= (2-4) mod5= 3, total=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, the Python code would be:\n\nRead n, m from input.\n\nRead the a list.\n\nCompute as above.\n\nNow, considering that the input may have leading/trailing spaces, and that the a list is read correctly.\n\nIn Python, the code would look like:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor x in a:\n\n    d = (x - prev) %n\n\n    total +=d\n\n    prev =x\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait, in the first sample, the a list is 3,2,3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a = [5,4,3,2,1].\n\nn=5.\n\nprev=1.\n\nx=5: d=4. total=4.\n\nx=4: (4-5) mod5=4. total=8.\n\nx=3: (3-4) mod5=4. total=12.\n\nx=2: (2-3) mod5=4. total=16.\n\nx=1: (1-2) mod5=4. total=20.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final code is as above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house 1 and moves clockwise along the ring road. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to move clockwise around a ring of `n` houses to complete `m` tasks. Each task `i` requires her to be at house `a[i]` after completing all previous tasks.\n2. **Intuition**: The key insight is that the optimal path involves moving from the starting point (house 1) to the first task location, then to the next task location, and so on. The minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive task locations, considering the circular nature of the ring road.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the input values for `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks).\n   - Read the list of task locations.\n   - Calculate the distance from the current position to the next task location using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular ring.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprev = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in a:\n    d = (x - prev) % n\n    total += d\n    prev = x\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of task locations.\n- **Initialization**: Start from house 1 with `prev` set to 1 and `total` time initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task location using `(x - prev) % n`. This ensures the correct distance considering the ring structure.\n- **Update Position and Time**: After computing the distance, update the current position `prev` to the task location and add the distance to the total time.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the properties of modulo arithmetic to handle the circular ring structure, ensuring an optimal solution.",
