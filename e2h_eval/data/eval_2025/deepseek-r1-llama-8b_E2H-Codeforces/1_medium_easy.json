    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that's divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We need to add k golden rings. Each ring is like a border around the plate, but each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one. So, the first ring is along the very edge, the second is two cells in, and so on.\n\nWait, no, wait. The i-th ring is made by considering an inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side, which is 2*2=4 subtracted per dimension.\n\nThe task is to compute the total number of cells that are gilded, meaning all the cells in these rings.\n\nHmm. So for each ring from 1 to k, we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all up.\n\nWait, because each ring is the perimeter of a rectangle. So for each i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if that's possible. Wait, but the problem states that k is given such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible rings. So we don't have to worry about cases where the rectangle becomes too small.\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle has width w_i = w - 4*(i-1) and height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the number of cells in that ring is the perimeter minus 4 (since the corners are counted twice when adding width and height).\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle with w_i and h_i is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), because each side contributes (length) cells, but the four corners are included in both length and width. So for example, a 3x3 square has perimeter 8: (3+3)*2 -4 = 8.\n\nYes. So the formula for the number of cells in the i-th ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current w_i and h_i.\n   b. Calculate 2*(w_i + h_i - 2).\n   c. Sum all these values across i=1 to k.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input: three integers w, h, k.\n\nThen, initialize a total variable to 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n   compute w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   compute h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   if either w_i or h_i is <=0, but since k is given within constraints, this shouldn't happen.\n   then, add 2*(w_i + h_i -2) to total.\n\nFinally, output the total as a string.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 1\nFor i=1:\nw_i =3, h_i=3.\ncells = 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9 1\ni=1: w=7, h=9.\ncells= 2*(7+9-2)= 2*(14)=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:\n7 9 2.\ni=1: 7+9-2=14, *2 is 28.\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3+5-2=6, *2=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5: perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)=16.\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So 2*(1+1-2)=0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, wait, but wait, a 1x1 square has perimeter 0? That makes sense because there's only one cell, but the ring would not exist beyond a certain point. But according to the problem statement, k is limited such that each ring is possible. So in this case, perhaps k can't be 2 for 5x5.\n\nWait, let's see. The maximum k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. So the sample is invalid.\n\nWait another example: w=11, h=15, k=3.\n\ni=1: 11x15 → perimeter 2*(11+15-2) = 2*(24)=48.\ni=2: 11-4=7, 15-4=11 → 2*(7+11-2)= 2*16=32. Total 80 so far.\ni=3: 11-8=3, 15-8=7 → 2*(3+7-2)= 2*8=16. Total 96.\n\nSo overall 48+32+16=96.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nSo in code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    wi = w - 4*(i-1)\n    hi = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(wi + hi -2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if wi or hi is less than or equal to zero? According to the problem statement, k is such that the rings can be formed. So in code, we don't have to handle that.\n\nTesting sample input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + (3+5-2)*2 = 28 + 12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 3x3, k=1 → 8. Correct.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that has been divided into `w` rows and `h` columns. The plate has `k` gilded rings, each forming a border around the plate, with each subsequent ring being two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle it forms. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w_i` and height `h_i` is calculated as `2 * (w_i + h_i - 2)`.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the perimeter and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle formed by that ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)` and add this value to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled within the constraints provided.",
