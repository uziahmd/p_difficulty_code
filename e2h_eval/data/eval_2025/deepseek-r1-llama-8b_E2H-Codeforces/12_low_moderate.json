The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be in ai by the time she completes all tasks before i. Wait, no—the description says she needs to be in ai for the i-th task and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Wait, the way the problem is phrased: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh wait, maybe that means that for each task i, she must have already completed all j < i tasks. So the i-th task must be done after all the previous ones. \n\nSo the tasks are processed in order 1 to m. Each task i requires her to be at ai at some point. But the exact timing depends on when she arrives there, considering she has to do all earlier tasks first.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal total time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm, okay, so the approach is to model her path through the tasks, making sure that for each i, she's at ai at the right time.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. \n\nEach task i requires her to reach ai, and she must arrive at ai no later than the time she finishes all prior tasks. But she can't start task i until she's arrived at ai. Wait, no—she must have arrived at ai at some point before or during the processing of the task. Because each task is sequential, meaning she can't do task 2 until she's done task 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows: She starts at house 1 at time 0. Then, for each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She must be at ai at some time before or equal to the current time plus the time taken to get there.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's better to model each step as the time when she arrives at each ai, ensuring that each arrival happens after the previous steps.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the timeline. She starts at house 1 at time 0. Then, for each task, she has to move to the required house, and the time taken is the distance from her current position to the new one.\n\nWait, let's take the example given.\n\nIn the first example input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo the sequence is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\n\nTotal steps: 6.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nTime 0: at 1.\n\nTask 1: go to 3. Path is 1→2→3. That's 2 steps. Time becomes 2.\n\nTask 2: go to 2. From 3, to 2 is one step back? Wait, no. Because the ring is one-way, so you can't go counter-clockwise. So, from 3, the next is 4, then 1, then 2. So the distance from 3 to 2 is 3 steps (3→4→1→2). Wait, but in the example, the movement was 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps, but the total steps were 6. Wait, perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, in the example explanation, the sequence is 1 →2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. So let's count the steps:\n\nFrom 1 to 2: 1 step.\n\n2 to 3: another.\n\n3 to 4: third.\n\n4 to 1: fourth.\n\n1 to 2: fifth.\n\n2 to 3: sixth.\n\nTotal of 6 steps.\n\nSo for each task, she moves to the required ai, but the order in which she does this affects the total time.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the order of visiting the required houses such that for each task i, she arrives at ai as early as possible, but without having to make unnecessary detours.\n\nWait, but the order of the tasks is fixed. Because the problem says she has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i before the i-th task. So she can't rearrange the order; the i-th task comes after all j < i tasks.\n\nSo the tasks are processed in order 1, 2, ..., m. For each task i, she must have been at",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks while moving along a ring-shaped road. The key is to model her movement in such a way that she can complete each task as efficiently as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit specific houses in a given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete each task in sequence without skipping any. The challenge is to find the shortest path that allows her to complete all tasks in the given order with minimal time.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Since the ring road is one-way and clockwise, Xenia can only move from house `i` to house `i+1`. Therefore, the shortest path between two houses can be determined by considering the clockwise direction.\n\n3. **Optimal Path Calculation**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from her current position to the required house for the task. Summing these distances gives the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensure that the calculation correctly handles the ring structure, especially when wrapping around from the last house back to the first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor ai in tasks:\n    # Calculate the distance from current to ai\n    if ai > current:\n        distance = ai - current\n    else:\n        distance = (n - current) + ai\n    time += distance\n    current = ai\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of task destinations.\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1 with `time` initialized to 0.\n- **Processing Each Task**: For each task destination `ai`, calculate the shortest distance from the current house to `ai` considering the ring structure. Update the total time and current position.\n- **Output**: The accumulated time after processing all tasks is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes each task in the given order with minimal time by always taking the shortest possible path on the ring road.",
