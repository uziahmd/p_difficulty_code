Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. Hmm. So the idea is that Vasily has some initial candles, and when he burns them, they become stubs. Then he can exchange a certain number of stubs to get new candles. And the question is, how many hours in total can he keep the room lit?\n\nLet me think about the example. The first sample input is 4 2. So he starts with 4 candles. Each burns for 1 hour. After burning all 4, he has 4 stubs. Since b is 2, he can make 4/2=2 new candles. Now, those two burn for another 2 hours, adding to the total. But wait, after burning these, he gets 2 more stubs. With b=2, he can make one more candle. That burns for 1 hour. So the total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nSo the process is: you add the initial a, then use as much as possible to create new candles from the stubs, each time adding the new candles' hours and the resulting stubs again.\n\nSo the approach is to model this as a loop: while the number of stubs is >= b, we can exchange them for new candles, which gives us (stubs // b) new ones. Each new candle adds to the total hours. Also, the remaining stubs after division are added back into the pool.\n\nWait, but the stubs come from the new candles. For example, when you create new_candles = stubs // b, the number of new stubs is new_candles (since each new candle burns for 1 hour and becomes a stub). So after each step, stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nSo that's the loop.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample.\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4\n\nstubs=4.\n\n4 >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2. total becomes 6.\n\nstubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=1. total is 7.\n\nstubs=0 +1=1. Now 1<2, so loop stops. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6.\n\nstubs=6.\n\n6//3=2, total=8.\n\nstubs=6%3=0+2=2. Now 2<3, loop ends. So output is 8.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nWhat about another test case? Like a=5, b=5.\n\nInitially, total=5.\n\nstubs=5.\n\n5//5=1. total=6.\n\nstubs=0+1=1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nStart with 10. Burn all.\n\nStubs=10.\n\n10//3=3, add to total (13).\n\nStubs=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3: yes.\n\n4//3=1. total 14.\n\nStubs=1+1=2 <3. Done.\n\nSo total is 14.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n10 -> 3 new (from 10), 3 burn, 3 stubs. So total 10+3=13.\n\nThen 3 stubs plus 1 from the remainder (wait, no: initial stubs after 10 were 10. After making 3, stubs become 1 (from 10%3) +3=4.\n\nIn next step: 4//3=1. So now total is 13+1=14.\n\nStubs becomes 4%3=1, plus 1 (from the new candle) → 2. Loop stops. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe need to read two integers a and b from input.\n\nCompute as per the above logic.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where a is less than b. Then no new candles can be made. So total is a.\n\nLike a=3, b=5 → 3.\n\nAnother case where a is exactly divisible by b. E.g., a=5, b=5 → 5 +1=6.\n\nWhat about a=0? But according to the problem statement, a is at least 1.\n\nSo the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nThe input is given as a single line with two integers. So in Python, something like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as per the loop.\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute total and stubs.\n\nLoop.\n\nPrint.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nTesting this against the samples:\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → 7.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 →8.\n\nAnother test case: 5,5 →6.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a stub. Vasily can exchange a certain number of these stubs to make new candles, which can be burned again.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a` and the number of stubs needed to make a new candle `b`.\n2. **Burn Initial Candles**: Burn all initial candles, which adds `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Use a loop to continuously recycle stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle. For each iteration:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the current stubs.\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the number of stubs to reflect the remainder after making new candles plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop stops when there are not enough stubs to make another candle, and the total hours are printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers from the input, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to make a new candle).\n- **Total Hours Calculation**: Initialize the total hours with the initial number of candles `a`.\n- **Loop for Recycling**: Use a while loop to repeatedly create new candles from the stubs. In each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made, add their burn time to the total, and update the stub count.\n- **Update Stubs**: After each iteration, update the number of stubs to include both the remainder from the division and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n- **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum illumination time by continuously recycling stubs until no more candles can be made, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
