            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals, and handling other bases.\n\nFirst, let me understand the input format. The first line gives a and b, where b can be 'R'. The second line gives c in base a. So, I need to read this c, possibly converting it into an integer, then represent it in base b, which could be the Roman system.\n\nWait, so the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the input c as a number in base a.\n2. Convert this number into an integer (base 10).\n3. Then, if the target base (b) is not Roman, convert the integer to base b as a string.\n4. If the target base is Roman (i.e., 'R'), then we need to represent the integer as a Roman numeral string.\n\nHmm, right. So, the plan is:\n\n- Read a and b. If b is 'R', then the output is a Roman numeral. Else, output the number in base b as a string.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the case where the target base is Roman? For example, if the input is '5 R', meaning the number is 5 in base a, and I need to output it in Roman numerals as 'V'.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the input correctly.\n\nLet's think about the steps in code:\n\n1. Read the first line: a and b. But b can be 'R' or an integer.\n   - For example, if the line is '16 R\\n5', then a=16, b='R'.\n   - Or if it's '12 13\\nA', then a=12, b=13.\n\nSo, in code, I'll split the first line into a and b. But since b can be 'R', which is a string, I need to check if the second part is 'R'.\n\nSo, the code will be something like:\na, b = input().split()\nif b == 'R':\n    roman_mode = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b)\n    roman_mode = False\n\nThen, read the next line: c_str. It's a string representing a number in base a.\n\nNow, I need to convert c_str from base a to an integer. So, I'll write a function to convert a string in base a to an integer.\n\nWait, but for that, I can iterate through each character, multiply by a^(position) and sum. Also, since leading zeros are allowed, the function should handle that.\n\nWait, no, leading zeros are allowed, but when outputting, they should be omitted except for zero, which isn't the case here because the problem says it won't be zero.\n\nSo, function to convert c_str from base a to decimal:\n\ndef str_to_int(c_str, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        digit = int(ch)\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nOnce I have the integer value, I need to convert it into base b or into a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, next, I need two functions:\n\n1. Function to convert an integer to a Roman numeral string.\n2. Function to convert an integer to a string in a given base (base >= 2, up to 25).\n\nLet's tackle the base conversion first.\n\nFor base conversion, for a given integer n and base b, we can repeatedly divide by b and collect the remainders. However, we have to make sure to collect the digits in the correct order.\n\nWait, no: when you divide n by b, the remainder is the least significant digit. So, for example, 5 in base 2 is 101. So, 5//2=2, remainder 1; 2//2=1, rem 0; 1//2=0, rem 1. So, the remainders are collected in reverse order.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(str(rem))\n        n = n // base\n    digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(digits)\n\nWait, but what if the base is larger than 10? Then, the digits beyond 9 are represented as letters A, B, etc. So, for base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nSo, in the function, for each digit, if it's less than 10, use its str representation. Otherwise, add ord('A') plus (digit-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the number to an integer, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values for bases `a` and `b`. If `b` is 'R', we will convert the number to Roman numerals; otherwise, we convert it to a standard base.\n2. **Convert String to Integer**: Convert the given number string from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Convert Integer to Base `b` or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If converting to a standard base, repeatedly divide the integer by the base and collect remainders to form the result string.\n   - If converting to Roman numerals, use predefined mappings for Roman symbols and handle subtractive combinations for numbers greater than 1000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_int(c_str, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        digit = int(ch)\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(digits)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\na_b = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b[0])\nb = a_b[1]\nif b == 'R':\n    roman_mode = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b)\n    roman_mode = False\n\nc_line = lines[1]\nc_str = c_line.split()[0]\n\n# Convert c_str from base a to integer\nc = str_to_int(c_str, a)\n\n# Convert to target base or Roman\nif roman_mode:\n    print(int_to_roman(c))\nelse:\n    print(int_to_base(c, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line. The first line contains bases `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R'. The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **String to Integer Conversion**: The function `str_to_int` converts the string representation of a number from any base to a decimal integer.\n3. **Integer to Base Conversion**: The function `int_to_base` converts the decimal integer to the specified base, handling bases greater than 10 by converting digits above 9 to letters.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `int_to_roman` converts the decimal integer to a Roman numeral string using predefined mappings and subtractive combinations for efficiency and correctness.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is correctly converted from any base `a` to the target base `b` or Roman numerals efficiently and accurately.",
