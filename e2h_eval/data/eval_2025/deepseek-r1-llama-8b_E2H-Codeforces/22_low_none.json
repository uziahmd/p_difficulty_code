After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that particular subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, the input is n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters. For each subject, we need to find which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in at least one subject. The count of such students is what we need to output.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each student's data. For each subject (each position in the string), I should track the maximum mark across all students for that subject. Then, for each student, I check if for any subject, their mark equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n\nWait, but for each subject, only the maximum mark is important. So perhaps for each subject, I can find the maximum value and then for each student, see if in any subject they have that maximum.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and m from the input.\n2. For each of the next n lines, read the string representing the student's marks.\n3. For each subject (0 to m-1), keep track of the maximum mark found so far across all students.\n4. After processing all students, for each subject, we know the maximum mark.\n5. Now, for each student, check if in any of their m marks, the mark is equal to the maximum for that subject.\n6. Count the number of students who have at least one such mark.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for a subject, the maximum is fixed, so any student who has that max in that subject is the best for that subject.\n\nSo, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the students' marks as a list of strings. For each subject, we can iterate through all students and find the maximum mark.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, we can collect all the marks from each student, then take the maximum.\n\nBut wait, for m subjects, each with n marks, this could be manageable since n and m are up to 100. So 10^4 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Create a list called max_marks, where max_marks[i] is the maximum mark for subject i.\n- For each i from 0 to m-1:\n   - Initialize max_marks[i] to 0.\n   - For each student:\n      - Get their mark in subject i (which is the ith character of their string)\n      - If this mark is larger than current max_marks[i], update max_marks[i].\n- Once we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks equals the corresponding max_marks for that subject.\n- If yes, count them as successful.\n\nWait, but how do we get the marks for each subject?\n\nEach student's string is a sequence of m characters. So for student j, their marks are in a list, say s = list(student_string). Then, for subject i, s[i] is their mark.\n\nSo, let's structure the code accordingly.\n\nIn Python, I'll first read n and m. Then read n lines, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, then process each line into a list of characters.\n\nSo:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append( list(line) )\n\nThen, compute the max_marks for each subject:\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor i in range(m):\n    current_max = 0\n    for student in students:\n        mark = int(student[i])\n        if mark > current_max:\n            current_max = mark\n    max_marks[i] = current_max\n\nWait, but wait: in the input example given, like the first sample input is ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'], which is read as three students: '223', '232', '112'.\n\nSo for each student, their marks are a string of length m.\n\nOnce max_marks is filled, then for each student, check if any of their marks is equal to the corresponding max_marks.\n\nSo, for each student in students:\n\nis_successful = False\nfor i in range(m):\n    if student[i] == str(max_marks[i]):\n        is_successful = True\n        break\nif is_successful:\n    count +=1\n\nAlternatively, since the max_marks are integers, and the student's marks are strings, maybe we need to convert them to integers before comparison.\n\nWait, in the code above, when I process the student's marks, I'm converting to integers. Or wait, in the code above,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, we read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, we read each student's marks as a string.\n2. **Track Maximum Marks:** For each subject, we track the maximum mark achieved by any student. This helps us identify which student is the best in each subject.\n3. **Identify Successful Students:** For each student, we check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append(list(line))\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    current_max = 0\n    for student in students:\n        mark = int(student[i])\n        if mark > current_max:\n            current_max = mark\n    max_marks[i] = current_max\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for i in range(m):\n        if str(int(student[i])) == str(max_marks[i]):\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** We start by reading the number of students and subjects. Each student's marks are stored as a list of characters.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks:** For each subject, we iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This information is stored in `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Success:** For each student, we compare their marks with the maximum marks for each subject. If they match any subject's maximum, the student is successful.\n4. **Output Result:** Finally, we count and print the number of successful students.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines successful students by leveraging the maximum marks for each subject, ensuring we only need to traverse the data a limited number of times.",
