Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers for his vacation. The conditions are that the sum of their durations is exactly x days, and they don't overlap. Also, he wants to minimize the total cost.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i != j) such that:\n\n1. Their combined duration equals x.\n2. They don't overlap. So either voucher i ends before voucher j starts, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as small as possible.\n\nThe output should be the minimal total cost, or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nSo first, I need to find all pairs of vouchers where the sum of their durations is x. Then, among those pairs, check if they are non-overlapping, and find the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently find these pairs? Because n can be up to 2e5, checking all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties required for two vouchers i and j.\n\nSuppose voucher i has duration d1 = (ri - li + 1), voucher j has duration d2 = (rj - lj + 1). We need d1 + d2 = x.\n\nSo for each voucher, I can compute what other vouchers would have a duration of x - d1, and then check if they are compatible (non-overlapping) and find the minimal cost.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut even so, for each voucher, how do I quickly find all possible vouchers that fit the required duration and are non-overlapping?\n\nLet's think about the structure.\n\nEach voucher has li, ri, cost.\n\nFor a given voucher i, I want to find all vouchers j where d_j = x - d_i, and (ri < lj OR rj < li).\n\nWait, but j can't be the same as i, since i != j.\n\nSo for each voucher i, I can calculate the needed duration for j: needed_d = x - d_i.\n\nIf needed_d is negative, skip.\n\nThen, I need to find vouchers j with duration needed_d, and which are either entirely before i or entirely after i.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a data structure that allows us to query for vouchers with a specific duration and certain time constraints.\n\n2. For each voucher i, compute needed_d = x - d_i. If needed_d <=0, skip.\n\n3. Find all vouchers j with duration needed_d, and either:\n\n   a. rj < li: j is completely before i.\n\n   b. lj > ri: j is completely after i.\n\n4. Among these j's, find the one with the minimal cost, add it to i's cost, and track the global minimum.\n\nNow, the question is how to efficiently perform step 3.\n\nIdea: For each possible duration d, maintain a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each d, have the vouchers sorted by their end time (ri) and start time (li).\n\nThis way, when we look for j's with needed_d, we can quickly find vouchers that end before i's start, or start after i's end.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the plan.\n\n- Create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of tuples (ri, cost). Wait, no—wait, the vouchers need to be sorted so that for a given i, we can find j's that end before li, or start after ri.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by ri (end time): so for j to end before i's start, we can binary search in this list for j's where ri < li.\n\n- Sorted by lj (start time): for j to start after i's end, we can binary search for lj > ri.\n\nWait, but for j to start after i's end, it's sufficient that lj > ri. So for each d, we can have a list of j's sorted by their start time.\n\nSimilarly, for j's ending before i's start, j's ri must be < i's li. So for each d, we can have a list of j's sorted by ri.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a structure where for each duration d, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted_ri: list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri.\n\n   b. Sorted_li: list of (li, cost) sorted by li.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each d, the vouchers with duration d can be stored in two separate sorted structures:\n\n- Sorted by ri, so for any i, I can find all j's with d_j = needed_d and ri < li.\n\n- Sorted by li, so I can find all j's with d_j = needed_d and li > ri.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for j to end before i's start (ri_j < li_i), we need j's ri to be less than li_i. So for each d, we can have a sorted list of j's (vouchers) ordered by their ri. Then, for a given li_i, we can binary search to find all j's in this list where ri_j < li_i.\n\nSimilarly, for j to start after i's end (li_j > ri_i), we can have a sorted list of j's ordered by li_j, and for a given ri_i, find all j's with li_j > ri_i.\n\nWait, but for each d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by ri (for j's that end early).\n\n- Another sorted by li (for j's that start late).\n\nSo the steps for each voucher i would be:\n\n- Compute needed_d = x - d_i.\n\n- Check if needed_d is positive. If not, continue.\n\n- If needed_d is not present in our duration dictionary, continue.\n\n- Otherwise, get the list of j's with duration needed_d.\n\n   a. For j's that end before i starts: in the sorted_ri list, find all j's with ri_j < li_i. The minimal cost among them plus i's cost is a candidate.\n\n   b. For j's that start after i ends: in the sorted_li list, find all j's with li_j > ri_i. The minimal cost among them plus i's cost is another candidate.\n\nWe need to find the minimal cost across all possible j's for each i.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\n- Group all vouchers by their duration d. For each d, create two lists:\n\n   - A list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri.\n\n   - A list of (li, cost) sorted by li.\n\nThis way, for any needed_d, we can access these lists quickly.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher i:\n\n1. Calculate d_i = ri_i - li_i + 1.\n\n2. needed_d = x - d_i.\n\n3. If needed_d is not in the duration groups, continue.\n\n4. For j's that end before i starts:\n\n   a. Access the sorted_ri list for needed_d.\n\n   b. Use binary search to find all j's where ri_j < li_i.\n\n   c. Among these, find the one with minimal cost.\n\n   d. If any exists, add to the possible candidates.\n\n5. For j's that start after i ends:\n\n   a. Access the sorted_li list for needed_d.\n\n   b. Use binary search to find all j's where li_j > ri_i.\n\n   c. Among these, find the minimal cost.\n\n6. Add the minimal found cost (if any) to i's cost, and update the overall minimal result.\n\nWe'll track the minimal total cost across all such valid pairs.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, group the vouchers by duration.\n\nIn Python, a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a tuple of two lists: one sorted by ri, the other sorted by li.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, store a list of all j's with that duration, and also have two sorted versions.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each d, we can sort the list of j's by ri and li separately.\n\nSo for each voucher j:\n\n- Append to a dictionary, say duration_dict[d].append(j)\n\nThen, for each d in duration_dict, we can create two sorted lists:\n\nduration_dict[d]['sorted_ri'] = sorted(voucher list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nduration_dict[d]['sorted_li'] = sorted(voucher list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nWait, but each voucher is a tuple (li, ri, cost). So for the 'sorted_ri' list, we sort by ri, which is the second element of each tuple.\n\nWait, no: for each voucher j, j is (li_j, ri_j, cost_j). So for the 'sorted_ri' list, we need to sort based on ri_j. So the key for sorting is x[1].\n\nSimilarly, for 'sorted_li', the key is x[0].\n\nSo for each d, after collecting all j's, we can create two sorted lists:\n\nsorted_ri = sorted(j for j in duration_dict[d]), where j is (li_j, ri_j, cost_j), sorted by ri_j.\n\nsorted_li = same list, sorted by li_j.\n\nOnce this is done, for each i, we can process as follows:\n\nCompute needed_d.\n\nCheck if needed_d is present in duration_dict.\n\nIf yes, for the needed_d group:\n\na. For the 'sorted_ri' list, find all j's with ri_j < i_li.\n\n   How? Since the list is sorted by ri_j, we can perform a binary search to find the largest index where ri_j < i_li. All elements before that index are candidates.\n\n   Then, among these, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nb. Similarly, for the 'sorted_li' list, find all j's with li_j > i_ri.\n\n   Again, binary search to find the first index where li_j > i_ri. All elements from that index onwards are candidates.\n\n   Among these, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nWe can use the bisect module in Python for this.\n\nSo for part a:\n\nUsing bisect.bisect_left on the sorted_ri list, with the key being ri_j. We want the insertion point for i_li. So all j's with ri_j < i_li are in the range [0, pos).\n\nSimilarly, for part b:\n\nUsing bisect.bisect_right on the sorted_li list, looking for i_ri. The insertion point gives the first index where li_j > i_ri. So all j's from [pos, len(list)) are candidates.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nbisect.bisect_left returns the first position where the element can be inserted. So for the sorted_ri list, which is sorted in ascending order of ri_j, to find all j's with ri_j < target (i_li), we can find the leftmost position where ri_j >= target, and take all elements before that.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the list is sorted, for example [2,4,5,7], and target is 5:\n\nbisect.bisect_left returns index 2, meaning that all elements before index 2 (elements 0 and 1) have ri_j < 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for part a, the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\n# For needed_d, get the sorted_ri list\nif needed_d in duration_dict:\n    sorted_ri_list = duration_dict[needed_d]['sorted_ri']\n    # find the rightmost j with ri_j < i_li\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri_list, (i_li, ...)) ? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the sorted_ri_list is a list of tuples (li_j, ri_j, cost_j), sorted by ri_j.\n\nSo for each j in sorted_ri_list, j[1] is ri_j.\n\nWe need to find all j where ri_j < i_li.\n\nSo to perform a binary search on the sorted_ri_list, extracting the ri_j's.\n\nWe can create a list of just the ri_j's for bisect purposes.\n\nOr, since each element in the list is a tuple, we can extract the ri_j's as a separate list.\n\nWait, but that's O(n) for each d, which is not efficient.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute for each d, a list of just the ri_j's for the sorted_ri list, and a corresponding list of costs.\n\nSo for each d, we have:\n\nsorted_ri_list = sorted list of (ri_j, cost_j) ?\n\nNo, wait, because each j is a tuple (li_j, ri_j, cost_j). So perhaps it's better to have the sorted_ri_list be a list of (ri_j, cost_j), and then the li_j is irrelevant for this purpose.\n\nWait, no.

Because pos is 2, the elements before pos are 0 to 1.\n\nSo the minimal is prefix_min_ri[2], but wait, prefix_min_ri is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min_ri[0] is the cost of the first element.\n\nprefix_min_ri[1] is the min of first and second.\n\nprefix_min_ri[2] is min of first, second, third.\n\nSo if pos is 2, then the elements 0,1,2 are in consideration.\n\nBut wait, no—because j's with ri_j < i_li are 0,1. So pos is 2, but the prefix_min_ri up to pos-1 (1) is the min up to index 1.\n\nAh, right! Because the insertion point is 2, which is the first index where ri_j >= i_li.\n\nSo the elements before pos are 0 to 1, which are j's with ri_j < i_li.\n\nSo the minimal cost is prefix_min_ri[pos-1], provided pos>0.\n\nSimilarly, for part b:\n\nbisect_right returns the first index where li_j > i_ri.\n\nSo j's from pos onward have li_j > i_ri.\n\nThus, the minimal cost is suffix_min_li[pos].\n\nBut wait, suffix_min_li is the minimal from pos to end.\n\nSo for example:\n\nsorted_li_list is [1,3,5,7]\n\ni_ri is 4.\n\nbisect_right finds the first index where li_j >4, which is 2 (since 5 is at index 2).\n\nSo j's from index 2 onwards have li_j >4.\n\nSo the minimal cost is suffix_min_li[2].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for part a is:\n\nif pos >0:\n\n   min_a = prefix_min_ri[pos-1]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_a = infinity\n\nAnd for part b:\n\nif pos < len(li_list):\n\n   min_b = suffix_min_li[pos]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_b = infinity\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each as li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup into vouchers_by_duration.\n\nFor each d in vouchers_by_duration:\n\n   sorted_ri_list = sorted(voucher for voucher in vouchers_by_duration[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   # wait, no: for each voucher, it's (li, ri, cost).

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals the given vacation duration `x` and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for these vouchers using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers**: Group vouchers by their duration. For each duration, maintain two sorted lists: one sorted by the end day of the vouchers and another sorted by the start day.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Minimums**: For each sorted list, compute prefix minimums (for end days) and suffix minimums (for start days). These help in quickly finding the minimum cost for valid vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each voucher, determine the required duration for the second voucher. Use binary search to efficiently find valid vouchers that either end before the current voucher starts or start after it ends.\n4. **Cost Calculation**: For each valid pair of vouchers, calculate the total cost and keep track of the minimum cost found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    x = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        ri = int(input[idx+1])\n        cost = int(input[idx+2])\n        vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n        idx +=3\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    duration_dict = {}\n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        li, ri, cost = voucher\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        if d not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[d] = []\n        duration_dict[d].append(voucher)\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration's data\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        data = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted_ri: sorted by ri, with (ri, cost)\n        sorted_ri_list = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ri_costs = [ (x[1], x[2]) for x in sorted_ri_list ]\n        # Compute prefix_min_ri\n        prefix_min_ri = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for r, c in ri_costs:\n            current_min = min(current_min, c)\n            prefix_min_ri.append(current_min)\n        \n        # Process sorted_li: sorted by li, with (li, cost)\n        sorted_li_list = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        li_costs = [ (x[0], x[2]) for x in sorted_li_list ]\n        # Compute suffix_min_li\n        suffix_min_li = [float('inf')] * len(li_costs)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(li_costs)-1, -1, -1):\n            current_min = min(current_min, li_costs[i][1])\n            suffix_min_li[i] = current_min\n        \n        # Update duration_dict with the processed data\n        duration_dict[d]['sorted_ri'] = ri_costs\n        duration_dict[d]['prefix_min_ri'] = prefix_min_ri\n        duration_dict[d]['sorted_li'] = li_costs\n        duration_dict[d]['suffix_min_li'] = suffix_min_li\n    \n    global_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in vouchers:\n        li_i, ri_i, cost_i = i\n        d_i = ri_i - li_i + 1\n        needed_d = x - d_i\n        \n        if needed_d not in duration_dict:\n            continue\n        \n        data = duration_dict[needed_d]\n        # Part a: j ends before i starts (ri_j < li_i)\n        ri_list = [x[0] for x in data['sorted_ri']]\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_list, li_i)\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_a = data['prefix_min_ri'][pos-1]\n        else:\n            min_a = float('inf')\n        \n        # Part b: j starts after i ends (li_j > ri_i)\n        li_list = [x[0] for x in data['sorted_li']]\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(li_list, ri_i)\n        if pos < len(li_list):\n            min_b = data['suffix_min_li'][pos]\n        else:\n            min_b = float('inf')\n        \n        current_total = float('inf')\n        if min_a != float('inf'):\n            current_total = min_a + cost_i\n        if min_b != float('inf'):\n            if current_total == float('inf'):\n                current_total = min_b + cost_i\n            else:\n                current_total = min(current_total, min_b + cost_i)\n        \n        if current_total < global_min:\n            global_min = current_total\n    \n    if global_min != float('inf'):\n        print(global_min)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration into a dictionary where the key is the duration.\n3. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: Each group of vouchers by duration is sorted and preprocessed to compute prefix and suffix minimums for efficient cost lookup.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, the required duration for the second voucher is calculated. Using binary search, valid vouchers are efficiently found and their costs are compared to find the minimum total cost.\n5. **Output Result**: The minimum total cost is printed, or `-1` if no valid pairs exist.",
