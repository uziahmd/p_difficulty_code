    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The first thing that comes to mind is that the original array's instability is the max minus min. But when we remove an element, the new array's instability could be smaller, right? So my goal is to find which single element, when removed, gives the smallest possible max-min.\n\nWait, but calculating this for every possible element by removing it and computing the new max and min each time would be too slow, especially since n can be up to 1e5. That approach would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's see. The key here is to find the best candidate to remove. Maybe the element that is either the current max or the current min. Because removing either might reduce the overall instability.\n\nBut wait, sometimes there are multiple max or min elements. For example, if the array has multiple maxes, then removing one won't change the max, so the new max would still be that value. Similarly for mins.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach is to consider all possibilities where the max or min could be removed, and find the one that gives the minimal instability.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the initial max and min of the array.\n2. Then, for each possible element, compute what the new max and min would be if that element is removed.\n3. The instability after removal is (new_max - new_min).\n4. We need to find the minimum such instability across all possible removals.\n\nBut doing this naively would be O(n) per step, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute the positions of the max and min elements. Or perhaps find the second max and second min.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to pre-sort the array. If the array is sorted, then for each position i, removing a[i], the new max and min would be the max of the array excluding a[i], and the min of the array excluding a[i].\n\nWait, but the array is sorted, so the max is at the end, min at the start. When you remove an element, the new max could be the same if there are duplicates. So perhaps the new max is the last element unless it was the only occurrence.\n\nSimilarly, the new min is the first element unless it was the only occurrence.\n\nWait, let's think about this. Suppose the array is sorted as [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]. The max is a_{n-1}, the min is a_0.\n\nIf I remove an element a_i:\n\n- If a_i is the max (a_i = a_{n-1}), then the new max is a_{n-2}. But only if there were other elements equal to a_i. Otherwise, the next max is a_{n-2}.\n\nSimilarly, if a_i is the min, then the new min is a_1, provided there were other elements equal to a_i.\n\nOtherwise, removing a_i doesn't affect the max or min.\n\nWait, but when you remove an element, the new max could be the same as before if there are other occurrences of the same value.\n\nSo, to calculate the new max after removing a_i, if a_i is the maximum, then the new max is the maximum of the array without a_i. Which would be the second maximum in the array.\n\nSimilarly for the min.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute the first and second max and min.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently find the second max and min?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible element, if I remove it, what's the new max and min?\n\nBut again, for each element, it's not feasible to compute it in O(1) time.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal instability after removing an element can be achieved in two cases:\n\nCase 1: The element being removed is the current maximum. Then, the new maximum is the second maximum in the array. The new min remains the same as the original min.\n\nCase 2: The element being removed is the current minimum. Then, the new minimum is the second minimum in the array. The new max remains the same.\n\nCase 3: The element being removed is neither the max nor the min. Then, the new max and min remain the same as the original, because the max was the global max and the min was the global min.\n\nWait, is that true? For example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 5, 7]. If I remove 3, the new array is [1,5,7], so max is 7, min is 1. So the instability remains 6. So yes, in this case, the new max and min are same as original.\n\nSo, for any element that is not the max or min, removing it doesn't change the max or min. So the new instability is same as the original.\n\nWait, but that's only if the element is not the only occurrence of the max or min. For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 5]. If I remove one of the 1s, the new min is still 1, because there's another 1. So the new instability would be 5-1=4, same as original.\n\nBut if the array is [1, 5], then removing 5 reduces the max to 1, and min is 1. So the instability becomes 0.\n\nSo, the key is: for each element a_i, when you remove it, the new max is the maximum of the array without a_i, and new min is the min of the array without a_i.\n\nBut calculating this for each a_i is expensive. So, we need a way to precompute for each element whether it's the max or min, or if there are other instances.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible instability is either:\n\n- The original instability (if we remove an element that is neither max nor min)\nOR\n- The instability after removing the max, which is (second_max - min)\nOR\n- The instability after removing the min, which is (max - second_min)\n\nSo, our task reduces to finding these three options and choosing the minimal among them.\n\nBecause, if the element is not the max or min, removing it leaves the max and min unchanged, so the instability remains the same as the original. So, the minimal instability can't be lower than the original, but if we can find a scenario where removing a max or min gives a lower instability, that's better.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original instability is max - min. If we remove an element that's not a max or min, the new array's max is same as before, min same as before, so the instability is same as original. So, the minimal instability can't be lower than the minimal between (second_max - min) and (max - second_min), but wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's see. The original instability is S = max - min.\n\nWhen we remove a max (if there are others), the new max is the second_max. So the new instability is (second_max - min). If second_max is less than max, this could be less than S.\n\nSimilarly, when we remove a min (if there are others), the new min is second_min, so new instability is (max - second_min), which could be less than S.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum between S, (second_max - min), and (max - second_min).\n\nWait, but wait: if there's only one max, then when you remove it, the new max is the second_max (if exists), otherwise, the new array's max is the previous second_max, but if the array had all elements equal, then removing any element leaves the same max.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of:\n\nCompute all possible candidates for when the max or min is removed.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the initial max and min of the array.\n\nCompute S = max - min.\n\nNow, find the second_max and second_min.\n\nHow?\n\nFor the second_max, we can iterate through the array and find the maximum element that is less than the current max.\n\nSimilarly, for the second_min, find the minimum element that is greater than the current min.\n\nBut wait, if the array has all elements equal, then second_max is same as max, and second_min is same as min.\n\nSo, when we remove any element, the new max and min will be same as the original.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal instability remains S, but S is zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, array [5,5,5], removing any element leaves [5,5], so instability is 0.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal instability is zero.\n\nBut in the general case, when the array has both max and min appearing more than once, then the second_max and second_min may exist.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial max and min, S = max - min.\n\n2. Compute the count of max elements and min elements.\n\n   - If count_max > 1: then removing one max won't change the max, so the new max is same as before.\n\n   - If count_min > 1: removing one min won't change the min.\n\n   - Else: if count_max is 1, then removing the max would make the new max the second_max.\n\n   Similarly for min.\n\n3. Now, for each possible case, compute the possible new instabilities.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nCase 1: Removing a non-max and non-min element.\n\nIn this case, the new max is same as original, new min is same as original. So instability is same as S.\n\nCase 2: Removing a max element.\n\nIf there are multiple max elements, then the new max remains same as before. So the new instability is max - min, which is same as S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if I have multiple max elements, say [3,3,5,7], and I remove a 7. Then, the new max is 5. So the new instability is 5 - min. So it's 5 - 1, assuming min is 1.\n\nWait, no, sorry. Original array is [3,3,5,7], max is 7, min is 3. So S is 4.\n\nIf I remove 7, the new array is [3,3,5], max is 5, min is 3. So new S is 2.\n\nSo in this case, when there are multiple max elements, removing one doesn't change the max because others are still present.\n\nSo, the new max is same as before only if there are other max elements. So, the new instability is same as before only if the max is present elsewhere.\n\nWait, this complicates things. Because, when you remove a max element, the new max depends on whether there are other max elements.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to track how many times the max appears.\n\nSame for min.\n\nSo, to handle this, let's first find:\n\n- max_val: the maximum value in the array.\n\n- min_val: the minimum value in the array.\n\n- count_max: the number of times max_val appears in the array.\n\n- count_min: the number of times min_val appears in the array.\n\nThen:\n\nIf I remove a max_val:\n\n- If count_max > 1: the new max is still max_val.\n\n- Else: the new max is the second_max (the maximum value in the array excluding max_val).\n\nSimilarly, if I remove a min_val:\n\n- If count_min > 1: the new min is still min_val.\n\n- Else: the new min is the second_min (minimum value in the array excluding min_val).\n\nSo, the new instability after removing a max is:\n\nif count_max > 1: new_max = max_val, so instability is (max_val - min_val) = S.\n\nElse: new_max is second_max, so instability is (second_max - min_val).\n\nSimilarly, for removing a min.\n\nWait, but that's only for the specific cases where we remove a max or a min.\n\nBut the minimal instability could also be achieved by removing a different element, but perhaps in the case where the array has multiple max or min, but removing a non-max/min doesn't help.\n\nSo, to find the minimal instability, we need to consider:\n\n- The original S.\n\n- The S when we remove a max, but only if count_max is 1 (since otherwise S remains same).\n\n- The S when we remove a min, but only if count_min is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n- S,\n\n- (second_max - min_val) if count_max == 1,\n\n- (max_val - second_min) if count_min == 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has both max and min with counts of 1. Then, the minimal instability would be min(S, (second_max - min_val), (max_val - second_min)).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute max_val, min_val, S = max_val - min_val.\n\n2. Compute count_max and count_min.\n\n3. Compute second_max and second_min.\n\n4. Compute possible options:\n\n   a. Option1: keep as is (no removal, but we have to remove one, so this is not applicable. Wait, no: if I remove a non max or min, the S remains same as original. So in this case, the minimal instability could be min(S, option2, option3).\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove a non max/min, the new S is same as original. So, the minimal instability is the minimum between S and the minimal of the other options.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute all possible candidates:\n\n- The original S.\n\n- The candidate when you remove a max (if count_max > 0). But in this case, when you remove a max, if count_max > 1, the new S is same as before. So, if you have multiple max elements, the option is same as S.\n\nSo, perhaps, the minimal instability is the minimum between S and the minimal of the cases where you remove a max (when count_max is 1, so new S is second_max - min_val), and the case where you remove a min (when count_min is 1, so new S is max_val - second_min).\n\nBut also, even if count_max is 1, when you remove the max, the new max is second_max, but the min remains same. So the new instability is (second_max - min_val).\n\nSimilarly, when you remove a min with count_min=1, the new instability is (max_val - second_min).\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum of the original S, and the two possible new instabilities (if applicable).\n\nWait, but in some cases, the minimal instability could be even lower. For example, in the sample input 2, the array is [1,100000]. The original S is 99999. If you remove 1, the new array is [100000], so S is 0. Similarly for removing 100000. So, the minimal is 0.\n\nSo, in this case, the original S is 99999, but removing either gives a much lower S.\n\nThus, in the code, I need to compute:\n\nCompute the original S.\n\nCompute the S when removing a max (if count_max is 1):\n\n   new_max_candidate = second_max\n\n   new_instability = new_max_candidate - min_val.\n\nCompute the S when removing a min (if count_min is 1):\n\n   new_min_candidate = second_min\n\n   new_instability = max_val - new_min_candidate.\n\nThe minimal instability is the minimum between S, new_max_candidate instability, and new_min_candidate instability.\n\nBut wait, what if both count_max and count_min are 1? Then, we have to compute both possibilities.\n\nAlso, what about when the array has multiple max elements but when you remove one, the new max is same as before, so the new S is same as original. So in that case, the option is same as original S.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute the original S.\n\nCompute second_max and second_min.\n\nCompute the following candidates:\n\ncandidate1 = S (removing a non max/min element)\n\ncandidate2 = (second_max - min_val) if count_max == 1 else S.\n\ncandidate3 = (max_val - second_min) if count_min == 1 else S.\n\nThe minimal instability is the minimum of candidate1, candidate2, candidate3.\n\nWait, but candidate1 is S, which is the same as candidate2 and candidate3 in cases where count_max >1 or count_min >1.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute all the required variables.\n\nCompute the three possible candidates:\n\ncand1 = S (case where we remove a non max/min)\n\ncand2 = (second_max - min_val) if count_max == 1 else S\n\ncand3 = (max_val - second_min) if count_min == 1 else S\n\nmin_instability = min(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n\nSo, the minimal instability is min(cand1, cand2, cand3).\n\nBut wait, in some cases, cand2 or cand3 may not be applicable. For example, if count_max is 1, then removing the max gives a certain instability, but if count_max is greater than 1, then removing a max doesn't change the instability, so the candidate is same as S.\n\nSimilarly for count_min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe need to compute second_max and second_min.\n\nHow to compute them?\n\nWell, for the array, after sorting, the second_max is the largest element less than max_val.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the unique elements, in sorted order.\n\nThen, if the number of unique elements is 1, then the second_max and second_min are same as max and min.\n\nElse, the second_max is the second last unique element, and the second_min is the second unique element.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. Sorted, it's [1,3,3,7].\n\nUnique elements are [1,3,7]. So, the second_max is 3, second_min is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the second_max is the second highest value, which is 3. So, for the array, when you remove 7, the new max is 3.\n\nSo, the candidate for removing 7 is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,2,3]. Unique elements are [1,2,3]. So, second_max is 2, second_min is 1.\n\nSo, the candidates when removing 3 (count_max is 1) is 2 -1 =1.\n\nWhich is better than S=3-1=2.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute unique elements.\n\nIf the number of unique elements is 1: then the second_max and second_min are same as max and min.\n\nElse:\n\n   second_max = the second to last unique element.\n\n   second_min = the second element.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for the unique elements, the second_max is the second from the top.\n\nSo, for the array [1,3,3,7], unique is [1,3,7], so second_max is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [5,5,5], unique is [5]. So, second_max is 5, same as max.\n\nSo, in this case, when you remove a 5, the new array is [5,5], max is 5, min is 5, so S is 0.\n\nBut according to the code logic, when we compute the candidate for removing a max (count_max is 3, which is >1), so the candidate is S = 0. So, it's correct.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the array.\n\nSort it.\n\nCompute the unique elements.\n\nIf the length of unique is 1:\n\n   second_max = max_val\n\n   second_min = min_val\n\nElse:\n\n   second_max = unique[-2]\n\n   second_min = unique[1]\n\nWait, no. Because unique is sorted, so unique[0] is min, unique[-1] is max.\n\nSo, unique[1] is the second min, unique[-2] is the second max.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for unique elements like [1,2,3,4], unique[1] is 2, unique[-2] is 3.\n\nSo, the second_min is 2, the second_max is 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second_min is the second smallest element, which is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, in code:\n\nCompute the unique list.\n\nIf len(unique) >=2:\n\n   second_min = unique[1]\n\n   second_max = unique[-2]\n\nElse:\n\n   second_min = min_val\n\n   second_max = max_val\n\nSo, now, for the case when count_max is 1, the candidate is (second_max - min_val).\n\nSimilarly, when count_min is 1, the candidate is (max_val - second_min).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute min_val = min(a)\n\nCompute max_val = max(a)\n\nS = max_val - min_val\n\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\n\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nunique = []\n\nprev = None\n\nfor num in sorted_a:\n\n   if num != prev:\n\n       unique.append(num)\n\n       prev = num\n\nif len(unique) >= 2:\n\n   second_max = unique[-2]\n\n   second_min = unique[1]\n\nelse:\n\n   second_max = max_val\n\n   second_min = min_val\n\n# Now compute candidates.\n\ncandidates = [S]  # candidate1: removing non max/min.\n\nif count_max == 1:\n\n   # candidate2: remove max, new max is second_max.\n\n   candidate2 = second_max - min_val\n\n   candidates.append(candidate2)\n\nif count_min == 1:\n\n   # candidate3: remove min, new min is second_min.\n\n   candidate3 = max_val - second_min\n\n   candidates.append(candidate3)\n\nminimal = min(candidates)\n\nprint(minimal)\n\nWait, but what if the array has only two elements, like [1, 100000]. So, unique is [1, 100000].\n\nsecond_max = unique[-2] = 1.\n\nsecond_min = unique[1] = 100000.\n\ncount_max is 1, count_min is 1.\n\nSo, candidates are [100000-1=99999, 1 - 100000=-99999 (but no, because when we remove 1, the new array is [100000], so max and min are same. So new S is 0.\n\nWait, this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, in this example, when you remove the max (100000), the new array is [1], so the new max and min are both 1. So the new S is 0.\n\nSimilarly, when you remove the min (1), the new array is [100000], S is 0.\n\nSo, the code's candidate2 is (second_max - min_val) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code is considering count_max ==1, so candidate2 is second_max (1) - min_val (1) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, candidate3 is max_val (100000) - second_min (100000) = 0.\n\nSo, candidates are [99999, 0, 0], so min is 0. So the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause in the code, the candidates are computed as:\n\ncandidate2 = second_max - min_val.\n\nIn this case, second_max is 1, min_val is 1.\n\nSo, candidate2 is 0.\n\nSimilarly, candidate3 is 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n\nSo, the minimal is 0.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput array is [1,3,3,7].\n\nunique is [1,3,7].\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min is 3.\n\ncount_max is 1.\n\ncount_min is 1.\n\nSo, candidate2 is 3-1=2.\n\ncandidate3 is 7-3=4.\n\ncandidates are [4,2,4].\n\nSo, minimal is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5]. unique has length 1.\n\nso, second_max =5, second_min=5.\n\ncount_max is 3, count_min is 3.\n\nSo, candidate2 is 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate3 is 5-5=0.\n\ncandidates are [0,0,0], so minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3,4].\n\nunique is [1,2,3,4].\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\ncount_max is 1, count_min is 1.\n\nSo, candidate2 is 3-1=2.\n\ncandidate3 is 4-2=2.\n\ncandidates are [3, 2, 2]. So minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing 4 gives [1,2,3], S=2.\n\nRemoving 1 gives [2,3,4], S=2.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,2,3,4].\n\nunique is [2,3,4].\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\ncount_max is 1, count_min is 2.\n\nSo, candidate2 is 3-2=1.\n\ncandidate3: since count_min is 2, the candidate3 is S=4-2=2.\n\nSo, candidates are [2,1,2], so minimal is 1.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing 4 gives S=3-2=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,1].\n\nunique is [1,5].\n\nsecond_max is 1, second_min is 5.\n\ncount_max is 3, count_min is 1.\n\nSo, candidate2: since count_max is 3>1, candidate2 is S=5-1=4.\n\ncandidate3: since count_min is 1, candidate3 is 5 - second_min (5) = 0.\n\nSo, candidates are [4,4,0]. Minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing the 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the array has multiple maxes, but removing a non max/min doesn't help.\n\nLike array [3,3,5,5], unique is [3,5].\n\nsecond_max is 3, second_min is 5.\n\ncount_max is 2, count_min is 2.\n\nSo, candidate2 is S=5-3=2.\n\ncandidate3 is S=5-3=2.\n\ncandidates are [2,2,2], minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the edge case when n=2.\n\nLike [5,5]: unique is [5], len=1.\n\nso, second_max and second_min are 5.\n\ncount_max is 2, count_min is 2.\n\ncandidates are [0, 0, 0], so minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother n=2 case: [1,2].\n\nunique is [1,2].\n\nsecond_max is 1, second_min is 2.\n\ncount_max is 1, count_min is 1.\n\nSo, candidate2 is 1-1=0.\n\ncandidate3 is 2-2=0.\n\ncandidates are [1,0,0], so minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement this logic.\n\nIn Python, handling the sorted array and unique elements is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array.\n\nCompute min_val and max_val.\n\nCompute S.\n\nCompute count_max and count_min.\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the unique list.\n\nCompute second_max and second_min based on the unique list.\n\nCompute the three candidates.\n\nTake the minimal.\n\nPrint the minimal.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given in the problem, the first sample is ['4\\n1 3 3 7'].\n\nWait, that's the input format? Or perhaps the user made a typo.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThe second line is n integers.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nWhich gives the array [1,3,3,7].\n\nSo, in code, the second line is read as a list of integers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the steps as discussed.\n\nTesting:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=4, a=[1,3,3,7]\n\nunique is [1,3,7]\n\nsecond_max=3, second_min=3.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\ncandidates = [4, 3-1=2, 7-3=4].\n\nSo, minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2, a=[1,100000]\n\nunique is [1,100000].\n\nsecond_max=1, second_min=100000.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\ncandidates = [99999, 1-1=0, 100000-100000=0].\n\nMinimal is 0.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, a=[5,5,5,5,5]\n\nunique is [5].\n\ncandidates are [0, 0, 0]. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, a=[10, 2, 3]\n\nunique is [2,3,10].\n\nsecond_max=3, second_min=2.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\ncandidates = [8, 3-2=1, 10-2=8].\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nSo, now, write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Compute the initial maximum (`max_val`) and minimum (`min_val`) values of the array, along with their counts (`count_max` and `count_min`).\n2. **Sorting and Unique Elements**: Sort the array and extract unique elements to determine the second maximum (`second_max`) and second minimum (`second_min`).\n3. **Candidates for Instability**:\n   - The original instability (`S`) when no specific element is removed.\n   - The instability when the maximum value element is removed, considering if there are multiple instances of the maximum value.\n   - The instability when the minimum value element is removed, considering if there are multiple instances of the minimum value.\n4. **Compute Minimum Instability**: Evaluate the instability for each candidate scenario and return the minimum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmin_val = min(a)\nmax_val = max(a)\nS = max_val - min_val\n\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\nunique = []\nprev = None\nfor num in sorted_a:\n    if num != prev:\n        unique.append(num)\n        prev = num\n\nif len(unique) >= 2:\n    second_max = unique[-2]\n    second_min = unique[1]\nelse:\n    second_max = max_val\n    second_min = min_val\n\ncandidates = [S]\n\nif count_max == 1:\n    candidate2 = second_max - min_val\n    candidates.append(candidate2)\nif count_min == 1:\n    candidate3 = max_val - second_min\n    candidates.append(candidate3)\n\nminimal = min(candidates)\nprint(minimal)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.\n2. **Initial Computations**: Calculate the initial maximum and minimum values, their counts, and the initial instability.\n3. **Unique Elements Extraction**: By sorting the array and extracting unique elements, we efficiently determine the second maximum and minimum values.\n4. **Evaluate Candidates**: Consider the instability when removing the maximum or minimum value (if applicable) and compute the possible instabilities for these cases.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The minimum value from all considered candidates is the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to 100,000 elements by leveraging sorting and counting operations, making the solution both optimal and scalable.",
