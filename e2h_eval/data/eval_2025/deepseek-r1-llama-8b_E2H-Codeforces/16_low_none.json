Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) in Crazy Town. The town has n infinite line roads, each defined by an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. These roads divide the plane into regions or blocks. My home and the university are in some of these blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to university. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to figure out how the lines partition the plane and determine the regions where home and university lie. Then, the minimal steps would be related to how many such lines separate them.\n\nWait, but how do the regions work? Each road is a line, and the arrangement of lines can create multiple regions. The blocks are the connected regions bounded by these lines. Moving between adjacent blocks requires crossing exactly one line at a time. So, the minimal steps should correspond to the number of lines that separate the home's region from the university's region.\n\nWait, no. Because each step can cross any number of lines, but according to the problem statement, each step is a move across a single boundary. So, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. Or perhaps it's the number of lines that separate the two regions.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the planar graph's faces and the number of edges you need to cross when going from one face to another. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each road as a line that divides the plane. The home and university are on opposite sides of certain roads. The minimal steps would be the number of such roads where home and university are on different sides.\n\nBecause for each such road, you'd have to cross it once. Because each step allows moving across a single boundary. So, for each line that separates the two points, you add one step.\n\nSo, the solution is to count the number of roads where home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. That would give the minimal steps needed.\n\nYes! Because each such road would require crossing exactly once, and since each step can only cross one road, the minimal steps are the count of such separating roads.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of such roads.\n3. Output this count.\n\nHow to determine if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nGiven a line ax + by + c = 0, compute the value f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c. For the home point (x1,y1), evaluate f(hx, hy). For the university point (x2,y2), evaluate f(ux, uy).\n\nIf the signs of these two values are different, then the points are on opposite sides of the line. So, we increment the count.\n\nBut wait, what if the value is zero? Well, the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road, so their evaluation will never be zero. So we don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n- Read n\n- For each of the next n lines:\n   - Read a, b, c\n   - Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   - Compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   - If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count\n- Output the count\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → equation is y = 0. Home is at (1,1) which is above, university at (-1,-1) is below. So on opposite sides. So count +=1.\nRoad 2: 1 0 0 → x=0. Home is at x=1 (right), university at x=-1 (left). Opposite sides again. So count is 2. So output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are on the same side of a line. Then that line doesn't contribute to the count.\n\nWhat about if a line is vertical or horizontal? It doesn't matter; the same logic applies.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\n- The coordinates can be as large as 1e6, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n- n can be up to 300, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the first two points, then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (line) in Crazy Town can be thought of as a line dividing the plane into two regions. If your home and the university are on opposite sides of a road, you will need to cross that road exactly once. Thus, the minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of such roads where the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n1. **Evaluate Each Road**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the value of the equation at the coordinates of the home and the university.\n2. **Check Sides**: If the signs of these values differ, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, and thus you must cross this road.\n3. **Count Crossings**: Count how many such roads exist where the home and university are on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nhome_x, home_y = map(int, input().split())\nuni_x, uni_y = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val_home = a * home_x + b * home_y + c\n    val_uni = a * uni_x + b * uni_y + c\n    if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Each Road**: For each road, the code evaluates the position of the home and university relative to the road using the given line equation.\n- **Determining Opposite Sides**: By checking the product of the evaluated values, the code determines if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. If they are, it increments the count.\n- **Output Result**: The count of such roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their geometric interpretations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
