Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a string of digits through several substitution queries and then computing the result modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo, Andrew has a string s. Eugene sends queries like \"di->ti\", which means replace every occurrence of digit di in s with the substring ti. For example, if s is '123123', a query '2->00' changes it to '10031003'. Another query '3->' replaces all 3s with nothing, turning it into '1212'.\n\nAfter all queries, we need to compute the number represented by s, ignoring leading zeros, modulo 1e9+7. If s is empty, it's zero.\n\nWait, but the note says that leading zeroes are not removed in the string after replacement. So for example, if after substitutions, s starts with zeros, those zeros remain when considering the numerical value. But when converting to the number, leading zeros are ignored. Oh wait, no: the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string. So the resulting number is computed based on the entire string, including any leading zeros. Wait, no, the note clarifies that in the third sample, the leading zeros are present. So, for example, in the third sample, after substitutions, the string could be '0777', which is treated as 777 numerically. Or wait, no: the note says that in the third sample, the output is 777, which suggests that leading zeros are stripped. Wait, looking at the sample:\n\nIn the third sample input:\n222\n2 queries: 2->0, then 0->7.\nAfter first query, '222' becomes '000' (because each 2 is replaced by 0).\nThen, the second query replaces 0 with 7, so the string becomes '777'. So the output is 777.\n\nBut if the initial string was '000222', and the same queries, it would become '777' as well. So when computing the numerical value, leading zeros are ignored, meaning the number is just the integer value of the string.\n\nSo, the plan is: process all the substitution queries, then compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros (if any), and then mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut how do I efficiently process these substitutions? Because the order of the queries matters, and each substitution can affect the outcome of the next.\n\nWait, but substitution queries are applied in the given order. So each substitution is done sequentially. For example, if I have a query 'a->b' followed by 'b->c', each 'a' becomes 'b' and then each 'b' becomes 'c', so effectively 'a' is replaced by 'c'.\n\nBut to process the substitutions correctly, perhaps it's better to represent the current state of the string as a mapping of each digit to its replacement. Then, for each query, update this mapping.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possible cases. Because during the processing of the queries, the substitution could change the string in a way that affects future substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to model the substitution process as a series of replacements, and for each character in the original string, track what it becomes after all the substitutions.\n\nBecause each substitution is processed in order, the final string is built by replacing each character according to all the queries in sequence.\n\nWait, but each query is a substitution of a specific digit. So, for each digit d, if there's a substitution rule for it, it's replaced by t. Otherwise, it remains as is.\n\nSo, the idea is to build a substitution map where for each digit, we track what it's replaced with. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, we update the substitution for the digit di to ti. So, for example, if a query comes later that also modifies di, it will overwrite the previous substitution.\n\nThis way, for each digit in the original string, we can determine what it becomes after all substitutions by following the substitution rules.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. For each query, parse di and ti. For each query, update the substitution map: if di is present, replace its substitution with ti; otherwise, add it to the map with ti.\n\n3. After processing all queries, for each character in the original string s, replace it with its substituted value. The substituted value is determined by following the substitution rules as per the queries, in the order they were processed.\n\nWait, but substitution is done in the order of the queries. So, for each character in the original string, we look up in the substitution map. For example, suppose the first query is a→b, and the second is b→c. Then, any a in the string becomes b, which then becomes c. So, the substitution for a is now c, but the substitution for b is also c. So, for each character in the original string, we can find its final substitution by checking if it exists in the substitution map. If it does, use the current substitution; else, keep the original.\n\nBut wait, substitution is applied in the order of the queries. So, each substitution may override previous ones. So, the substitution map should be built in such a way that each subsequent query for the same di overwrites the previous value.\n\nSo, the substitution map is built step by step. For each query, di is mapped to ti. Any prior mapping for di is overwritten.\n\nTherefore, for any digit d, the substitution is the last ti provided in the queries for that digit.\n\nSo, processing the queries in order, updating the substitution map accordingly.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, for each character in the original string, we look it up in the substitution map. If it's present, we append its replacement; otherwise, we append the character itself.\n\nOnce the transformed string is built, we need to compute the numeric value of this string, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that leading zeros should be ignored when representing the number. So, for example, if the string becomes '000123', it's treated as 123. But if it's '0', it's 0. If the string is empty, it's 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Process all queries and build substitution map.\n\n- Replace each character in s according to substitution map.\n\n- Compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros.\n\n- Output the result mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the numeric value of the string efficiently, especially since the length can be up to 105 + sum of ti lengths (sum up to 105). So the total length is manageable.\n\nBut for the computation, we can process each character one by one, building the number as we go, using modular exponentiation techniques to prevent integer overflow.\n\nWait, but the string could be up to 210 characters (since initial s is up to 105, and each substitution adds some characters). So, the maximum possible number is 10^210, which is way beyond what can be stored in standard variables.\n\nSo, we need a way to compute the number modulo 1e9+7 without actually building the full number.\n\nWe can process each character, updating the current number as we go.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\nInitialize the result as 0.\n\nFor each character c in the transformed string:\n\n- result = (result * 10 + value_of(c)) % MOD\n\nWhere MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nThis works because each step, we multiply the current result by 10 (shifting digits left) and add the new digit, then take mod MOD. This correctly computes the value mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, the string could be empty, which is handled as 0.\n\nAlso, if the transformed string starts with '0's, but we ignore leading zeros when computing the number. However, the way we process the string is to process all characters, including leading zeros. For example, if the string is '000123', processing each character as '0' '0' '0' '1' '2' '3' gives us 0*10 +0=0, then 0*10+0=0, etc., until the '1' comes, which would make it 1, then 12, etc. So the end result is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because 000123 is 123, but the way we process it:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nMultiply by 10 and add 0: 0.\n\nAgain, multiply by 10 and add 0: 0.\n\nMultiply by 10 and add 1: 1.\n\nMultiply by 10 and add 2: 12.\n\nMultiply by 10 and add 3: 123.\n\nSo yes, the method correctly computes the numeric value regardless of leading zeros.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n\n- Read n queries.\n\n- For each query, parse di and ti. Update the substitution map: substitution[di] = ti.\n\n- Then, for each character in s, replace it according to substitution map. For each c in s:\n\n   if c is in substitution, append substitution[c], else append c.\n\n- Now, the transformed string is built.\n\n- Compute the numeric value by processing each character as described, mod 1e9+7.\n\n- Output the result.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: s is empty after substitution. Then, the result is 0.\n\nCase 2: All substitutions result in leading zeros. For example, s is '0', and substitution is '0->' (replace 0 with empty string). Then the transformed string is empty, which is 0.\n\nAnother case: s is '000', substitution for 0 is '00'. Then, the transformed string is '0000', which is 0.\n\nWait, but substitution for 0 is '00', so each '0' becomes '00'. So '000' becomes '0000' → the numeric value is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nLet me parse this:\n\nWait, the input format is a bit tricky. The first line is the string s, which is a single string, possibly containing newline? Or wait, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a line. So the first element is the string s, the second is n, the number of queries, and the next elements are the queries.\n\nWait, in the example given, the input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nHmm, perhaps the actual input is given as multiple lines, but the code needs to read them properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial string is the first line, then the second line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '123123\\n1\\n2->00' which seems to contain three parts separated by \\n. That can't be right. So perhaps the sample input is a representation of four lines, but in reality, the code should read from standard input.\n\nBut regardless, the code should read s from the first line, n from the second line, and then n lines of queries.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut perhaps in the sample input, the first line is '123123' followed by a newline, then '1', then '2->00', etc. No, that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows four elements: the initial string, n, and three queries. But that's unclear.\n\nWell, perhaps in the problem statement, the input is given as the first line being s, the second line being n, and the next n lines are the queries. So the code should read s, then n, then read n lines, each line is a query.\n\nSo, for the sample input, the first line is '123123\\n1\\n2->00', which seems like a multi-line string, but perhaps it's just the way the sample is presented. In reality, the code should read s as the first line, n as the second, and the next n lines as the queries.\n\nSo, perhaps the code will be structured as follows:\n\nRead s as input().strip()\n\nRead n as int(input())\n\nRead n lines, each is a query, stripping any whitespace.\n\nProcess each query.\n\nNow, the substitution map.\n\nImplementing the substitution map as a dictionary where the key is the digit as a string, and the value is the replacement string.\n\nInitially, substitution is empty. For each query, split into di and ti.\n\nWait, each query is in the format \"di->ti\". So, for each query string, split on \"->\" to get di and ti.\n\nSo for each query:\n\nparts = query.split('->')\n\ndi = parts[0]\n\nti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n\nSo, for example, the query '2->00' gives di='2', ti='00'.\n\nThe substitution map is a dictionary substitution = {}.\n\nFor each query, substitution[di] = ti.\n\nIf di is already a key, it gets overwritten.\n\nSo, after processing all queries, substitution contains for each di, the last ti provided.\n\nOnce the substitution map is built, for each character in the original s, we check if it's in substitution.\n\nIf it is, we replace it with substitution[c], else leave it as c.\n\nSo, the transformed string is built as:\n\ntransformed = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c in substitution:\n        transformed.append(substitution[c])\n    else:\n        transformed.append(c)\ntransformed_str = ''.join(transformed)\n\nWait, no. Because substitution[c] is a string, so for example, if substitution['2'] is '00', then each '2' in s becomes '00', which appends two '0's to the transformed list.\n\nSo, the code for building the transformed string should be:\n\ntransformed = []\nfor c in s:\n    rep = substitution.get(c, c)\n    transformed.extend(list(rep))\ntransformed_str = ''.join(transformed)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOnce transformed_str is built, compute its numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nAs discussed earlier, process each character in transformed_str:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\nresult = 0\nfor c in transformed_str:\n    digit = int(c)\n    result = (result * 10 + digit) % mod\n\nBut wait, in Python, 10**9+7 is 1000000007.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\nresult = 0\nfor ch in transformed_str:\n    result = (result *10 + int(ch)) % mod\n\nYes.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead s, n, then queries.\n\nBuild substitution map.\n\nBuild transformed string.\n\nCompute the result.\n\nHandle the case where transformed_str is empty: return 0.\n\nElse, compute as above.\n\nNow, let's think about another sample input.\n\nIn the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nProcessing queries:\n\nFirst query: di=2, ti=0. substitution['2'] = '0'.\n\nSecond query: di=0, ti='7'. substitution['0'] = '7'.\n\nSo, substitution is {'2':'0', '0':'7'}.\n\nSo, each '2' becomes '0', each '0' becomes '7'.\n\nOriginal s is '222'.\n\nEach '2' is replaced by '0', so transformed_str is '000'.\n\nThen, for each '0' in '000', it's replaced by '7', so transformed_str becomes '777'.\n\nSo, the numeric value is 777, mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: s is '3', n=1, query '3->', which replaces 3 with empty string. So transformed_str is empty, so result is 0.\n\nAnother case: s is '0', substitution is '0->', so transformed_str is empty, result is 0.\n\nAnother case: s is '00', substitution is '0->a'. So transformed_str is 'aa', which is 'aa' → which is 1010 in decimal? Or wait, no. Wait, 'a' is a letter, but in our substitution, it's a string. So, if substitution['0'] is 'a', then transformed_str is 'aa', which is treated as the string 'aa', which is 10 in decimal. Because 'a' is a non-digit, but the problem says that substitution results in a string consisting of digits. Wait, no: in the problem statement, each query's ti is a string consisting of digits, which can be empty.\n\nSo, substitution can only produce digits. So, in the code, substitution values must consist of digits only, as per the problem statement.\n\nThus, in the code, we can assume that substitution values are valid (ti consists of digits).\n\nSo, in code, for each query, ti can be any string of digits, including empty.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, what about the fourth sample input:\n\ns is '1000000008'\n\nn=0.\n\nSo, no substitutions are done. Thus, the transformed_str is '1000000008'.\n\nBut 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1, since 1e9+7 is 1000000007, and 1000000008 - 1000000007 = 1.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nThe substitution map is a dictionary, where each key is a single-character string (digit), and the value is the replacement string (could be empty).\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nsubstitution = {}\n\nThen, for each query:\n\ndi_part, ti_part = query.split('->') if '->' in query else (query, '')\n\nWait, no: the split on '->' returns a list. So, for example, '2->00' → ['2', '00'], '3->' → ['3', ''].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor query in queries:\n    if '->' in query:\n        di, ti = query.split('->')\n    else:\n        di = query\n        ti = ''\n\n    substitution[di] = ti\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if the query is something like '1->2->3'? That's invalid, but the problem statement says that each query is of the form di->ti, so it's guaranteed that each query has exactly one '->' and di is a single digit.\n\nThus, no need to handle such cases.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n queries.\n\nProcess each query into substitution.\n\nBuild transformed_str as per substitution.\n\nCompute the mod.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nTesting:\n\nAnother test case: s = '123', n=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n1->1\n\n2->3\n\nSo substitution is {'1':'1', '2':'3'}.\n\nTransformed_str is '1' + '3' + '3' → '133'.\n\nCompute 133 mod 1e9+7 is 133.\n\nAnother test case: s = '111', substitution is '1->1234'.\n\nSo transformed_str is '123412341234', which is a very long number.\n\nBut the code can process it correctly.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if a substitution for a digit is an empty string?\n\nLike substitution['5'] = ''.\n\nSo, any '5' in s becomes nothing.\n\nSo, for s = '55', substitution['5']='', transformed_str is empty, which is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother issue: leading zeros after substitution.\n\nFor example, s is '0', substitution is '0->07'.\n\nTransformed_str is '07', which is treated as 7, but the code computes 0*10 +7=7 mod mod is 7.\n\nWait, no: the transformed_str is '07', which when processed, the first '0' is 0, then 7: 0*10 +0 = 0, then 0*10 +7 =7.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWait, wait, no: the transformed_str is '07', so processing each character:\n\nFirst character is '0': result = (0 *10 + 0) = 0.\n\nSecond character is '7': result = (0 *10 +7) =7.\n\nSo the final result is 7, which is correct because '07' is 7.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles leading zeros.\n\nAnother case: s is '00', substitution is '0->00'. Transformed_str is '0000', which is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, time to write the Python code.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n queries.\n\nBuild substitution.\n\nBuild transformed_str.\n\nCompute result.\n\nPrint result.\n\nIn code:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nsubstitution = {}\n\nfor query in queries:\n    if '->' in query:\n        di, ti = query.split('->')\n    else:\n        di = query\n        ti = ''\n    substitution[di] = ti\n\ntransformed = []\nfor c in s:\n    rep = substitution.get(c, c)\n    transformed.extend(list(rep))\n\ntransformed_str = ''.join(transformed)\n\nif not transformed_str:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    result = 0\n    for ch in transformed_str:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(ch)) % mod\n    print(result)\n\nWait, but in the case when transformed_str is empty, it's treated as zero. Else, process each character.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when the transformed_str is '0'? It should output 0. Which the code does.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, in code, the first line is s, which is '123123\\n1\\n2->00'? Or is it that the first line is the string s, then the second line is n, then the next lines are the queries.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is a list of four elements: the initial string, n, and three queries.\n\nBut in reality, the code reads s as the first line, n as the second, and the next three lines as the queries.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, but in the code, it's correctly handled.\n\nSo, in the code, the first line is s, the second line is n, and the next n lines are the queries.\n\nThus, in the sample input, the code would read s as '123123', n=1, then the query '2->00'.\n\nThen, process the substitution for '2' as '00'.\n\nSo, the transformed string is '123123' → each '2' becomes '00', so '1','2' becomes '00', '3','1','2','3' remains.\n\nSo, transformed_str is '10031003'.\n\nThen, compute 10031003 mod 1e9+7 is 10031003.\n\nWhich is the first output in the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: when s is empty? Well, the problem says that s is initially a string with 1<=|s|<=105, so s can't be empty. So, no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: when substitution for a digit is empty. Like substitution['5'] = '', then any '5' is removed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",

Each character of the transformed string is processed sequentially, updating the result using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle all substitutions correctly and efficiently compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) without running into issues with integer overflow or excessive memory usage.",
