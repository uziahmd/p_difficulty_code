The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2 each, and these are independent events.\n\nAfter building the towers, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to compute the probability that this is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So for each subset of built towers, we need to check if there's an assignment of powers that satisfies the conditions.\n\nBut considering all subsets is impossible because n can be up to 2e5, so we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure required for the assignments.\n\nEach town must be covered by exactly one tower. Also, town 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any.\n\nSo, the arrangement of towers must form a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals where each interval is exactly the coverage of some tower.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to tiling or covering the line with certain ranges without overlapping.\n\nAnother thought: Each tower's coverage is a range around its position. We need these ranges to exactly cover 1..n, without overlapping, and without covering 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a set of points (towers) such that when each is assigned a radius, their coverage intervals form a non-overlapping partition of 1..n, and 0 and n+1 are outside all coverage.\n\nWait, but the assignment of radii is what determines the coverage. So, for each tower, the radius p_i must be chosen such that the coverage [i - p_i + 1, i + p_i -1] doesn't touch 0 or n+1, and the entire 1..n is covered exactly once.\n\nWait, more precisely: For a tower at position i with power p, it covers all c where |c - i| < p. So the coverage is from max(1, i - (p-1)) to min(n, i + (p-1)).\n\nSo, for each tower, the coverage is [a, b], where a = i - (p-1), b = i + (p-1). But since the towns are 1..n, a can't be less than 1, and b can't be more than n.\n\nMoreover, for the entire 1..n to be covered exactly once, the union of all these intervals must be exactly 1..n, and they must not overlap except possibly at the endpoints.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each town must get exactly one signal. So, the intervals must be non-overlapping and their union must be 1..n.\n\nSo, the arrangement is that the selected towers form a partition of 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower.\n\nSo, each interval corresponds to a tower. The tower's position is somewhere inside the interval, and the power is such that the coverage exactly spans the interval.\n\nFor example, if a tower is placed at position m, and the interval is from a to b, then the power p must satisfy:\n\nm - (p-1) = a\nm + (p-1) = b\n\nSolving these gives p = b - m + 1.\n\nAlternatively, p could be as large as possible to cover the interval, but perhaps not larger than needed. Wait, no: because the coverage is determined by p, which has to be an integer between 1 and n.\n\nSo, for an interval [a, b], the length is l = b - a + 1. The tower's position must be such that it can cover exactly this interval. So, the position must be at a + k, where k is such that when you choose p, it covers exactly from a to b.\n\nWait, let's think: suppose the interval is [a, b]. The tower can be placed anywhere inside it. The power p must be such that the coverage starts at a and ends at b.\n\nSo, the coverage of the tower at position m is [m - (p-1), m + (p-1)]. This needs to equal [a, b].\n\nSo, m - (p-1) = a → m = a + p -1.\n\nSimilarly, m + (p-1) = b → substituting m, a + p -1 + p -1 = b → a + 2p -2 = b → 2p = b -a + 2 → p = (b -a + 2)/2.\n\nWait, but p must be an integer. So, for an interval [a, b], the length must be even for p to be integral? Or wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the interval length is (b - a + 1). Hmm. Because p must satisfy 2p = (b -a + 2), which implies that (b -a + 2) must be even. So, (b -a + 2) must be divisible by 2, which means (b -a) must be even.\n\nWait, no: 2p = (b -a + 2) → (b -a + 2) must be even, so (b -a) must be even minus 2, which is even. So yes, (b -a) must be even.\n\nWait, for example, if the interval is [1,3], then b -a is 2, which is even. Then 2p = 3 + 2 → 5? No, wait: [1,3] has length 3, so a=1, b=3.\n\nWait, wait, the calculation was: p = (b - a + 2)/2. So for a=1, b=3: p=(3-1+2)/2=4/2=2. So p=2. Then the coverage is from 1-1=0 (but we can't have that, but wait, since the coverage must not include 0. So perhaps the interval must be such that a >= 1 and b <=n.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, 0 and n+1 must not receive any signal. So, for the first interval, a must be 1, and for the last interval, b must be n.\n\nSo, the setup is that the selected towers must form a set of intervals that partition 1..n, each being covered by exactly one tower, and the coverage doesn't extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nThis feels like the problem is equivalent to finding a perfect matching of a certain structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the set of built towers must form a certain kind of binary structure, like a full binary tree or something similar. Because for each interval, the center is a tower, and the interval is split into left and right sub-intervals, each of which must also be covered by a single tower.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if an interval is split into two by a tower, then each of those sub-intervals must also have a tower at their respective centers.\n\nThis suggests that the only valid configurations are those where the built towers form a perfect binary tree structure on the line. Each node has exactly two children, except the leaves.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of such valid binary structures, multiplied by (1/2)^n, since each tower is built with probability 1/2.\n\nWait, but how do we model this?\n\nLet me consider small examples.\n\nFor n=1: Only one town, 1. It must have a tower, and its power must be 1. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, according to the sample input, when n=2, the correct answer is 1/4.\n\nWait, for n=2:\n\nPossible subsets of built towers are { }, {1}, {2}, {1,2}.\n\nWhich of these can form a valid configuration?\n\nCase 1: No towers. Then no way to cover towns 1 and 2. So invalid.\n\nCase 2: Only tower 1. Its coverage is [1-0, 1+0] = [1,1], which covers town 1. But town 2 is uncovered. So invalid.\n\nCase 3: Only tower 2. Coverage is [2,2], town 1 is uncovered. Invalid.\n\nCase 4: Both towers. Assign tower 1's power to 1 (covers 1), and tower 2's power to 1 (covers 2). So both are covered. So this is valid. Probability is 1/4.\n\nSo the answer is 1/4.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nSample output says the answer is 1/4.\n\nWait, why? Because in that case, the valid subsets are either:\n\n- All three towers are built, and their powers are 1,1,1. So each covers exactly one town.\n\nOr, only the middle tower is built, with power 2, which covers all three towns. But wait, does that cover 0? No, because 2-1=1, so coverage is from 1 to 3. So yes, that's valid.\n\nWait, so for n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n- Towers 1,2,3 (each power 1).\n\n- Only tower 2, power 2.\n\nEach of these cases contributes 1/(2^3) * (number of such subsets).\n\nSo the total is (1 + 1) / 8 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nSo that's why the answer is 1/4.\n\nSo, the valid subsets are those that form a binary tree structure.\n\nIn other words, the built towers must form a perfect binary partition of the towns.\n\nSo, for each valid subset S of built towers, the arrangement of the towers must form a perfect binary structure where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and the coverage doesn't exceed the boundaries.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of such valid subsets S.\n\nOnce we have the count, the probability is count / 2^n.\n\nSo, the key is to find the number of valid S.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of a \"binary search tree\" in a way. Each node in the structure is a tower whose coverage splits the remaining part into two intervals, each of which must have their own towers.\n\nWait, but the structure is a full binary tree, where each internal node has exactly two children.\n\nSo, for a given n, the number of such valid subsets is equal to the nth Catalan number.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think: the number of ways to arrange the towers is the same as the number of ways to form a full binary tree with n nodes. Because each internal node represents a tower that splits the interval into two smaller intervals, each requiring their own tower(s).\n\nWait, but wait: for n=3, the number of valid subsets is 2. The Catalan number for n=3 is 5, which doesn't match. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid subsets is equal to the (n)th Motzkin number or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of ways to form a perfect binary tree of height h, where 2^h - 1 = n. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose f(k) is the number of valid subsets for a segment of length k (where the segment is from a to a+k-1, but probably better to model it as a contiguous block of size k).\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) represents the number of valid configurations for a segment of length k.\n\nFor a segment of length 1: only one way, which is to have a tower at the position. So f(1)=1.\n\nFor a segment of length 2: the only way is to have two towers, each with power 1. So f(2)=1.\n\nWait, but earlier for n=2, the valid subsets were {1,2}, which is one way. So f(2)=1.\n\nBut wait, for a segment of length 3, there are two options: either three towers each with power 1, or one tower in the middle with power 2. So f(3)=2.\n\nFor a segment of length 4: How many valid configurations?\n\nWe can have:\n\n- Four towers, each with power 1.\n\n- One tower in the middle (position 2 or 3?), but wait, wait. Wait, for a segment of length 4, say positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nIf I choose the tower at position 2, with power 2: it covers 1-2+1=1, and 2+2-1=3. So the remaining segments are 4, which would require another tower at 4. So the configuration is tower 2 (power 2) and tower 4 (power 1). Similarly, choosing tower 3 with power 2 covers 2-3+1=2, and 3+2-1=4. Remaining is 1, which requires a tower at 1. So that's another configuration.\n\nAlternatively, tower 2 and 3 with power 1 each. Wait, but that would leave gaps. No, because the coverage of 2 and 3 would be just 2 and 3. So 1 and 4 are not covered. So that's invalid.\n\nSo for length 4, the valid configurations are:\n\n1. All four towers, each power 1.\n\n2. Tower 2 with power 2, and tower 4 with power 1.\n\n3. Tower 3 with power 2, and tower 1 with power 1.\n\nSo f(4) is 3.\n\nWait, but that's 3, which is the same as the third Catalan number (which is 5 for n=3, but maybe my initial understanding is wrong).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) is equal to the (k-1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nBecause for k=1, f(1)=1; k=2, f(2)=1; k=3, f(3)=2; k=4, f(4)=3. Which fits the Fibonacci sequence starting from f(1)=1, f(2)=1.\n\nYes! So f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = f(2)+f(1) = 2\n\nf(4) = f(3)+f(2) = 3\n\nf(5) = f(4)+f(3) = 5\n\nYes, that looks like the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one. So f(k) is the (k-1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, but wait: For k=5, the number of configurations is f(5)=5.\n\nLet me verify with n=5.\n\nWhat's the sample input for n=5? The output is 5/32, which is 5 divided by 32, which is 5/(2^5) = 5/32.\n\nSo, indeed, for n=5, the number of valid subsets is 5.\n\nWhich aligns with f(5)=5.\n\nSo, the pattern is that f(k) is equal to the (k)th Fibonacci number, but perhaps it's shifted.\n\nWait, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5. So f(k) is the (k)th Fibonacci number where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, etc.\n\nYes, because Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, which matches.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is f(n), where f(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, for n=3, the answer is 1/4. Let's see: the total number of valid subsets is 2, which is Fib(3)=2. 2/(2^3) = 2/8=1/4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is that the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nWait, but wait: in the n=5 case, the probability is 5/32, which is 5/(2^5), which again is Fib(5)/2^5.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute Fib(n), multiply by the modular inverse of 2^n mod MOD, and output the result.\n\nWait, but wait: for n=1, Fib(1) is 1, so the probability is 1/2. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, Fib(2)=1, 1/4. Correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the nth Fibonacci number modulo MOD, where MOD is 998244353.\n\n2. Precompute the inverse of 2^n modulo MOD.\n\n3. Multiply the two results, then take modulo MOD.\n\nBut wait, how to compute Fib(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nYes, we can compute it using dynamic programming in O(n) time.\n\nNow, the steps to code:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute Fib(n), where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2).\n\n- Compute pow(2, n, MOD), then compute the modular inverse of this.\n\n- Multiply Fib(n) by the inverse, mod MOD.\n\nSo, for example, when n=5, Fib(5)=5, 2^5=32, inverse of 32 mod MOD is 156479681 (since 32*156479681 mod MOD is 1). Then 5 * 156479681 mod MOD is 5*156479681 = 781,989,405 → mod 998244353 is 781,989,405 - 998244353*0 = 781,989,405. Wait, but the sample output for n=5 is 842268673. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's compute 5 / 32 mod 998244353.\n\nCompute 32's inverse: since MOD is a prime, 32^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nCompute 32^(-1) mod MOD:\n\nBut MOD is 998244353.\n\nCompute 32^k mod MOD, where k is MOD-2.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute pow(32, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\npow(32, 998244351, 998244353) ?\n\nWell, in code, we can compute inv_2n = pow(2, n, MOD) and then compute its inverse.\n\nWait, in Python, pow(2, n, MOD) returns 2^n mod MOD. Then, the inverse is pow(2, n * (MOD-2), MOD). Or, more accurately, inv_2n = pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD-2, MOD).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for n=5:\n\ninv_2n = pow(2,5) mod MOD =32.\n\ninv_32 = pow(32, MOD-2, MOD) = 748683265.\n\nWait, because 32 * 748683265 mod MOD equals 1.\n\nSo, 5 * inv_32 mod MOD is 5 * 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nCompute 5*748683265 = 3,743,416,325.\n\nThen mod 998244353:\n\n3,743,416,325 divided by 998,244,353:\n\nWell, 998,244,353 * 3 = 2,994,733,059. Subtracting from 3,743,416,325 gives 748,683,266.\n\nWhich is the sample output for n=5: 748,683,265? Wait, the sample output for n=5 is '842268673'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, sample input for n=5 is '5' and output is '842268673'.\n\nWait, 5/32 mod 998244353 is 5 * inv_32 mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_32: 32^{-1} mod MOD is x such that 32x ≡ 1 mod MOD.\n\nCompute 32 * x mod MOD = 1.\n\nWe can compute x using the extended Euclidean algorithm, but perhaps it's easier to compute using Fermat's little theorem since MOD is prime.\n\nx = 32^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nCompute 32^998244351 mod MOD.\n\nBut calculating this in code is manageable.\n\nWait, let's compute 32^ (MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps in the code, using pow(32, MOD-2, MOD) will give us the correct inverse.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nCompute Fib(n), compute pow(2, n) mod MOD, compute its inverse mod MOD, multiply Fib(n) by the inverse mod MOD, and output the result.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute Fib(n) as follows:\n\nif n == 1: Fib =1\n\nelif n ==2: Fib=1\n\nelse: Fib(n) = Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2)\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is manageable.\n\nCompute pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_pow_2n = pow(pow_2n, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nResult = (Fib(n) * inv_pow_2n) % MOD.\n\nPrint result.\n\nTesting this against the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nFib(2) =1.\n\npow_2n=4.\n\ninv_pow_2n = 748683265.\n\n1 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265.\n\nBut the sample output for n=2 is 748683265.\n\nWait, but according to the note, the real answer is 1/4, which is 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=3.\n\nFib(3)=2.\n\npow_2n=8.\n\ninv_8= 748683265 * 2 (since 8*124780544 = 1 mod MOD). Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 8 mod MOD is 8.\n\nCompute inv_8: 8^ (MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nCompute 8^(MOD-2) mod MOD. But in code, it's handled correctly.\n\nSo, 2 * inv_8 mod MOD.\n\nWhich for n=3, 2 * inv_8 mod MOD is 2 * 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nWait, 748683265 * 2 = 1,497,366,530.\n\nSubtract MOD once: 1,497,366,530 - 998,244,353 = 499,122,177.\n\nBut the sample output for n=3 is 748683265.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Fib(n) calculation.\n\nWait, for n=3, the number of valid subsets is 2.\n\nWhich is Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo, 2 / 8 = 1/4, which is 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nWait, but 2 * inv_8 mod MOD is 2 * 748683265 mod MOD.\n\nWait, 748683265 * 2 is 1,497,366,530.\n\nDivide by MOD: 1,497,366,530 - 1 * MOD = 1,497,366,530 - 998,244,353 = 499,122,177.\n\nWhich is different from the sample output of 748683265.\n\nSo, something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid subsets is not Fib(n), but another function.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the n=3 case.\n\nFor n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n1. Towers at 1,2,3.\n\n2. Tower at 2, power 2.\n\nSo, two valid subsets.\n\nThus, the count is 2, which is Fib(3) = 2.\n\nSo, the probability is 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut according to the code, 2 * inv_8 mod MOD would be 2 * 748683265 mod MOD = 1,497,366,530 mod MOD.\n\nBut 1,497,366,530 - MOD is 1,497,366,530 - 998,244,353 = 499,122,177.\n\nBut the sample output is 748683265.\n\nSo, clearly, something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused Fib(n) with another function.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is Fib(n+1).\n\nWait, for n=1, Fib(2)=1, which is correct.\n\nn=2: Fib(3)=2, but the count is 1.\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is Fib(n+1) -1.\n\nWait, for n=1: Fib(2) -1= 1-1=0. No.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the model.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of Dyck paths or other combinatorial structures.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the number of subsets that form a valid binary tree structure, which is the Catalan number C_{n}.\n\nBut for n=3, the Catalan number is 5, which is higher than the required 2.\n\nSo, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the number of ways to arrange the towers such that each is the root of a full binary tree.\n\nWait, for n=3, the count is 2: the root can be at position 2, splitting into left and right subtrees of size 1 each. Or, perhaps it's a chain of three nodes, but that's not a binary tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the same as the number of compositions into 1 and 2.\n\nWait, n=3 can be composed as 3 (all 1s), or 2+1, which is the middle tower.\n\nSo, count is 2.\n\nWhich is same as the number of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the count is 3.\n\nWhich is Fib(4)=3.\n\nSo, it's consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial model is correct.\n\nThus, for n=3, the count is Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo, the code for n=3 would compute 2 * inv_8 mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 2 * inv_8 = 2 * 748683265 mod MOD = 1,497,366,530 mod MOD.\n\nWait, MOD is 998244353.\n\nCompute 1,497,366,530 divided by MOD: 1,497,366,530 - 998,244,353 = 499,122,177.\n\nBut sample output is 748683265.\n\nWait, this suggests that the initial model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is Fib(n+1).\n\nWait, for n=3: Fib(4)=3, but the count is 2.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the number of valid binary trees, which is Catalan(n), but for n=3, that's 5, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the number of ways to tile a 1xN grid with squares and dominoes, which is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nYes, that's the same as the count here.\n\nBecause each square is a tower with power 1, and each domino represents a tower with power 2, covering two adjacent towns.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the tiling problem.\n\nWait, in tiling, for a length n, the number of tilings is Fib(n+1), but in our case, it's Fib(n).\n\nHmm, perhaps the count is the same as the number of ways to tile a 1x(n) board with squares (covering 1 town) and dominoes (covering 2 towns), which is Fib(n).\n\nWait, but for n=3, the number of tilings is 3: all squares, square and domino, domino and square.\n\nWait, but in our problem, for n=3, the count is 2.\n\nSo, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the count is the number of valid subsets that form a certain structure, which can be modeled as the number of ways to arrange the towers in a way that each interval is either covered by a single tower (power 1) or a tower that covers an even-length interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the number of subsets that form a certain type of binary structure, which may be counted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the model is wrong, and the number of valid subsets is not Fib(n), but the count is the same as the number of ways to select a subset that forms a certain type of binary tree.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial model is incorrect, and the count is actually the number of ways to arrange the towers as a certain kind of binary search tree, which is counted by the Catalan numbers.\n\nBut earlier examples don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is the (n)th Catalan number.\n\nWait, for n=3, Catalan is 5, but the count is 2.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is the (n-1)th Catalan number.\n\nFor n=3, Catalan(2)=2, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, Catalan(1)=1, which matches.\n\nFor n=1, Catalan(0)=1, which matches.\n\nn=4: Catalan(3)=5, but earlier calculation shows f(4)=3, which is less than 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is the number of ways to arrange the towers in a way that forms a certain kind of structure, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the same as the number of ways to build a binary Huffman tree for the towns, which is also a Catalan number.\n\nBut again, the numbers don't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial model.\n\nWait, for n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n1. {1,2,3}: each with power 1.\n\n2. {2}: power 2.\n\nSo, 2 subsets.\n\nWhich is 2.\n\nWhich is Fib(3) =2.\n\nThus, the initial model holds.\n\nSo, the code should compute Fib(n) and multiply by inv(2^n).\n\nBut why for n=3, the sample output is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nThus, the code computes Fib(3)=2, pow(2,3)=8.\n\ninv_8 mod MOD is 124780544.\n\nBecause 8*124780544 = 998,244,352, which is -1 mod MOD. Wait, no: 8 * 124780544 = 998,244,352, which is MOD-1.\n\nSo, 8*124780544 ≡ -1 mod MOD. Thus, 8* (-124780544) ≡ 1 mod MOD.\n\nSo, the inverse is -124780544 mod MOD, which is 998244353 - 124780544 = 873463809.\n\nThus, 2 * 873463809 mod MOD is 1746927618 mod MOD.\n\nCompute 1746927618 - 998244353 = 748683265.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAh, so perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the code needs to compute the inverse correctly.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nThe problem reduces to computing the nth Fibonacci number, Fib(n), then dividing by 2^n modulo MOD, which is done by multiplying Fib(n) with the modular inverse of 2^n.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can set their signal powers such that each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal, while towns 0 and n+1 receive none. The result should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing a pattern in the valid configurations of towers. Each valid configuration forms a structure similar to a binary tree, where each interval covered by a tower is either a single tower or a tower covering an even-length interval.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The number of valid configurations for n towns corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number. This is because each valid configuration can be broken down into smaller valid configurations, leading to a recursive relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result must be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. We compute the modular inverse of 2^n using Fermat's Little Theorem, which allows us to compute the inverse using exponentiation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute Fib(n)\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    fib[1] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        fib[2] = 1\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    fib_n = fib[n]\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute inverse of 2^n mod MOD\n    inv_pow_2n = pow(pow_2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    # Result is (fib_n * inv_pow_2n) mod MOD\n    result = (fib_n * inv_pow_2n) % MOD\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: We precompute the nth Fibonacci number modulo 998244353 using dynamic programming. This helps in efficiently handling the large value of n up to 200,000.\n2. **Modular Exponentiation**: We compute 2^n modulo 998244353 using Python's built-in `pow` function for efficient exponentiation.\n3. **Modular Inverse**: Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we compute the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353, which allows us to convert the division into multiplication under modulo arithmetic.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by multiplying the nth Fibonacci number with the modular inverse of 2^n, then taking the result modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and compute the required probability within the given limits.",
