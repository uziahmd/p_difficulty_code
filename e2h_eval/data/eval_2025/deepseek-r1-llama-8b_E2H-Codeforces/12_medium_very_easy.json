The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1. She has m tasks. For the i-th task, she needs to be at ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, she must process each task in order, right? Because for each task i, she must have done all j < i already. So the tasks are processed in the order they are given.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Oh, perhaps it's that for each task, when she is doing task i, she must have already completed tasks 1 to i-1. So the processing order is sequential, like she does task 1, then 2, etc., up to m. But wait, the input is given as a list of a1, a2, ..., am, which represents the target houses for each task in order. So for each task i, she must reach a_i, and before that, she must have finished all the previous tasks.\n\nSo, the way she moves is such that for each i from 1 to m, she goes from wherever she was to a_i, and along the way, she must pass through any necessary houses to ensure that all previous tasks are completed. Or perhaps, the order is that she must process the tasks in the order given, and for each i, she must be at a_i, but also, she must have done all the earlier tasks.\n\nBut how does this translate into movement? Let's think of it as a path that starts at 1, and for each task i, she moves to a_i, but she must do this in such a way that all the required positions for the earlier tasks are visited before their corresponding task.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to model the movement as visiting all the required positions in the order of their task indices, but in the minimal time possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to visit the earliest required positions first, ensuring that by the time we get to a later position, all the earlier ones have been covered.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal path that covers all the required points in the correct order, starting from 1, and making sure that each step is moving in the clockwise direction (since the ring is one-way).\n\nWait, let's look at the example given:\n\nIn the first test case, the input is 4 3, with the sequence 3,2,3.\n\nThe output is 6.\n\nThe explanation says the path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break this down.\n\nShe starts at 1. Then she moves to 2 (task 1?), then 3 (task 2?), then 4 (task 3?), but then she has to return to 1, then 2, then 3 again.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the tasks are processed in order. So the first task is a1=3, the second is a2=2, third a3=3.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Because for the second task, she needs to be at 2, but for the first task, she had to be at 3. So she has to do the first task first, then the second, then the third.\n\nWait, perhaps the order of the tasks is such that task 1 comes before task 2, which comes before task 3. So she must reach a1 first, then a2, then a3.\n\nSo in the first example, the steps are:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask 1: go to 3. That would require moving from 1 → 2 → 3, which takes 2 steps.\n\nThen, Task 2: go to 2. From 3, moving clockwise would take her to 4, then 1, then 2. That's 3 steps.\n\nThen, Task 3: go to 3. From 2, she goes to 3, which is 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2 +3 +1 =6. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive points, considering that the next point is the current task's position, and each time she must move clockwise.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think: the order of the tasks is 1, 2, ..., m. So for each i from 1 to m, she must go to a_i, but she must have already passed through all the a_j where j < i.\n\nWait, no. Because for task i, she has to be at a_i, but she might not have to have visited all a_j for j < i before. Because the problem says that to complete the i-th task, she just needs to be at a_i and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So perhaps, as long as she is at a_i, regardless of whether she has been to other a_j's, but the processing is in order.\n\nWait, no. Because the way the problem is phrased: she must be in a_i and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So for task i, she must have done all j=1 to j=i-1. So the order of processing the tasks is 1, 2, ..., m. So she must process them in this order.\n\nSo the movement is determined by the sequence of a_1, a_2, ..., a_m.\n\nEach step i, she goes from her current position to a_i, moving clockwise, and the distance is the minimal steps needed in that direction.\n\nWait, but the minimal steps may involve taking a different path if it's shorter.\n\nWait, no, because the ring is a cycle. So moving from position x to y, the clockwise distance is (y -x) mod n. Or wait, no. Because in a ring of n houses, moving from x to y in clockwise direction requires (y -x) steps if y >=x, else (n -x + y) steps. Alternatively, it's (y -x) % n.\n\nWait, yes, exactly. So the distance from x to y is (y - x) % n. Because moving clockwise, you add 1 each step, wrapping around at n back to 1.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to m, she has to move from the previous position (let's say p_{i-1}) to a_i, adding (a_i - p_{i-1}) mod n to the total time.\n\nBut wait, initially, she's at 1. So p0 =1.\n\nThen, for i=1, she moves from p0=1 to a_1, adding (a_1 -1) mod n steps.\n\nFor i=2, she's at a_1, and moves to a_2: steps added are (a_2 - a_1) mod n.\n\nAnd so on until i=m.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of these individual steps.\n\nBut wait, what about if the a_i's are not in order? Like, suppose a_1 is 3, a_2 is 2, etc.\n\nLike the first sample: a1=3, a2=2, a3=3.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1 →3: distance (3-1)=2.\n\n3→2: since 2 <3, the clockwise distance is (2 +n -3) mod n. Since n=4, 2 +4-3=3.\n\n3→2 is 3 steps.\n\nThen 2→3: 1 step.\n\nTotal 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother sample: input is 4 3, 2 3 3.\n\nSo a1=2, a2=3, a3=3.\n\nSteps:\n\n1→2: distance 1.\n\n2→3: 1.\n\n3→3: 0.\n\nTotal 2 steps. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the second sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the a_i's in the order of their task indices (1 to m), as per the input.\n\n- For each consecutive pair (p_prev, a_i), compute (a_i - p_prev) mod n, and sum all these.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1, not the first a_i. So the first step is from 1 to a_1.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize prev = 1.\n\ntotal_time =0.\n\nfor each a in a_list:\n\n   distance = (a - prev) mod n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   prev = a\n\nreturn total_time.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the code needs to read n and m, then read the list of m a_i's.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nSo, in Python, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the modulo correctly is important. Because (a - prev) can be negative if a is smaller than prev, but mod n will handle that.\n\nFor example, (2-3) mod4 is (-1 mod4)=3, which is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a = list of integers.\n\nprev =1\n\ntime=0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    time += (num - prev) %n\n\n    prev = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\nStep 1: 3-1=2 → time +=2 → time=2.\n\nStep 2: 2-3= -1 mod4=3 → time +=3 →5.\n\nStep3:3-2=1 → time +=1 →6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample: a=[2,3,3]\n\nStep1: 2-1=1 → time=1.\n\nStep2:3-2=1 → time=2.\n\nStep3:3-3=0 → remains 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase when all a_i are 1: then each step is 0, total 0.\n\nIf m=0? But according to input constraints, m is >=1.\n\nWait, the input says m can be 1, but no, looking back: Input constraints are 1<=m<=105.\n\nWait, no, wait the problem says m>=1? Let me check.\n\nProblem statement says m can be 1, because in the input description, m can be 1.\n\nWait, no, the input says 'the second line contains m integers'.\n\nSo for m=1, the code will process one step from 1 to a1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, m=2, a1=2, a2=1.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1→2: 1 step.\n\n2→1: (1-2) mod2= ( -1 ) mod2=1.\n\nTotal steps 2.\n\nWhich makes sense: 1 →2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step).\n\nAnother case: n=3, a_list = [3,3,3].\n\nSteps:\n\n1→3: 2 steps.\n\n3→3:0.\n\n3→3:0.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete each task in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Movement**: Xenia can only move clockwise around the ring, which means from any house `i`, she can only move to house `i+1` (or wrap around to house 1 after house `n`).\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Xenia must complete each task in the given order. For each task, she needs to be at the specified house, and she must have already completed all previous tasks.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two consecutive houses `x` and `y` in a clockwise direction on a ring of `n` houses is calculated as `(y - x) % n`. This handles both cases where `y` is greater than `x` or when `y` is smaller than `x` by wrapping around the ring.\n\nThe solution involves:\n1. Starting at house 1.\n2. For each task, calculate the distance from the current house to the next required house using modulo arithmetic to handle the ring structure.\n3. Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    total += (num - current) % n\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of target houses for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each target house in the list:\n   - Calculate the distance from the current house to the target house using `(num - current) % n`.\n   - Update the total time with this distance.\n   - Update the current position to the target house.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the ring structure and ensuring that each task is completed in the correct order.",
