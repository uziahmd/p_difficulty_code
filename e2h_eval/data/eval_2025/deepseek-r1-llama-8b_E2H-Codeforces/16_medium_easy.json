Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) in Crazy Town. The town has n infinite line roads, each defined by an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. These roads divide the plane into regions or blocks. My home and the university are in some of these blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\nHmm, the key here is understanding what determines whether two blocks are adjacent. From the description, two blocks can be adjacent if they share a common border segment. But how do the roads affect this?\n\nWait, the roads are lines, and each pair of lines can intersect at most once, right? Because two distinct lines in a plane either intersect at a single point or are parallel.\n\nSo, each intersection point is where exactly two roads cross. Now, for any point not on any road, it's inside a block. Moving between blocks requires crossing a road. But the movement is allowed only if the blocks share a border with a non-zero length.\n\nWait, but how does that translate into steps? It feels like this is related to the concept of Voronoi diagrams. Because each road represents a line that divides the plane into two, and the regions are the Voronoi cells.\n\nIn a Voronoi diagram, each cell consists of all points closer to a particular site than any other. But in this problem, the sites are the roads, perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, no. In our case, the lines themselves are the boundaries. So the regions are the areas where certain conditions hold regarding which side of the lines they are on.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. The problem is about moving from home to university, each step crossing a road boundary. So the minimal steps would correspond to the minimal number of roads you need to cross when moving from home to university.\n\nWait, that makes sense! Because each time you cross a road, you move from one block to another. So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Or wait, more precisely, the number of roads that lie between the two points in such a way that their orientation relative to the points changes.\n\nOh right! For each road, we can determine on which side the home and the university lie. If for a given road, the home and university are on opposite sides, then this road is a separating road between them. So the minimal number of steps required is the number of such roads.\n\nBecause each time you cross a separating road, you get closer to the university. So the total steps would be the count of roads that separate home and university.\n\nSo the approach is: for each road, check whether home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nThat's a clever insight! So the problem reduces to counting how many lines (roads) separate the two points.\n\nHow do I check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, plugging in a point (x0, y0) gives f = a*x0 + b*y0 + c. If f is positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other. If f is zero, the point is on the line, but the problem states that home and university are not on any road.\n\nSo for each road, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 and f2 have opposite signs, then the road separates home and university. Count all such roads.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the example provided.\n\nSample Input:\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1).\nThere are 2 roads:\nFirst road: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\nSecond road: 1x +0y -3=0 → x=3.\n\nFor the first road (y=0): home is (1,1) → f1=1*1+0*1+0=1 >0. University is (-1,-1) → f2= -1 <0. So this road is separating. So count 1.\n\nFor the second road (x=3): home is x=1 <3 → f1=1+0-3= -2 <0. University is x=-1 <3 → f2= -1 -3 = -4 <0. So same side. So this road is not separating. So total count is 1. But the sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the sample input has two roads, but perhaps I misread the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input as per the user is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the first part is home and university, then n=2, then two roads.\n\nWait, the first road is 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. Home is (1,1), which is above y=0. University is (-1,-1), which is below. So this road is a separator, count +=1.\n\nThe second road is 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. Home is at x=1>0, so f1=1. University is x=-1<0, f2=-1. So again, opposite sides. So count is 2. Hence, the sample output is 2.\n\nAh, okay, I see. So in that case, both roads separate the two points.\n\nSo my initial approach is correct.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each of the n roads, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 +c and f2 = a*x2 +b*y2 +c. If f1 and f2 have opposite signs (i.e., product is negative), then this road is a separator, increment the count.\n\nThe count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nSo now, the task is to write code that reads home and university coordinates, then for each road, compute f1 and f2, check if their product is negative, and sum those.\n\nEdge cases: what if a road has a=0 and b=0? No, the problem states that ai and bi are not both zero.\n\nAnother edge case: home and university are the same point. But the problem says they are in different blocks, because they are not on the same road, but wait, no, the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road. So if home == university, then they are in the same block. So steps needed is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, \"it is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\" So they are not on any road, but can be in the same block.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nIf (x1,y1) == (x2,y2), output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nFor each road, compute f1 and f2.\n\nIf f1 * f2 < 0, increment count.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nWe'll read the input lines.\n\nIn Python, the first line after the initial prompt is home's coordinates. Second line is university's. Third line is n.\n\nThen n lines follow, each with a, b, c.\n\nCompute for each road:\n\nf1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\nf2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif f1 * f2 < 0: count +=1\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 --> y=0\n1 0 0 --> x=0\n\nFor first road: f1=0*1 +1*1 +0=1, f2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1. Product is -1, so count +=1.\n\nSecond road: f1=1*1+0*1+0=1, f2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1. Product is -1, count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2, which matches sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are in the same block. Then, for all roads, either they are on the same side or not. But if none of the roads separate them, then count is 0.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are in different blocks, but all roads don't separate them. How? Well, that's impossible because without any roads separating them, they must be in the same block.\n\nWait, no. Because the roads may not all pass between them, but perhaps they are arranged such that the two points are in separate regions, but no individual road separates them. Hmm, is that possible?\n\nWait, think of two parallel lines. Suppose home is in one region, university in another. But since the lines are parallel, no line actually crosses between them. So for each road, the home and university are on the same side. So the count is zero. But that's impossible because the two points are in different blocks. So in reality, there must be at least one road that separates them.\n\nWait, maybe not. Wait, no—each road is an infinite line. So two points can be in different blocks even if no individual road separates them if the arrangement is such that multiple roads create a kind of barrier.\n\nWait, for example, imagine three roads forming a triangle. The two points could be on opposite sides of each road, but perhaps their positions require crossing all three roads. But according to our logic, each road that separates the two points contributes to the count. So the minimal steps would be the number of such roads.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose home is in a cell A, and university in cell B. The minimal path from A to B must cross each road that separates them. So the count is indeed the number of such roads.\n\nSo regardless of the arrangement, the minimal steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nBut wait, what about floating points? Oh, no. Since all computations are integer-based (as a, b, c are integers), and f1 and f2 are computed as a*x + b*y + c, which can be positive, negative, or zero. But since home and university are not on any road, f1 and f2 are never zero.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nIf (x1, y1) == (x2, y2), print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet me test it with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nAs before, f1 for first road is 1, f2 is -1. Product is -1, count is 1.\n\nSecond road: f1=1, f2=-1. Product is -1, count becomes 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are the same point.\n\nInput:\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\n3\n\n... any roads.\n\nSince home == university, the code will print 0.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are in the same region, but none of the roads separate them.\n\nIs that possible? Let's see.\n\nSuppose home is (0,0), university is (1,1). There are two roads:\n\nroad1: x=0.5 (so for home, f1=0.5, for university, f2=0.5. So same sign. Not a separator.\n\nroad2: y=0.5. Same as above.\n\nSo for both roads, f1 and f2 have same signs. So count is 0. So the minimal steps are 0.\n\nBut wait, are home and university in the same block?\n\nYes, because all roads don't separate them. So the code correctly returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are in different blocks, but all roads do not separate them.\n\nWait, is that possible? For example, arrange three roads such that home is on one side of all three, and university on the other side of all three. Then each road would contribute to the count.\n\nBut perhaps, if the roads are arranged in a way that the two points are on opposite sides of each road.\n\nWait, but that's the same as each road being a separator.\n\nSo the code will correctly count each such road.\n\nI think the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nSo, I think this approach is correct and efficient. The constraints are small, n up to 300, so O(n) is acceptable.\n\nNow, writing the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (line) in Crazy Town can be thought of as a boundary between blocks. If two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road, that road acts as a separator between their respective blocks. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of such separating roads.\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each road is defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\).\n   - For each road, we can determine which side of the line the home and university lie on by evaluating the expression \\(ax + by + c\\) at those points.\n   - If the product of these evaluations for home and university is negative, they lie on opposite sides of the road, indicating it is a separator.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the expression \\(ax + by + c\\) at both home and university.\n   - Count the number of roads where the values for home and university have opposite signs (i.e., their product is negative).\n\n3. **Complexity**:\n   - The solution involves iterating through each road once, resulting in a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of roads. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (x1, y1) == (x2, y2):\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n = int(input())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Separation**: For each road, the code evaluates whether home and university lie on opposite sides by checking the sign of the expression \\(ax + by + c\\). If they do, it increments the count of separating roads.\n- **Output**: The count of separating roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points in the plane.",
