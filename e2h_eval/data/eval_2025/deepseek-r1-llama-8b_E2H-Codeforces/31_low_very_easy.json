Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that S. Then, I need to find the smallest number of additional cards (each with value in [-x, x]) such that their total sum is -S. Because when we add their sum to S, it should equal zero.\n\nWait, right. So the sum of the found cards is S. We need the sum of the additional cards to be -S. And each additional card can contribute at most x towards this sum (since each card can be at most x in absolute value).\n\nSo the minimal number of cards required would be the smallest k such that k * x >= |S|. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum needed.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. For example, if S is 5 and x is 2. Then 3 cards are needed: 2+2+1? Wait no, because each card can be as high as x, but maybe we can use x each time. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, rounded up to 3. So yes, 3 cards.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. If S is zero, no more cards are needed.\n3. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of S, say T.\n4. The minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Because each card can contribute up to x towards T.\n\nWait, but wait—what if T is exactly divisible by x? Then the division is exact. Like T=4, x=2: 4/2=2, so two cards.\n\nYes. So the formula is ceiling(T / x). But how do I compute that in code?\n\nWell, in Python, I can calculate T divided by x, then check if there's a remainder. If yes, add one. Otherwise, just take the quotient.\n\nAlternatively, use the math.ceil function. But since T and x are integers, perhaps using integer operations is better.\n\nLet me see: for T and x, the minimal k is (T + x - 1) // x. That way, if T is divisible by x, it gives T/x, else it rounds up.\n\nFor example:\n- T=5, x=2: 5+2-1=6, 6//2=3.\n- T=4, x=2: 4+2-1=5, 5//2=2.\n- T=3, x=3: 3+3-1=5, 5//3=1.\n- T=0: returns 0.\n\nSo yes, that formula works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and x.\n- Read the list of n integers.\n- Compute S = sum of the list.\n- If S is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute T = abs(S).\n- Compute k = (T + x -1) // x.\n- Output k.\n\nWait, but what about when x is zero? Oh, but in the input, x is at least 1. Because the constraints say 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.\n\nSo no problem there.\n\nTesting the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S = (-1) +1 +2 = 2.\n\nT is 2.\n\nk = (2 +2-1)/2 = 3//2=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S = -4.\n\nT is 4.\n\nx is 3.\n\n(4 +3-1)/3 =6//3=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose n=1, x=5, and the found card is 3.\n\nSum S=3. T=3.\n\nk=(3 +5-1)/5=7//5=1. So one card of -3.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, x=10.\n\nFound cards: 10 and 10. Sum S=20. T=20.\n\nk=(20 +10-1)//10=29//10=2. So two cards of -10 each.\n\nWait, but could I use a single card of -20? No, because x is 10, so the maximum each card can contribute is 10. So no, can't do that. So yes, need 2 cards.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum \\( S \\) of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Check for Zero Sum**: If \\( S \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Determine the Required Sum**: If \\( S \\) is not zero, compute the absolute value \\( T \\) of \\( S \\). This represents the total sum needed from the additional cards to make the overall sum zero.\n4. **Compute Minimum Number of Cards**: To find the minimum number of additional cards, each contributing up to \\( x \\) towards the required sum, use the formula \\( k = \\lceil \\frac{T}{x} \\rceil \\). This can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as \\( k = (T + x - 1) // x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = abs(s)\n    k = (t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards \\( n \\) and the maximum absolute value \\( x \\) of each card. It then reads the integers on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n- **Zero Check**: If the sum is zero, it immediately outputs zero since no additional cards are needed.\n- **Required Sum Calculation**: For non-zero sums, the absolute value of the sum is taken to determine the target sum needed from additional cards.\n- **Card Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, the code calculates the minimum number of cards required to achieve the target sum, ensuring each card contributes up to \\( x \\) towards the target.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed in constant time, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
