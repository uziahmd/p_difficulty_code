Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards reaching the required sum.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current sum of the found cards.\n2. The target is to make the sum zero. So the required sum from the new cards is -current_sum.\n3. Each new card can add at most x (if positive) or subtract at most x (if negative). Wait, no: each card can contribute up to x in magnitude. So, for each new card, the maximum possible contribution towards the desired sum is x. So if the required sum is S, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |S| / x.\n\nWait, but maybe not exactly. Because maybe the sum isn't perfectly divisible by x. For example, if S is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards (2 + 2 +1, but wait, 1 is allowed because x is 2. So yes, 3 cards are needed: 2, 2, 1? No, wait, each card can only be up to 2 in absolute value. So 2+2+1 would require three cards, but the sum is 5. Alternatively, 3 cards: 2, 2, 1. Or perhaps 3 cards of 2, which sum to 6, which is more than needed. Hmm, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, no. The required sum is S = -current_sum. We need to achieve this using as few cards as possible, each contributing up to x in either direction.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is the smallest k such that k * x >= |S|. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum. So, for example, if |S| is 5 and x is 2, then 5 /2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4 <5, but 3*2=6 >=5.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the formula is: minimal k is the ceiling of |S| / x.\n\nBut wait, what if S is zero? Then no cards are needed. That's a corner case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute sum_found = sum of the given numbers.\n- required_sum = -sum_found\n- if required_sum is zero: output 0.\n- else: compute the minimal k where k is the smallest integer such that k * x >= |required_sum|.\n- So k = ceil( |required_sum| / x )\n\nWait, but let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\nInput: 3 2\nNumbers: -1, 1, 2\nSum is (-1 +1 +2 )= 2. So required_sum is -2.\nSo |required_sum| is 2.\nx is 2. So 2 / 2 is 1. So k is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: 2 3\nNumbers: -2, -2\nSum is -4. Required_sum is 4.\nx is 3.\n4 /3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. So k is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say sum is 5, x is 2.\nAs before, k is 3.\n\nWhat if sum is 0? Then no cards needed.\n\nWhat if sum is 10, x is 10: k is 1.\n\nWhat if sum is 10, x is 9: 10/9 is ~1.11, so k=2.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Read the input: n and x, then the list of numbers.\n- Compute sum_found.\n- required = -sum_found\n- if required is 0: print 0.\n- else:\n   compute abs_required = abs(required)\n   k =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and new) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target is to make the total sum zero, so the required sum from the new cards is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards**: The minimum number of additional cards needed is determined by the absolute value of the required sum divided by the maximum absolute value of the cards (x). We use the ceiling of this division to ensure we cover the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(cards)\nrequired = -sum_found\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n    k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x  # Equivalent to ceiling division\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Required Adjustment**: The required adjustment to make the total sum zero is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimum number of additional cards needed is found using ceiling division to ensure we can cover the required adjustment with the maximum possible contribution per card.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of additional cards needed, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
