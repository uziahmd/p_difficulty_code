Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I should probably sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they are not in order, it's harder to see the coverage. Sorting will help me visualize which lanterns cover which parts of the street.\n\nOnce sorted, I can imagine that the street is divided into segments. For each segment between two consecutive lanterns, I need to ensure that the maximum distance from either lantern (the left or the right) is less than or equal to d. Because if any point in that segment is more than d away from both neighboring lanterns, then that point won't be covered, and thus we need a larger d.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Actually, for each segment between two consecutive lanterns, the required d is determined by the midpoint of that segment. Or perhaps the maximum distance from either end? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose two lanterns are at positions x1 and x2, with x1 < x2. The street segment between them is from x1 to x2. Any point in this segment must be within d of at least one lantern. So the worst case is the point farthest from both x1 and x2. That would be the midpoint of the segment. Because the midpoint is as far as possible from both ends. So the distance from the midpoint to either lantern is (x2 - x1)/2. Therefore, for this segment, the required d must be at least half the length of the segment.\n\nBut wait, that's only if there's a segment between two lanterns. What about the ends? Like, before the first lantern and after the last lantern?\n\nAh right! For the area before the first lantern, the furthest point is at 0. So the required d must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0. Similarly, for the area after the last lantern, the furthest point is at l, so d must be at least the distance from the last lantern to l.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. Compute the required d for each segment between consecutive lanterns, considering the midpoint.\n3. Also compute the required d for the start and end points.\n4. The overall minimal d is the maximum of all these computed values.\n\nThat makes sense. So let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input gives n and l, then the list of ai's. Then, I need to process these ai's.\n\nSo, in Python, I can read the second line as a list of integers. Then sort them.\n\nThen, I need to handle the segments:\n\n- Before the first lantern: distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n- Between each pair of consecutive lanterns: max of (x_i+1 - x_i)/2 for all i.\n- After the last lantern: distance from last lantern to l.\n\nWait, but between two lanterns, the maximum required d is the maximum of (x_i+1 - x_i)/2. But wait, no. Because if you have two lanterns, the middle of their segment is the point that requires the largest d. So for each consecutive pair, the required d is (x_j - x_i)/2. So for all such pairs, the maximum among those and the start and end is the minimal d needed.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute all the necessary distances:\n\n- Start with 0 to first lantern: first_ai - 0. So d_start = first_ai.\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute (ai_next - ai_prev)/2. Take the maximum of these.\n- Then, compute (l - last_ai). So d_end = l - last_ai.\n- The minimal d is the maximum of d_start, all the midpoints, and d_end.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the lantern positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCompute the required d for each segment:\n\nStart: 0 to 0 is 0, but wait, the first lantern is at 0. So the distance from 0 to 0 is zero, so d_start is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the first lantern is at 0, so the street starts at 0, which is covered. So d_start is zero.\n\nBetween 0 and 3: the midpoint is 1.5. So required d is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and5: midpoint is 4. So d for this segment is 1.\n\nWait, wait no, wait: 5-3=2, so midpoint is 4, but the distance from 3 is 1, from 5 is 1. So the maximum needed is 1.\n\nSimilarly, between 5 and7: midpoint is 6, distance is 1.\n\nSame for 7 and9: midpoint is 8, distance 1.\n\nBetween9 and14: 14-9=5, midpoint is 11.5. So required d is 2.75.\n\nBetween14 and15: midpoint is 14.5, required d is 0.5.\n\nEnd: 15 is the end of the street, so d_end is zero.\n\nNow, the maximum of all these is 2.75. So why does the sample output say 2.5?\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the output is 2.5000000000.\n\nHmm, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the first sample. The lanterns are at [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nWait, wait, the first sample input is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — when sorted, it's [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo the segments are:\n\n0-3: length 3. Midpoint is 1.5 → required d is 1.5.\n\n3-5: length 2 → midpoint 4 → required d 1.\n\n5-7: length 2 → midpoint 6 → required d 1.\n\n7-9: length 2 → midpoint 8 → required d 1.\n\n9-14: length 5 → midpoint 11.5 → required d 2.75.\n\n14-15: length 1 → midpoint 14.5 → required d 0.5.\n\nEnd: 15 is end, so d_end is 0.\n\nStart: 0 is start, so d_start is 0.\n\nSo the maximum among all is 2.75. But the sample output is 2.5.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So my logic must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the lanterns don't just cover their own segment, but also the previous and next segments. Hmm, no. No, the coverage is per lantern, but the entire street must be covered.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is not just the maximum of the midpoints and the ends, but also other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of the following:\n\nFor all lanterns, the distance to the next lantern beyond it, considering that the current lantern's coverage might extend beyond.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the coverage intervals for each lantern.\n\nEach lantern at position a_i covers [a_i -d, a_i +d]. The entire street [0, l] must be covered by the union of all these intervals.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the union of all intervals and find the minimal d such that their union covers [0, l].\n\nHmm, that's a different way to model the problem.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal d where all the intervals [a_i -d, a_i +d] cover [0, l].\n\nHow can I compute this?\n\nIdea:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns in ascending order.\n2. Compute the required d such that the union of all intervals covers [0, l].\n3. To find the minimal d, we can model the coverage and find the gaps.\n\nLet's consider the sorted lanterns a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}.\n\nThe first interval starts at a_0 -d. It must reach at least 0. So a_0 -d <=0 → d >=a_0.\n\nWait, no. Because a_0 is the first lantern, so the leftmost point is 0. So to cover 0, a_0 -d must be <=0 → d >=a_0.\n\nWait, no, because 0 is the starting point. So if a_0 is at some point, its coverage extends to a_0 -d. But if a_0 is at 0, then a_0 -d is 0 -d, which is negative. But the street starts at 0. So the coverage starts at max(0, a_i -d).\n\nSimilarly, the coverage ends at min(l, a_i +d).\n\nBut to cover the entire street, the union of all intervals must include [0, l].\n\nSo, the idea is to find the minimal d where:\n\n- The first interval covers from 0 to a_0 +d.\n\nBut no, the first interval may not cover 0 if a_0 is not 0.\n\nWait, for example, if the first lantern is at position x>0, then its left coverage is x-d. So to cover 0, x -d <=0 → d >=x.\n\nSimilarly, the last interval must cover up to l. So a_n-1 +d >= l → d >= l -a_n-1.\n\nFor the middle sections, between two lanterns, the coverage must connect.\n\nSo for two consecutive lanterns a_i and a_{i+1}, their coverage areas must overlap or meet.\n\nSo for each i from 0 to n-2:\n\na_{i} +d >= a_{i+1} -d → a_{i} +d >= a_{i+1} -d → 2d >= a_{i+1} -a_i → d >= (a_{i+1} -a_i)/2.\n\nSo the minimal d must satisfy all these conditions.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a_0 (since d >=a_0)\n- (a_{i+1} -a_i)/2 for all i\n- l -a_{n-1} (since d >= l -a_{n-1})\n\nSo that's the same as what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, according to this logic, the maximal value would be (14-9)/2 = 2.5, which aligns with the sample output.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate for the first sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7, l=15\n\nLantern positions: [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nCompute a_0 =0 → d must be >=0.\n\nCompute a_{n-1}=15 → l-a_{n-1}=15-15=0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 5:\n\ni=0: a_1 -a_0=3-0=3 → d >=1.5.\n\ni=1: a_2 -a_1=5-3=2 → d >=1.\n\ni=2:7-5=2 → d>=1.\n\ni=3:9-7=2 → d>=1.\n\ni=4:14-9=5 → d>=2.5.\n\ni=5:15-14=1 → d>=0.5.\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nAh, okay, so my initial approach was correct. Earlier, I thought the maximum was 2.75, but that was a miscalculation. Because 14-9 is 5, so 5/2 is 2.5.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nSort the lanterns.\n\nCompute the maximum between a_0, (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 for all i, and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThat's the minimal d.\n\nSo now, the plan is clear.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of ai's, convert to integers, sort.\n\nCompute the required d as the maximum of:\n\n- a[0] (distance from 0 to first lantern)\n- (a[i+1] - a[i])//2 for each consecutive pair\n- (l - a[-1]) (distance from last lantern to end)\n\nWait, but wait: for a[i+1] -a[i], it's integer division? No, in Python, it's float division.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCompute the maximum of:\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nif len(ai) ==0: # but n>=1, so not needed.\n\nelse:\n\nmax_d = ai[0] # d >= ai[0]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n\n    required = gap / 2.0\n\n    if required > max_d:\n\n        max_d = required\n\nrequired_end = l - ai[-1]\n\nif required_end > max_d:\n\n    max_d = required_end\n\nprint max_d with sufficient precision.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: n=1.\n\nIf there's only one lantern at position x. Then d must be at least max(x, (l -x)). Because the lantern must cover from 0 to l.\n\nSo, for example, if the lantern is at 0, then d can be zero, but wait, the lantern at 0 must cover up to l. So d needs to be l -0 = l. So in that case, d is l.\n\nAnother example: n=2, ai=[0,5], l=10.\n\nThe required d is max(0, (5-0)/2=2.5, 10-5=5). So the maximum is 5.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nEach lantern covers [0-5,0+5] → [-5,5], but since street starts at 0, the first lantern covers 0 to 5. The second is at 5, covering 0 to 10. So the union is 0 to 10. So d is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample.\n\nInput:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nai = [2,5]\n\nsorted: [2,5]\n\na[0]=2, so d >=2.\n\ngap between 2 and5 is 3 → 1.5.\n\nl -a[-1] is 5-5=0.\n\nSo max is 2, which is the sample output.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, ai=[l], then d is 0.\n\nBecause the lantern is at l, so it covers l -d to l +d. Since the street is from 0 to l, d=0 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but wait: if the lantern is at l, its coverage is from l-d to l+d. But the street ends at l. So, to cover l, d can be zero.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, ai = [1,3,6], l=10.\n\nCompute:\n\na0=1 → d>=1.\n\nGaps:\n\n3-1=2 → 1.\n\n6-3=3 → 1.5.\n\nEnd: 10-6=4.\n\nSo the maximum is 4.\n\nSo d=4.\n\nCheck:\n\nLantern at 1: covers 1-4= -3 (so 0 to 1+4=5.\n\nLantern at 3: covers 3-4= -1 (so 0 to 3+4=7.\n\nLantern at6: covers 6-4=2 to 6+4=10.\n\nSo the union is from 0 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the ai list as integers.\n\nSort it.\n\nCompute max_d.\n\nHandle each step.\n\nPrint max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nIn Python, that's straightforward.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead the input lines.\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nai.sort()\n\nmax_d = ai[0]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n\n    required = gap / 2.0\n\n    if required > max_d:\n\n        max_d = required\n\nrequired_end = l - ai[-1]\n\nif required_end > max_d:\n\n    max_d = required_end\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if n is 1?\n\nLike, n=1, l=5, ai=[3].\n\nThen, max_d is max(3, (no gaps), 5-3=2). So the maximum is 3.\n\nSo the coverage is [3-3, 3+3] → [0,6], which covers 0-5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai = [0, 2, 4], l=4.\n\nCompute:\n\na0=0 → d>=0.\n\ngaps: 2-0=2 → 1.\n\n4-2=2 →1.\n\nend: 4-4=0.\n\nMax is 1.\n\nSo each lantern covers 1 unit around.\n\n0 covers 0-1, 0+1=1. So 0-1 is covered, 1-3 covered by 2's lantern, 3-5 by 4's. But l is 4, so 3-5 includes 4. So yes, the entire street is covered.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, ai = [0,4,8], l=10.\n\nGaps: 4-0=4 →2.\n\n8-4=4→2.\n\nend: 10-8=2.\n\nmax is 4 (from a0=0?), no:\n\nWait, a0 is 0, so required is 0.\n\ngaps: 4 and4, required 2 each.\n\nend: 2.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but the coverage is:\n\n0 covers 0-2.\n\n4 covers 2-6.\n\n8 covers 6-10.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light up the entire street. The lanterns are placed at various points along the street, and each lantern lights up all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps us analyze the coverage segments between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Compute Required Distances**:\n   - **Start Coverage**: The distance from the beginning of the street (0) to the first lantern's position.\n   - **Midpoint Segments**: For each segment between two consecutive lanterns, compute the required distance as half the length of the segment. This is because the midpoint of the segment is the farthest point from both lanterns.\n   - **End Coverage**: The distance from the last lantern's position to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Determine Maximum Distance**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) must be the maximum of the computed start, midpoint, and end distances to ensure the entire street is covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nmax_d = ai[0]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n    required = gap / 2.0\n    if required > max_d:\n        max_d = required\n\nrequired_end = l - ai[-1]\nif required_end > max_d:\n    max_d = required_end\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to systematically check the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Start and End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position, and the last lantern must cover from its position to \\( l \\). These are straightforward distances.\n- **Midpoint Segments**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the midpoint determines the furthest point from both lanterns. The radius must be at least half the distance between the lanterns to cover this midpoint.\n- **Maximum Radius**: The largest of these values ensures that all parts of the street are covered.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal radius \\( d \\) by focusing on the critical points where coverage might be insufficient, ensuring the entire street is illuminated.",
