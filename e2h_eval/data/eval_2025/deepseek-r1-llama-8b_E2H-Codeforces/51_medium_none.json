Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. That means all the letters from the guest and host should be present in the pile, and no extra letters should be there.\n\nHmm, how to approach this? Well, I think the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Combine the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n2. Count the frequency of each character in this combined string.\n3. Do the same for the pile of letters.\n4. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they match exactly, output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, right. So the first thing I need to do is read the three lines of input: guest, host, and pile. Then process them.\n\nSo, let's think about the structure. In Python, I can read the three lines using input().strip(), but wait, the sample input shows that each line is a separate string, like ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', ...]. So I'll read each line separately.\n\nOnce I have the three strings, I can concatenate guest + host to get all the required letters. Then, compare the counts with the pile.\n\nTo count the letters, I can use a dictionary or a Counter from the collections module. Oh right, using Counter would make this easier. So import Counter from collections.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three lines.\n- Concatenate guest and host to get expected_letters.\n- Create a Counter for expected_letters.\n- Create a Counter for the pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, print YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem says all letters are uppercase, so no issues there.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the order of the letters doesn't matter because we're just counting.\n\nWhat about edge cases? Like when one of the names is empty, but the problem states that all lines are not empty. So no need to handle empty cases.\n\nWait, but what if the guest and host together have a different length than the pile? Because if the sum of their lengths isn't equal to the pile's length, then it's impossible. So maybe as a first check, I can compare the lengths.\n\nYes! So step 0: Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, immediately return NO.\n\nThat's an important optimization because it can quickly rule out cases where the total number of letters doesn't match.\n\nSo the steps become:\n\n1. Read guest, host, pile.\n2. Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n3. Else, create Counters for guest+host and pile.\n4. Compare the two Counters. If equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nThat makes sense. So implementing that.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, no, the third line is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'—but wait, in the sample explanation, the first sample's pile is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' + 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'? Or wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows that the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', so their combined letters would be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'? Or wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows that the pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'—no, wait, perhaps I misread. Wait, the first sample's output is YES because the pile can be permuted to form both names.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the note. The first sample's pile is formed by combining guest and host. So the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ'. So their combined length is len('SANTACLAUS') + len('DEDMOROZ') = let's see:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S?), wait: S A N T A C L A U S? Wait, no, S A N T A C L A U S is 10 letters? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the sum of their lengths is equal to the pile's length. So in code, that's handled by the initial check.\n\nSo in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # proceed to count\n\nElse, combine guest and host into expected = guest + host.\n\nThen, count = Counter(expected)\npile_count = Counter(pile)\n\nif count == pile_count:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nTesting this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS (10 letters)\nHost: DEDMOROZ (8 letters)\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS (length 10 + 8 = 18. What's the pile's length?)\n\nWait, the pile in the first sample is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'—wait, no, that's the third line of the second sample. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the samples. Let's look back.\n\nNo, the first sample's input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, the first sample input in the problem is:\n\nInput:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the actual sample input is probably three lines, each being a string. So the first line is guest, the second host, the third pile.\n\nSo in the first sample, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWait, no, the third line is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'—so len(guest) is 10, host is 8, pile is 10+8=18. But the third line's length is len('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS')—let's count:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 19 letters? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first sample, the pile is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' which is 10+8=18 letters. But that's just a guess.\n\nWell, regardless, the code will correctly calculate the lengths and the counters.\n\nAnother edge case: when the guest and host are empty, but the problem states all lines are non-empty.\n\nAnother case: when the pile has all the required letters but in a different order.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, what about performance? Since the maximum length per line is 100, the total possible letters are 200. Using Counter is efficient enough.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nImport Counter from collections.\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if the sum of guest and host's lengths equals pile's length. If not, print NO.\n\nElse, combine guest and host into expected, create Counter for expected and pile.\n\nCompare the two Counters. If equal, print YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nexpected_length = len(guest) + len(host)\npile_length = len(pile)\n\nif expected_length != pile_length:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    expected = guest + host\n    counter_expected = Counter(expected)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if counter_expected == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting this against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS (10 letters)\nHost: DEDMOROZ (8 letters)\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS (I think it's 18 letters.)\n\nWait, the expected is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' which is 10+8=18 letters. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'—wait, is that 18 letters? Let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 19 letters. So expected_length is 18, pile_length is 19. So code would print NO, but according to the sample, the output is YES.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input given is:\n\nInput:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no. The way the problem is presented, the input is three lines, each containing the guest, host, and pile respectively.\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line the host's name, the third line the pile.\n\nSo, in the first sample input, the three lines are:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', the host is 'DEDMOROZ', so expected is 10+8=18 letters. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'—how long is that?\n\nLet's count the letters:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 19 letters. So expected_length is 18, pile_length is 19. So the code would print 'NO', but according to the sample, the output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, that contradicts. So perhaps I misunderstood the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement's example:\n\nThe first sample's pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', but perhaps the actual pile is the combination of the guest and host's letters. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the length.\n\nWait, perhaps I should manually count the letters in the expected and the pile.\n\nExpected: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nLetters: Let's see:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S D E D M O R O Z → Wait, SANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S), then DEDMOROZ is 8 letters. So 10+8=18.\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's see:\n\nBreaking it down: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 19 letters. So the expected length is 18, pile is 19, so the code would output NO. But the sample expects YES.\n\nWait, that suggests that my understanding of the sample is wrong. Maybe the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS, but perhaps that's actually the same as the expected letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount the letters in the expected and the pile.\n\nExpected: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ.\n\nCounting each letter:\n\nS: 4 (positions 0, 9, 12, 19)\nA: 5 (positions 1, 4, 7, 10, 17)\nN: 3 (positions 2, 3, 6)\nT: 3 (positions 4, 8, 11)\nC: 1 (position 5)\nL: 2 (positions 6, 14)\nU: 2 (positions 7, 13)\nS: already counted above?\nWait, perhaps it's better to write out all letters:\n\nSANTACLAUS is S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S.\n\nDEDMOROZ is D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nSo combined, the expected letters are:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S D E D M O R O Z.\n\nWait, let's list all letters:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nCount each letter:\n\nS: appears 3 times (positions 0, 9, 10? Wait, no: in 'SANTACLAUS' S is at position 0 and 9, and in the combined, after that comes D E D M O R O Z.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all letters in the expected.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nSo letters are:\n\nS: 3 times (positions 0, 9, 10?)\nWait, no: in 'SANTACLAUS' S is at the end, so the letters are S (index 0), A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S (index 9). Then D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nSo S occurs at indices 0, 9: that's two times.\n\nWait, no: SANTACLAUS is S A N T A C L A U S → 10 letters. So S is at 0 and 9: two times.\n\nThen, DEDMOROZ is D E D M O R O Z → D is 3 letters: positions 0,1,2? No, D is the first letter.\n\nSo letters:\n\nD: 3 times (positions 0, 2 in DEDMOROZ → D E D M O R O Z: D is at 0, 2, and then in DEDMOROZ, that's 3 Ds? Or wait, D E D M O R O Z: D appears at the start, then another D at position 2. So D appears twice in DEDMOROZ.\n\nWait, D E D M O R O Z → D is at position 0 and 2: two times.\n\nSo in the expected, D appears 2 times (from DEDMOROZ) plus any from SANTACLAUS? No, SANTACLAUS has no Ds.\n\nSo in the expected, D occurs twice.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just make a frequency count.\n\nUsing Counter for 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' and the pile 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' to see if they are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' which is S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nLet's count the letters in the pile.\n\nLetters:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S.\n\nSo:\n\nS: appears at position 0, 17 → two times.\nA: positions 1, 4, 15 → three times.\nN: position 2 → once.\nT: position 3 → once.\nM: position 5 → once.\nO: positions 6, 8, 9 → three times.\nR: position 7 → once.\nZ: position 10 → once.\nD: positions 11, 12 → two times.\nE: position 13 → once.\nC: position 14 → once.\nL: position 16 → once.\nU: position 17 → wait, no, U is at position 16? Or is that another letter?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the letters in the pile:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n1. S\n2. A\n3. N\n4. T\n5. A\n6. M\n7. O\n8. R\n9. O\n10. Z\n11. D\n12. E\n13. D\n14. C\n15. L\n16. A\n17. U\n18. S\n\nWait, that's 18 letters.\n\nSo counting each:\n\nS: positions 1, 18 → 2 times.\n\nA: positions 2,5,16 → 3 times.\n\nN: position3 → 1.\n\nT: position4 →1.\n\nM: position6 →1.\n\nO: positions7,9 → 2.\n\nR: position8 →1.\n\nZ: position10 →1.\n\nD: positions11,13 →2.\n\nE: position12 →1.\n\nC: position14 →1.\n\nL: position15 →1.\n\nU: position17 →1.\n\nSo the pile's Counter is:\n\nS:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nNow, the expected Counter is:\n\nExpected is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → letters:\n\nS:2 (positions 0,9)\n\nA:4 (positions1,4,7,8?)\n\nWait, SANTACLAUS is S A N T A C L A U S → letters: S appears at 0,9 → 2 times.\n\nA appears at 1,4,7 → three times.\n\nWait, let me count again.\n\nS A N T A C L A U S → letters:\n\nS: 0,9 → 2.\n\nA: 1,4,7 → 3.\n\nN:2 →1.\n\nT:3 →1.\n\nC:5 →1.\n\nL:6 →1.\n\nU:8 →1.\n\nThen, D E D M O R O Z → D:0,2 →2, E:1, M:3, O:4,5, R:5, O:6, Z:7.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all letters in expected:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S, D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nSo:\n\nS: 2.\n\nA: 3 (positions1,4,7).\n\nN:1.\n\nT:1.\n\nC:1.\n\nL:1.\n\nU:1.\n\nD:2 (positions10, 11).\n\nE:1.\n\nM:1.\n\nO:2 (positions13,14).\n\nR:1.\n\nZ:1.\n\nSo expected Counter is:\n\nS:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nComparing with pile's Counter:\n\nPile has:\n\nS:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nWhich matches exactly. So the code would output YES.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → len=8.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → len=10.\n\nPile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → len 20?\n\nWait, expected_length is 8+10=18. Pile_length is len of third line.\n\nWait, the third line is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' → let's see:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → that's 19 letters.\n\nSo expected_length is 18, pile_length is 19 → code would print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\nGuest: BABBONATALE → len?\n\nLet's see: B A B B O N A T A L E → 10 letters.\n\nHost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → len? Let's see: F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → 14 letters.\n\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → len? Let's see.\n\nWait, the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → count the letters.\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → Hmm, let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the lengths.\n\nGuest: len(BABBONATALE) → let's count letters: B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E → wait, that's 11 letters.\n\nHost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S → 15 letters.\n\nSo expected_length is 11+15=26.\n\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → let's count letters.\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the length.\n\n\" BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER \" → let's count the letters.\n\nB, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R → that's 27 letters.\n\nSo expected_length is 26, pile_length is 27 → code outputs NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that all letters from the guest and host should be present in the pile, and there should be no extra letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths:** First, check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, it's immediately impossible to form the names, so we print \"NO\".\n3. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in the combined string of the guest's and host's names.\n4. **Compare Counters:** Compare the counter of the combined string with the counter of the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines of input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the total number of letters matches\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Combine guest and host into expected letters\n    expected = guest + host\n    # Create counters for expected and pile\n    counter_expected = Counter(expected)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    # Compare the two counters\n    if counter_expected == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input consists of three lines which are read using `input().strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding, we check if the sum of the lengths of the guest's and host's names equals the length of the pile. This is a quick check to rule out impossible cases.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string representing all the letters needed.\n- **Counting Letters:** Using the `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** Finally, we compare the two counters. If they are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly, so we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently determines if the pile can be used to reconstruct the names by leveraging character frequency counting, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
