Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find an N x N board arrangement such that the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen. Let's break down what's happening here.\n\nFirst, let me understand the movement of the pieces. The rook moves in straight lines (horizontal or vertical), any number of squares, but must stop on a cell each move. The queen can move any number of squares in any direction—like a rook and a bishop combined.\n\nThe process starts with the piece on the cell with number 1. Each step, among all unvisited cells reachable in one move by the current piece, it moves to the one with the smallest number. If there are no more unvisited cells, the process stops. But if during the step, the piece has to teleport because all possible moves are already visited, it jumps to the smallest-numbered unvisited cell, paying a vun. The goal is for the total vuns paid by the rook to be less than that of the queen.\n\nHmm. So, I need to arrange the numbers on the board such that when the rook follows its movement rules, it incurs fewer teleport fees than the queen.\n\nWait, but how do the teleport steps work? Oh right, the teleport occurs only when all reachable cells are already visited. So the piece can't make a normal move, so it has to jump to the smallest available cell, which costs a vun.\n\nSo, I need to model both the rook's path and the queen's path, calculate the number of teleport steps for each, and ensure that the rook's count is less than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about small N first. For N=1, the board is just [1]. Both rook and queen can't move, so no vuns. So the output is just 1, but wait, the output should have N=1, so it's just '-1' because maybe the problem says N=1 is invalid? Or perhaps the sample input shows something else. Wait, looking back at the example input given, it's probably a typo. The first sample input is ['1', '4'], which might not be correct, but the output is '-1'. Wait, no—the first sample's input is probably N=1, as the output is '-1'.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that for N=1, both rook and queen cannot pay any vuns. So in that case, their counts are equal (zero). So we need to output a board, but the problem says \"strictly less\". So for N=1, it's impossible. Hence, output -1.\n\nSo for N=2, maybe it's possible?\n\nBut let's think about how to approach this. We need to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path has fewer teleport steps than the queen's.\n\nWait, perhaps arranging the numbers in a certain way, like a specific order that forces the rook and queen to take different paths.\n\nI remember that in some grid problems, certain patterns like a spiral or diagonal arrangement can influence the movement paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe placing the numbers in a way that the rook's path is as efficient as possible, minimizing the times it has to teleport. Similarly for the queen, but since the queen can move more flexibly, it's likely to have more options.\n\nWait, but the movement is determined by the numbers. So the rook always picks the smallest possible next cell, same for the queen.\n\nWait, the starting point is 1. Then, for each step, the piece moves to the smallest possible unvisited cell reachable in one move.\n\nSo, for the rook, each step is a move along the same row or column. So from 1, it looks at all reachable cells in the same row and column, and picks the smallest.\n\nFor the queen, it can move in any direction, including diagonally, so it has more options.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the key is to arrange the board so that the rook's path has as few teleport steps as possible, while the queen's path has more.\n\nBut how can I model this?\n\nLet me think about how the movement proceeds.\n\nFor the rook:\n\nEach step, from the current cell, it looks in four directions (left, right, up, down) for the smallest numbered cell that hasn't been visited yet.\n\nIf none found, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying a fee.\n\nSimilarly for the queen: it can look in eight directions, so it has more options.\n\nSo, the idea is that the rook may end up having to teleport more often than the queen, but in our case, we need the opposite: the rook's teleport count is less than the queen's.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the board should be arranged in such a way that the rook can reach new cells without needing to teleport, while the queen often has to teleport.\n\nWait, but how? Because the queen has more movement options, it's less likely to get stuck and need to teleport.\n\nWait, perhaps the opposite: arrange the board so that the queen has to make more teleport steps than the rook.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nMaybe arranging the board in a way that the queen's movement is restricted in some way, forcing it to have to teleport more.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the movement for both pieces and see how their paths compare.\n\nBut for N=500, this would be computationally intensive. So we need a pattern or structure that can be efficiently constructed.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution lies in creating a grid where the rook's path can reach all cells without teleporting, except for one step, while the queen has to teleport more times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rook can traverse the grid in a way that covers all cells with minimal teleport steps, while the queen's path is forced into more teleport steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to construct the grid in such a way that the rook's path is as efficient as possible, while the queen's path is forced into a situation where it must teleport multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps arranging the grid in a specific order, like a snake-like pattern for the rook, but something else for the queen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid such that the rook can move in a way that it doesn't get blocked, thus avoiding teleport, while the queen does get blocked more often.\n\nAnother thought: the teleport step is triggered when the piece can't make a normal move. So for the rook, it's when all cells in the same row or column as the current position are already visited. For the queen, it's when all cells in any of the eight directions are already visited.\n\nSo, for the rook to not have to teleport, it's sufficient that in each step, there's at least one cell in the same row or column that's unvisited. Similarly, for the queen, in each step, there's at least one cell in one of the eight directions that's unvisited.\n\nThus, the rook's path will have a teleport only if all possible row and column cells are visited. The queen's teleport occurs only when all possible cells in any of the eight directions are visited.\n\nTherefore, the rook's teleport count is lower than the queen's if the rook's path blocks itself less frequently than the queen's.\n\nBut how to arrange the grid so that the rook's path doesn't block itself as much, but the queen does?\n\nPerhaps arranging the grid in a way that the rook can always find a new cell in its row or column, while the queen often runs into a dead end.\n\nWait, but how? Because the queen has more options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is a single continuous line, while the queen's path requires taking detours, leading to more teleport steps.\n\nWait, but the movement is determined by the numbers. So the path is determined by the sequence of numbers chosen in each step.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe looking for a pattern or mathematical approach.\n\nWait, another angle: the minimal number of teleport steps for the rook and queen depends on how quickly they can cover the grid.\n\nSince the rook can only move in straight lines, perhaps the rook's path can be arranged to cover the grid in a way that minimizes the need for teleport, while the queen's path, due to the number arrangement, is forced to make more teleports.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arranging the grid so that the rook can traverse all cells without needing to teleport, but the queen has to teleport once.\n\nWait, but what's the minimal scenario?\n\nIn the example given, N=4, the rook pays 1 vun, and the queen pays 2.\n\nSo, in that case, the solution is possible.\n\nSo, perhaps for even N, it's possible, but for odd N, not? Or maybe for some other pattern.\n\nBut the problem statement says that N can be up to 500, so we need a general solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in such a way that the rook can reach all cells without teleporting, except for the last step, but the queen has to teleport more times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid can be structured so that the rook's path is along rows or columns, and the queen's path is forced to take longer paths, leading to more teleport steps.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative idea: construct a grid where the rook's path is a simple row-wise traversal, covering all cells without needing to teleport, except perhaps the last step. Meanwhile, the queen's path is forced to take a longer route, causing it to have to teleport once.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path (covers all cells) without requiring teleportation, while the queen's path is forced into situations where it has to teleport more.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to arrange the grid so that the rook can always find a new cell in its row or column before the grid is filled, thus never requiring a teleport. While the queen, due to the arrangement, may have to teleport.\n\nBut then, the rook's teleport count would be zero, which is definitely less than the queen's.\n\nBut is this possible? Because the rook can only move along rows and columns. So, for the rook to not have to teleport, every time it's on a cell, there must be at least one cell in the same row or column that hasn't been visited yet.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the grid so that this is true until the very end, when the last cell is the only one left, and the rook can't move, so it has to teleport.\n\nWait, but in that case, the rook would have to teleport once, which is the same as the queen's count if she also needs to teleport once.\n\nSo that wouldn't satisfy the condition.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rook's path can be arranged to never require teleportation, while the queen's path requires it exactly once.\n\nSo the rook's count is zero, queen's is one—satisfying the condition.\n\nBut is this possible?\n\nLet's think for N=2.\n\nArrange the grid as:\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\nThen, for the rook:\n\nStart at 1. From 1, look for the smallest in the same row or column. The same row has 2, same column has 3. So choose 2.\n\nNext, from 2, same row has 4, same column is nothing. So choose 4.\n\nNow, all cells are visited. So the rook's path is 1->2->4. No teleports.\n\nFor the queen:\n\nStart at 1. She can choose between 2 (same row), 3 (same column), or 4 (diagonal). The smallest is 2.\n\nFrom 2, she can go to 3 (same column) or 4 (row or diagonal). Smallest is 3.\n\nFrom 3, she can go to 4 (same column) or 2 (already visited), so chooses 4.\n\nSo queen's path is 1->2->3->4. No teleports.\n\nSo both have zero teleports. Not good.\n\nWe need the rook's count < queen's.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if we arrange the grid differently?\n\nLike:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nRook's path:\n\nStart at 1. Same row has 3, same column has 4. Choose 3.\n\nFrom 3, same row has 2 (but 4 is in column 2?), wait no, N=2, 3 is in (1,2), same row is 2 (cell 2,2). So from 3, the rook can move to 2.\n\nSo rook's path is 1->3->2.\n\nNo teleport.\n\nQueen's path:\n\nStart at 1. She can go to 3, 4, or 2 (diagonally). The smallest is 2.\n\nFrom 2, she can go to 4 (same column) or 3 (row). So 3 is smaller.\n\nSo queen's path is 1->2->3.\n\nBut then, from 3, the queen can go to 4 (same column), which is the last cell.\n\nSo queen's path is 1->2->3->4. Teleport count is zero.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe for N=3, I can create a grid where the rook's path is such that it doesn't need to teleport, but the queen does once.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in such a way that the rook's path is a single row, and the queen's path is forced into a situation where it has to teleport.\n\nWait, but the queen's movement is more flexible, so it's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a single row, but the queen's path requires going back and forth, thus hitting a situation where it can't find any new cells in its current direction and has to teleport.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook can traverse all cells in a single row, thus requiring no teleport steps, while the queen's path is forced into a situation where it has to teleport once.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: think about the minimal number of teleport steps for the rook and the queen.\n\nThe minimal possible teleport steps for the rook is zero if the rook can visit all cells without getting stuck. Similarly, the minimal for the queen is zero.\n\nBut perhaps for some arrangements, the rook's teleport is zero, the queen's is one.\n\nSo the rook's count is zero < queen's count of one.\n\nSo, how can I arrange the grid so that the queen's path requires a teleport once, but the rook's does not.\n\nLet me try for N=3.\n\nArrange the grid as:\n\n1 2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n7 8 9\n\nWait, the rook's path:\n\nStart at 1. It can move right to 2, then right to 3, then down to 4, etc. But wait, the rook's movement is determined by the smallest next cell.\n\nWait, no. The rook's movement is based on the order of the numbers.\n\nWait, in the grid above, the numbers are in row-major order. So the rook's path would be 1->2->3->6->9->8->7->4->5.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, from 1, the rook can move right to 2, then right to 3.\n\nFrom 3, same row has no more cells. So it can move down to 6, then down to 9.\n\nFrom 9, same row is done, so down is not possible. Move left to 8, then left to 7.\n\nFrom 7, same row is done, so down to 4.\n\nFrom 4, same row is done, so down to 5.\n\nSo the rook's path is 1→2→3→6→9→8→7→4→5. That's 9 steps, but how many teleports?\n\nOnly when there's no more cells in the row or column.\n\nIn this case, when the rook is at 5, all cells are visited, so it stops. So no teleport.\n\nFor the queen:\n\nShe starts at 1. She can choose the smallest next cell in any direction.\n\nFrom 1, the possible cells are 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.\n\nWait, 1 is at (0,0). The cells in row 0 are 1,2,3; column 0 are 1,4,7.\n\nSo the smallest unvisited is 2 (row 0, column 1), then 3 (row 0, column 2), then 4 (row 1, column 0), then 5 (row 1, column 1), then 6 (row 1, column 2), then 7 (row 2, column 0), then 8 (row 2, column 1), then 9 (row 2, column 2).\n\nSo the queen's path would be 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9. So no teleport steps. Thus, both have zero.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a single row, but the queen's path is forced to take a different route, causing it to have to teleport once.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid such that the rook can move in a way that covers all cells without needing to teleport, but the queen's path is forced into a situation where it can't find any new cells in any direction, causing it to teleport.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps arranging the grid in a way that the queen's path is forced to take a certain route, leading to a dead end.\n\nWait, for example, in N=2, arrange the grid as:\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\nRook's path:\n\nStart at 1. In row, 4 is next. So 1→4.\n\nFrom 4, column has 2. So 4→2.\n\nFrom 2, row has 3. So 2→3.\n\nSo no teleport steps.\n\nQueen's path:\n\nStart at 1. She can go to 2, 4, or 3.\n\nSmallest is 2.\n\nFrom 2, she can go to 3 (same row) or 1 (already visited), or 4 (diagonal, which is 4, but she came from 1 to 2, then to 4 is via diagonal.\n\nWait, from 2, the queen can move to 3, which is 3. So 2→3.\n\nFrom 3, she can go to 4 (same row) or 2 (visited), or 1 (diagonally, which is 1, already visited). So next is 4.\n\nSo queen's path is 1→2→3→4. No teleport steps. So both have zero.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the conditions under which the rook has to teleport.\n\nFor the rook, it will have to teleport if, from the current cell, all cells in the same row and column are already visited.\n\nSimilarly, for the queen, it will have to teleport if, from the current cell, all cells in any of the eight directions are already visited.\n\nSo, to have the rook's teleport count less than the queen's, we need that for each teleport step of the rook, there exists a way to avoid it, but the queen's path is such that it hits a situation where it has to teleport more times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the grid so that the rook's path is such that it doesn't get stuck (so no teleport steps), but the queen's path does get stuck.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid such that the queen's path is forced to make a step where all possible directions are blocked, but the rook's path is able to proceed without being blocked.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the queen's path is forced into a loop, leading to multiple teleport steps, while the rook's path is straightforward.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern or mathematical way to construct such a grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a simple row-wise traversal, while the queen's path is forced to go through a detour, leading to a teleport.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid so that the rook's path is a single row, and the queen's path is forced to go into a column that's already filled.\n\nWait, but for larger N, it's unclear.\n\nAnother thought: Since the rook's movement is limited to rows and columns, perhaps arranging the grid such that the rook can always find a new cell in its row or column, thus never needing to teleport. While the queen's path is forced into a situation where she has to teleport once.\n\nBut how to arrange this.\n\nWait, perhaps for N=3, arrange the grid as:\n\n1 2 3\n\n6 5 4\n\n7 8 9\n\nSo, the rook's path:\n\nStart at 1. It can move right to 2, then right to 3.\n\nFrom 3, same row is done. Move down to 6.\n\nFrom 6, same row is done. Move down to 9.\n\nFrom 9, same row is done. Move up to 8, then up to 7.\n\nFrom 7, same row is done. Move up to 4.\n\nFrom 4, same row is done. Move left to 5.\n\nWait, but 5 is in the middle. Hmm, but the rook's movement is along straight lines, so from 4, moving left would be along the same row, which is row 1 (assuming 0-based). So from 4, the rook can go left to 5, then left to 6, but 6 is already visited.\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the exact path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rook's path would be 1→2→3→6→9→8→7→4→5.\n\nNo teleport steps.\n\nFor the queen's path:\n\nStart at 1. She can choose 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe smallest is 2.\n\nFrom 2, she can go to 3 (right), 5 (diagonal), or 1 (left). So 3 is the next.\n\nFrom 3, she can go to 4 (down-right), 6 (down), or 2 (already visited). So 4 is next.\n\nFrom 4, she can go to 5 (right), 7 (down-right), or 3 (left). So 5 is next.\n\nFrom 5, she can go to 6 (up), 8 (down-right), or 4 (left). So 6 is next.\n\nFrom 6, she can go to 9 (down), 7 (left-down), or 5 (already visited). So 7 is next.\n\nFrom 7, she can go to 8 (right), 9 (down), or 5 (already visited). So 8 is next.\n\nFrom 8, she can go to 9 (right) or 7 (left). 9 is next.\n\nSo queen's path is 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to arrange an N x N chessboard such that the rook pays strictly fewer vuns (teleport fees) than the queen during their respective traversal of the board.
