For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. The input is three notes, and I need to check if they form a major or minor triad when arranged in the correct order. If they don't fit either, it's 'strange'. \n\nThe notes are cyclic, so after H comes C again. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher one in the circle.\n\nFor a major triad, the three notes X, Y, Z must be arranged such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. That totals 7 semitones. For a minor triad, it's the opposite: X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n2. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n3. Check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n4. If exactly one condition is met, classify accordingly. Otherwise, it's strange.\n\nWait, but how do I represent the notes numerically? Maybe assign each note a number, like C=0, C#=1, D=2, etc., up to H=11. Then the distance can be calculated using modulo operations.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So first, create a mapping from note names to their numerical values. Let's list them:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nEach note has an index in this list. So for example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, ..., 'H' is 11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the distance is measured from the lower note to the higher. So when calculating the distance between two notes, we take (y - x) mod 12, but since the scale is circular, that should give the correct number of semitones.\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is always forward. For example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones because you go E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B-C. Wait, let's count: E (4), F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), A#(10), B(11), C(0). Wait, wait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, each note is a semitone apart. So from C to C# is 1 semitone. From C to D is 2 semitones, etc. But since the order is cyclic, the distance from C to H is 8 semitones (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H—so from C to H is 11 semitones, but wait, no. Let me count:\n\nWait, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, that's 12 notes. So from C to H is 11 semitones? Or is it 8?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me list all the notes with their indices:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nWait, so H is at index 11. So the next note after H is C again, which is index 0.\n\nSo the distance between C (0) and H (11) is (11 - 0) mod 12 = 11 semitones. Because you move forward 11 steps to get from C to H.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from H (11) to C (0) is (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1 semitone. Because moving backward 11 steps is the same as forward 1 step.\n\nSo, in code, the distance between two notes x and y is (y - x) % 12.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Convert each input note into its numerical value (x, y, z).\n- Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n- For each permutation, compute the distances between the first and second, and second and third.\n- Check if the permutation forms a major or minor triad.\n\nBut wait, the triad is an unordered set. So the same set could be permuted in different ways, and only one of those permutations may satisfy the major or minor condition.\n\nSo for each permutation of (x, y, z), compute d1 = (y - x) mod 12, d2 = (z - y) mod 12. Then, if d1 + d2 == 7, it's a major triad if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3. Or if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, then it's minor.\n\nWait, no. Because the arrangement in the permutation determines the order. So for a major triad, the permutation must have the first two notes separated by 4 semitones, and the next two by 3. So in a permutation (X, Y, Z), if Y is X+4 mod 12, and Z is Y+3 mod 12, then it's a major triad.\n\nSimilarly, for minor, Y is X+3, Z is Y+4.\n\nSo for each permutation, check whether the distances match either major or minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then the chord is major. Similarly for minor. But the problem says that there are no cases where a chord is both major and minor, so we can safely check for the presence of major or minor conditions without worrying about overlapping.\n\nWait, but what if multiple permutations satisfy major? Like, perhaps the same set can be arranged in a way that meets major condition in more than one permutation. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so perhaps such cases don't exist.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps:\n\n1. Read the three notes as a list.\n2. Convert each note to its numerical value using the mapping.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n4. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n   a. Compute d1 = (b - a) mod 12\n   b. Compute d2 = (c - b) mod 12\n   c. Check if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3: if yes, it's a major triad.\n   d. Else, check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4: minor triad.\n5. If any permutation satisfies major, the chord is major.\n6. Else if any permutation satisfies minor, the chord is minor.\n7. Else, it's strange.\n\nWait, but maybe the same set can be arranged in a way that satisfies both major and minor? But the problem says it won't happen, so we can ignore that.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all permutations and check each one.\n\nIn Python, the itertools.permutations function can be used to generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, the helper function to map note names to numbers.\n\nI'll create a list where the index corresponds to the note's position.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo, for a note like 'C', it's 0; 'C#' is 1, etc.\n\nSo, I'll create a dictionary for quick lookup.\n\nnote_to_num = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nNow, for each note in the input, convert it to its numerical value.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as strings like 'C E G', so I'll split them into a list of three elements.\n\nOnce I have the numerical values, I can process permutations.\n\nSo, for example, the input 'C E G' becomes [0, 4, 7].\n\nThen, for each permutation, calculate the distances.\n\nLet's see: for permutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 = (4-0) mod 12 =4\n\nd2=(7-4) mod12=3\n\nSo d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nAnother permutation, say (E, G, C): d1=(7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)= (mod 12 → 5? Wait, no, 0-7 is -7 mod12 is 5? Or wait, (0-7) mod12 is 5, but in reality, the distance from G to C is 5 semitones? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's think: G is 7, C is 0. So (0-7) mod12 is 5, but that's the distance from C to G, which is 5 semitones. But the distance from G to C is 5 semitones as well, because moving forward 5 steps from G (7) would get to C (0). Or moving backward 7 steps is the same as moving forward 5 steps.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is from the lower note to the upper note. So, when considering the permutation (E, G, C), E is 4, G is7, C is0.\n\nSo d1 is (7-4)=3.\n\nd2 is (0-7) mod12 → (0-7) is -7, mod12 is 5.\n\nSo 3 and 5: doesn't fit either major or minor.\n\nThus, the only permutation that fits is (C,E,G), which is a major.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' → ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nConvert to numbers:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is5.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nOne permutation is (B, C#, F):\n\nB is10, C# is1: d1 is (1-10) mod12 → (1-10) is -9 mod12 is 3.\n\nd2 is (5-1)=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nAnother permutation: (C#, B, F) → 1,10,5.\n\nd1=10-1=9 mod12 is 9 → not 3 or4.\n\nSo the minor condition is satisfied in one permutation.\n\nThus, output is minor.\n\nThird example: 'A B H' → [9, 10, 11].\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nPermutation (A, B, H): 9,10,11.\n\nd1=1, d2=1 → no.\n\nPermutation (A, H, B): 9,11,10.\n\nd1=2, d2= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nOther permutations: (B,A,H): 10,9,11. d1= (9-10)= -1 mod12=11. No.\n\n(B, H, A):10,11,9. d1=1, d2= (9-11)= -2 mod12=10. No.\n\n(H, A, B):11,9,10. d1= (9-11)=-2 mod12=10. No.\n\n(H, B, A):11,10,9. d1= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11. No.\n\n(A, H, B): already checked.\n\nNo permutation satisfies either major or minor, so output is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read the input line as a list of three strings.\n\n2. Create the note_to_num mapping.\n\n3. Convert each note to its numerical value.\n\n4. Generate all possible permutations of the three numbers.\n\n5. For each permutation, calculate d1 and d2.\n\n6. Check for major and minor conditions.\n\n7. Determine the result based on whether any permutation meets the condition.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All three notes are the same. But according to the problem, it's a triad, which requires exactly three distinct notes? Wait, no, the problem says \"exactly three notes\", but they can be the same? Or perhaps the notes are considered distinct. Wait, the problem says \"unordered set of no less than three notes\". So, the set can have duplicates? Or is it a set, which implies unique elements?\n\nWait, the problem says \"chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes.\" Hmm, but the term 'set' usually implies uniqueness. So probably, the three notes are distinct. So in our code, perhaps we don't need to handle duplicates, but the problem's constraints may not include such cases.\n\nBut in our code, perhaps we can proceed regardless.\n\nBut for the problem, the inputs will have three distinct notes, as per the examples.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the input as a list, e.g., ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nConvert each to their numerical values.\n\nThen, for each permutation, compute d1 and d2.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_num = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnums = [note_to_num[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but the code breaks after finding the first occurrence. But since the problem states that the answer is unambiguous, it's safe to break early.\n\nBut what if some permutations meet major and others minor? According to the problem statement, this can't happen.\n\nBut in code, the way it's written, it will find the first major, mark is_major as True, and then continue checking other permutations, but once is_major is True, it won't change. So, for example, if a permutation satisfies major, it sets is_major to True, and breaks, thus avoiding further checks.\n\nWait, no. In the code above, the loop is:\n\nfor perm in ...:\n    check d1 and d2\n    if major: set is_major=True, break\n    else if minor: set is_minor=True, break\n\nSo, in the case where a permutation is major, is_major is set to True, and the loop breaks. So the code doesn't check other permutations, but since the problem says the answer is unique, it's okay.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, suppose a permutation is major, another is minor. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nProcessing each input:\n\nFirst input: C E G → nums [0,4,7]\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nOne permutation is (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo is_major is True, loop breaks. Output is 'major'.\n\nSecond input: C# B F → [1,10,5]\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nOne permutation is (10,1,5): d1= (1-10)= -9 mod12=3, d2=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4 → minor. So is_minor is True, loop breaks. Output is 'minor'.\n\nThird input: A B H → [9,10,11]\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nNone satisfy either condition. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: E G C → [4,7,0]. Permutation (4,7,0): d1=3, d2= (0-7)=5 → no. But permutation (4,0,7): d1= (0-4) mod12=8, d2=7 → no. Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, E is 4, G is7, C is0.\n\nWait, wait, let me try all permutations.\n\nPermutation (E, G, C): 4,7,0 → d1=3, d2= (0-7)=5. Not matching.\n\nPermutation (E, C, G): 4,0,7 → d1= (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\nPermutation (G, E, C): 7,4,0 → d1= (4-7) mod12= 5 → no.\n\nWait, but what about the correct order for major? Like C, E, G: 0,4,7.\n\nWhich is a permutation. So in that case, the code will find d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nThus, the code correctly identifies it.\n\nAnother test case: C# D# F → notes 1,3,5.\n\nCheck permutation: 1,3,5 → d1=2, d2=2 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: 3,5,1 → d1=2, d2= (1-5)= -4 mod12=8 → no.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct arrangement is 3,5,1: no. Or another permutation: 5,1,3 → d1= (1-5)= -4 mod12=8 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps this chord is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code will return 'strange' for this input.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The problem is based on the cyclic nature of musical notes and their distances in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Musical Notes and Distances**: \n   - There are 12 notes in total, each separated by a semitone. The notes are cyclic, meaning after 'H' comes 'C' again.\n   - A major triad is formed when the distance between the first and second note is 4 semitones, and between the second and third note is 3 semitones.\n   - A minor triad is formed when the distance between the first and second note is 3 semitones, and between the second and third note is 4 semitones.\n\n2. **Mapping Notes to Numerical Values**: \n   - Each note is assigned a numerical value from 0 to 11. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, and so on up to 'H' which is 11.\n\n3. **Generating Permutations**: \n   - Since the order of notes can vary, we generate all permutations of the three given notes to check each possible arrangement.\n\n4. **Checking for Triads**: \n   - For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. If any permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor triad, classify the chord accordingly.\n\n5. **Determine the Result**: \n   - Based on the checks, determine if the chord is major, minor, or neither.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_num = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnums = [note_to_num[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = (b - a) % 12\n    d2 = (c - b) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a string of three notes, which are then split into individual note strings.\n- **Numerical Conversion**: Each note is converted to its corresponding numerical value using a predefined mapping.\n- **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated modulo 12 to handle the cyclic nature of the notes.\n- **Classification**: The code checks if any permutation fits the criteria for a major or minor triad and prints the result accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible arrangements of the notes are checked efficiently, providing the correct classification based on the given criteria.",
