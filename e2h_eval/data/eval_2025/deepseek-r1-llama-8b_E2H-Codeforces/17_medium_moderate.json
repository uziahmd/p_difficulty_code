He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a certain string s of length n. The input gives all possible improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths from 1 to n-1), and I need to output a string where each character is 'P' or 'S', indicating whether the corresponding input string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, the challenge is that I don't know which is which, but I have to assign P or S such that exactly half of them are P and the other half S, and the assignments must be consistent with some possible string s.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that the given strings are indeed prefixes and suffixes of some existing string s. So my job is to find an assignment where each string is either a prefix or suffix of s, and then output the corresponding P/S for each input string.\n\nSo the approach is: find a string s that has all the given strings as either its proper prefixes or suffixes. Then, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix (mark 'P') or a suffix (mark 'S').\n\nBut how do I construct s? Since there could be multiple possibilities, but I just need one that works.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can reconstruct s by considering all possible candidates that fit the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this using a trie or some structure that builds up s step by step.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\nFor each string in the input, it's either a prefix of s or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, any prefix of s is present as one of the input strings for each length. Similarly, for suffixes, any suffix of s (excluding s itself) is present as input strings.\n\nWait, but each length from 1 to n-1 appears exactly twice: once as a prefix and once as a suffix. Because the input has 2n-2 strings, and for each length l (1<=l<=n-1), there are two strings: one is a prefix of s, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each l, among the two strings of length l, one must be a prefix, the other a suffix.\n\nBut how to determine which is which?\n\nHmm. Maybe for each possible position in the string s, we can build possible options.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the entire set of input strings. For each possible pair of two strings of the same length l, one could be a prefix candidate and the other a suffix candidate. But since for each l, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, perhaps for each l, among the two strings of that length, exactly one will match as a prefix of the full string s, and the other as a suffix.\n\nWait, but how to find s?\n\nAlternative idea: Let's try to build the string s step by step. For each position in s, determine the possible characters that could appear, based on the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal possible s by considering the longest common prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, another thought: The string s must be such that all its prefixes (except s) are present in the input as prefixes, and all its suffixes (except s) are present as suffixes.\n\nWait, no, because the input contains all possible prefixes and suffixes, but each length l from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each l, the two strings of length l are the prefix and the suffix of s. Or wait, no, that's not correct. Because the prefix and suffix could be the same string for different l's. Wait no, for each l, the two strings are of that length. So for example, for l=1, there are two strings of length 1. One of them is the first character of s, and the other is the last character of s.\n\nAh, right! Because for l=1, the prefix is s[0], and the suffix is s[-1]. So for each l, the two strings of that length are the prefix of s of length l and the suffix of s of length l.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=1, the prefix is s[0], the suffix is s[-1]. So in the input, for l=1, we have two strings: one is s[0], the other is s[-1].\n\nSimilarly, for l=2, the two strings are s[0:2] and s[-2:]. Wait, no: for l=2, the prefix is s[0:2], the suffix is s[-2:], which is the last two characters. So in the input, for l=2, there are two strings: one is the first two characters of s, the other is the last two.\n\nSo, the key insight is that for each length l, the two strings of that length in the input must consist of the prefix of s of length l and the suffix of s of length l.\n\nSo, for each l from 1 to n-1, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix.\n\nWait, but how can we determine which one is the prefix and which is the suffix for each l?\n\nBecause, for example, for l=1, the two strings are s[0] and s[-1]. These could be the same or different.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings of that length, one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length. Let's call them A and B.\n\n2. For each l, one of A or B is the prefix of s of length l, the other is the suffix of s of length l.\n\n3. Once we have the prefix for each l, we can build s step by step.\n\n4. Similarly, for the suffix of each l, we can also build s step by step.\n\nWait, but how to combine these to get s.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about building s from the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThe idea is to find s such that for each l, the prefix of s of length l is one of the two strings in the input for that l, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, for l=1, the first character of s is either A or B. Similarly, the last character is the other one.\n\nBut for l>1, the prefix is built upon the previous prefix, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe can represent s as a list of characters, s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1].\n\nFor each l, the prefix of s of length l is s[0..l-1], and the suffix is s[l-1..n-1] (wait, no, suffix of length l is the last l characters, so s[n-l ... n-1]).\n\nWait, for a string s of length n, the suffix of length l is s[-l:] which is s[n-l : n].\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings in the input for that l must be equal to the prefix of s of length l and the suffix of s of length l.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are p_l and s_l, where p_l is s[0..l-1], and s_l is s[n-l .. n-1].\n\nWait, but p_l and s_l could be any permutation of the two strings in the input for that l.\n\nSo, for each l, we have two options: either the first string is p_l and the second is s_l, or the other way around.\n\nBut how to choose between these options for all l?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the possible s's by considering the constraints for each l.\n\nBut for n up to 100, this could be manageable.\n\nSo, the approach is to find s such that for each l, the prefix and suffix of s of length l are exactly the two strings provided for that l.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model s as a string and check for each l if the two conditions hold.\n\nBut since s can be built step by step, perhaps we can find s by considering the possible options at each step.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother approach is to realize that for the entire string s, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1. So, for l < n-1, the prefix of l is a prefix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix of length l, it must be a suffix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, but the suffix of l is s[n-l : n], which is the last l characters. The suffix of l+1 is s[n-(l+1):n], which is the last l+1 characters. So, the suffix of l is the last l characters of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is the last l characters of the suffix of l+1.\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nSo, for the prefixes: prefix_{l} = prefix_{l-1} + next_char.\n\nFor the suffixes: suffix_l = suffix_{l+1}[-l:].\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the possible s by starting from the l=1 case and building up.\n\nLet me think.\n\nFor l=1, the two strings are c1 and c2. So, the first character of s is either c1 or c2, and the last character is the other.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings are a and b. The prefix of s of length 2 must be a or b, and the suffix of length 2 must be a or b as well.\n\nWait, but the prefix of length 2 is s[0:2], and the suffix of length 2 is s[-2:].\n\nSo, for l=2, the two input strings must be s[0:2] and s[-2: ].\n\nBut how does that relate to the l=1 case?\n\nWell, for l=2, the prefix is s[0] followed by s[1], which is either c1 or c2 (from l=1). So, for l=2, the two input strings must include s[0:2] and s[-2:].\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a graph, where each state represents the possible current character, and the transitions are based on the possible next characters.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, we can track the possible candidates for the prefix and suffix.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can try to build the string s by considering that for each l, the prefix of s of length l must be one of the two options, and the suffix of s of length l must be the other.\n\nSo, for l=1, let's say the two options are c1 and c2. So, s starts with c1 or c2, and ends with c2 or c1, respectively.\n\nThen for l=2, the prefix of s must be one of the two strings in that group. Let's say the two options for l=2 are p1 and p2. So, s's first two characters must be either p1 or p2.\n\nBut s's first two characters are s[0] followed by s[1]. From l=1, s[0] is either c1 or c2. So, for each possible starting character, we can see what the next character would be.\n\nWait, but for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of s of length l. So for l=2, the two strings are p1 and p2, which are s[0:2] and s[-2:]. So, one of them is the first two characters, the other is the last two.\n\nBut how to connect this with the l=1 case.\n\nWait, let's take the example given in the note.\n\nIn the third example, n=2. The input consists of two strings of length 1 and two strings of length 2-1=1, but wait no: n=2, so 2n-2 is 2*2-2=2. So the input has two strings of length 1, and two strings of length 1? No, wait, n=2, the lengths are 1 and 1.\n\nWait, the input for n=2 is two strings of length 1. Because 2n-2 = 2, but 2n-2=2 when n=2. So the input has 2 strings of length 1.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the prefixes are of lengths 1 and the suffixes are also of length 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\n['2\\na\\nc']\n\nWhich means for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'c'. So, s must start with either 'a' or 'c', and end with the other.\n\nSo s could be 'ac' or 'ca'.\n\nHence, the output could be 'SP' or 'PS', etc.\n\nSo back to the approach.\n\nLet me think about the steps for building s.\n\nWe can model this as trying all possible combinations for the initial steps and see which one leads to a consistent s.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternative approach: Find s such that for each l, the prefix and suffix of l are in the input for that l.\n\nSo, for each possible l, we can collect the two possible strings, and then find s that satisfies all of them.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible l, the two strings of that length must be the prefix and suffix of s of length l.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are a prefix and suffix of s of that length.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a prefix of the other when considering their positions in s.\n\nWait, for l=2, the prefix is s[0:2], the suffix is s[-2:].\n\nIf s is built as s0 s1 s2, then for l=2, the prefix is s0s1, the suffix is s2.\n\nWait, no, for l=2 and n=3, the suffix is s1s2.\n\nWait, no, for n=3, l=2: the suffix is s[1:3] (since it's the last two characters).\n\nSo, for l=2, the prefix is s[0:2], the suffix is s[1:3].\n\nSo, the two strings for l=2 must be s[0:2] and s[1:3].\n\nThus, the two strings are overlapping in the sense that the suffix starts with the second character of the prefix.\n\nAh! So, for each l, the suffix of length l is the substring starting at position n-l.\n\nSo, for l=2, the suffix is s[n-2], s[n-1].\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the suffix of length l is s[n-l], s[n-l+1], ..., s[n-1].\n\nSo, for l=2 and n=5, the suffix is s[3], s[4].\n\nSo, the suffix of l=2 is s[3:5].\n\nSo, the two strings for l=2 are s[0:2] and s[3:5].\n\nWait, but then how do they relate to each other?\n\nBecause s[0:2] is a prefix, and s[3:5] is a suffix. So, for l=2, the two strings must be the first two characters and the last two characters of s.\n\nBut how do these relate to the l=1 case?\n\nBecause for l=1, the two strings are s[0] and s[-1] (the last character).\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are s[0:2] and s[3:5], and for l=1, the two strings are s[0] and s[4].\n\nWait, that's getting complicated.\n\nMaybe the way to proceed is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings for that l.\n\n- For each l, the two strings are the prefix (s[0..l-1]) and the suffix (s[-l..]).\n\n- So, for each l, the two strings must be compatible in the sense that the suffix of l can be obtained by taking the last l characters of the prefix of l+1.\n\nWait, perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: Try to find a string s such that for each l, the two strings of length l in the input are exactly the prefix and suffix of s of length l.\n\nThus, for each l, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix, and thus, for s, the prefix of l must be the first l characters, and the suffix of l must be the last l characters.\n\nSo, how to construct s?\n\nPerhaps we can start by considering that the prefix of length n-1 must be a string of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1].\n\nThus, the two strings of length n-1 in the input must be s[0..n-2] and s[1..n-1].\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of length n-2 is s[0..n-3], and the suffix is s[2..n-1], and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to build s is to start with the prefix of length n-1, which is one of the two options for that l, and then see if the suffix of length n-1 matches the other option.\n\nWait, for example, for l = n-1:\n\nThe two strings are A and B. So, s[0..n-2] must be either A or B, and s[1..n-1] must be the other.\n\nSo, for each possible choice of the prefix of l=n-1 as A, the suffix is B. Then, s is A + last character, where the last character is the last character of B.\n\nWait, no. Because s[1..n-1] is the suffix of l=n-1. So, the suffix of l=n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is B.\n\nWait, because for l=n-1, the suffix is s[-(n-1): ] which is s[1..n-1] (since n-1 - 1 + 1 = n-1 elements). So yes, the suffix is s[1..n-1].\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are A and B, where A is s[0..n-2], and B is s[1..n-1].\n\nThus, for each possible choice of A and B, we can try to see if B starts with s[1], which is the second character of A.\n\nSo, the second character of A should be the first character of B.\n\nIf that's true, then we can build s as A + last character of B.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of l=n-1 is B, which is s[1..n-1]. So, s[1..n-1] = B.\n\nSo, s is A concatenated with s[-1], but s[-1] is the last character of B.\n\nSo, for example, suppose A is 'abc', B is 'bcd'.\n\nThen, s would be 'ab' + 'cd' -> 'abcd'? No, wait, n=4, l=n-1=3.\n\nWait, for n=4, l=3, the prefix is s[0..2], the suffix is s[1..3].\n\nSo, A is s[0..2], B is s[1..3].\n\nSo, s is A concatenated with s[3], which is the last character of B.\n\nSo, in the example, A is 'abc', B is 'bcd'.\n\nThen s is 'ab' (A[0..1]) + 'cd' (B[1..2]) and then the last character of B is 'd'. So s is 'abcd'.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each possible A and B for l = n-1, we can check if B starts with A[1..]. That is, the second character of A equals the first character of B. If so, then s can be constructed as A + last character of B.\n\nWait, but for l = n-1, the two strings are A and B. So, one is the prefix (A) and the other is the suffix (B). So, for each pair (A,B), we can check if the second character of A is equal to the first character of B. If yes, then s can be constructed as A followed by the last character of B.\n\nOnce s is constructed, we need to verify that for all other l's, the two strings for that l are indeed the prefix and suffix of s.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be as follows:\n\n1. For l = n-1, collect the two strings, A and B.\n\n2. For each possible pair (A, B) where A is the prefix and B is the suffix:\n\n   a. Check if B starts with A[1:] (i.e., the first character of B is the second character of A).\n\n   b. If yes, then construct s_candidate as A + last character of B.\n\n   c. For each l from 1 to n-2, check if the two strings for that l are the prefix and suffix of s_candidate.\n\n3. For each s_candidate that passes all checks, mark the input strings as P or S accordingly.\n\n4. Once a valid s_candidate is found, output the corresponding P/S string.\n\nIf no s_candidate is found, then perhaps there are multiple possibilities, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that at least one exists.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple possible s_candidates? For example, in the third sample, the possible s could be 'ac' or 'ca'.\n\nSo, the approach needs to find all possible s_candidates and then pick one that works for all l.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\n- Read all the input strings, grouping them by their lengths.\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, group the two strings of that length into a list.\n\n- For l = n-1, take the two strings, A and B.\n\n- For each possible assignment (A is prefix, B is suffix) and (B is prefix, A is suffix), check if the condition holds (B starts with A[1:] for the first case, and A starts with B[1:] for the second case).\n\nWait, no. Because for l = n-1, the prefix is s[0..n-2], the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, the suffix starts with s[1], which is the second character of the prefix.\n\nSo, for the case where A is the prefix, B must start with A[1:].\n\nSimilarly, if B is the prefix, then A must start with B[1:].\n\nSo, for each possible order of A and B, we can check if the required condition holds.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, then for each l from 1 to n-2, check whether the two strings of that l are indeed the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut how to check for each l.\n\nFor each l in 1..n-2:\n\n   The two strings are the prefix of s of length l and the suffix of s of length l.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are s[0..l-1] and s[n-l..n-1].\n\nSo, for a given s_candidate, for each l, we can extract the two strings and see if they match.\n\nIf for all l, this holds, then s_candidate is valid.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, we can process all the input strings, checking for each input string whether it is the prefix or suffix of s_candidate, and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for each l, the two strings of that l are assigned to prefix and suffix, but in the input, the order is arbitrary.\n\nSo, for a given s_candidate, for each l, among the two strings of that l, one must be the prefix of s of that l, the other the suffix.\n\nThus, in code, for each l, we can get the two strings and compare to s_candidate's prefix and suffix of that l.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can see whether it's a prefix of s_candidate of its length, or a suffix of s_candidate of its length.\n\nBut wait, each input string has a known length (since they were grouped by their lengths). So for each input string, we can check whether it's a prefix of s_candidate for its length, or a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, the input has two strings, which are supposed to be the prefix and suffix of s_candidate of that l.\n\nSo, for a given s_candidate, for each l, among the two strings of that l, one must be the prefix of s_candidate of that l, the other must be the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of that l must be s_candidate[0:l] and s_candidate[-l:].\n\nSo, in code, for each l, the two strings must be equal to s_candidate's prefix and suffix of that l.\n\nSo, the steps for code:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read 2n-2 lines, and group them by their lengths. For each l, there will be two strings.\n\n3. For l = n-1, collect the two strings, A and B.\n\n4. For each possible order (A is prefix, B is suffix; B is prefix, A is suffix):\n\n   a. Check if B starts with A[1:] (for A as prefix, B as suffix).\n\n      i. If yes, construct s_candidate as A + last_char_of_B.\n\n   b. Else, check if A starts with B[1:] (for B as prefix, A as suffix).\n\n      i. If yes, construct s_candidate as B + last_char_of_A.\n\n5. For each s_candidate generated in step 4:\n\n   a. For each l from 1 to n-2:\n\n      i. Get the two strings for that l: s_list.\n\n      ii. Compute the expected prefix: s_candidate[0:l]\n\n      iii. Compute the expected suffix: s_candidate[-l:]\n\n      iv. Check if {s_list[0], s_list[1]} == {expected_prefix, expected_suffix}.\n\n         - If yes, continue.\n\n         - Else, break and try next s_candidate.\n\n   b. If all l pass, then this s_candidate is valid.\n\n6. Once a valid s_candidate is found, process all input strings:\n\n   a. For each input string, determine its length l.\n\n   b. Check if it's equal to s_candidate[0:l] (prefix) or s_candidate[-l:] (suffix).\n\n   c. Assign 'P' if it's a prefix, 'S' otherwise.\n\n7. Output the resulting string.\n\nBut wait, how to handle cases where multiple s_candidates are possible.\n\nIn code, we can iterate through all possible s_candidates (based on the l=n-1 case), and for each, check if it's valid across all l.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nIf none is found, then perhaps the code is incorrect, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that at least one exists.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, in Python, we can read all the input, group them by their lengths.\n\nWe can create a dictionary, where the keys are the lengths, and the values are lists of strings.\n\nFor example:\n\nn = int(input())\nstrings_by_length = {}\nfor _ in range(2*n-2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in strings_by_length:\n        strings_by_length[l] = []\n    strings_by_length[l].append(s)\n\nBut wait, the input may not have the correct lines, but the problem says that it's guaranteed.\n\nThen, for each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings.\n\nSo, for l in 1 to n-1:\n\n   if l not in strings_by_length: something's wrong.\n\nBut the problem says it's guaranteed, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, for l = n-1:\n\n   a_list = strings_by_length[n-1]\n\n   So, a_list has two strings, A and B.\n\nFor each possible order (A as prefix, B as suffix; B as prefix, A as suffix):\n\n   For the first case:\n\n   Check if B starts with A[1:]. That is, B[0] == A[1].\n\n   If yes, then s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n   For the second case:\n\n   Check if A starts with B[1:]. That is, A[0] == B[1].\n\n   If yes, then s_candidate = B + A[-1]\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncandidates = []\n\nfor a, b in itertools.permutations([a_list[0], a_list[1]]):\n    # a is prefix, b is suffix\n    if len(a) != n-1 or len(b) != n-1:\n        continue  # shouldn't happen\n    if len(a) == 0:\n        continue\n    if a[1:] == b[:len(a)-1]:\n        # Wait, no, for a as prefix, b must start with a[1:]\n        # So, b[0] should be a[1]\n        if b[0] == a[1]:\n            s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n            candidates.append(s_candidate)\n    # else, try the other way\n    if a[0] == b[1]:\n        s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n\nWait, no, for the second case, where a is suffix, b is prefix.\n\nWait, no: the second case is when b is prefix, a is suffix.\n\nWait, in the second case, b is the prefix, a is the suffix.\n\nSo, the suffix starts with the second character of the prefix.\n\nSo, a[0] == b[1].\n\nThus, in code:\n\nif b[0] == a[1]:  # a is prefix, b is suffix\n    s_candidate = a + b[-1]\nelif a[0] == b[1]:  # b is prefix, a is suffix\n    s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n\nWait, but in the elif, what about the rest of the suffix?\n\nBecause when a is the suffix, it's s[1..n-1], which is b + a[-1]?\n\nNo, wait, when b is the prefix (of l=n-1), then s is b followed by the last character of a.\n\nWait, no: s is b (the prefix) plus the last character of a (the suffix).\n\nBut a is the suffix of l=n-1, which is s[1..n-1], so a is of length n-1, which is the same as b.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps, to clarify:\n\nCase 1: A is the prefix (s[0..n-2]), B is the suffix (s[1..n-1]).\n\nSo, s_candidate = A + last_char_of(B).\n\nCase 2: B is the prefix (s[0..n-2]), A is the suffix (s[1..n-1]).\n\nSo, s_candidate = B + last_char_of(A).\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation of (A, B):\n\n   if the first case is possible (B starts with A[1:]), then construct s_candidate as A + last char of B.\n\n   else, if the second case is possible (A starts with B[1:]), then construct s_candidate as B + last char of A.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor a, b in [(a_list[0], a_list[1]), (a_list[1], a_list[0])]:\n    if b[0] == a[1]:\n        s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n    elif a[0] == b[1]:\n        s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n    else:\n        continue  # no candidate from this permutation\n\nSo, in code, we generate two possible candidates for each permutation.\n\nBut wait, for each permutation, we check both possibilities.\n\nSo, for each permutation (A, B), we can have two possible s_candidate.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given permutation (A, B), it's either case 1 (A is prefix, B is suffix) or case 2 (B is prefix, A is suffix), but only one of them can be true.\n\nWait, no. Because for the first permutation (A, B), we check if B starts with A[1:], which would mean A is prefix and B is suffix. If not, then we check if A starts with B[1:], which would mean B is prefix and A is suffix.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we can generate 0 or 1 s_candidate.\n\nThus, in code, for each of the two permutations of (A, B), we can generate a s_candidate, if the condition holds.\n\nOnce all possible s_candidates are generated, for each, we need to verify that for all l from 1 to n-2, the two strings of that l are indeed the prefix and suffix of s_candidate.\n\nSo, in code, for each s_candidate in candidates:\n\n   valid = True\n   for l in range(1, n-1):\n       str_list = strings_by_length[l]\n       expected_prefix = s_candidate[:l]\n       expected_suffix = s_candidate[-l:]\n       if {str_list[0], str_list[1]} != {expected_prefix, expected_suffix}:\n           valid = False\n           break\n   if valid:\n       # found the s_candidate, process it.\n       break\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, process all input strings.\n\nWait, but the input strings may not be grouped correctly.\n\nWait, no. Because in the input, all strings are given in arbitrary order, regardless of their lengths.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can determine its length l, and then find the expected prefix and suffix of s_candidate of that l.\n\nThen, for that string, if it's equal to the prefix, mark 'P'; if equal to the suffix, mark 'S'.\n\nSo, for each input string s_i:\n\n   l = len(s_i)\n\n   expected_prefix = s_candidate[:l]\n\n   expected_suffix = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n   if s_i == expected_prefix:\n       mark 'P'\n   elif s_i == expected_suffix:\n       mark 'S'\n   else:\n       # impossible, but according to problem statement, it's valid.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nBut wait, how to process the input strings in the order they were read.\n\nBecause the output string must correspond to the input in the order they were given.\n\nSo, in code, we need to read all the input strings into a list, and then for each string in that list, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nRead all 2n-2 input strings into a list.\n\nGroup them by their lengths into a dictionary.\n\nFor l = n-1, get the two strings.\n\nGenerate possible s_candidate(s).\n\nFor each s_candidate, check if it's valid for all l.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, process each input string in the original order, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix of s_candidate, and build the output string.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet's write the code outline.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 lines into a list called 'all_strings'.\n\nCreate a dictionary, strings_by_length, where keys are lengths, values are lists of strings.\n\nFor each l in 1 to n-1, ensure that there are exactly two strings.\n\nGet a_list = strings_by_length[n-1], which has two strings.\n\nGenerate possible s_candidate(s):\n\n   for each permutation of (a_list[0], a_list[1]):\n\n       if permutation is (A, B):\n\n           if B[0] == A[1]:\n\n               s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n               add to candidates.\n\n           else if A[0] == B[1]:\n\n               s_candidate = B + A[-1]\n\n               add to candidates.\n\nSo, after this, 'candidates' has zero, one, or two possible s_candidate strings.\n\nFor each s_candidate in candidates:\n\n   check for all l from 1 to n-2:\n\n       get the two strings for that l.\n\n       expected_prefix = s_candidate[:l]\n\n       expected_suffix = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n       if the two strings are not exactly {expected_prefix, expected_suffix}, break.\n\n   if all l are okay, then s_candidate is valid.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, process each string in 'all_strings' in order.\n\nFor each s in 'all_strings':\n\n   l = len(s)\n\n   expected_prefix = s_candidate[:l]\n\n   expected_suffix = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n   if s == expected_prefix: append 'P'\n\n   elif s == expected_suffix: append 'S'\n\n   else: this shouldn't happen.\n\nFinally, output the concatenated string.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\nall_strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\nstrings_by_length = {}\nfor s in all_strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in strings_by_length:\n        strings_by_length[l] = []\n    strings_by_length[l].append(s)\n\n# For l = n-1, get the two strings\na_list = strings_by_length[n-1]\ncandidates = []\n\n# Generate possible s_candidate(s)\nfor a, b in [(a_list[0], a_list[1]), (a_list[1], a_list[0])]:\n    if b[0] == a[1]:\n        s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n    elif a[0] == b[1]:\n        s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n\n# Now, check each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of a hypothetical string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, each of which is either a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. This helps us efficiently access the strings of any specific length later.\n2. **Generate Possible Candidates for `s`**: We focus on the longest possible prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`). For each permutation of these two strings, we check if they can form a valid candidate for `s` by ensuring that one string starts with the second character of the other.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: For each candidate string `s`, we verify if it satisfies the conditions for all shorter lengths (from 1 to `n-2`). Specifically, for each length `l`, the two strings provided must match the prefix and suffix of `s` of that length.\n4. **Determine Prefix/Suffix Marks**: Once a valid `s` is found, we process each input string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s` and construct the result accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nall_strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\nstrings_by_length = {}\nfor s in all_strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in strings_by_length:\n        strings_by_length[l] = []\n    strings_by_length[l].append(s)\n\n# Get the two strings of length n-1\na_list = strings_by_length[n-1]\ncandidates = []\n\n# Generate possible s candidates based on the two possible permutations\nfor a, b in [(a_list[0], a_list[1]), (a_list[1], a_list[0])]:\n    if b[0] == a[1]:\n        s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n    elif a[0] == b[1]:\n        s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n        candidates.append(s_candidate)\n\nvalid_s = None\n\nfor s_candidate in candidates:\n    valid = True\n    for l in range(1, n-1):\n        str_list = strings_by_length[l]\n        expected_prefix = s_candidate[:l]\n        expected_suffix = s_candidate[-l:]\n        # Check if both expected strings are present\n        if set([str_list[0], str_list[1]]) != set([expected_prefix, expected_suffix]):\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if valid:\n        valid_s = s_candidate\n        break\n\nresult = []\nfor s in all_strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    expected_prefix = valid_s[:l]\n    expected_suffix = valid_s[-l:]\n    if s == expected_prefix:\n        result.append('P')\n    else:\n        result.append('S')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input and Grouping**: The input strings are read and grouped by their lengths into a dictionary.\n2. **Generating Candidates**: For the longest strings (length `n-1`), we consider both possible permutations as potential prefixes and suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Validating Candidates**: Each candidate string is checked against all shorter lengths to ensure the input strings match the expected prefixes and suffixes.\n4. **Constructing Result**: Once a valid `s` is found, each input string is checked against `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the results are concatenated into the final output string.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for `s` and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
