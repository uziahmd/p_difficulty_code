    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) that satisfy two conditions: p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. We need to compute this modulo mod, which can be up to 1e9.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to understand what a permutation pair is. A permutation is just an arrangement of all numbers from 1 to n in some order. For each pair (p, q), we check two things:\n\n1. Is p lex smaller than q? Lex order is like dictionary order. So, for example, [1,2] is smaller than [2,1], because at the first position, 1 < 2.\n2. Does the inversion count of p exceed that of q? An inversion is a pair (i,j) where i<j and p_i > p_j. So, more inversions mean the permutation is more 'reversed'.\n\nI need to find the total number of such pairs.\n\nConstraints are n up to 500. So, a brute force approach checking all possible pairs is impossible because there are n! * n! possibilities, which is way too big even for n=500. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider that for each permutation p, I need to find all permutations q such that:\n- q starts with a number larger than p's first element.\nWait, no. Because lex order depends on the first differing element. So, for p to be lex smaller than q, there must be some k where p[k] < q[k], and for all positions before k, p[i] == q[i].\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to iterate through each possible position where p and q differ, and for each possible choice of elements at that position, count the valid pairs.\n\nBut that still seems complicated. Maybe it's better to think combinatorially.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem in terms of inversion counts. Let's denote inv(p) as the number of inversions in p.\n\nWe need inv(p) > inv(q), and p < q lex order.\n\nSo, for each possible p, how many q's are there such that q is lex larger than p, and inv(q) < inv(p)?\n\nHmm, but again, enumerating all p's is impossible for n=500.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute for each possible inversion count and lex order, but that also seems tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this problem by considering the contribution of each possible inversion change between p and q.\n\nAnother thought: since p < q lex-wise, any q that is lex greater than p must start with a certain prefix. For example, if p starts with [1,3,...], then q could start with [1,4,...], or [2,...], etc., as long as the first element where they differ has q's element larger than p's.\n\nSo, perhaps for each position i, we can consider the case where p and q first differ at position i. Then, for that i, p's element is less than q's element. All positions before i must be equal.\n\nWait, that might be a way to break down the problem. So, the lex order condition can be broken into the earliest position where p and q differ, and in that position, q has a larger element.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs is the sum over all possible i (from 0 to n-1) of the number of pairs (p, q) where p and q agree on the first i elements, and at position i+1, p[i] < q[i], and for j > i, p and q can be anything else, provided that inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm, but how do we model the contributions for each i?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible split point i, where the first i elements are the same in p and q, and the (i+1)th element of q is larger than p's, we can compute the number of such pairs.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n1. The first i elements of p and q are the same.\n2. At position i+1, p's element is a, q's is b, with a < b.\n3. For the remaining positions (after i+1), p and q can be any permutations, but inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut wait, the initial i elements being the same implies that p and q are identical up to position i. So, the first i elements are the same, and the (i+1)th element of p is a, and of q is b, with a < b.\n\nWait, no. Because after the first i elements, the (i+1)th is where p and q first differ, and in that position, q is larger than p.\n\nSo, the process would involve considering each possible i, then for each possible a and b where a < b, and ensuring that a and b are part of some permutation.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut for each i, a, and b, we need to calculate the number of pairs (p, q) that meet these conditions.\n\nWait, but a and b are elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, but they must appear in the (i+1)th position of p and q respectively, with a < b.\n\nMoreover, the first i elements of p and q are the same, so for each i, the first i elements are a fixed sequence.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose a and b is the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a < b, multiplied by the number of possible ways to arrange the rest.\n\nWait, but the first i elements are fixed, so the first i elements must form a permutation of some subset of size i. So, for each i, the first i elements are a specific permutation.\n\nWait, no. Because p and q have the same first i elements. So, for i=0, all possible a and b with a < b are considered, but for i>0, the first i elements must be the same in both p and q. So, the first i elements are a fixed permutation.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because for each i, the first i elements are the same for p and q, but they can be any possible permutation of some i elements.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, for a given i, the first i elements can be any possible permutation s, and for each s, the (i+1)th element of p is a, and of q is b, with a < b. Then, for the rest of the permutation, p and q can be any possible permutations.\n\nBut even that seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: think about generating all possible pairs (p, q) and count those that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut n=500 is way too large for that, so this isn't feasible.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex-wise. Then, subtract the number of pairs where p < q lex-wise and inv(p) <= inv(q). Or, alternatively, compute the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWait, but computing the total number of pairs where p < q is easier. It can be found as (n! * (n! -1))/2. Because for each p, the number of q's that are lex larger than p is (total q's - number of q's lex smaller or equal to p). But since all p's are distinct, the total is (n! * (n! -1)) / 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, the problem requires us to count the number of (p, q) pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). So, perhaps it's easier to compute for each possible p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have a lower inversion count.\n\nBut again, for n=500, iterating over all p's is impossible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the problem using dynamic programming.\n\nWe can represent the state as (k, a, b), where k is the current position, a is the number of inversions in p up to this position, and b is the number of inversions in q up to this position. But even this seems infeasible because the state space would be too large.\n\nHmm, but perhaps we can find a way to compute for each position, the possible inversion counts for p and q, given the choices made so far.\n\nWait, another angle: since p and q share the same first i elements, but differ at position i+1, perhaps the inversion counts can be computed incrementally.\n\nLet's think recursively.\n\nSuppose that for the first i positions, p and q are the same. Now, at position i+1, p has value a, and q has value b, with a < b. Then, for the remaining positions, p and q can be any permutations.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to considering each possible split point i, and for each possible a < b, the number of ways to complete p and q such that inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me define f(i, a, b) as the number of pairs (p, q) where:\n\n- The first i elements are the same in p and q.\n- The (i+1)th elements are a and b, with a < b.\n- For the remaining n - (i+1) elements, p and q are completed in such a way that inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nThen, our answer is the sum over all i from 0 to n-1, and for all a < b, of f(i, a, b).\n\nNow, how to compute f(i, a, b).\n\nAfter choosing a and b for position i+1, the rest of the elements are arranged in some way. Let's call the remaining elements S = {1,..,n} \\ {a, b}.\n\nFor each permutation of S, the p and q will have some inversions.\n\nWait, but the inversions in p and q depend on the entire structure.\n\nAlternatively, after choosing a and b, the inversions in p and q are influenced by the choices made in the remaining positions.\n\nLet me denote that for the remaining positions, the number of inversions added to p is x, and to q is y. Then, the total inversions for p is inv(p) = inv_up_to_i + x, and similarly for q, inv(q) = inv_up_to_i + y.\n\nWait, no. Because up to position i, the inversions for p and q are the same, since their first i elements are identical. So, the difference comes from the choices made in the remaining positions.\n\nSo, when we fix the first i+1 elements (with a and b), the inversions for p and q beyond this point are determined by how the remaining elements are arranged.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the remaining elements. After choosing a and b, the remaining elements are S = {1, 2, ..., n} \\ {a, b}.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the remaining elements in p and q is (|S|)! * (|S|)! ), because each can be permuted independently.\n\nBut for each such arrangement, the inversions in p and q can vary.\n\nWait, but for the remaining elements, the inversions in p and q are determined by how the elements are arranged in both permutations.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model this as a product of certain factors.\n\nWait, perhaps for the remaining elements, the number of possible (x, y) pairs where x is the number of inversions in p's suffix, y is the number of inversions in q's suffix, and x > y.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, note that for the remaining elements, p and q are permutations of the same set, but possibly different orders.\n\nWait, no. Because in p and q, the remaining elements after i+1 can be arranged in any way, but p and q are independent.\n\nWait, but for the remaining elements, the permutations for p and q can be arbitrary. So, for the remaining n - i - 1 elements, each can be arranged in any way in p and in any way in q.\n\nBut the inversion counts for the suffixes of p and q are functions of these arrangements.\n\nBut calculating the total number of such pairs where x > y is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible split i, a, b, the number of (p, q) pairs is equal to the number of ways to arrange the suffixes such that the number of inversions in p's suffix is greater than that in q's suffix.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for the remaining positions, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs of permutations (s, t) of S, such that the number of inversions in s is greater than that in t.\n\nIf we can compute this, then for each i, a, b, the contribution is (number of such pairs) multiplied by 1 (since a < b).\n\nBut how to compute the number of pairs (s, t) where s and t are permutations of S, s != t (since p and q are different), and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nWait, but for the suffix, the initial part is fixed as a and b, so s and t can be any permutations of the remaining elements, with s and t being different.\n\nSo, the problem for the suffix is to count the number of ordered pairs (s, t) where s and t are permutations of S, s != t, and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nBut S can be any size m = n - i - 1.\n\nHmm, but for a fixed m, perhaps we can precompute this for all m up to 500.\n\nWait, but for each m, the number of possible s and t is (m!)^2, but we need to count the number of pairs where inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nSo, for each m, the total number of such pairs is equal to the sum over all s and t, where s != t and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nWait, but that's the same as the number of pairs where inv(s) > inv(t) minus the cases where s = t, but since s and t are permutations of the same set, s = t only if s is the identity permutation, which is one case.\n\nWait, but in our problem, s and t can be any permutations, including the same one. But in our case, since p and q must be different permutations, s and t must be different.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs (s, t) where s and t are permutations of S, s != t, and inv(s) > inv(t) is equal to:\n\nTotal_pairs = T(m) = (m! )^2 - C(m) - D,\n\nwhere C(m) is the number of pairs where s = t, which is zero except when s is the identity permutation and t is the same permutation. Wait, no, because s and t are any permutations, and for s != t, we exclude all cases where s and t are the same permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: for all s and t (including s=t), the number of pairs where inv(s) > inv(t) is equal to the sum over s and t of (inv(s) > inv(t)).\n\nIn this case, the total is (sum_{s} sum_{t} [inv(s) > inv(t)]).\n\nThis can be computed as:\n\nSum = sum_{s} sum_{t} [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nBut note that when s = t, [inv(s) > inv(t)] is zero unless inv(s) is strictly greater than itself, which never happens.\n\nSo, Sum = sum_{s != t} [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nWhich is equal to the total number of pairs where s and t are different and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, for each s, the number of t's where inv(t) < inv(s) is equal to the number of t's with inv(t) < inv(s), including s itself, and then subtract 1 if t = s (because when t = s, it's not allowed in our problem). But since s and t are permutations of the same set, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nWait, perhaps for each permutation s, the number of t's (including s) where inv(t) < inv(s) is equal to the number of t's with inv(t) < inv(s).\n\nThen, the total Sum is sum_{s} (count_t [inv(t) < inv(s)] ) - m! , because for each s, we include t=s in the count, which we need to exclude.\n\nSo, Sum = (sum_{s} count_t [inv(t) < inv(s)]) ) - m!.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, note that the total number of ordered pairs (s, t) where s != t and inv(s) > inv(t) is equal to:\n\n(Total_pairs_with_inv_order) = [ (sum_{s} count_t [inv(t) < inv(s)]) ] - m! \n\nBecause for each s, the count_t includes t=s, which contributes 1 if inv(s) > inv(s), which is false, so it doesn't add anything. Wait, no, because in the count_t [inv(t) < inv(s)], when t = s, it's 1 only if inv(s) < inv(s), which is false, so t = s is not included.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nEach pair (s, t) is either s != t or s = t.\n\nThe total number of pairs where s != t and inv(s) > inv(t) is equal to:\n\nSum = (number of pairs where inv(s) > inv(t) and s != t) \n\n= [number of pairs where inv(s) > inv(t)] - [number of pairs where s = t and inv(s) > inv(t)]\n\nBut for s = t, inv(s) > inv(t) is always false, so this term is zero.\n\nThus, Sum = [number of pairs (s, t) where inv(s) > inv(t)] - [number of pairs where s = t and inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nBut the second term is zero, so Sum equals the first term.\n\nWait, but the first term includes all s and t, including s = t. So, the total is:\n\nSum = [sum_{s,t} [inv(s) > inv(t)]] \n\n= (sum_{s} sum_{t} [inv(s) > inv(t)] )\n\nSo, Sum is the sum for all s and t, including s = t, but in our problem, s and t must be different.\n\nWait, no. Our problem requires s and t to be different, because p and q are distinct permutations. So, Sum is the number of (s, t) pairs where s != t and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nThus, Sum = (sum_{s} sum_{t} [inv(s) > inv(t)]) - [number of s where inv(s) > inv(s)].\n\nBut the latter term is zero for all s, because inv(s) is not greater than itself.\n\nSo, Sum = sum_{s} sum_{t} [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nBut this sum includes all possible s and t, including s = t.\n\nWait, but in our problem, for the suffix, s and t can be any permutations, including the same one. However, in our overall problem, when s and t are the same, the p and q would have the same suffix, but the entire p and q may differ in the earlier parts.\n\nWait, no. Because in the suffix, s and t are the same, meaning that for the remaining positions, p and q have the same elements in the same order. So, the entire p and q are identical, which would imply p = q. But in the problem statement, p must be lex smaller than q, so p cannot equal q. Therefore, in the suffix, s and t must be different, but perhaps that's not necessarily true, because the earlier parts may differ, making p and q different even if the suffix is the same.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix is after the first i+1 elements. If the suffix is the same, then the entire p and q are the same, because the first i+1 elements are same, and the suffix is same. So, p would equal q. But since p < q is required, such pairs are invalid and must be excluded.\n\nThus, in the suffix, s and t must be different, because if s = t, then p and q are the same, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, for the suffix, the count is the number of (s, t) pairs where s != t and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nSo, for each i, a, b, the contribution is the number of such (s, t) pairs multiplied by 1 (since a < b).\n\nThus, the key is to compute for each m = n - i -1, the number of (s, t) pairs where s and t are permutations of m elements, s != t, and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each m, compute T(m) = number of such pairs.\n\nOnce we have T(m), then for each i, a, b with a < b, the contribution is T(m) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the first i elements.\n\nWait, no. Because the first i elements are same in p and q, but how many ways are there to choose the first i elements.\n\nWait, for each i, the first i elements are a fixed permutation. So, for each i, the number of possible s (the first i elements) is i!.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, the first i elements can be any permutation of any i elements from 1 to n. But no, because p and q are permutations of 1..n, so the first i elements must be a subset of size i, but for each i, the first i elements can be any possible permutation of size i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the number of possible first i elements is i! times the number of ways to choose the elements. Wait, no. Because the first i elements must form a permutation, but they can be any permutation of any i distinct elements from 1..n.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because p is a permutation of 1..n, so the first i elements are a subset of size i, arranged in some order. Similarly for q. But in our case, for each i, the first i elements of p and q are the same, so for each i, the first i elements must be the same in both p and q.\n\nSo, for each i, the first i elements form a permutation s of some i elements. So, for each i, the number of possible s is (n choose i) multiplied by i! ? No, because the first i elements are a permutation of exactly i distinct elements.\n\nWait, no. The first i elements are a permutation of exactly i distinct elements from 1..n. So, the number of possible s is (n choose i) * i! ?\n\nNo, because choosing i elements and permuting them gives i! possibilities. So, for each i, the number of possible s is nP_i = n!/(n-i)!.\n\nBut wait, for a particular i, the first i elements can be any i-length permutation of 1..n. So, for each i, there are nP_i possible s.\n\nBut when we fix the first i elements as s, then the (i+1)th element is a, which is part of the remaining n-i-1 elements.\n\nWait, but for each i, a and b are elements from the remaining elements, with a < b.\n\nSo, the number of possible a and b is the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a < b and a, b are in the remaining elements.\n\nBut the remaining elements are n - i elements, because the first i are fixed as s.\n\nWait, no. Because s is a permutation of i elements, so the remaining elements are n - i elements.\n\nSo, for each i, the number of possible (a, b) pairs is C(k, 2), where k is the number of remaining elements. Wait, no, because a and b are ordered, and a < b. So, for k = n - i, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a < b is k*(k-1)/2.\n\nWait, no, because for each a and b in the remaining elements, a < b. So, the number is the combination of 2 from k elements, which is k choose 2, which is k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo, for each i, the number of possible (a, b) is (n - i)*(n - i - 1)/2.\n\nBut for each i, a and b are fixed, and the suffix contributes T(m), where m = n - i - 1.\n\nSo, the total contribution for each i is:\n\ncontribution_i = (number of s) * (number of (a, b) pairs) * T(m)\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, the number of s is nP_i = n!/(n-i)!.\n\nAnd for each s, the number of (a, b) pairs is (n - i choose 2), but a and b must be from the remaining elements.\n\nWait, no. Because s is a permutation of i elements, the remaining elements are n - i. So, the number of (a, b) pairs is (n - i) * (n - i - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each i, the total contribution is:\n\nn!/(n-i)! * [ (n - i)(n - i - 1)/2 ] * T(m), where m = n - i -1.\n\nWait, but T(m) is the number of (s, t) pairs for the remaining m elements, which is the same for any i as long as m is fixed.\n\nYes, because for m = n - i -1, regardless of i, T(m) is the same.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nCompute for each m from 0 to n-1, the value T(m) = number of (s, t) pairs where s and t are permutations of m elements, s != t, and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1, compute:\n\nterm_i = (n! / (n - i)! )) * ( (n - i) * (n - i - 1) // 2 ) * T(n - i - 1)\n\nAnd sum all term_i for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut wait, when i = n-1, m = n - (n-1) -1 = 0. So, T(0) is the number of (s, t) pairs where m=0, which is zero because there are no elements. So, T(0) is zero.\n\nSo, for i ranging from 0 to n-2, m ranges from n-1-0= n-1 down to 0.\n\nWait, but when m=0, T(0)=0. So, for i=n-1, term_i is zero.\n\nSo, the sum is from i=0 to i=n-2.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute T(m) for all m from 0 to n.\n\n2. For each i from 0 to n-2, compute the term as (n!/(n-i)! ) * C(n -i, 2) * T(n - i -1).\n\n3. Sum all terms and output the result modulo mod.\n\nSo, the main challenge is to compute T(m) efficiently for all m up to 500.\n\nNow, how to compute T(m) for each m.\n\nT(m) is the number of ordered pairs (s, t) where s and t are permutations of m elements, s != t, and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nSo, for each m, T(m) = sum_{s} sum_{t} [inv(s) > inv(t)] - [cases where s = t]\n\nBut since when s = t, inv(s) > inv(t) is false, so the subtraction is zero.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning suggests that T(m) is equal to the sum over all s and t (including s=t) of [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nBut since when s = t, inv(s) > inv(t) is false, the sum remains the same as the sum for s != t.\n\nWait, no. Because when s = t, [inv(s) > inv(t)] is 0.\n\nSo, T(m) is equal to the number of ordered pairs (s, t) where s != t and inv(s) > inv(t).\n\nWhich is equal to the total number of ordered pairs (s, t) where inv(s) > inv(t), minus the number of pairs where s = t and inv(s) > inv(t). But since for s = t, inv(s) > inv(t) is false, the second term is zero.\n\nThus, T(m) = sum_{s, t} [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nBut this sum includes all s and t, including s = t.\n\nWait, no, because when s and t are the same permutation, [inv(s) > inv(t)] is false, so it's not included.\n\nSo, T(m) is the sum over all s and t (including s = t) of [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nBut for s = t, it contributes 0.\n\nSo, T(m) = sum_{s, t} [inv(s) > inv(t)].\n\nSo, how to compute this.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each permutation s, compute the number of permutations t where inv(t) < inv(s), and then sum over all s.\n\nBecause T(m) = sum_{s} (number of t where inv(t) < inv(s)).\n\nBecause for each s, the number of t's where inv(t) < inv(s) is added to T(m).\n\nSo, T(m) = sum_{s} count_t[inv(t) < inv(s)].\n\nBut then, for each s, count_t[inv(t) < inv(s)] is the number of t's with fewer inversions than s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to, for each permutation s, compute the number of t's that have fewer inversions than s.\n\nOnce we have that, summing over all s gives us T(m).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nHmm, for each m, the number of permutations is m!.\n\nWe can precompute the number of permutations with a given number of inversions.\n\nLet's denote c[k] as the number of permutations of m elements with exactly k inversions.\n\nThen, for each permutation s with inv(s) = k_s, the number of t's with inv(t) < k_s is sum_{k=0}^{k_s - 1} c[k].\n\nSo, T(m) = sum_{s} sum_{k=0}^{k_s - 1} c[k}.\n\nBut since all permutations s contribute, and each s has a unique k_s, we can compute T(m) as:\n\nT(m) = sum_{k=0}^{max_inversion} (c[k] * (sum_{t=0}^{k-1} c[t} )) )\n\nWait, because for each permutation s with k inversions, there are c[k] such s, and each contributes sum_{t=0}^{k-1} c[t} t's.\n\nThus, T(m) = sum_{k=0}^{max_inversion} c[k] * (sum_{t=0}^{k-1} c[t} )\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each m, the inversion counts and the number of permutations for each count.\n\n2. For each m, compute the prefix sums of the inversion counts.\n\n3. Then, for each k, compute c[k] * (prefix_sum[k-1]).\n\n4. Sum these for all k to get T(m).\n\nSo, the steps for each m are:\n\n- Compute all c[k] for k from 0 to max_inversion (which is m*(m-1)/2).\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array, where prefix_sum[k] = sum_{t=0}^k c[t}.\n\n- Then, T(m) is sum_{k=0}^{max_inversion} c[k] * (prefix_sum[k-1}) if k >=1, else 0.\n\nWait, but when k=0, prefix_sum[-1] is undefined. So, for k=0, the term is zero.\n\nSo, for k from 0 to max_k:\n\nif k == 0: term += 0.\n\nelse: term += c[k] * prefix_sum[k-1}.\n\nThus, T(m) is the sum of these terms.\n\nSo, the next step is to compute for each m, the c[k], the number of permutations with k inversions.\n\nThis is a classic problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nWe can precompute c[k] for all m up to 500 and k up to m(m-1)/2.\n\nThe DP approach for c[m][k] is as follows:\n\nc[0][0] = 1.\n\nFor m >= 1, c[m][k] = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} c[m-1][k-i}, for k >= i.\n\nBut wait, more accurately:\n\nWhen adding the m-th element, it can be inserted into any position in the permutation of m-1 elements. Each insertion adds a certain number of inversions. For example, inserting the new element at position j (0-based from the end) would add (m-1 - j) inversions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the maximum possible inversions.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nc[m][k] = sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c[m-1][k - j}.\n\nBut this is not efficient for m=500 because the time complexity is O(m^3), which would be 500^3 = 125e6, manageable.\n\nWait, for each m, and for each possible k up to m*(m-1)/2, compute c[m][k] based on c[m-1][*].\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nOnce c[m][k] is computed for all m up to 500, we can proceed.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read n and mod.\n\n2. Precompute c[m][k] for all m from 0 to n, and k from 0 to m*(m-1)/2.\n\n3. For each m from 0 to n, compute T(m) as described above.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2:\n\n   a. m = n - i -1.\n\n   b. Compute the term_i as (n! / (n - i)! ) * ( (n - i) * (n - i -1) // 2 ) * T(m).\n\n   c. Add term_i to the answer.\n\n5. Sum all term_i and output the result mod mod.\n\nBut wait, what about factorials?\n\nWe need to compute n! / (n - i)! for various i. Since n can be up to 500, we can precompute factorials up to 500 modulo mod.\n\nBut wait, mod is not necessarily a prime, so division is tricky.\n\nBut in this case, n! / (n - i)! is equal to the product of (n - i + 1) * ... * n.\n\nSo, perhaps precompute for each possible i, the value of (n! / (n - i)! ) mod mod.\n\nBut since mod can be up to 1e9, and n is up to 500, this is feasible.\n\nWe can precompute fact = [1]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in 2 to n:\n\n   fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n\nThen, for each i, the value n!/(n-i)! is equal to fact[n] * inverse(fact[n-i]) mod mod, but wait, no. Because division in modular arithmetic is only possible if mod is coprime with the denominator.\n\nBut since mod can be any number, including non-primes, we can't use modular inverses directly. So, this approach won't work.\n\nThus, we need to compute n!/(n-i)! modulo mod without using inverses. But for that, the denominator (n-i)! must divide the numerator (n!) exactly.\n\nIn our case, since n!/(n-i)! is an integer, it's possible to compute it modulo mod by multiplying the necessary terms, but we have to handle the case where mod is not a prime.\n\nWait, but for example, if mod is 403458273, which is a composite, then for each i, we can compute the product of (n - i + 1) * ... * n, and multiply them modulo mod.\n\nYes, because for each i, the term is the product of (n - i +1) to n, which is exactly n!/(n-i)!.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute this product as a separate loop.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nPrecompute for each i, the product P = product_{k=1 to i} (n - i +k) mod mod.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for i =0, the term is n! / (n-0)! = n! /n! = 1.\n\nFor i=1, the term is n!/(n-1)! = n.\n\nFor i=2, it's n!/(n-2)! = n*(n-1).\n\nSo, for each i, the product is n*(n-1)*...*(n -i +1).\n\nSo, for each i, compute P_i = product from k=1 to i of (n - i +k).\n\nBut for i up to 500, and",
