Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then, he gets n queries, each of which is a substitution: replace all occurrences of a digit di with a string ti. The order of the queries matters because each subsequent query operates on the result of the previous ones.\n\nMy goal is to process all these queries in order and then compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the substitutions efficiently? Because if I process each substitution naively by replacing each occurrence, it could be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long and there are up to 105 queries. But maybe for the constraints given, a straightforward approach would work.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Read n queries.\n3. For each query, perform the substitution on the current s.\n4. After all substitutions, compute the numeric value of s, ignoring leading zeros (but wait, no, according to the note, leading zeros should not be removed; the sample shows that the third case has '000' which becomes '777' but the output is 777, implying that leading zeros are kept as part of the number, but when converted to a number, they are treated as zero. Wait, no, the note says that after replacement, leading zeros are ignored when representing as a decimal number. Or wait, no: the note says \"when you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is empty, it's zero.\" So, for example, if the resulting string is \"00123\", it's treated as 123.\n\nWait, but in the third sample input, the output is 777. Let's see:\n\nSample Input:\n222\n2->0\n0->7\n\nAfter first substitution (2→0), the string becomes 000. Then, the next substitution is 0→7. So the string becomes 777. So the output is 777, which matches the sample. So leading zeros are not ignored in the process. So during substitution, the string can have leading zeros, but when converting to the number, those are stripped.\n\nBut for the purpose of the modulo operation, perhaps we need to consider the entire string as a number, including any leading zeros, because that affects the actual value. Wait, no. Because leading zeros change the value. For example, \"000123\" is 123, but \"0123\" is 123. So when the problem says to ignore leading zeros, it's only when considering the numeric value, not when processing the substitutions.\n\nWait, but when processing the substitution, the string's structure affects what the substitutions do. So leading zeros are preserved during substitution but when calculating the number, they are ignored. So for the final computation, the string is converted into a number, leading zeros are removed, and then modded by 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because processing the substitutions correctly is important, but the final output depends on the numeric value after leading zeros are stripped.\n\nSo, how do I model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent each digit's substitution as a transformation function. That is, for each digit d, we know what it's replaced with. But the order of substitution matters, so we need to process them in the given order.\n\nWait, but substitution is done in the order of the queries. So for each query, we replace all instances of di with ti. So each time, it's a global substitution across the entire string.\n\nThis suggests that for each digit in the string, we can track what it's been replaced into through the sequence of queries.\n\nBut since substitutions can be overlapping (for example, a query may replace '2' with '00', then another query may replace '0' with '7'), the order in which substitutions are processed is crucial.\n\nSo, the idea is to process each query one by one, and for each substitution, update the current mapping of each digit to its replacement.\n\nWait, perhaps using a dictionary to map each digit to a string of replacements. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, we update the mapping for di to ti. However, we have to process the queries in reverse order because later substitutions override earlier ones. Wait, no. Because each substitution is applied on the current state of the string. So, for example, if a query replaces 'a' with 'b', and then another query replaces 'b' with 'c', the second substitution is applied to the string after the first.\n\nSo the correct way is to process the queries in the given order, updating the substitution mappings accordingly. But wait, substitution mappings are such that each query replaces a certain digit with a string, which may consist of multiple digits, each of which may have their own substitutions.\n\nWait, no. Because when a substitution is made, any subsequent substitutions will affect the new string. So, for example, if I have a substitution '2→a' and then 'a→b', the first substitution changes '2's into 'a's, and the second substitution changes 'a's into 'b's. So the overall effect is that '2's become 'b's.\n\nThus, the substitution process is order-dependent. So, each substitution must be applied in the order given, and the new substitutions can modify the string in a way that affects future substitutions.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to process each query in order, and for each query, replace all occurrences of di with ti in the current string.\n\nBut doing this naively for each query could be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which is acceptable because n is up to 105 and m is up to 105, so total operations are around 10^7, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but let's think about how many times each character is processed. Each substitution could potentially change the length of the string, so the next substitution could affect more or fewer characters.\n\nBut for the constraints given, even a naive approach should be acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n- For each query in the order given:\n   - Split the query into di and ti.\n   - Replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n- Once all queries are processed, compute the numeric value of s, stripping leading zeros, and then take mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the leading zeros are ignored when representing as a number. So, after all substitutions, the resulting string may have leading zeros, but when converted to a number, those are ignored.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Process all queries on s, replacing each di with ti in order.\n\n2. Compute the numeric value of the resulting s, treating it as a number without leading zeros. If s is empty, it's zero.\n\n3. Compute this number mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the challenge is to process the substitutions correctly, and then compute the numeric value, handling leading zeros.\n\nNow, the question is: how to implement the substitution process.\n\nImplementing substitution naively:\n\nFor each query, loop through the string and replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nYes. For example, in Python, for a given string s and a query di and ti, the new s is s.replace(di, ti).\n\nBut wait, the replace function in Python replaces all occurrences, right? So for example, '123123'.replace('2','00') gives '10031003', which matches the first example.\n\nSimilarly, '123123'.replace('3', '') gives '1212'.\n\nSo, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead s from input.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor each of the next n lines:\n\n   parse the line into di and ti.\n\n   s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process the resulting s.\n\nCompute the number: if s is empty, it's 0. Else, strip leading zeros, then if the result is empty, it's 0, else convert to integer and mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but stripping leading zeros might leave an empty string, which we treat as zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif not s:\n    result = 0\nelse:\n    # remove leading zeros\n    s_stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not s_stripped:\n        result = 0\n    else:\n        result = int(s_stripped)\nresult %= MOD\n\nwhere MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, wait, the input format is a bit confusing. The first line is the initial string s, which is given as '123123'.\n\nThen, the second line is n=1.\n\nThen, the next line is the first query: '2->00'.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the sample input provided:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, that's perhaps a representation, but in reality, the input is read as:\n\nThe first line is the string s, which is '123123'.\n\nThen the second line is n=1.\n\nThen, the third line is the first query: '2->00'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the sample input is a list of four elements, but that's probably a formatting issue. Anyway, perhaps the actual input is as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nquery: 2 -> 00.\n\nSo, after substitution, s becomes '10031003'.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the output is '10031003' as the first step. Then, the second query is 3->, which replaces all 3's with empty string, making s '1212'.\n\nThird query: 222 → 2->0, then 0->7. So after first substitution, 222 becomes 000. Then substituting 0->7, it becomes 777.\n\nFourth query: 1000000008 → 0. So, the string becomes 0.\n\nSo the outputs are 10031003, 1212, 777, 1.\n\nWait, but the sample output shows four outputs, but that's because it's showing the intermediate steps. But according to the problem statement, we have to process all queries and output the final result.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says that the output is the remainder after division by 1e9+7 of the resulting number. So the output is a single integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is just illustrating the process, but the actual output is just one line.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample in the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nSample Output:\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo, and the actual output is just the last result, which is 1.\n\nWait, no, because processing all four queries:\n\nFirst query: 2→00 → s becomes 10031003.\n\nSecond query: 3→'' → s becomes 1212.\n\nThird query: 2→0 → s becomes 00 (from 22 being replaced by 0). Then, 0→7 → s becomes 77.\n\nWait, but wait, the third query is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7': the two queries are '2→0' and '0→7'.\n\nSo after first substitution, 222 → 000.\n\nThen, substitution '0→7' changes each 0 to 7, so 000 becomes 777.\n\nSo s is now 777.\n\nFourth query is '1000000008\\n0': the substitution is 0→0? Or wait, the query is '1000000008' → '0'? So any occurrence of '1000000008' in the string is replaced by '0'. But since the string is 777, which doesn't contain '1000000008', nothing changes. So s remains 777.\n\nWait, but the sample output after processing all four queries is 777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nBut the sample output says '1'. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is miswritten, and the actual fourth query is '0→8' or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns is '1000000008'.\n\nn is 0, so no queries. So the output is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut 1e9+7 is 1000000007, so 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the sample's fourth query is '1000000008' → '0', but since the initial s is '1000000008', applying the substitution 1000000008→0 makes s become '0'.\n\nSo after all queries, s is '0', which when converted to a number is 0. But according to the note, if s is empty, it's zero, but here s is '0', so the numeric value is 0.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 1. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial s is '1000000008', n=0, so no substitutions. So the resulting s is '1000000008', which when converted to a number is 1000000008. Then, mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the output is 1.\n\nSo, the sample's output is 1.\n\nSo the code needs to process all substitutions, then compute the numeric value correctly, stripping leading zeros.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read s from input. But the input is read via stdin, which in practice is a line.\n\nWait, in the sample input, it's written as ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', ...], but perhaps in the actual code, the first line is s, which may include \\n. So, in code, s = input().strip().\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first line is '123123\\n1\\n...', which suggests that the first line is the initial s, which includes a newline? No, that's unlikely. Probably, the sample is misformatted.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nLine 1: s is '123123'\n\nLine 2: n is 1\n\nLines 3: the first query is '2->00'\n\nLines 4: second query is '3->'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a list of lines, but for code submission, the initial string is the first line, then n is the second, then n lines of queries.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process each query in order.\n\nEach query is a string like 'di->ti', so we split each into di and ti.\n\nFor each query:\n\nparts = query.split('->')\n\ndi = parts[0]\n\nti = parts[1]\n\ns = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nYes.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, compute the numeric value.\n\nSo, code:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    s_stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not s_stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(s_stripped)\n        print(num % MOD)\n\nBut wait, what if s is empty after substitutions? Like, all substitutions resulted in an empty string. Then, it's 0.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nTesting the code with the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\ns becomes '10031003' → when converted, it's 10031003 mod MOD.\n\nBut in the sample, the output after first substitution is '10031003'.\n\nBut the problem expects us to process all queries, so the final s after all substitutions is as per the code.\n\nAnother test case: the third sample in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo s starts as '222'.\n\nAfter first substitution: '222'.replace('2', '0') → '000'.\n\nAfter second substitution: '000'.replace('0', '7') → '777'.\n\ns is '777' → stripped is '777' → 777 mod MOD is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: s is '1000000008', n=0.\n\nNo substitutions, so s is '1000000008' → stripped is '1000000008' → 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- Empty string after substitution: e.g., s is 'a' (but wait, s is a digit string, so no letters), so substitution could lead to empty. For example, s='0', substitution '0'→'', then s is empty. So output is 0.\n\n- All substitutions result in leading zeros, but the final s is '0000', which is treated as 0.\n\nAnother edge case: s is '0', n=1, query '0'→'00', so s becomes '00' → stripped is '0' → 0.\n\nWhat about s being '00', substitution '0'→'1', then s is '11' → 11.\n\nWait, no: substitution '0'→'1' replaces each '0' in s. So '00' becomes '11'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code correctly handles leading zeros.\n\nThus, the approach should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1,000,000,007.

This is done sequentially, ensuring that each substitution affects the subsequent ones.\n3. **Compute Result:** After processing all queries, convert the resulting string to a numeric value, ignoring any leading zeros. If the result is an empty string, treat it as zero.\n4. **Modulo Operation:** Compute the remainder of the numeric value modulo 1,000,000,007 and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Read the initial string s\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor query in queries:\n    # Split the query into di and ti parts\n    if '->' not in query:\n        continue  # skip invalid queries, though per problem statement, this shouldn't happen\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Remove leading zeros\n    stripped_s = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped_s:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped_s)\n        print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Queries:** Each query is processed in order. For each query, the specified digit is replaced with the given string. This is done using Python's `str.replace()` method which replaces all occurrences efficiently.\n3. **Handling Leading Zeros:** After processing all queries, the resulting string is converted to a numeric value by stripping leading zeros. If the result is an empty string (after stripping), it is treated as zero.\n4. **Modulo Operation:** The numeric value is taken modulo 1,000,000,007 to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits and meets the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that all substitutions are handled correctly and efficiently, even for the maximum constraints, providing the correct result as required by the problem statement.",
