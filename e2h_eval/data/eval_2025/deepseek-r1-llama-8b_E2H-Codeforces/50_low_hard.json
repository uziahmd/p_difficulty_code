There are $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$ distinct$$$^\\dagger$$$ edge-weighted trees with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that each edge is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. Your task is to find the sum of $$$d(1,n)^\\ddagger$$$ of all such trees that are good. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Two trees are considered to be distinct if either:   there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the trees, and not in the other.  there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one tree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$). That is why total number of distinct edge-weighted tree is $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$.$$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$d(u,v)$$$ denotes the sum of the weight of all edges on the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nThe only line of output should contain a single integer, the required answer, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\n### Output\n['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, there is only $$$1$$$ distinct good tree.

The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees. The sum of $$$d(1,4)$$$ over all trees is $$$2 \\cdot (-2) + 8 \\cdot (-1) + 4 \\cdot (0) + 2 \\cdot (1) = -10$$$, which is $$$998\\,244\\,343$$$ under modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the sum of d(1,n) across all good trees. A good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1, and for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights around it is -1. Then, d(1,n) is the sum of the weights along the path between 1 and n. We need to compute this sum modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, what makes a tree 'good'? For each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. So, every node must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. Because (-1)^k = -1 only if k is odd.\n\nWait, because each edge contributes either +1 or -1. So for each node, the product is the product of its incident edges. Since the product is -1, each node must have an odd number of -1 edges connected to it.\n\nSo, each node's degree (in terms of -1 edges) is odd. But the tree structure also imposes that the overall graph is a tree, which is connected and has exactly n-1 edges.\n\nNow, considering the entire tree, let's think about the total product. Each edge contributes either 1 or -1. The product of all edges in the tree would be equal to the product over all nodes' products. Wait, no—since each edge is counted twice, once at each endpoint. So the product of all edges (considering each edge as a factor) would be the square of the product of the node products. Because each edge is part of two nodes' products.\n\nWait, more precisely: the product of all edges is equal to the product of each node's product, but each edge is included in two nodes. So the product of all nodes' products is equal to (product of edges) squared. Because each edge is multiplied twice.\n\nBut the product of all nodes' products is (-1)^n, because each node contributes a -1. So (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n. So product of edges is either 1 or -1, depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see:\n\nEach node's product is -1. So the product over all nodes is (-1)^n.\n\nThe product over all edges is E = e1 * e2 * ... * e_{n-1}.\n\nEach edge ei is part of two nodes' products, so when you multiply all the node products together, each edge is counted twice. So the product of all node products is (E)^2.\n\nSo, (-1)^n = (E)^2.\n\nTherefore, E = ±1, depending on n being even or odd.\n\nIf n is even: (-1)^n is 1, so E^2=1 → E=1.\n\nIf n is odd: (-1)^n is -1 → E^2=-1, which is impossible since E is a product of 1s and -1s. Wait, that can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the product of all edges is indeed E. Then the product of all node products is E squared, because each edge is included twice. So E² equals the product of all node products, which is (-1)^n.\n\nSo for E² to be a real number, (-1)^n must be non-negative. So when n is even, E²=1 → E=±1. When n is odd, (-1)^n is -1 → E²=-1, which is impossible. So that suggests that for odd n, there are no such good trees. But that can't be, because in the sample input where n=2, which is even, there was a solution. Wait, but when n is 1, then there are zero edges. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe my initial assumption is incorrect. Because each edge is included in two nodes' products, the product of all node products is (product of edges)^2. So E^2 = product of all nodes' products. Since each node's product is -1, the product is (-1)^n. So E^2 = (-1)^n.\n\nSo, for E^2 to be a real number, (-1)^n must be 1. That is, n must be even. Otherwise, if n is odd, E^2 = -1, which is impossible because E is a product of 1 and -1, so E is either 1 or -1, making E^2 always 1. So this leads to a contradiction unless n is even.\n\nWait, that suggests that for odd n, there are no good trees. So the answer is zero in those cases.\n\nLooking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the second test case, n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the path sums \\(d(1, n)\\) across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees. A tree is considered \"good\" if each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight -1, and each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: For a tree to be good, every vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. This implies that the product of edge weights around each vertex is -1.\n2. **Parity Consideration**: The product of all edge weights in the tree must be 1 because each edge is counted twice when considering the product around each vertex. This leads to the conclusion that \\(n\\) must be even for such a tree to exist. If \\(n\\) is odd, there are no good trees, and the answer is 0.\n3. **Path Sum Calculation**: For each good tree, the path sum \\(d(1, n)\\) is computed. We need to sum these values for all possible good trees.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelif n % 2 != 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # The result for even n is (n choose 1) * something, but let's compute it properly.\n    # Wait, according to the problem's third sample, for n=4, the sum is -10 mod MOD.\n    # Let's find a pattern or formula.\n    # After analysis, the sum is 0 for n=2, -10 for n=4, etc.\n    # For even n, the sum is 0 when n is 2, and for larger even n, perhaps it's also 0?\n    # Wait, let me think again.\n    # Each good tree has an even number of -1 edges around each node.\n    # The path from 1 to n will have certain properties based on the structure.\n    # However, upon deeper analysis, the sum over all good trees of d(1,n) is zero for even n > 2.\n    # Or perhaps it's not zero.
