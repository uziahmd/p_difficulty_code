            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Radio Towers\n\nThere are $$$n + 2$$$ towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n + 1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2 each, and these are independent events.\n\nAfter building the towers, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to compute the probability that this is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So for each subset of built towers, we need to check if there's an assignment of powers that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, we're to find the probability that after building the towers (randomly), there exists a valid power assignment. So the probability is over all possible subsets of built towers, multiplied by the indicator whether a valid assignment exists.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S (where S is a subset of {1,2,...,n}) such that there's a way to assign p_i (signal power) to each i in S, satisfying the coverage conditions.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like the problem is combinatorial.\n\nLet me think about what a valid configuration looks like.\n\nEach tower's signal must cover some interval. The entire set of towns 1..n must be covered exactly once.\n\nMoreover, town 0 and n+1 must not be covered. That means, for town 1, the only way it can be covered is if there's a tower in town 1 with power 1. Because any tower in town 1 would reach town 0 if its power is >=2, which is not allowed. So to prevent town 0 from being covered, any tower in town 1 must have power 1.\n\nSimilarly, town n must have a tower in town n with power 1, because otherwise, a tower in town n would cover town n+1, which is forbidden.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nFor town 0: any tower in town i can't have a power that allows it to reach 0. The condition is |c -i| < p. So for c=0, i can't be such that |0 - i| < p. But since i is at least 1, this would require p > i. But p is at most n, which is >=1. So for i=1, if p is 2, then 0 is covered. So to prevent 0 from being covered, any tower in town 1 must have p=1.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1: any tower j in town n can't have p>1, because |(n+1) -n| =1 <p implies p>1. So if there's a tower in n, it must have p=1.\n\nWait, but if there's a tower in n, and p is 1, then it covers town n only. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo the first thing I notice is that in the valid configurations, for any tower at position 1, its power must be exactly 1. Similarly, any tower at position n must also have power exactly 1.\n\nThat's a key point.\n\nNow, considering the middle towns (2..n-1), they can be covered by their own tower or by adjacent ones, but in such a way that each is covered exactly once.\n\nWait, but let's think of the overall structure.\n\nThe assignment of powers must form a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nBut each tower's coverage is determined by its power. So, perhaps the arrangement of the towers must form a certain kind of structure, like a tiling where each tile is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is similar to placing non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a tower, such that every position is covered exactly once.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement is such that the towers form a certain kind of binary structure, where each tower either covers only itself or covers a range that doesn't interfere with others.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the towers form a certain type of structure, like a set of \"dominoes\" where each domino covers exactly one cell, and adjacent dominoes don't overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem as follows: each tower's coverage must consist of a single contiguous segment, and these segments must partition the towns 1..n without overlapping.\n\nSo each tower's coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)], but only within 1..n.\n\nBut since the coverage must be exactly once per town, the union of all these intervals must cover 1..n exactly",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can assign signal powers such that each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal, while towns 0 and n+1 receive none.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the valid configurations of towers form a specific structure where each tower's coverage interval does not overlap with others and covers exactly one town. This structure is similar to tiling the towns with non-overlapping intervals.\n\n1. **Towers at the ends (towns 1 and n)**: Towers at these positions must have power 1 to avoid covering towns 0 and n+1.\n2. **Middle towns**: Each middle town can either be covered by its own tower or by an adjacent tower, but the coverage must be non-overlapping and cover all towns exactly once.\n\nThe valid configurations are those where the towers form a perfect partition of the towns into contiguous segments. This can be modeled using dynamic programming to count the number of valid subsets of towers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef modinv(a):\n    return pow(a, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelif n == 1:\n    print(748683265)  # 1/2 mod MOD\nelse:\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        if i >= 2:\n            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]\n        dp[i] %= MOD\n    inv_total = modinv(pow(2, n, MOD))\n    res = dp[n] * inv_total % MOD\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Base Case**: `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to cover zero towns.\n3. **Transition**: For each town `i`, we consider two cases: either the tower at `i` has power 1, covering only itself, or it covers a segment ending at `i`. This is done by adding `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` (if `i >= 2`).\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo `998244353`, we use modular inverses to handle division operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations and computes the required probability using modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and efficiency for large values of `n`.",
