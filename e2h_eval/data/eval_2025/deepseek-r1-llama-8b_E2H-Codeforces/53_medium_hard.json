    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I'm given a string, and I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, first, what's a substring? Oh right, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, in 'abc', substrings are like 'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'b', etc. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it appears more than once in the given string.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum length of such a substring. If no such substring exists (like when all substrings are unique), then the answer would be 0, I guess. Wait, but the problem says \"at least twice\", so even if the same character appears twice, that's a valid substring of length 1.\n\nBut wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output 0. Because all substrings are unique.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output 3. Because 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and 2, overlapping.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output 2. Because 'zz' appears at 0-1 and 1-2.\n\nSo, the approach needs to consider all possible substrings, track their positions, and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nHmm, the straightforward way is to generate all possible substrings, for each possible length starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if any substring of that length occurs more than once. Once found, return that length.\n\nBut generating all substrings could be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nWait, the maximum possible substring length to check is n-1, where n is the length of the string. For example, in a string of length 3, the maximum substring length to check is 2. But checking from the largest possible down might help in finding the answer quickly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1.\n   - For each length l, iterate through all possible substrings of that length.\n   - For each substring, check if it appears again somewhere else in the string.\n   - If any substring of length l appears more than once, return l as the answer.\n\n2. If after checking all lengths down to 1, no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nSo the key is, for each possible l, we look for any duplicate substring of length l. Once we find the largest l for which this is true, we return it.\n\nHow do I implement this efficiently?\n\nFirst, for a given l, we can loop through each possible starting index i and extract the substring s[i:i+l], then check if this substring appears again in the string.\n\nBut checking for each substring whether it appears elsewhere can be done by storing all substrings of length l in a set or a dictionary, and see if adding a new one causes a duplicate.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring of length l, we can record its position. Then, for each new substring, check if it's already in the map. If yes, then we have a duplicate, so return l.\n\nYes, that's a better approach.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nFor l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n    Create a dictionary (let's call it seen) to track the starting indices of substrings of length l.\n    Loop i from 0 to len(s) - l:\n        current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n        if current_sub is already in seen:\n            return l as the answer\n        else:\n            add current_sub to seen with value i\n    After checking all i for this l, proceed to next smaller l.\n\nIf no duplicates are found for any l, return 0.\n\nWait, but for the same l, multiple substrings may have duplicates. So, for each l, as soon as any substring is found to have a duplicate, we can immediately return l.\n\nYes, that makes sense because we're checking from the largest possible l downwards, so the first l for which duplicates exist is the maximum possible, and we can return it.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the steps in code.\n\nIn Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = {}\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen[substr] = i\n# If no duplicates found\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but this will not work correctly. Let me test on sample input 2.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → n=5.\n\nLoop l starts at 4:\n\nCheck substrings of length 4:\ni=0: 'abab' → not in seen → add.\ni=1: 'baba' → not in seen → add.\nNo duplicates, so l=4 is not the answer.\n\nThen l=3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' → add.\ni=1: 'bab' → add.\ni=2: 'aba' → already in seen → return 3. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 'zzz' (n=3):\n\nl=2: i=0: 'zz' added. i=1: 'zz' → found, return 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'. The largest l is 4. For each substring of length 4, they are 'aaaa' starting at 0 and 1. So l=4 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nAt l=4, i=0: substr 'aaaa' added to seen.\ni=1: substr 'aaaa' is taken from s[1:5], which is also 'aaaa'. So in the second iteration, it's found as a duplicate. So the code returns 4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab'. What's the maximum l? 5.\n\nSubstrings of length 5: 'ababa' and 'baban' (no). So no duplicates at l=5.\n\nl=4: check each substring. 'abab' at i=0, then 'baba' at i=1, then 'abab' at i=2. When i=2, 'abab' is found in seen, so return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 'abcabc'? The maximum l is 5: 'bcabc' and 'cabcx' (wait, no, the string is 'abcabc', so for l=5, substrings are 'abcab' and 'bcabc'. No duplicates. Then l=4: 'abca', 'bcab', 'cabc' — no duplicates. l=3: 'abc' appears at i=0 and i=3 → yes, so return 3.\n\nWait, but wait, in 'abcabc' the substring 'abc' appears at 0-2 and 3-5. So l=3 is correct.\n\nBut according to our code, for l=3, when i=0, substr 'abc' is added. Then when i=3, substr is 'abc', which is already in seen, so we return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nWhat about the sample input 1: 'abcd' → for l=3, each substring is unique. Then l=2: each substring is unique. l=1: 'a' appears once, 'b' once, etc. So no duplicates. So code returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the empty string? Well, the problem states that the input is non-empty, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nWhat about a single character string? For example, 'a'. Then the code loops from l=0 (since n-1 is 0, but the loop is from n-1 down to 1. Wait, for n=1, the loop is from 0 down to 1, which doesn't execute. So the code will proceed to print 0, which is correct because there's only one occurrence of the substring 'a'.\n\nWait, but wait, in the loop 'range(n-1, 0, -1)' → when n=1, n-1=0, so range(0,0,-1) is an empty range, so the loop doesn't run. So the code proceeds to print 0, which is correct because the substring 'a' appears once.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aa' → the code for l=1: i=0, substr 'a' added. i=1, substr 'a' is found, so returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about when a substring of longer length appears multiple times, but the code picks up a shorter one earlier. No, because the code starts with the longest possible l and returns immediately upon finding a duplicate.\n\nTherefore, the code should work correctly.\n\nSo the plan is solid. Now, to write the Python code accordingly.\n\nRead the input string, process it as described, and output the result.\n\nWait, but in Python, reading from standard input can sometimes have issues, especially with multiple inputs. So the code should read from stdin, perhaps using input().strip(), but need to handle cases where the input is read correctly.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the first line contains the string. So, the code can read it as s = input().strip().\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(l)\n                exit()\n            seen[substr] = i\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but in the code, when l is 0, the range is from n-1 (which is -1 if n is 1) down to 1, so no iterations. So for n=1, the loop doesn't run, and the code prints 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → Output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → Output 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → Output 2.\n\nWhich matches the examples.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → Output 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcab' → for l=4, substrings are 'abca' and 'bcab' → no duplicates. Then l=3: 'abc' and 'cab' → no. l=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab' → when i=0, 'ab' added. i=3, 'ab' is found, so returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
