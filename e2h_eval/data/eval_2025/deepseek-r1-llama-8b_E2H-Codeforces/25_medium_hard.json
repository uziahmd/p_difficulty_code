При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine if a given string t could be the result of an error in a network where two identical messages were concatenated incorrectly. The error causes the two messages to merge by overlapping some characters at the end of the first and the beginning of the second.\n\nLet me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that when two identical messages are sent consecutively, they might merge. The merging happens at the end of the first message and the start of the second. So, for example, if both messages are \"abrakadabra\", sending them one after another could result in \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" if the last 'a' of the first overlaps with the first 'a' of the second.\n\nThe goal is to check if the given string t can be formed by such a merge. If it can, we need to find a possible original message s such that when s is sent twice, it produces t via this overlap.\n\nSo, how can I model this?\n\nIdea: For the given string t, we need to split it into two parts, s1 and s2, where s1 is a suffix of t and s2 is the corresponding prefix of t. But wait, no—because the two messages are s, so s1 would be the suffix of s concatenated with s's prefix, but since the messages are identical, s1 is the suffix of s, and s2 is the prefix of s. So, t should be equal to s + s', where s' is the prefix of s that overlaps with the suffix of s.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Let’s consider that the resulting string t is formed by concatenating two copies of s, but with an overlapping part. So t can be thought of as s concatenated with a substring that starts from some position i in s. So, for some i, t must equal s concatenated with s[i:].\n\nBut wait, more accurately, the first s is the original, and the second s is being merged. So the resulting string is s followed by s, but with an overlapping part. So, the total length of t is len(s) * 2 - k, where k is the length of the overlap (the number of overlapping characters). Since the overlapping must be positive, k is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nSo, for t to be a possible result, there must exist some s such that t can be written as s concatenated with a suffix of s. Alternatively, t can be split into two parts: the first part is s, and the second part is a suffix of s. So, the entire t is s followed by a suffix of s.\n\nBut wait, the way the messages are sent is that the two messages are s and s, but then they are merged. So the resulting t is s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part merged. So, t would be s concatenated with the part of s that starts after the overlapping part.\n\nHmm, perhaps another way: The resulting string t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part merged. So, the first occurrence of the overlapping part is at the end of the first s, and the second occurrence is at the beginning of the second s. So, t is formed by taking s, and then appending the part of s that starts at position i, for some i>0.\n\nTherefore, t must be equal to s + s[i:]. But since the two s's are merged, the total length of t is 2*len(s) - k, where k is the length of the overlapping part.\n\nSo, for a given t, to find a possible s, we need to find a split point where t can be divided into s followed by a suffix of s.\n\nSo the steps I can take are:\n\n1. Iterate over possible split points in t. For each possible split, check if the second part is a suffix of the first part.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's say t has length L. Then, for each possible split point m (from 1 to L-1), the first part is t[:m], the second part is t[m:]. We need to check if the second part is a suffix of the first part.\n\nIf that's the case, then s can be the first part, and the second part is the suffix of s. Then, when two copies of s are sent, they merge into t.\n\nFor example, in the sample input 'acacacaca', the output is 'YES\\nacaca'. Let's see:\n\nThe string is 'acacacaca'. Let's try splitting it into two parts. Suppose m=5: the first part is 'acaca' (length 5), the second is 'caca' (length 4). Is 'caca' a suffix of 'acaca'? Let's see: 'acaca' ends with 'aca'. 'caca' is not a suffix. Hmm, maybe another split.\n\nAlternatively, m=6: first part 'acacac', second 'aca'. Is 'aca' a suffix of 'acacac'? Yes, because 'acacac' ends with 'ac' (wait, no, 'acacac' ends with 'c', but 'aca' is three letters. Wait, 'acacac' is six letters. So positions 0-5. The last three letters are 'cac'. So 'aca' is not a suffix. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe I'm not looking at the right split. Let's try m=3: first part 'aca', second 'cacaca'. Is 'cacaca' a suffix of 'aca'? No, because 'aca' is only 3 letters.\n\nWait, maybe another example: 'acacacaca' is 9 letters. Let's try m=5: first part 'acaca' (5 letters), second 'caca' (4 letters). Is 'caca' a suffix of 'acaca'? 'acaca' is a c a c a. The last four letters are 'c a c a' which is 'caca'. So yes. So in this case, s is 'acaca', and the second part is 'caca' which is the suffix of s starting from index 1.\n\nSo when s is sent twice, the two s's merge at the overlapping part of length 4. So t becomes s concatenated with s[1:], which is 'acaca' + 'caca' = 'acacaca' — but wait, the original t is 'acacacaca' which is longer than that. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the length of t is 2*len(s) - k, where k is the length of the overlapping part. So in the example above, len(s) is 5, k is 4, so 2*5-4=6. But the t is 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm getting the approach wrong.\n\nAnother approach: For a possible s, the t must be equal to s + s', where s' is a proper suffix of s. So, t is s followed by a suffix of s. Thus, for any possible split of t into s and a suffix of s, we can check.\n\nSo for the given t, we can try all possible split points m (from 1 to len(t)-1), and for each m, check whether t[m:] is a suffix of t[:m]. If yes, then s is t[:m], and the error occurred when two s's were sent, causing t to be s concatenated with the suffix of s beyond the overlapping part.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the error occurs when two messages are sent one after another, and their concatenation results in a merged string. So, the two messages are s and s, and the merged string is s concatenated with s, but with an overlapping part merged.\n\nWait, no. When two messages are sent, each is s. The first is sent, then the second. The second is sent, but due to the error, it's merged with the first. So the result is the first s's end plus the second s's start, overlapping as much as possible.\n\nSo the resulting string is s1 + s2, where s1 is the first s, and s2 is the second s, but with the maximum possible overlap between the end of s1 and the start of s2.\n\nSo, the resulting string is s1 + s2, but s2 is a continuation after the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is that the resulting t is s1 concatenated with s2, where s1 and s2 are the same (s), but the overlapping part is merged. So, the overlapping is the maximum possible.\n\nThus, the resulting t is s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part merged.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'abc', then s + s is 'abcabc'. But if they are merged with an overlap of 1, it becomes 'abccbc' — wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible overlap is 3 letters, but wait, 'abc' and 'abc' have an overlap of 3, which is the entire string. So when you concatenate them, the result is 'abcabc' but without the error, but with the error, it would be just 'abc' + 'abc' → 'abcabc', but without the error, it's the same. So, perhaps the maximum possible overlap is len(s) - 1, but not sure.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the overlapping must be a positive number, less than the length of the text (so, for a string of length n, the maximum possible overlap is n-1).\n\nSo, for example, for s = 'aab', s concatenated with s with an overlap of 2 would be 'aab' + 'b' → 'aabb'? Or wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: when two messages s are sent, the first is s, the second is s. Due to the error, the end of the first s overlaps with the beginning of the second s as much as possible.\n\nSo the resulting string is s + s, but with the overlapping part merged.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap is the largest k such that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s.\n\nOnce that k is found, the resulting string is s concatenated with the remaining part of s after the first k characters.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'abcdab', and the maximum possible overlap is 3 ('dab' and 'dab'), then the result would be 'abcdab' + 'cdab' → 'abcdab' + 'cdab' → 'abcdab cdab' → but wait, no, because the overlapping is 3, so the second s starts at position 3 of the first s. So, the result is s concatenated with s[k:], which is s[3:].\n\nWait, let's take the first example in the note:\n\nInput: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra']\n\nThey say that when two 'abrakadabra's are sent, they become 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. So, the first s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The maximum possible overlap is 1 character: the last 'a' of the first s and the first 'a' of the second s. So the result is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nSo, for a given t, to check if it's a possible result of this process, we need to see if t can be written as s + s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap. But wait, no, because the error could have happened at any possible overlap, not necessarily the maximum. Or is it that the error is considered as the maximum possible overlap? Because the problem says that the error could cause any possible overlap.\n\nWait, the problem says that when two messages are sent, the error may cause them to merge. So the resulting string is formed by the maximum possible overlap. So, for example, if the maximum possible overlap is 3, then that's what happens. So, for our problem, the string t must be exactly s + s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap between s and itself.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when two messages are sent, the error may cause them to merge, but the resulting t can have any possible overlap. So, the error could have caused any possible overlap, not necessarily the maximum.\n\nNo, wait, the problem says that the messages are sent, and when sent, the two messages may merge. So the error can occur, but the merging is done with the maximum possible overlap. So, the resulting string is s concatenated with s, but with the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that during the error, the two messages s and s are merged by overlapping as much as possible. So the maximum possible overlap is achieved. Therefore, for the resulting string t, it must be equal to s + s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap (the largest possible k where the last k characters of s match the first k of s).\n\nSo, for a given t, to determine if it's a possible result, we need to find an s such that s + s[k:] equals t, where k is the maximum possible overlap for s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible k is the largest possible such that s ends with a substring that starts s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me rephrase:\n\nWe are to find s and k (k is the maximum possible) such that:\n\nt = s + s[k:]\n\nWhere k is the largest possible value such that s ends with a substring equal to the beginning of s. So, the maximum k is the length of the longest prefix of s that is also a suffix of s.\n\nThis is known as the longest border of the string s.\n\nSo, for example, for s = 'ababab', the maximum k is 4, because 'abab' is the longest prefix that is also a suffix.\n\nSo, given t, we need to check if it can be split into s and s[k:], where k is the maximum possible for s.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n1. For the given t, iterate over all possible s lengths m (from 1 to len(t)-1), because s cannot be equal to t (as two s's would make t of length 2m, but in the problem statement, the result is t which is m + (m -k) = 2m -k, which is less than 2m). So for each m, split t into s_candidate = t[:m] and rest = t[m:].\n\n2. Check if rest is a suffix of s_candidate. If it is, then compute the maximum possible k for s_candidate, which is the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix. Then, check if rest is exactly s_candidate[k:]. If yes, then this s_candidate is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but the maximum k is the largest possible. So, for example, if s_candidate is 'aaaaa', the maximum k is 4 (since 'aaaa' is the longest prefix that is also a suffix). So, for this s, the rest should be 'a', which is s_candidate[4:].\n\nSo, the algorithm steps are:\n\nFor each possible m (split point):\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   rest = t[m:]\n\n   if rest is a suffix of s_candidate:\n\n       compute the maximum possible k for s_candidate (longest prefix which is also a suffix)\n\n       if rest == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n           return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf after checking all m none satisfy, return NO.\n\nSo, now, the question is: How to compute the maximum possible k for s_candidate?\n\nTo find the maximum k for s_candidate, which is the length of the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix. This is known as the failure function in the KMP algorithm, specifically the prefix function.\n\nYes, the prefix function for a string s is an array π where π[i] is the length of the longest prefix of s[0..i] which is also a suffix. The maximum possible k is the maximum value of π for the entire string.\n\nWait, no. The maximum possible k is the last value of the prefix function array. For example, for 'ababab', the prefix function for the entire string is 4, which is the maximum.\n\nSo, for each s_candidate, compute its prefix function, get the last value (max_k), and then check if rest equals s_candidate[max_k:].\n\nSo, to implement this, I need a function to compute the prefix function for a given string s.\n\nOnce I have that, I can proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop through each possible m from 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   rest = t[m:]\n\n   if rest is a suffix of s_candidate:\n\n       compute max_k for s_candidate.\n\n       if rest == s_candidate[max_k:]:\n\n           return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none found, return NO.\n\nNow, how to implement checking if rest is a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nIn Python, for a string s and a substring substr, s.endswith(substr) tells us if substr is a suffix.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif s_candidate.endswith(rest):\n\n   compute prefix function for s_candidate.\n\n   max_k = prefix_function[-1]\n\n   if rest == s_candidate[max_k:]:\n\n       return YES and s_candidate.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the prefix function correctly.\n\nImplementing the prefix function:\n\nThe prefix function for a string s is an array π where π[i] is the length of the longest prefix of s[0..i] which is also a suffix.\n\nCompute it using the standard KMP algorithm.\n\nLet me write a helper function to compute the prefix function.\n\nSo, the code structure will be:\n\ndef compute_prefix(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    pi = [0] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        j = pi[i-1]\n        while j > 0 and s[i] != s[j]:\n            j = pi[j-1]\n        if s[i] == s[j]:\n            j += 1\n        pi[i] = j\n    return pi\n\nThen, the maximum k is pi[-1].\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: t is of length 1. Then, no possible split, so output is NO.\n\nCase 2: t is of length 2. Split into m=1: s_candidate is t[0], rest is t[1]. Check if rest is a suffix of s_candidate. Since s_candidate is length 1, rest is length 1, so it's a suffix. Compute max_k for s_candidate (which is 0, since the only possible prefix is the empty string). So, rest must be equal to s_candidate[0:], which is s_candidate. So, rest must be equal to s_candidate. So, if t is 'aa', then s_candidate is 'a', rest is 'a'. So, s_candidate[0:] is 'a', which equals rest. So, t is 'aa' can be formed by s='a' concatenated with s[0:], which is 'a' + 'a' = 'aa'. But according to the problem statement, this is not considered an error. Because the problem says that a simple concatenation of two messages is not considered an error.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\"\n\nSo, the problem counts as errors only those cases where the two messages s and s are sent, and during the transfer, they are merged by overlapping, leading to a shorter string than 2*len(s).\n\nSo, in the case where t is s + s, and s is sent twice, but the error does not cause any overlap, meaning the messages are just concatenated as-is. But in that case, the error didn't happen. So, t is considered to have no error.\n\nSo, for our problem, the condition is that the resulting t must be shorter than 2*len(s). Because the error caused the two messages to merge, thus reducing the total length by the overlapping part.\n\nWait, but in the case where the overlapping is zero, then t would be s + s, which is 2*len(s). But in that case, the two messages were simply appended, which is not considered an error.\n\nSo, for t to be the result of an error, len(t) must be less than 2*len(s_candidate).\n\nBecause when two messages are sent, the error merges them, so the resulting length is len(s) + len(s) - k, where k >=1. So, len(t) = 2*len(s) -k < 2*len(s).\n\nThus, in our code, for each s_candidate, we must ensure that len(t) = len(s_candidate) + len(rest) = m + (n - m) = n. But len(s_candidate) + len(rest) is always equal to len(t), which is n. So, len(s_candidate) is m, len(rest) is n - m.\n\nBut for the error to have occurred, len(t) must be less than 2*m. Because t = s_candidate + rest, but rest is s_candidate[k:]. So, len(rest) = m - k.\n\nSo, len(t) = m + (m -k) = 2m -k.\n\nSince k >=1, len(t) <= 2m -1.\n\nThus, len(t) < 2m.\n\nSo, in code, for each m, if len(t) >= 2m, then this m is invalid because the error can't reduce the length enough.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor m in range(1, len(t)):\n\n    if m > len(t)/2:\n\n        continue  # because 2m > len(t), but len(t) = 2m -k, k>=1 → 2m -k = len(t) → 2m > len(t) +k ≥ len(t)+1 → len(t) = 2m -k < 2m → len(t) < 2m → so m must be ≤ (len(t)-1)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps m must be ≤ (len(t)-1)/2, since len(t) = 2m -k, and k≥1 → 2m -1 ≥ len(t) → m ≥ (len(t)+1)/2 → wait no, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, len(t) = 2m -k.\n\nk can be at most m-1 (since the maximum possible k is m-1, because the maximum possible overlap is m-1).\n\nSo len(t) can be as small as m + (m - (m-1)) )= m +1.\n\nWhich is 2m - (m-1) = m+1.\n\nSo, for m to be a possible candidate, len(t) must be ≥ m + 1.\n\nWait, len(t) = 2m -k, where 1 ≤k ≤ m-1 → len(t) can be up to 2m-1.\n\nBut len(t) can be as low as m+1.\n\nSo, for each m, if len(t) < m+1 → no.\n\nWait, no, for example, if m is 5 and k is 4, len(t) is 5+1=6.\n\nWait, 2*5 -4=6.\n\nYes. So, for a given m, the minimal len(t) is 2m - (m-1) = m+1.\n\nSo, for a given m, if len(t) < m+1 → it's impossible. So, m must satisfy len(t) ≥ m+1.\n\nBut len(t) is fixed. So, for each m, check if len(t) ≥ m+1.\n\nSo, in code, for each m in 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   if len(t) < m+1 → skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   check if rest is a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   if yes, compute max_k.\n\n   if rest == s_candidate[max_k:] → valid.\n\nSo, integrating this into the code.\n\nAnother edge case: when the entire t is s + s, but no overlap. Then, it's not considered an error.\n\nLike t = 'abcdabcd', which is s='abcd' concatenated with s. So, in this case, the code would check m=4, s_candidate='abcd', rest='abcd'. Since rest is a suffix of s_candidate (it's the entire string), but max_k is 0, because the prefix function of 'abcd' is all zeros. So, rest must be s_candidate[0:] which is 'abcd', which it is. So, according to the code, it would return YES and s_candidate 'abcd'. But according to the problem statement, this is not considered an error. So, the code would mistakenly return YES.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, because when the overlap is zero, the resulting string is s + s, which is the concatenation without any error. So, according to the problem statement, this is not considered an error.\n\nSo, in the code, for m= len(s_candidate) = len(t)/2, when s_candidate is s, and rest is s, the code would pass the condition, but in reality, this is not an error.\n\nSo, how to avoid this?\n\nWe need to ensure that the resulting t is strictly shorter than 2*len(s_candidate). Because only when the two messages are merged, the resulting t is shorter than 2m.\n\nSo, in code, for each m, after checking the other conditions, also ensure that len(t) < 2*m.\n\nBecause len(t) = 2m -k, where k≥1 → len(t) ≤ 2m-1 < 2m.\n\nSo, in code, for each m:\n\n   if len(t) >= 2*m → continue.\n\nSo, adding this condition.\n\nSo, in the example where t is 'abcdabcd', len(t) is 8. For m=4, len(t) =8, 2*m is 8 → condition fails. So, the code would skip this m.\n\nThus, the code would not consider this case as a valid error.\n\nAnother test case: t is 'abcabcabc', len(t)=9.\n\nSuppose m=5: s_candidate is 'abcab', rest is 'cabc'. Check if rest is a suffix of s_candidate. 'cabc' is not a suffix of 'abcab' (ends with 'cab').\n\nAnother possible m: m=3: s_candidate is 'abc', rest is 'abcabc'. rest is not a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nAnother m: m=6: len(t) is 9. 2*m is 12. 9 < 12 → proceed.\n\ns_candidate is 'abcdef', rest is 'ghijk...' → no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test more examples.\n\nSo, the code needs to include the condition len(t) < 2*m.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor m in range(1, len(t)):\n\n    if len(t) >= 2*m:\n\n        continue\n\n    s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n    rest = t[m:]\n\n    if not s_candidate.endswith(rest):\n\n        continue\n\n    # compute max_k\n\n    pi = compute_prefix(s_candidate)\n\n    max_k = pi[-1]\n\n    if rest == s_candidate[max_k:]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nThis should handle the 'abcdabcd' case correctly.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 'tatbt' has len 5.\n\nWe need to check m from 1 to 4.\n\nFor m=2: s_candidate is 'ta', rest is 'tbt'.\n\nCheck if 'tbt' is a suffix of 'ta' → 'ta' ends with 'a', 'tbt' is longer, so no.\n\nFor m=3: s_candidate 'tat', rest 'bt'.\n\nCheck if 'bt' is a suffix of 'tat' → 'tat' ends with 'at', 'bt' is not.\n\nFor m=4: len(t) is 5. 2*4=8>5 → allowed.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatb', rest is 't'.\n\nCheck if 't' is a suffix of 'tatb' → yes.\n\nCompute max_k for 'tatb':\n\nThe string is 't','a','t','b'.\n\nCompute prefix function:\n\npi[0] = 0.\n\ni=1: compare s[1] (a) with s[0] (t): no match, pi[1]=0.\n\ni=2: s[2] is 't'. Compare with s[0] → match. So pi[2] = 1.\n\ni=3: s[3] is 'b'. Compare with s[1] (a): no. So, check pi[pi[2]-1] = pi[0]=0. Compare s[3] with s[0]: 'b' vs 't' → no. So pi[3]=0.\n\nSo max_k is 1.\n\nrest is 't' → s_candidate[1:] is 'atb' → 't' is not equal to 'atb' → condition not met.\n\nSo, this m=4 is not valid.\n\nOther m's:\n\nm=1: s_candidate 't', rest 'atbt'.\n\nCheck if 'atbt' is a suffix of 't' → no.\n\nm=5: len(t) is 5, 2*5=10>5 → skip.\n\nThus, no valid s_candidate, so output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'abababab' → len 8.\n\nSample output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nSo, m=6: s_candidate is 'ababab', rest is 'ab'.\n\nCheck if 'ab' is a suffix of 'ababab' → 'ababab' ends with 'ab' → yes.\n\nCompute max_k for 'ababab': \n\nThe string is 'a','b','a','b','a','b'.\n\nThe prefix function:\n\npi[0] =0.\n\ni=1: s[1] =b vs s[0]=a → no → pi[1]=0.\n\ni=2: s[2] =a. Compare with s[0]=a → match → pi[2] =1.\n\ni=3: s[3]=b. Compare with s[1]=b → match → pi[3]=2.\n\ni=4: s[4]=a. Compare with s[2]=a → match → pi[4]=3.\n\ni=5: s[5]=b. Compare with s[3]=b → match → pi[5]=4.\n\npi array is [0,0,1,2,3,4]. Max_k is 4.\n\nSo, rest is 'ab', and s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → yes.\n\nThus, it's a valid case.\n\nSo, the code would return 'YES' and 'ababab'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'acacacaca' → len 9.\n\nWe need to find m=5: s_candidate is 'acaca', rest is 'caca'.\n\nCheck if 'caca' is a suffix of 'acaca' → 'acaca' ends with 'caca' → yes.\n\nCompute max_k for 'acaca':\n\nThe string is 'a','c','a','c','a'.\n\npi[0]=0.\n\ni=1: 'c' vs 'a' → no → pi[1]=0.\n\ni=2: 'a' vs 'a' → yes → pi[2]=1.\n\ni=3: 'c' vs s[1] 'c' → yes → pi[3]=2.\n\ni=4: 'a' vs s[2] 'a' → yes → pi[4]=3.\n\npi array is [0,0,1,2,3]. Max_k is 3.\n\nSo, rest is 'caca' → s_candidate[3:] is 'ca' → 'ca' is not equal to 'caca' → condition fails.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 'YES\\nacaca'. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the string is 'acacacaca' → len 9. So, when m=5: s_candidate is 'acaca' (5 letters), rest is 'caca' (4 letters). So, 'acaca' ends with 'caca'? Let's see: 'acaca' is 'a c a c a'. The last 4 letters are 'c a c a' → 'caca' → yes.\n\nSo, in this case, max_k is 3. So, s_candidate[3:] is 'ca' → 'ca' is not equal to 'caca' → condition fails.\n\nBut according to the sample, it is a valid case.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to compute s_candidate and rest.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not require the maximum k, but any k that allows the rest to be a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBecause the error could have any possible k, not necessarily the maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach should be: for a given m, s_candidate is t[:m], rest is t[m:]. Check if rest is a suffix of s_candidate. Then, find any k (any possible length) such that s_candidate ends with a prefix of length k, and rest equals s_candidate[k:]. Then, the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut this would require checking all possible k for s_candidate.\n\nBut that's computationally expensive, but given that len(t) is up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each m:\n\n   s = t[:m]\n\n   rest = t[m:]\n\n   if rest is a suffix of s:\n\n       find the maximum k such that s ends with a prefix of length k (i.e., the maximum k is the maximum possible for s).\n\n       if rest equals s[k:], then it's valid.\n\nBut perhaps, for some k less than the maximum, it's also valid.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem requires that the two messages were merged, which implies that the maximum possible k was used.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the error could cause the messages to merge, but the exact k is determined by how much they overlapped. So, for the purpose of the problem, any possible k that allows the rest to be a suffix of s is acceptable.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the error could cause the messages to merge, regardless of the k. So, the resulting t could have any possible k, as long as the rest is a suffix of s.\n\nSo, in the sample 'acacacaca' (len 9), when m=5, s_candidate is 'acaca' (len 5), rest is 'caca' (len 4). Since 'caca' is a suffix of 'acaca', then regardless of the maximum k, the condition is satisfied. So, in this case, the code would find that m=5 is a valid split, and thus return 'acaca' as the possible s.\n\nBut according to the previous approach, the code only checks the maximum k. In this case, the maximum k is 3, but s_candidate[3:] is 'ca', which is not equal to 'caca'. So, the code would not accept this m, even though the rest is a suffix.\n\nSo, the initial approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of relying on the maximum k, for each m, check whether rest is a suffix of s_candidate. If it is, then any possible k (including non-maximum) that satisfies s_candidate ends with a prefix of k, and rest equals s_candidate[k:]. So, the code should check all possible k's for s_candidate, not just the maximum.\n\nBut that's computationally expensive, as for each m, it would have to iterate through all possible k's for s_candidate.\n\nBut considering that len(s_candidate) is up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each m:\n\n   s = t[:m]\n\n   rest = t[m:]\n\n   if rest is a suffix of s:\n\n       for k in range(1, len(s)):\n\n           if s ends with a prefix of length k:\n\n               if rest == s[k:]:\n\n                   return YES and s.\n\nThus, the code would look like:\n\nfor m in 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n    if len(t) >= 2*m → skip.\n\n    s = t[:m]\n\n    rest = t[m:]\n\n    if not s.endswith(rest):\n\n        continue\n\n    for k in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        # find if s ends with a prefix of length k.\n\n        # this can be checked via the prefix function.\n\n        # the maximum k is the last element of the prefix function.\n\n        # but perhaps any k up to the maximum is possible.\n\n        # so, for each possible k, check if s has a prefix of k that is also a suffix.\n\n        # to find all possible k, we can precompute the prefix function.\n\n        # then, for each possible k, if k is present in the prefix function.\n\n        # wait, perhaps it's easier to precompute all possible k's where s has a prefix of k that is also a suffix.\n\n        # So, for s, collect all possible k's.\n\n        # One way is to precompute the prefix function and then collect all possible k's.\n\n        # So, first compute the prefix function of s.\n\n        # Then, collect all k's where s has a prefix of length k that is also a suffix.\n\n        # So, for each position i in s, pi[i] is the length of the current border.\n\n        # So, all possible borders are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could be the result of an error in a network where two identical messages were merged. The error causes the two messages to overlap as much as possible at the end of the first and the start of the second.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The resulting string `t` must be formed by concatenating two identical messages `s` with a positive overlap. This means `t` should be `s` followed by a suffix of `s`.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible split point `m` in `t`, check if the substring `t[:m]` (let's call it `s_candidate`) can be concatenated with a suffix of itself to form `t`.\n3. **Check Suffix and Prefix Match**: For each candidate `s_candidate`, verify if the remaining part of `t` (after `m`) is a suffix of `s_candidate`. If it is, compute the maximum overlap using the prefix function and check if the remaining part matches the suffix starting from the maximum overlap.\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: Use the prefix function (from the KMP algorithm) to efficiently find the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each candidate `s_candidate`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_prefix(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    pi = [0] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        j = pi[i-1]\n        while j > 0 and s[i] != s[j]:\n            j = pi[j-1]\n        if s[i] == s[j]:\n            j += 1\n        pi[i] = j\n    return pi\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    t = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    if n < 2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    for m in range(1, n):\n        if len(t) >= 2 * m:\n            continue\n        \n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n        rest = t[m:]\n        \n        if not s_candidate.endswith(rest):\n            continue\n        \n        # Compute all possible k values where s_candidate has a border of length k\n        pi = compute_prefix(s_candidate)\n        max_k = pi[-1]\n        possible_ks = set()\n        for i in range(len(pi)):\n            possible_ks.add(pi[i])\n        \n        for k in possible_ks:\n            if k == 0:\n                continue\n            if rest == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                return\n    \n    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Function Calculation**: The `compute_prefix` function calculates the prefix function for a string, which helps in determining the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Splits**: For each possible split point `m`, check if the substring `t[:m]` can be concatenated with a suffix of itself to form `t`.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each candidate `s_candidate`, check if the remaining part of `t` is a valid suffix. If it is, use the prefix function to determine possible overlaps and verify if the remaining part matches the expected suffix after the overlap.\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid candidate is found, print \"YES\" and the candidate string.
