Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nLet me think: the initial sum is S = sum of the found cards. The target is 0, so the required sum from the additional cards is -S.\n\nEach additional card can add a value between -x and x. To reach the required sum with as few cards as possible, we should maximize each card's contribution. That means using the largest possible values in absolute terms.\n\nSo, for example, if the required sum is 5 and x is 3, then the minimal number of cards would be 2: one +3 and another +2.\n\nBut wait, the required sum could be negative. For instance, if the sum is -7 and x is 3, the minimal number is 3: -3, -3, -1.\n\nWait no, maybe not. Let's see: 3*(-3) is -9, which is less than -7. So perhaps it's better to take -3, -3, and +1: sum is -7. So yeah, that's 3 cards.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. The required sum from the additional cards is T = -S.\n3. We need to find the minimal k such that T can be expressed as a sum of k terms, each in [-x, x], and each term can be any integer within that range.\n\nHow do we find the minimal k?\n\nWell, the maximum possible contribution per card is x (if T is positive) or -x (if T is negative). Wait, no. For T positive, each card can contribute up to x towards T. So for T = t, the minimal k is ceil(t / x), but only if t is positive.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nIf T is positive:\n\nWe want as many x's as possible. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x).\n\nSimilarly, if T is negative, the minimal number is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, no. Because if T is negative, each card can contribute at most x towards T (since T is negative, adding x makes it more negative). Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, T is the required sum from the additional cards. So, for example, if T is 5, then each additional card can add up to x. So the minimal number is ceil(5/x).\n\nIf T is -5, then each additional card can subtract up to x, meaning each contributes -x. So the minimal number is ceil(5/x) again.\n\nWait, because if T is -5, each card can contribute -x, so after k cards, the sum is -k*x. We need this to be >= T (since T is negative). So to have -k*x <= T, because T is the required sum.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me rephrase:\n\nWe have T = sum of additional cards. So:\n\nsum_{i=1 to k} a_i = T.\n\nEach a_i is in [-x, x].\n\nWe need to find the smallest k such that T can be achieved.\n\nSo, the minimal k is the minimal integer satisfying |T| <= k * x.\n\nBecause each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). So |T| must be <= k * x.\n\nThus, k >= ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Then k is |T|/x.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, but let's test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1: T = 5, x=2.\n\nCeil(5/2) = 3. But 2*2=4 <5, so 3 cards: 2+2+1=5. Yes.\n\nAnother example: T=6, x=2. Ceil(6/2)=3. 2+2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Initial Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the initial sum.\n3. **Compute Minimum Additional Cards**: The minimum number of cards needed is determined by the absolute value of the required sum divided by the maximum allowed value on a card. This is because each additional card can contribute at most `x` towards reducing the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nrequired = -s\nabs_required = abs(required)\n\n# Calculate the minimal number of cards needed\nif abs_required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_cards = (abs_required + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of found cards `n` and the maximum value `x`.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n3. **Target Adjustment**: Determine the required sum from the additional cards to make the total sum zero.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Use integer division to find the smallest number of cards needed to achieve the required sum. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the required sum by `x` and rounding up to ensure we cover any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of additional cards using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the problem constraints.",
