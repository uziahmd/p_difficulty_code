In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a mentsu is. From the problem statement, a mentsu is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). So, for each possible way her current tiles can form a mentsu when adding some extra tiles, I need to find the minimal number needed.\n\nWait, but she has three tiles in her hand. So after drawing, she could have four, five, etc. But she only needs at least one mentsu in her hand after drawing. So my task is to check all possible ways she can add tiles to form a mentsu, and find the smallest number required.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I should consider all possible triplets and sequences that could be formed with the existing tiles plus some added ones, and compute the minimal draws needed.\n\nHmm, but considering all possibilities might be computationally intensive. Wait, but the input is only three tiles, so perhaps it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the three tiles.\n2. For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), check if the current tiles can contribute to it.\n3. Calculate how many tiles are missing from each possible mentsu.\n4. Find the minimal number of draws across all possible mentsu options.\n\nBut wait, how do I generate all possible mentsu? That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible mentsu, I can see what's the minimal number of tiles needed to complete it using the current tiles plus some new ones.\n\nSo let's think about each type of mentsu:\n\nFor koutsu: It's three identical tiles. So for each tile in the current hand, see if having two more of the same would make a triplet. The minimal draws would be 0 if already three, else 2 - (count in current).\n\nWait, no. Because in the current hand, she can have multiple copies. For example, if she has two '1m's, then she needs one more to form a triplet. So for each tile, compute how many are needed beyond the current count.\n\nSimilarly for shuntsu: It's a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, look for any triplet of consecutive numbers that can be formed by adding tiles.\n\nWait, but the current tiles may already have some parts of such a sequence.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), calculate how many tiles are missing in the current hand. The minimal number of additional tiles required is the maximum between the required for each possible mentsu.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to iterate through all possible mentsu candidates and compute the minimal draws needed for each, then pick the smallest among them.\n\nWait, no, because for each candidate, the required tiles are the number of tiles not present in the current hand. Then, the minimal required is the minimal number across all candidates.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given mentsu, you can have overlapping with existing tiles. So for each possible mentsu, compute how many tiles are needed to complete it. Then, the minimal number across all these is the answer.\n\nBut the problem is that the number of possible mentsu is quite large. Let's think about how many.\n\nFor triplets (koutsu):\n\nEach triplet is three identical tiles. There are 9 suits (but grouped into m, p, s). Wait, no, for each of the three suits, there are 9 possible triplets (each number 1-9). So total koutsu is 3 * 9 =27.\n\nFor sequences (shuntsu):\n\nEach sequence is three consecutive numbers in a suit. For each suit, the possible sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4,... up to 7-8-9. So 7 per suit, 3 suits: 21.\n\nSo total mentsu is 27 + 21 =48.\n\nSo for each of these 48 mentsu, I need to compute how many tiles are missing in the current hand, which is 3 minus the number of tiles in the current hand that belong to this mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Because each mentsu consists of exactly three specific tiles. For each mentsu, check how many of those tiles are present in the current hand. The number of required tiles to add is 3 minus the count.\n\nWait, no. Because the current hand is three tiles. For a given mentsu, say [1m,2m,3m], the current hand may have some of these. The number of tiles needed is 3 - count of how many of the mentsu's tiles are present in the current hand.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the current hand could have more than three tiles, but in our problem, she starts with three and adds some. Wait, no, wait: the initial hand is three, and she can draw any number of tiles, including duplicates. So the current hand plus drawn tiles must include all three tiles of some mentsu.\n\nWait, but for each mentsu, the number of tiles she needs to have in her hand is three. So the number of tiles she needs to add is 3 minus the number of tiles in the mentsu that are already present in her initial three.\n\nWait, no. Because she can have more than three tiles after adding, but she just needs to have at least three that form a mentsu. But since she can choose any tiles to add, the minimal number is determined by how many are missing in the mentsu.\n\nWait, perhaps yes. So for each mentsu, the number of tiles in the current hand that belong to it is c. So she needs to add (3 - c) tiles to have all three in her hand.\n\nBut wait, what if she has more than three tiles in the mentsu? Like, if she has four '1m's, but that's impossible because she can't have four in the initial hand. Oh right, she starts with three, and she can add any tiles, but the mentsu requires exactly three.\n\nWait, but the mentsu is a subset of three tiles. So even if she has more, as long as she has all three, it's fine.\n\nSo for each mentsu, the required tiles to add is max(0, 3 - current count of mentsu tiles in her hand).\n\nWait, no. Because the current hand is three, but the mentsu is three distinct tiles. So, for example, if the current hand has two of the mentsu's tiles, then she needs one more. If she has all three, then she needs zero.\n\nSo for each mentsu, we calculate how many of its tiles are present in the current hand. The minimal number of tiles to add is 3 - count.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because the current hand has three tiles, which may have other tiles. So for a particular mentsu, the count is how many of its three tiles are present in the current hand.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each mentsu (koutsu and shuntsu), calculate how many of its tiles are present in the current hand. Let this be cnt.\n\n2. The required tiles to add is 3 - cnt. But wait, since the current hand has three tiles, but a mentsu requires three. So for example, if the current hand has all three tiles of a mentsu, then required is zero.\n\n3. For each mentsu, the required is max(0, 3 - cnt).\n\nThen, the minimal required across all mentsu is the answer.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for a given mentsu, the required is 3 - cnt, but she can have other tiles in her hand as well. But as long as the mentsu is present, that's sufficient.\n\nSo for example, if the current hand is [1m, 1m, 2m], and the mentsu is 1m, 1m, 1m, then the count is 2 (since current hand has two 1ms). So required is 1.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Enumerate all possible mentsu (koutsu and shuntsu).\n\n- For each mentsu, count how many of its three tiles are present in the current hand.\n\n- Compute required tiles as max(0, 3 - cnt).\n\n- Find the minimal required across all mentsu.\n\n- Output the minimal required.\n\nWait, but what about if the same tile appears multiple times in the mentsu? For example, a koutsu is three of the same. So in that case, if the current hand has two, then required is one.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the next step is to model the current hand and the mentsu sets.\n\nSo how do I represent the current hand? As a set of tiles, perhaps, but also track the count for each tile.\n\nWait, no. Because for koutsu, the count matters. For example, if a tile is present once, but the mentsu is three of them, then for that mentsu, the count is one, requiring two more.\n\nSo perhaps, for each tile in the current hand, we can count their frequency. Because when a mentsu is a triplet, the count is important.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to create a frequency dictionary that maps each tile to the number of times it appears in the current hand.\n\nFor example, for the input:\n\n['1s', '2s', '3s'], the frequency is {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}.\n\nAnother example: ['1m','1m','2m'] will have '1m':2, '2m':1.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, when checking, we need to see for each of the three tiles in the mentsu, whether they exist in the current hand and sum their counts.\n\nWait, no. Because for a koutsu, all three tiles must be the same. So for the triplet [x, x, x], we need to see how many x's are present. So the count is the frequency of x in the current hand.\n\nFor a shuntsu, the mentsu consists of three different tiles, in sequence. So for each of the three, we need to see if it exists in the current hand.\n\nSo for each mentsu, we can process it as follows:\n\nCase 1: koutsu.\n\nThe mentsu is [a, a, a]. So the count is the frequency of a in the current hand. So required is max(0, 3 - frequency[a]).\n\nCase 2: shuntsu.\n\nThe mentsu is [x, x+1, x+2] in the same suit. So for each of x, x+1, x+2, we check if they are present in the current hand. The count is the sum of their frequencies (but wait, no: for a shuntsu, each tile must be present at least once. So for each of the three tiles, if it's present, add 1; else 0. So the total count is sum of 1 for each tile present.\n\nWait, no. Because in a shuntsu, the three tiles must all be present. So for each of x, x+1, x+2, if it's present in the current hand, it contributes 1 to the count. So the count is the number of tiles in the shuntsu that are present in the current hand.\n\nSo for a shuntsu, the count is the number of tiles in {x, x+1, x+2} that are present in the current hand.\n\nThus, for a shuntsu, required tiles is 3 - count.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, regardless of type, the required is 3 minus the count of how many of its three tiles are present in the current hand.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Parse the current hand into a frequency dictionary.\n\n2. Enumerate all possible mentsu (both types).\n\n3. For each mentsu, count how many of its three tiles are present in the current hand (sum 1 for each present, regardless of frequency >=1).\n\n   - For koutsu: all three tiles are same, so count is 1 if the tile exists, else 0.\n\n   - For shuntsu: count is the number of x, x+1, x+2 present in the current hand.\n\n4. For each mentsu, required is max(0, 3 - count).\n\n5. Find the minimal required among all mentsu.\n\n6. Output that minimal required.\n\nWait, but for koutsu, the count is 1 if the tile exists, else 0. Because a koutsu requires three of the same tile. So if the current hand has one, then count is 1.\n\nSo for example:\n\nCurrent hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor the koutsu [1m,1m,1m], count is 2 (because there are two 1m's in the current hand). So required is 3-2=1.\n\nBut for another koutsu, like [2m,2m,2m], the count is 1 (only one 2m in current hand), so required is 2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the challenge is to generate all possible mentsu.\n\nSo how to generate all possible koutsu and shuntsu.\n\nFirst, for koutsu:\n\nEach suit has 9 possible numbers. For each number, create a triplet of three same tiles.\n\nSo for m suit:\n\nNumbers 1-9: for each n, create ('n' + 'm') *3.\n\nSame for p and s.\n\nSo that's 3*9=27 koutsu.\n\nNext, for shuntsu:\n\nEach suit has 7 possible sequences.\n\nFor suit 'm':\n\n1,2,3\n\n2,3,4\n\n...\n\n7,8,9.\n\nEach is a triplet.\n\nSo for each of the three suits, we have 7 shuntsu.\n\nTotal 3*7=21 shuntsu.\n\nSo total mentsu is 27+21=48.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the three tiles. For each, parse into a list, e.g., ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nCreate a frequency dictionary: for each tile, count how many times it appears.\n\nThen, generate all 48 mentsu, and for each, compute how many tiles are present in the current hand.\n\nCompute required for each, find the minimum.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the input line, split into three strings.\n\ncurrent_hand = list of the three strings.\n\nfrequency = {}\nfor tile in current_hand:\n    frequency[tile] = frequency.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\nThen, generate all mentsu.\n\nWe'll need functions to generate all possible mentsu.\n\nLet's think about generating all possible mentsu:\n\nFirst, for koutsu:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for num in 1..9:\n\n        tile = str(num) + suit\n\n        mentsu = [tile, tile, tile]\n\n        add to list.\n\nSo for each, mentsu is a list of three same tiles.\n\nSecond, for shuntsu:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start_num in 1..7:\n\n        num1 = start_num\n\n        num2 = start_num +1\n\n        num3 = start_num +2\n\n        tiles = [str(num1)+suit, str(num2)+suit, str(num3)+suit]\n\n        add to list.\n\nSo for each, the mentsu is three distinct tiles in sequence.\n\nOnce all mentsu are generated, for each, compute the count.\n\nHow to compute the count for a mentsu:\n\nif it's a koutsu: check if the single tile is in frequency. If yes, count is 1, else 0.\n\nif it's a shuntsu: count how many of the three tiles are present in frequency (i.e., their key exists).\n\nThen, required = 3 - count.\n\nBut wait, the count can't exceed 3, so 3 - count is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmentus = []\n\n# Generate all koutsu\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        mentus.append([tile, tile, tile])\n\n# Generate all shuntsu\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 8):  # since 1,2,3 up to 7,8,9\n        tiles = [\n            f\"{start}{suit}\",\n            f\"{start+1}{suit}\",\n            f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n        ]\n        mentus.append(tiles)\n\nOnce the mentus are generated, for each, compute the count.\n\nWait, but each mentsu is a list of three tiles. For each mentsu in mentus:\n\nif the first element is same as the others (koutsu), then count is 1 if present.\n\nelse (shuntsu), count is the number of tiles in the list that are present in frequency.\n\nSo, for each mentsu:\n\ntiles = mentsu\n\nif len(set(tiles)) == 1:  # koutsu\n    count = 1 if tiles[0] in frequency else 0\nelse:\n    count = 0\n    for t in tiles:\n        if t in frequency:\n            count +=1\n\nrequired = 3 - count\n\nmentu_required.append(required)\n\nWait, but what if the mentsu is a triplet but all three tiles are present in the current hand? Then required is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce all required are computed, find the minimal value.\n\nBut wait, what if the minimal required is zero? That's correct, because she already has a mentsu.\n\nSo the code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nWait, but what about the order of the tiles in the mentsu? No, because the mentsu is considered as a set of three tiles, regardless of order.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: ['1s 2s 3s']\n\nWait, wait, in the input, each string is like '1s', '2s', etc. So in code, the current_hand is ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nFrequency is {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}.\n\nGenerate all mentsu.\n\nLooking for shuntsu in 's' suit:\n\nStart=1: 1s,2s,3s. All present. Count is 3. Required is 0.\n\nOther shuntsu in 's' will have higher starts, but for start=2, it's 2,3,4. Only 2s and 3s present, so count is 2, required is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other mentsu, the minimal required is zero.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: ['9m 9m 9m']\n\nAll three tiles are '9m'. So frequency is {'9m':3}.\n\nFor the koutsu [9m,9m,9m], count is 3. Required is 0.\n\nFor any other mentsu, it's either a triplet (like 8m) which requires 3, or a shuntsu which would require 3 (as none are present except 9m). So the minimal is 0.\n\nSample output is 0.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput: ['3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo the tiles are '3p', '9m', '2p'.\n\nSo frequency is {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}.\n\nNow, for shuntsu in 'p' suit.\n\nLooking for sequences:\n\nPossible sequences are:\n\n1p,2p,3p → check if all three are present. Current hand has 3p and 2p. So count is 2. Required is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 2p,3p,4p: current has 2p and 3p. Count is 2, required is 1.\n\nWhat about other shuntsu:\n\nIn 'p' suit, for example, 4p,5p,6p: none present. So required is 3.\n\nIn 'm' suit, shuntsu like 1m,2m,3m: none present. So required is 3.\n\nIn 's' suit: same.\n\nSo the minimal required is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, what about cases where the current hand has multiple tiles that contribute to a mentsu.\n\nE.g., current hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor the koutsu '1m' triplet: count is 2 (two '1m's). Required is 1.\n\nFor the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 2 (have 1m and 2m). Required is 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nAnother example: current hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'].\n\nThis is a shuntsu, so required is zero.\n\nAnother example: current hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nShuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 2 (1m and 2m). So required is 1.\n\nKoutsu 1m: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, what about handling the case where the current hand has more than one tile contributing to a mentsu.\n\nLike, current hand is ['1m', '1m', '1m']: required is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: current hand is empty? No, the problem states that she has three tiles.\n\nWait, no, the input is always three tiles.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- How to represent the mentsu correctly.\n\n- Making sure that for shuntsu, the numbers are consecutive.\n\nImplementing this in code.\n\nNow, in Python:\n\nWe can read the input as a list of three strings.\n\nThen, create the frequency dictionary.\n\nGenerate all mentsu as described.\n\nFor each mentsu, compute the required.\n\nFind the minimal required.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into three parts.\n\ncurrent_hand = input().split()\n\nfrequency = {}\nfor tile in current_hand:\n    frequency[tile] = frequency.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\nGenerate all mentsu:\n\nmentus = []\n\n# Koutsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        mentus.append( [tile]*3 )\n\n# Shuntsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 8):\n        tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n        mentus.append(tiles)\n\nCompute required for each mentsu:\n\nmin_draws = 3  # worst case, add 3 tiles (but probably not needed)\nfor mentsu in mentus:\n    if len(set(mentsu)) == 1:  # koutsu\n        tile = mentsu[0]\n        count = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n        required = max(0, 3 - count)\n    else:  # shuntsu\n        count = 0\n        for t in mentsu:\n            if t in frequency:\n                count +=1\n        required = max(0, 3 - count)\n    if required < min_draws:\n        min_draws = required\n\nprint(min_draws)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for koutsu, the count is the number of times the tile appears in the current hand. For example, if current hand has two '1m's, then count is 2, required is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nSample 3:\n\nCurrent hand is ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nShuntsu in 'p' for start=1: '1p', '2p', '3p'.\n\nCheck if '1p' is in frequency: no. '2p' is present. '3p' is present.\n\nCount is 2. Required is 1.\n\nAnother mentsu: shuntsu in 'p' for start=2: '2p', '3p', '4p'.\n\n'2p' and '3p' present. '4p' not present.\n\nCount is 2. Required is 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: current hand is ['1m', '2m', '1m'].\n\nFor the koutsu '1m' ×3: count is 2. Required is 1.\n\nShuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 2 (1m and 2m present). Required is 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: current hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nKoutsu '1m' → count 2 → required 1.\n\nShuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count 2 → required 1.\n\nShuntsu 2m,3m,4m: count 1 → required 2.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: current hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'].\n\nShuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count 3 → required 0.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: current hand is ['1m', '4m', '5m'].\n\nShuntsu 4m,5m,6m: count 2 (4m and5m). required 1.\n\nShuntsu 3m,4m,5m: count 2 (4m and5m). required 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the current hand has four tiles? No, because the problem says she has three tiles initially.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. A mentsu is formed by three identical tiles (koutsu) or three consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit (shuntsu).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the three tiles from the input and store them in a list.\n2. **Frequency Dictionary**: Create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each tile in the current hand.\n3. **Generate Mentsu**: Enumerate all possible mentsu, which includes both koutsu and shuntsu.\n4. **Calculate Requirements**: For each mentsu, calculate how many additional tiles are needed to complete it using the current hand.\n5. **Find Minimum Draws**: Determine the minimum number of tiles needed across all possible mentsu.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input\ncurrent_hand = input().split()\n\n# Create frequency dictionary for each tile\nfrequency = {}\nfor tile in current_hand:\n    frequency[tile] = frequency.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\n# Generate all possible mentsu\nmentus = []\n\n# Add all koutsu (triplets)\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        mentus.append([f\"{num}{suit}\", f\"{num}{suit}\", f\"{num}{suit}\"])\n\n# Add all shuntsu (sequences)\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 8):\n        mentus.append([\n            f\"{start}{suit}\",\n            f\"{start+1}{suit}\",\n            f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n        ])\n\n# Calculate the minimal required draws\nmin_draws = 3  # Initialize with the worst case scenario\n\nfor mentsu in mentus:\n    if len(set(mentsu)) == 1:  # Check if it's a koutsu\n        tile = mentsu[0]\n        count = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n        required = max(0, 3 - count)\n    else:  # It's a shuntsu\n        count = 0\n        for t in mentsu:\n            if t in frequency:\n                count += 1\n        required = max(0, 3 - count)\n    \n    if required < min_draws:\n        min_draws = required\n\nprint(min_draws)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line split into three strings representing the tiles.\n2. **Frequency Dictionary**: This dictionary helps track how many times each tile appears in the current hand.\n3. **Generating Mentsu**: We generate all possible koutsu and shuntsu. Koutsu are triplets of the same tile, while shuntsu are sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n4. **Calculating Requirements**: For each mentsu, we check how many of its tiles are already present in the current hand. The number of additional tiles needed is calculated as 3 minus the count of present tiles.\n5. **Finding Minimum Draws**: We iterate through all possible mentsu and keep track of the minimum number of draws required to form any mentsu.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and find the optimal solution with minimal computational effort.",
