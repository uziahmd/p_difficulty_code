He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I have to output the count of such numbers and the numbers themselves in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. But wait, there's also the case for 25, 125, etc., which contribute extra 5s.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of trailing zeros z(n) is the sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division yields zero.\n\nThe first step is to find all n such that z(n) = m. So, for each m, I need to find the possible n values.\n\nBut how do I find all such n? Since z(n) increases as n increases, but sometimes it can increase by more than one when n crosses a multiple of 5, 25, etc.\n\nFor example, when n is 24, z(24) is 4 (since 24/5=4). When n is 25, z(25) becomes 6 because 25/5 is 5 and 25/25 is 1, total 6. So, from 24 to 25, the number of zeros jumps by 2. So, for m=5, there might be a range of n's where z(n) equals 5.\n\nWait, let me think about the example given. In the sample input, m=5. The output is 5,6,7,8,9. So, for n=5, z(5)=1; n=6, z=1; n=7, z=1; n=8, z=1; n=9, z=1; then n=10, z=2. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, wait, the sample input was ['1', '5'], so maybe the example is for m=1 and m=5.\n\nWait, looking back: in the sample input, the output shows two lines. The first line is for m=1, which outputs 5, meaning only n=5 has exactly 1 trailing zero. Then, the second line is for m=5, which has 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but wait, z(5) is 1, so that can't be. Oh, maybe the sample input is m=5 and m=1? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is m=1 and m=5, and the output is two lines. Let me check:\n\nIn the sample input, the list is ['1', '5']. So the first m is 1, outputting the count as 1 (only n=5), and the second m is 5, outputting 5 numbers.\n\nSo, for m=5, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Hmm, but z(5) is 1, z(6) is 1, up to z(9) is 1. Then z(10) is 2. So wait, how does m=5 fit into that? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sample. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, for m=1, the output is 5, which means only n=5 has exactly 1 trailing zero. Because 5! is 120, which has one trailing zero. 6! is 720, which also has one. Wait, no: 6! is 720, which has one trailing zero. 7! is 5040, which has one. 8! is 40320, one. 9! is 362880, one. Then 10! is 3628800, which has two.\n\nWait, that's why for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9—so five numbers. So the sample output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nAh, okay, I see now. So for m=1, the count is 5, and the numbers are 5-9. For m=5, it's a different case.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is [1,5], so the first line is m=1, outputting 5 numbers. The second line is m=5, and the output is 0. So for m=5, there are zero numbers.\n\nWait, that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is essentially determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This includes contributions from higher powers of 5 (25, 125, etc.).\n\n2. **Function to Count Trailing Zeros**: We can define a helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` that calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until the division yields zero.\n\n3. **Finding Valid \\( n \\) Values**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find all \\( n \\) such that \\( count\\_trailing\\_zeros(n) = m \\). Since \\( count\\_trailing\\_zeros(n) \\) is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count equals \\( m \\). Then, we check the range around this \\( n \\) to find all valid values.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Binary search helps in quickly narrowing down the possible values of \\( n \\) that could yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Once we find the smallest \\( n \\) for which the count is \\( m \\), we can check subsequent values to see if they also yield \\( m \\) trailing zeros until the count increases beyond \\( m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n(m):\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m  # Initial bounds\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    if left > 5*m:\n        return None\n    if count_trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return None\n    # Now find all n's such that count is m\n    result = []\n    current = left\n    while True:\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(current)\n        if z != m:\n            break\n        result.append(current)\n        current += 1\n        if current > 5 * m:  # Prevents infinite loop in case of edge cases\n            break\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_list = input_line.split()\n    m = int(m_list[0])\n    if len(m_list) == 1:\n        print(len(find_n(m)))\n    else:\n        for i in range(1, len(m_list)):\n            target_m = int(m_list[i])\n            ns = find_n(target_m)\n            if ns is None:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                print(len(ns))\n                if ns:\n                    print(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function `count_trailing_zeros`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from each power of 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search in `find_n`**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( count\\_trailing\\_zeros(n) = m \\). It then checks subsequent values to collect all \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\n3. **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each \\( m \\), and prints the results. For each \\( m \\), it either finds the valid \\( n \\) values or determines that there are none.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that we find all valid \\( n \\) values for each \\( m \\) in an optimal manner.",
