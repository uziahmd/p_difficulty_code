Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then, he gets n queries, each of which is a substitution: replace all occurrences of a digit di with a string ti. The order of the queries matters because each subsequent query operates on the result of the previous ones.\n\nMy goal is to process all these queries in order and then compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the substitutions efficiently? Because the string can be up to 105 characters, and each substitution can change the string length a lot. Doing this naively by replacing each character step by step might be manageable since the maximum steps are 105, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for each query, I need to replace every occurrence of 'di' in the current string with 'ti'. So for example, if the string is '123123' and the query is '2→00', it becomes '10031003'.\n\nBut if I process each query one by one, modifying the string each time, that should work. Since the initial string is up to 105 characters, and each substitution could expand or contract it, but with n up to 105, the total operations would be manageable.\n\nHowever, after all substitutions, I need to compute the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But wait, the resulting string can be very long. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, the length could grow exponentially. But since the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is 105, the maximum possible length after all substitutions is manageable.\n\nWait, the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is up to 105. So for each query, the replacement string ti has a length that contributes to the overall string length. So the maximum possible string length after all substitutions is s_length + sum(ti_lengths). Since s is up to 105, and sum of ti is 105, the total can be up to 210. That's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Read each query and process them in order.\n3. For each query, replace all instances of di in the current string with ti.\n4. After all queries, compute the numerical value of the resulting string mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how to compute the numerical value mod 1e9+7 efficiently? Because the string can be up to 210 characters, which is not too bad. We can process each character, building up the number mod 1e9+7 as we go.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n- Process each substitution query in order, modifying the string.\n- Once all substitutions are done, calculate the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the main challenge is handling the substitutions correctly, especially since each substitution can be processed in any order but must be applied sequentially.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. I'll represent the string as a list or a string. Since strings are immutable in Python, using a list might be more efficient for multiple substitutions.\n\nWait, but each substitution replaces a specific single character (di) with a potentially longer string (ti). So for each substitution, I need to iterate through the current string and replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nWait, but that's correct. For example, if the current string is '222', and the substitution is '2→0', the new string becomes '000'.\n\nBut the substitution is per query: each query specifies di and ti, and you replace all di's in the current string with ti.\n\nSo, for each query, I need to process the current string and replace all di's with ti's.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nIn Python, strings are immutable, so for each substitution, I have to create a new string. So for each substitution, I can loop through the current string, and for each character, if it's equal to di, append ti to the new string; else, append the character.\n\nBut wait, that approach may not work if ti contains the same di again. Because during the replacement, when you're processing the string, the original di's are being replaced, so any further di's in ti will not be processed until the entire substitution is done.\n\nWait, no. Because during a substitution, the di is only replaced once. So for example, if the substitution is 'a→b', and the current string is 'aabba', then the substitution will replace all 'a's with 'b's, resulting in 'bbbb'.\n\nBut what if the substitution is 'a→ab'? Then each 'a' is replaced by 'ab', so the string 'aaa' becomes 'ababab'.\n\nSo, in terms of processing, for each substitution, I must scan the string, and for each character, if it's di, add ti to the new string. Otherwise, add the character itself.\n\nThis way, any di in ti is treated as part of the replacement, but they won't be processed in the same substitution step. They will only be processed in future substitutions if there's another query that targets them.\n\nSo, for each substitution, the steps are:\n\n- For each character in the current string:\n   - if the character is di, append ti\n   - else, append the character\n\nSo, for the initial string, let's say it's 's'.\n\nThen, for each query, we perform the above substitution.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7? Because the string can be up to 210 characters, which is manageable.\n\nWe can compute the number as follows:\n\nInitialize result = 0.\n\nFor each character in the resulting string:\n\n   result = (result * 10 + int(char)) % MOD.\n\nWhere MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nRead the input:\n\n- Read the initial string s from input. Wait, but the input format is a bit tricky. The first line is s, but it's given as a string. The second line is n, followed by n lines of queries.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, no, that's probably not the actual input. It's presented as a list of four elements, perhaps representing the four lines of input. Or maybe it's a representation of the input reading.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is s.\n\nThe second line is n.\n\nThe next n lines are the queries.\n\nEach query is a string like \"di->ti\".\n\nSo, in code, I need to read s, then n, then read n lines, each of which is a query.\n\nIn Python, I can read from stdin, perhaps using sys.stdin.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nRead s = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut wait, sometimes, the input can have leading or trailing spaces, but in the problem statement, the queries are written as \"di->ti\". So each query is a string that starts with a digit, followed by ->, then the replacement string.\n\nSo, in the code, for each query, split it into di and ti.\n\nFor example, for a query_str, split on \"->\" to get di and ti.\n\nSo:\n\nfor query in queries:\n\n    parts = query.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the main loop:\n\ncurrent_string = s\n\nfor each query in queries:\n\n    di, ti = split the query into two parts.\n\n    # Now, replace all occurrences of di in current_string with ti.\n\n    new_string = ''\n\n    for c in current_string:\n\n        if c == di:\n\n            new_string += ti\n\n        else:\n\n            new_string += c\n\n    current_string = new_string\n\nWait, but what if di is a multi-character string? No, according to the problem statement, each query has di as exactly one digit.\n\nYes, so di is a single character.\n\nSo, after processing all queries, compute the number.\n\nCompute the numerical value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut the string may be empty. In that case, the result is 0.\n\nElse, process each character, updating the result.\n\nSo, code:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nresult = 0\n\nfor c in current_string:\n\n    result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % mod\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros?\n\nThe problem says that when representing s as a decimal number, ignore leading zeros. Also, if s is empty, it's considered zero.\n\nWait, so for example, if the resulting string is '000123', we treat it as 123, so the numerical value is 123, not 000123.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to ignore leading zeros. So the numerical value is computed as the integer represented by the string, ignoring leading zeros.\n\nBut how does that affect the modulo computation?\n\nBecause, for example, '000123' is 123, which mod 1e9+7 is 123.\n\nSimilarly, '0123' is 123, mod is 123.\n\nSo, in the code, when computing the result, it's better to ignore leading zeros before computing the number.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Because if the string is '0000', then the numerical value is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- If the string is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, strip leading zeros, and if the result is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute the integer value of the stripped string, then mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, for large strings, stripping leading zeros and then computing the integer is impossible, as it's a huge number.\n\nSo, we need an efficient way to compute the mod without actually building the entire number.\n\nHmm, right. So, the approach to compute the number mod 1e9+7 while considering leading zeros.\n\nWait, but leading zeros are insignificant in the numerical value. So, for the string '00123', the numerical value is 123. So, when processing the string, leading zeros can be skipped except when the entire string is zero.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n- Iterate through the string, skipping leading zeros.\n\n- Once we hit a non-zero character, we start processing the number.\n\n- If all are zeros, the result is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(current_string) ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    num_str = current_string.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not num_str:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        mod_val = 0\n\n        for c in num_str:\n\n            mod_val = (mod_val *10 + int(c)) % mod\n\n        print(mod_val)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first query is '123123\\n1\\n2->00'\n\nWait, no, the sample input isn't clear, but perhaps the first line is '123123', then n=1, and the query is '2->00'.\n\nSo, initial s is '123123'.\n\nAfter the substitution, replace '2's with '00'.\n\nSo, '123123' becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, for the next query, perhaps it's '3->', which replaces '3's with empty string. So '10031003' becomes '10000003'? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the string is '10031003'. Replacing '3's with empty.\n\nLooking at each character:\n\n1 → 1\n\n0 → 0\n\n0 →0\n\n3 → replace with nothing, so skip.\n\n1 →1\n\n0 →0\n\n0 →0\n\n3 → skip.\n\nSo, the resulting string is '10000000' ?\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nOriginal string after first substitution: '10031003'.\n\nProcessing the substitution of '3' → empty.\n\nEach '3' is removed.\n\nSo:\n\nCharacters:\n\n1 → remains.\n\n0 → remains.\n\n0 → remains.\n\n3 → removed.\n\n1 → remains.\n\n0 → remains.\n\n0 → remains.\n\n3 → removed.\n\nSo the resulting string is '1000000'.\n\nWait, but the sample output shows the third query leading to '777', so perhaps the sample is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the third sample in the note.\n\nIn the note, the third sample has input:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo initial string is '222'.\n\nFirst substitution: 2→0 → '000'.\n\nSecond substitution: 0→7 → replace all 0s with 7 → '777'.\n\nWhich gives a numerical value of 777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code needs to process substitutions correctly.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the initial string is '1234', and a substitution '1→9', '2→8', '3→7', '4→6'.\n\nResulting string is '9876'.\n\nSo, the code should correctly apply each substitution.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures. Since each substitution can cause the string to change, and each substitution is done step by step, the code should handle this.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n queries, each as a string, split into di and ti.\n\nFor each query, process the substitution:\n\nnew_string = ''\n\nfor each character in current_string:\n\n   if c == di:\n\n      new_string += ti\n\n   else:\n\n      new_string += c\n\ncurrent_string = new_string\n\nAfter all substitutions, process the current string to compute the numerical value.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ncurrent = s\n\nfor query in queries:\n\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n\n    new_str = []\n\n    for c in current:\n\n        if c == di:\n\n            new_str.append(ti)\n\n        else:\n\n            new_str.append(c)\n\n    current = ''.join(new_str)\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nif not current:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    stripped = current.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not stripped:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        res = 0\n\n        for ch in stripped:\n\n            res = (res *10 + int(ch)) % mod\n\n        print(res)\n\nWait, but what if the current string is empty after all substitutions? Like, all substitutions removed all characters. Then, the result is 0.\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nTesting the third sample:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nProcess:\n\nInitial current is '222'.\n\nFirst query: di='2', ti='0'.\n\nReplace each '2' with '0' → '000'.\n\nSecond query: di='0', ti='7'.\n\nEach '0' is replaced with '7' → '777'.\n\nStripped is '777', which is 777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: initial string is '0', and a substitution '0→7'.\n\nAfter substitution, current is '7' → 7 mod is 7.\n\nAnother case: initial string is '0000', and substitution '0→00'.\n\nAfter substitution, current becomes '00000000' → 0 mod is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: initial string is '1', n=0.\n\nNo substitutions, so the result is 1.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nWhat about when the substitution is for a digit that doesn't exist in the current string? Then, nothing changes.\n\nLike, substitution '5→00' when current is '1234' → no change.\n\nSo, the code handles that.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input provided in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem's sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\nSo, the initial string is '123123'.\n\nAfter substitution of '2'→'00', it becomes '10031003'.\n\nWhich is 10031003 → 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut the sample output is '10031003' → but that's just the string; the actual numerical value is 10031003, which mod is 10031003.\n\nBut the sample output shows the string after substitution as '10031003'.\n\nWait, no, the sample output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is not correctly represented here. Or perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first query is '2->00' on '123123' → becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->' on '10031003' → which replaces '3's with empty. So '10031003' becomes '10000000' (since the '3's are replaced by empty).\n\nBut the sample output for the second query is '1212'.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps the sample input is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns is '123123', n is 1, and the query is '3->'.\n\nSo, initial s is '123123' → after substitution, '1212'.\n\nSo, the output is 1212, mod is 1212.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nIn any case, the code seems correct.\n\nI think this approach will work.\n",
