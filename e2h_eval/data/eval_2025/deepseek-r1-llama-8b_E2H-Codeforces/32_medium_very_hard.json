    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element we can remove, we calculate the instability of the remaining array and then choose the smallest among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, so a brute-force approach where we try removing each element and compute max and min each time would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about what affects the instability when we remove an element. The instability depends on the current max and min of the array. When we remove an element, the new max could be lower than the old max, or the new min could be higher than the old min. But sometimes, it might not change at all.\n\nWait, but the initial array has a certain max and min. If the element we remove is either the current max or the current min, removing it could potentially reduce the instability. For example, if the array is [1,3,7], removing 7 reduces the max to 3, so the instability becomes 3-1=2 instead of 6.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal choice is to consider removing either the current max or min. Because removing any other element may not change the max or min, thus not helping to reduce the instability.\n\nWait, let's test this idea with some examples.\n\nTake the sample input:\nFirst case: [1,3,3,7]. Current max is 7, min is 1. Removing 7 gives us [1,3,3], with max 3 and min 1, instability 2. Alternatively, if we remove 1, the new array is [3,3,7], instability 4 (7-3). Or if we remove 3, the array remains [1,3,7], same as original, so instability 6. So yes, the best is to remove 7, giving 2.\n\nSecond sample: [1,100000]. Removing 1 leaves [100000], which has 0 instability. Same with removing 100000. So the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5]. No matter which element we remove, the array remains [5,5], instability is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nWhat about [2,5,3,7,4,6]. The current max is 7, min is 2. If we remove 7, the new array is [2,5,3,4,6]. Max is 6, min is 2. Instability is 4. If we remove 2, the new array is [5,3,7,4,6], max 7, min 3. So instability is 4. If we remove another element, say 5, the array is [2,3,7,4,6]. Max 7, min 2, instability 5. So the best is to remove either 7 or 2, giving 4 or 4? Wait, no, because when you remove 2, the min becomes 3, max is 7, so 7-3=4. When you remove 7, the max becomes 6, min 2, 6-2=4. So same result.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a scenario where the optimal is not to remove the current max or min. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 4, 5, 6]. Current max is 6, min 1. If we remove 6, the new array is [1,4,5], max 5, min 1 → instability 4. If we remove 1, new array is [4,5,6] → max 6, min 4 → instability 2. Oh! So in this case, removing the min gives a better result than removing the max.\n\nSo the initial idea of just considering removing the current max or min is incorrect because sometimes removing the min leads to a better result.\n\nWait, wait. That changes things. So we can't just consider the current max and min. We have to check all possibilities where removing any element could possibly affect the max or min.\n\nBut how can we do this efficiently?\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to find for each element, the next possible max and min when it's removed. But calculating that directly would be O(n) per element, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute the global max and min, but also find the second maximum and second minimum. Then, when we remove an element, the new max could be the second maximum, and the new min could be the second minimum, but only if that element was the max or min.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let's formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- current_max = max(a)\n- current_min = min(a)\n- count_max = number of times current_max appears\n- count_min = number of times current_min appears\n\nIf we remove an element that is the current_max, then the new max will be the next highest element, which is the second_max. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the current_min, the new min will be the next lowest element, which is the second_min.\n\nSo for each candidate element to remove:\n\nCase 1: The element is the current_max.\n\nIn this case, the new max is the second_max, and the min remains current_min. So instability is (second_max - current_min).\n\nBut wait, if there are multiple current_max elements, like if the array is [3,3,3], then even if we remove one 3, the max remains 3. So in that case, the new max is still 3, so the min is the same as before.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute current_max, current_min, second_max, second_min, count_max, count_min.\n\n2. For each element in the array, determine whether removing it affects the max or the min.\n\nWait, but the element can be either the current_max, current_min, or neither.\n\nSo, for each element x in a:\n\n- if x == current_max:\n   - if count_max > 1: the new max is current_max (since others remain)\n   - else: the new max is second_max\n- if x == current_min:\n   - if count_min > 1: the new min is current_min (others remain)\n   - else: the new min is second_min\n- else:\n   - the new max is current_max, new min is current_min\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. For example, if the element is not the max or min, but its removal doesn't affect the max or min. So, for example, in [1, 3, 5, 7], removing 3: the max is still 7, min is 1. So the instability remains the same as the original.\n\nSo the idea is that for each element x, the new instability after removing x depends on whether x was the max, and whether it's the only max, or similar for min.\n\nSo perhaps we can precompute:\n\n- the list of elements that are the current max, and how many times they occur.\n- similarly for the current min.\n\nThen, for each x in the array:\n\nIf x is the current_max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n       new_max = current_max\n   else:\n       new_max = second_max\n\nIf x is the current_min:\n\n   if count_min > 1:\n       new_min = current_min\n   else:\n       new_min = second_min\n\nElse:\n   new_max = current_max\n   new_min = current_min\n\nThen, the instability after removing x is max(new_max, new_min) - min(new_max, new_min). Wait no, because new_max is the maximum of the remaining array, and new_min is the minimum. So the instability is new_max - new_min.\n\nSo for each x, compute the new_max and new_min as described, then calculate the instability.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where after removing x, the new_max or new_min is determined by multiple factors.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to precompute:\n\ncurrent_max, current_min, second_max, second_min.\n\ncount_max = number of occurrences of current_max.\n\ncount_min = number of occurrences of current_min.\n\nThen, for each x in a:\n\nif x == current_max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n       new_max = current_max\n   else:\n       new_max = second_max\n\n   new_min = current_min (since x was the max, unless x was also the min, which is only possible if all elements are equal, but in that case, removing any x leaves the same array, so the instability is 0.)\n\nelif x == current_min:\n\n   if count_min > 1:\n       new_min = current_min\n   else:\n       new_min = second_min\n\n   new_max = current_max (similar reasoning)\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = current_max\n\n   new_min = current_min\n\nWait, but this isn't entirely correct. For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. current_max is 5, count_max is 1. current_min is 1, count_min is 1. second_max is 4, second_min is 2.\n\nIf we remove 5, the new_max is 4, new_min is 1 → instability is 3.\n\nIf we remove 1, new_min is 2, new_max is 5 → instability is 3.\n\nIf we remove 3, new_max is 5, new_min is 1 → instability is 4.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability is 3.\n\nBut according to our previous logic, for x=5, new_max is 4, new_min is 1 → 3.\n\nFor x=1, new_min is 2, new_max is 5 → 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach works.\n\nBut wait, another test case: [1, 3, 5, 5, 7].\n\ncurrent_max is 7, count_max 1.\n\ncurrent_min 1, count_min 1.\n\nsecond_max 5, second_min 3.\n\nIf we remove 7: new_max is 5, new_min 1 → instability 4.\n\nIf we remove 1: new_min is 3, new_max 7 → 4.\n\nIf we remove 5: new_max is 7, new_min 1 → 6.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nSo yes, the approach seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the element is neither max nor min, but after removal, the max or min changes?\n\nWait, but according to the above logic, the new_max and new_min are always either current_max or current_min, or their second values. But in reality, when we remove an element that is not max or min, the max and min could stay the same.\n\nFor example, in [1, 2, 4, 5], current_max 5, current_min 1.\n\nIf we remove 2: new array is [1,4,5]. Max is 5, min 1 → instability 4.\n\nWhich is same as original.\n\nSo in this case, the new instability is same as original.\n\nSo our approach correctly calculates the new instability as 4.\n\nAnother example: [2,5,3,7,4,6]. Original max 7, min 2.\n\nIf we remove 5: new array is [2,3,7,4,6]. Max 7, min 2 → instability 5.\n\nWhich is same as original.\n\nSo the approach correctly captures that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute current_max, current_min.\n\n2. Compute second_max and second_min.\n\n   How to compute second_max: iterate through the array and find the maximum value less than current_max.\n\n   Similarly for second_min: find the minimum value greater than current_min.\n\n   However, this is tricky. Because the second_max could be the same as current_max if there are multiple occurrences.\n\n   For example, in [3,3,3], second_max is 3.\n\n   So, to compute second_max, we need to find the maximum value in the array that is less than current_max. If none exists, then the second_max is undefined, but in practice, since n>=2, when we remove one of the current_max, the new_max could be the same as current_max if there are multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute second_max is the maximum of all elements except current_max, but only if there are elements less than current_max.\n\nSimilarly, second_min is the minimum of all elements except current_min, but only if there are elements greater than current_min.\n\nBut in cases where all elements are same, like [5,5,5], then both second_max and second_min are same as current_max/current_min.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute the current_max, count_max, current_min, count_min.\n\nThen, for the second_max:\n\nWe can collect all elements that are less than current_max, and take their maximum. If none, then second_max is same as current_max (since when we remove the current_max, there are more of them, so the new max remains same).\n\nWait, no. Because if all elements are same, like [5,5,5], then current_max is 5, count_max is 3. So when we remove one, the new max is still 5.\n\nSimilarly, in [5,5,3], current_max is 5, count_max is 2. Removing one, the new max is 5.\n\nSo, perhaps the second_max should be the maximum of all elements excluding the current_max.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because when you have multiple current_max elements, the second_max is same as current_max.\n\nSo, to compute second_max, we can:\n\nCreate a list of elements that are less than current_max. If this list is non-empty, then the maximum of this list is the second_max. Else, the second_max is current_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min: create a list of elements greater than current_min. If non-empty, the min of that is second_min. Else, second_min is current_min.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative is to iterate through the array once, keeping track of the top two maxima and minima.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to precompute the second_max and second_min.\n\nLet me think about how to compute second_max:\n\nInitialize current_max and second_max.\n\nWe can traverse the array and for each element:\n\n- if element > current_max: set second_max = current_max, current_max = element.\n\n- elif element == current_max: do nothing, since second_max remains as is.\n\n- elif element > second_max: set second_max = element.\n\nThis way, after processing all elements, second_max is the second largest element, but if all elements are same, second_max is same as current_max.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the array is [3,3,3], then during traversal, all elements are same. So current_max is 3, and second_max remains whatever it was initialized to (like negative infinity). So in code, perhaps we should initialize second_max to negative infinity, and current_max to -infinity.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialize current_max = -infinity, second_max = -infinity.\n\nTraverse each element:\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > current_max:\n\n        second_max = current_max\n\n        current_max = num\n\n    elif num == current_max:\n\n        pass  # do nothing, since second_max remains same\n\n    elif num > second_max:\n\n        second_max = num\n\nAfter this, second_max is the second maximum, but only if there are elements less than current_max.\n\nWait, but in [3,3,3], current_max is 3, second_max remains -inf. So that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps, after computing current_max and second_max, we need to check if second_max is less than current_max. If not, that means all elements are same as current_max, so second_max is same as current_max.\n\nSo, after processing, if second_max < current_max: then it's valid. Else, it's same as current_max.\n\nWait, perhaps in code:\n\nif second_max < current_max:\n\n    second_max = current_max\n\nNo, that's not right. Because in [5,5,3], current_max is 5, second_max is 3. So 3 <5 is true, so we leave it as is.\n\nBut in [5,5,5], second_max is -inf, which is less than current_max. So we set second_max to 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter the traversal, if second_max is not updated (i.e., remains -inf), then set second_max to current_max.\n\nAlternatively, after the traversal, if second_max is less than current_max, then set second_max to current_max.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn [5,5,3], the traversal would have:\n\nnum=5: since 5> current_max (-inf), second_max becomes -inf, current_max becomes 5.\n\nnum=5: equals current_max, do nothing.\n\nnum=3: 3>second_max (-inf), so second_max becomes 3.\n\nThus, after traversal, second_max is 3, which is less than current_max (5). So no problem.\n\nIn [5,5,5], all nums are 5.\n\nnum=5: since 5> current_max (-inf), second_max becomes -inf, current_max 5.\n\nnum=5: equals current_max, do nothing.\n\nnum=5: same.\n\nThus, second_max remains -inf. So in this case, after traversal, we need to set second_max to 5.\n\nSo in code, after the traversal, if second_max is less than current_max, then set second_max to current_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nSo the algorithm for second_max is:\n\nInitialize current_max = -infinity, second_max = -infinity.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num > current_max:\n\n        second_max = current_max\n\n        current_max = num\n\n    elif num == current_max:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif num > second_max:\n\n        second_max = num\n\nafter loop:\n\nif second_max < current_max:\n\n    second_max = current_max\n\nSame for second_min, but in reverse.\n\nWait, for second_min, it's similar but looking for the smallest elements.\n\nSo, for second_min, we can initialize current_min to +infinity, second_min to +infinity.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num < current_min:\n\n        second_min = current_min\n\n        current_min = num\n\n    elif num == current_min:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif num < second_min:\n\n        second_min = num\n\nafter loop:\n\nif second_min > current_min:\n\n    second_min = current_min\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, with current_max, second_max, current_min, second_min computed.\n\nNext step: compute count_max and count_min.\n\ncount_max is the number of elements equal to current_max.\n\ncount_min is the number of elements equal to current_min.\n\nOnce we have all these, we can process each element x in the array, compute the new_max and new_min when x is removed, then compute the instability as new_max - new_min.\n\nBut wait, for each x, the new_max and new_min can be determined as follows:\n\nif x is current_max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n\n       new_max = current_max\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = second_max\n\n   new_min = current_min (since x is the max; if x was the only max, new_max is second_max, else same as before)\n\nelif x is current_min:\n\n   if count_min >1:\n\n       new_min = current_min\n\n   else:\n\n       new_min = second_min\n\n   new_max = current_max (since x is the min, and if it's the only min, new_min is second_min)\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = current_max\n\n   new_min = current_min\n\nWait, but what if x is both the current_max and current_min? That's only possible if all elements are same. In that case, removing any x leaves the array with n-1 elements, all same. So new_max and new_min are same, instability is 0.\n\nSo, in code, for each x in a:\n\nif x == current_max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n\n       new_max = current_max\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = second_max\n\n   new_min = current_min\n\nelif x == current_min:\n\n   if count_min >1:\n\n       new_min = current_min\n\n   else:\n\n       new_min = second_min\n\n   new_max = current_max\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = current_max\n\n   new_min = current_min\n\nThen, the instability is new_max - new_min.\n\nWe need to compute this for each x and find the minimal one.\n\nBut wait, what about when the new_max is less than new_min? Because in the code above, new_max and new_min are assigned based on x being the max or min.\n\nWait, no. Because new_max is always the maximum of the remaining elements, and new_min is the minimum.\n\nSo, new_max >= new_min, so instability is new_max - new_min >=0.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All elements are same.\n\nLike [5,5,5]. Then, current_max =5, current_min=5. second_max=5, second_min=5.\n\ncount_max=3, count_min=3.\n\nWhen we remove any x (which is 5):\n\nx is current_max and current_min.\n\nSince count_max >1, new_max =5.\n\nSimilarly, new_min=5.\n\nSo, instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nCase 2: Only two elements, [1,2].\n\ncurrent_max=2, current_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 1, second_min is 1.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\nIf we remove 2: new_max is 1, new_min is1 → instability 0.\n\nIf we remove 1: new_min is1, new_max is 2 → 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nCase3: [3,5,7].\n\ncurrent_max=7, current_min=3.\n\nsecond_max=5, second_min=3.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\nRemoving 7: new_max=5, new_min=3 → instability 2.\n\nRemoving 3: new_max=7, new_min=5 → instability 2.\n\nRemoving 5: new_max=7, new_min=3 → 4.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nCase4: [1,3,3,7].\n\nAs in the sample input.\n\ncurrent_max=7, current_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=3, second_min=3.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\nRemoving 7: new_max=3, new_min=1 → 2.\n\nWhich is the sample's answer.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut wait, for n up to 1e5, the solution must be O(n) time.\n\nComputing current_max, current_min, second_max, second_min, count_max, count_min is O(n).\n\nThen, for each x in a, compute new_max and new_min as per the rules, which is O(n).\n\nSo overall O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nImplement steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read the array as a list of integers.\n\n3. Compute current_max, second_max.\n\n   Initialize current_max = -infinity, second_max = -infinity.\n\n   for num in a:\n\n       if num > current_max:\n\n           second_max = current_max\n\n           current_max = num\n\n       elif num == current_max:\n\n           continue\n\n       elif num > second_max:\n\n           second_max = num\n\n   After loop, if second_max < current_max:\n\n       second_max = current_max\n\n4.

Compute count_max and count_min.\n\n   count_max = a.count(current_max)\n\n   count_min = a.count(current_min)\n\n6.

But in reality, since count_max and count_min are same, but in code, for x being current_max, it will execute the first clause, and for x being current_min, it will execute the second.\n\nBut that's a problem because for x being both, the code will compute new_max and new_min twice.\n\nWait, no, because for x being current_max, it's also current_min. So in the code, the condition x == current_max is true, and x == current_min is also true.\n\nSo, the code will evaluate both conditions. But in reality, since the new_max and new_min are same in both cases, it's redundant but not harmful.\n\nBut wait, in that case, count_max and count_min are same as well.\n\nBut in code, when x is current_max, we process as:\n\nif count_max >1 → new_max = current_max\n\nelse → new_max = second_max.\n\nBut in the case where x is also current_min, and count_max is 1, then new_max is second_max.\n\nBut since x is the only current_max, after removing it, new_max is second_max.\n\nBut in the case where all elements are same, after removing x, the new array has n-1 elements, all same. So new_max and new_min are same, leading to instability 0.\n\nSo, in code, when x is current_max and current_min, the code will correctly compute new_max and new_min.\n\nBut in this case, the code will process both conditions. Let me see.\n\nIn the code:\n\nx is current_max → enter first condition.\n\nCompute new_max and new_min.\n\nThen, since x is also current_min, the code will enter the second condition and compute new_max and new_min again.\n\nBut in the case where x is current_max and current_min, the new_max and new_min are same as in the first condition.\n\nSo, it's redundant, but not a problem.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nSo, implementing this in Python.\n\nNow, handling the cases where second_max is not found, but that's taken care of after the traversal.\n\nTesting for the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=4\n\na = [1,3,3,7]\n\nProcessing for current_max:\n\nelements are 1,3,3,7.\n\ncurrent_max starts as -inf.\n\n1: > -inf → second_max = -inf, current_max=1.\n\n3: >1 → second_max=1, current_max=3.\n\n3: ==3 → do nothing.\n\n7: >3 → second_max=3, current_max=7.\n\nAfter loop, second_max is 3 <7 → so second_max remains 3.\n\ncurrent_max is 7.\n\nSimilarly, current_min:\n\nstart as inf.\n\n1 < inf → second_min=inf, current_min=1.\n\n3>1 → do nothing.\n\n3>1 → do nothing.\n\n7>1 → do nothing.\n\nAfter loop, second_min is inf> current_min (1) → so set second_min=1.\n\ncount_max = a.count(7) →1.\n\ncount_min = a.count(1) →1.\n\nNow, for each x in a:\n\nx=1:\n\nit's current_min.\n\ncount_min=1 → so new_min = second_min=1.\n\nnew_max = current_max=7.\n\ninstability 6.\n\nx=3:\n\nnot current_max or min.\n\nnew_max=7, new_min=1 → 6.\n\nx=3: same.\n\nx=7:\n\nit's current_max.\n\ncount_max=1 → new_max=3.\n\nnew_min=1.\n\ninstability 2.\n\nThus, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=2\n\na = [1,100000]\n\ncurrent_max=100000, current_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=1, second_min=1.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\nFor x=1:\n\nit's current_min.\n\ncount_min=1 → new_min=1.\n\nnew_max=100000.\n\nso instability 99999.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, when x=1 is removed, the array is [100000], so instability is 0.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, wait, in the code:\n\nx=1 is current_min.\n\ncount_min=1 → new_min=second_min.\n\nWhat is second_min?\n\nIn the code, for current_min=1, second_min is computed as the minimal element larger than 1.\n\nBut in the array [1, 100000], the current_min is 1.\n\nAll other elements are 100000, which is larger.\n\nSo, second_min is 100000.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, let's recompute second_min.\n\nCompute current_min and second_min.\n\nStart with current_min = inf.\n\nFirst element is 1: 1< inf → second_min= inf, current_min=1.\n\nSecond element is 100000: 100000> current_min=1 → do nothing, since 100000 is not less than current_min.\n\nSo, after processing, second_min remains inf.\n\nBut after the loop, since second_min is inf> current_min (1), we set second_min = current_min=1.\n\nSo, second_min is 1.\n\nSo, when x is 1 (current_min), count_min=1.\n\nSo, new_min = second_min=1.\n\nnew_max is current_max=100000.\n\nInstability is 100000-1=99999.\n\nBut sample says that removing 1 leaves [100000], which has 0 instability.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the code, the new_max is 100000, and new_min is 1.\n\nBut when you remove 1, the array becomes [100000], which has max and min 100000. So the instability is 0.\n\nBut according to the code, when x=1 is processed, it's treated as current_min, and new_min becomes second_min=1, new_max remains 100000.\n\nThus, the code computes 100000-1=99999, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, that's a big issue.\n\nSo, the code's approach is incorrect in cases where removing the current_min (but it's not the only occurrence) causes the new array to have a different min.\n\nWait, no. In this case, the array is [1, 100000]. count_min is 1.\n\nWhen x=1 is removed, the new array is [100000], whose min and max are 100000. So new_min is 100000, not 1.\n\nSo why is the code's calculation wrong?\n\nBecause in the code's logic, when x is current_min and count_min=1, new_min is set to second_min=1.\n\nBut in reality, after removing x, the new array's min is 100000.\n\nSo, the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see. So the code is assuming that when x is the current_min, the new_min is the second_min, but that's not the case when all other elements are larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach for new_min when x is current_min is flawed.\n\nSo, the error is in the logic when x is current_min.\n\nIn the case where x is current_min, and count_min is 1, the new_min is the minimum of the remaining elements.\n\nWhich could be higher than the second_min.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIn the sample [1,100000], current_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_min is 1.\n\nWhen x=1 is removed, the remaining array is [100000], whose min is 100000.\n\nSo, in the code, for x=1:\n\nnew_min is second_min=1.\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nBecause the remaining elements are all 100000, which are higher than 1.\n\nThus, the new min is 100000.\n\nSo, the code's logic is wrong.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the approach?\n\nThe mistake is that when x is current_min and count_min is 1, the new_min is not necessarily the second_min.\n\nBecause the second_min is the minimal element greater than current_min, but when you remove the current_min, the new_min could be the minimal of the remaining elements, which may be higher than second_min.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where x is current_min, and count_min is 1, then the new array has elements excluding x. Among those, the current_max is same as before.\n\nBut the new_min is the minimal of the remaining elements.\n\nWhich could be higher than the second_min.\n\nSo, the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, this suggests that the approach of using second_max and second_min is insufficient.\n\nHmmm. So the initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, I need to rethink.\n\nAlternative approach: For each x in a, compute the new_max and new_min as the max and min of the array without x.\n\nBut this is O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, that's impossible.\n\nThus, we need an efficient way to compute for each x, the new_max and new_min.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute prefix and suffix maxima and minima.\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nWe can precompute for each position i, the maximum from the left up to i, and the maximum from the right starting at i.\n\nSimilarly for minima.\n\nThen, for any element x, the new_max when x is removed is the maximum between the max of the left part (up to i-1) and the max of the right part (from i+1).\n\nSimilarly for new_min.\n\nThis way, for each x, new_max is the maximum of left_max[i-1] and right_max[i+1], and new_min is the minimum of left_min[i-1] and right_min[i+1].\n\nBut we have to handle cases where x is the first or last element.\n\nThis approach would allow us to compute new_max and new_min for each x in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.\n\nYes, this seems promising.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max and suffix_max arrays.\n\nprefix_max[i] = max of a[0..i]\n\nsuffix_max[i] = max of a[i..n-1]\n\nSimilarly for prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\n2. For each index i:\n\n   if i is 0:\n\n       new_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n\n   elif i is n-1:\n\n       new_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n\n   Similarly for new_min.\n\n   Then, the instability is new_max - new_min.\n\n3. Find the minimal instability among all x.\n\nThis approach would work, but let's test it against the sample.\n\nSample 1: [1,3,3,7]\n\nCompute prefix_max: [1,3,3,7]\n\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\n\nFor i=3 (element 7):\n\ni is last element.\n\nnew_max = prefix_max[2] →3.\n\nnew_min is min of prefix_min[2] and suffix_min[4], but wait, for i=3, the suffix_min[i+1] is beyond the array.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min.\n\nFor each i, new_max is:\n\nif i ==0: suffix_max[1]\n\nelif i ==n-1: prefix_max[n-2]\n\nelse: max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n\nSimilarly for new_min.\n\nSo, let's compute this for the sample.\n\nSample 2: [1,100000]\n\nprefix_max: [1, 100000]\n\nsuffix_max: [100000, 100000]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,100000]\n\nFor i=0:\n\nnew_max = suffix_max[1] =100000.\n\nnew_min = suffix_min[1] =100000.\n\nSo instability 0.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nnew_max = prefix_max[0]=1.\n\nnew_min = prefix_min[0]=1.\n\nSo instability 0.\n\nThus, minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,3,5,7].\n\nprefix_max: [1,3,5,7]\n\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1,1,1]\n\nFor i=3 (element 7):\n\nnew_max is prefix_max[2]=5.\n\nnew_min is prefix_min[2]=1.\n\nInstability 4.\n\nFor i=0:\n\nnew_max is suffix_max[1] =7.\n\nnew_min is suffix_min[1] =1.\n\nSo 6.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,3,5,5,7].\n\nCompute for i=2 (element 5):\n\nnew_max is max(prefix_max[1], suffix_max[3]) → max",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We compute four arrays:\n   - `prefix_max`: The maximum value from the start up to each index.\n   - `suffix_max`: The maximum value from each index to the end.\n   - `prefix_min`: The minimum value from the start up to each index.\n   - `suffix_min`: The minimum value from each index to the end.\n\n2. **Calculate New Max and Min for Each Element Removal**: For each element in the array, determine the new maximum and minimum values that would result if that element were removed. This is done using the precomputed prefix and suffix arrays:\n   - If the element is at the start or end, use the corresponding suffix or prefix array.\n   - Otherwise, use the maximum of the prefix and suffix arrays.\n\n3. **Compute Instability**: For each possible removal, compute the instability as the difference between the new maximum and new minimum.
