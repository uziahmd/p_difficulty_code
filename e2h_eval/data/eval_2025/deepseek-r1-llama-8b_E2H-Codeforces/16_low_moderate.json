Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. Each road is an infinite line, and the roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border segment with non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step requires crossing exactly one road. Because if two blocks share a border, that border is a segment of a single road. So, moving between adjacent blocks across a shared road boundary counts as one step.\n\nWait, but how do we model the movement? It feels like a graph problem where each block is a node, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent via a road. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block in this graph.\n\nBut wait, the number of blocks could be very large, making it impossible to model them all. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Each road divides the plane into two parts. For any point, it can be on one side or the other of a road. So, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because for each such road, you have to cross it once.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if a road doesn't separate the home and the university, then their blocks are on the same side of that road. So, to move from home to university, you only need to cross the roads that separate them.\n\nSo the minimal number of steps would be the count of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each such road must be crossed exactly once, and since each step crosses exactly one road, the total steps are the count.\n\nYes! So the key idea is to count how many lines (roads) separate the two points.\n\nHow do I determine if a line separates two points?\n\nFor a given line ax + by + c = 0, compute the value f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c. For the home point (x1, y1), compute f1 = f(x1, y1). For the university point (x2, y2), compute f2 = f(x2, y2).\n\nIf f1 and f2 have opposite signs, then the points are on opposite sides of the line, meaning the line separates them. If they have the same sign, then the line does not separate them.\n\nSo, for each of the n roads, we check whether f1 and f2 have opposite signs. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nThat's a clever approach because it avoids dealing with the entire graph of blocks and just focuses on each road's contribution.\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Read the home coordinates (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n2. For each of the n roads, represented by a, b, c:\n   a. Compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n   b. Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n   c. Check if f1 * f2 < 0. If yes, increment the count.\n3. Output the count.\n\nThis should work because each separating line contributes one step to the minimal path.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\nf1 = 1, f2 = -1. So f1*f2 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\nRoad 2: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\nf1=1, f2=-1 → again count +=1. So total is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example in the sample input after the second set:\nWait, no, the first sample's output is 2, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, what about handling the computation correctly?\n\nWe need to compute a*x1 + b*y1 +c and a*x2 +b*y2 +c, and check their signs.\n\nBut we have to be cautious about zero. Since the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road, so for each road, f1 and f2 can't be zero. So, no division by zero or anything; just checking the product.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from the first line.\nRead x2, y2 from the second line.\nRead n.\nInitialize count=0.\nFor each of n lines:\n   read a, b, c.\n   compute val1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The town is divided into blocks by roads represented as lines. Each road can be defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\). We need to find the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, determine if it separates the home and university points. If a road separates them, it means their positions relative to the road are on opposite sides, which implies crossing this road is necessary.\n\n3. **Mathematical Check**: For each road defined by \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the values \\(f1 = a \\cdot x1 + b \\cdot y1 + c\\) for the home point \\((x1, y1)\\) and \\(f2 = a \\cdot x2 + b \\cdot y2 + c\\) for the university point \\((x2, y2)\\). If \\(f1\\) and \\(f2\\) have opposite signs, the road separates the two points, and thus must be crossed.\n\n4. **Count Separating Roads**: The minimum number of steps required is the count of such roads that separate the home and university points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    x1 = int(input[ptr])\n    y1 = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    x2 = int(input[ptr])\n    y2 = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        b = int(input[ptr+1])\n        c = int(input[ptr+2])\n        ptr +=3\n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) or (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0):\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, the function computes the values of the line equation at the home and university points. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates the road separates the two points.\n- **Counting Separations**: The count of such separating roads is maintained and printed as the result, representing the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution.",
