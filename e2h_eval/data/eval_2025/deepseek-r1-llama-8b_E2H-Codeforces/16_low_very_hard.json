Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. Each road is an infinite line, and the roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border segment with non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step requires crossing exactly one road. Because if two blocks share a border, that border is a segment of a single road. So, moving between adjacent blocks across a shared road boundary counts as one step.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, if two blocks share a common boundary segment, which is part of a road, then you can move between them in one step. But each such movement is across a single road. Because if two blocks are on opposite sides of a road, then that's their only common border. So, each step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. That is, each such road that the straight line path between home and university crosses must be traversed, but wait, maybe not exactly that. Wait, perhaps each road that the home and university are on opposite sides of contributes one step. Because each such road acts as a barrier that you have to cross.\n\nSo, the approach would be: for each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. If they're on opposite sides, then that road must be crossed once, contributing to the step count.\n\nWait, yes! Because each time you cross a road, you switch blocks. So, if home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut how do we check if home and university are on the same or different sides of a given road?\n\nEach road is defined by ai*x + bi*y + ci = 0. For a point (x0, y0), substituting into the equation gives ai*x0 + bi*y0 + ci. The sign of this value tells us which side of the line the point is on. If it's positive, negative, or zero.\n\nBut since neither home nor university lie on any road, their values will never be zero.\n\nSo for each road, compute the value f1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i, and f2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i. If f1 and f2 have the same sign (both positive or both negative), then home and university are on the same side of the road. Otherwise, they are on opposite sides.\n\nSo for each of the n roads, we count how many times f1 and f2 have opposite signs. The total count is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nThat makes sense. So the solution is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the home coordinates (x1, y1) and the university (x2, y2).\n\nThen, for each of the n roads, read ai, bi, ci.\n\nFor each road, compute f1 = ai * x1 + bi * y1 + ci.\n\nCompute f2 = ai * x2 + bi * y2 + ci.\n\nIf f1 and f2 have different signs (i.e., f1 * f2 < 0), then increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- When home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then the count is zero steps. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither home nor university is on a road. So, for example, if all roads are such that home and university are on the same side, then the answer is zero steps? Or wait, no. Because the initial position is a block, and the university is another block. So, if there are no roads separating them, then they are in the same block, so zero steps. But the problem statement says that the home and university are in different blocks. Wait, no: the problem says that the output is the minimal steps to get to the university's block. It's possible that home and university are already in the same block, but that's only if they are on the same side of all roads. But the problem says it's guaranteed that neither is on a road, but they could be in the same block.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block.\"\n\nIt doesn't say that they are in different blocks. So, it's possible that home and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The town is divided into blocks by roads, each defined by a line equation. Moving between blocks requires crossing a road. The goal is to find the minimum number of such crossings needed.\n2. **Key Insight**: Each road can be represented by the line equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\). For any point \\((x, y)\\), substituting into this equation gives a value whose sign indicates which side of the road the point is on. If two points (home and university) are on opposite sides of a road, they are separated by that road.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, count this road as a necessary crossing. The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(input[idx])\n    y1 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2 = int(input[idx])\n    y2 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        \n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) or (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0):\n            count +=1\n    \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Checking Each Road**: For each road, compute the values of the home and university when substituted into the road's equation. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Crossings**: Each time the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, increment the count. This count represents the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separating effects on points.",
