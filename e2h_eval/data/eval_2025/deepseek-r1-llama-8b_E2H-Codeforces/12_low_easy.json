The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1. She has m tasks. For the i-th task, she needs to be at ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, she must process each task in order, right? Because for each task i, she must have done all j < i already. So the tasks are processed in the order they are given.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Oh, perhaps it's that for each task, when she is doing task i, she must have already completed tasks 1 to i-1. So the processing order is sequential, like she does task 1, then task 2, etc., regardless of their positions.\n\nSo the order is fixed as per the input list. So for each i from 1 to m, she must be at a_i at some point before starting task i. Or wait, maybe the way to model it is that she must be at a_i at the time she starts task i.\n\nWait, the problem statement says she needs to be in ai to complete task i. So for each task i, she must be present at ai when she starts it. Also, she must have completed all tasks with j < i before starting i. So the order is 1, 2, ..., m, and for each i, she is at a_i.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal time such that she moves from 1 to a_1, then from a_1 to a_2, and so on until a_m, possibly passing through other houses as needed. But the movement along the ring is only possible in the clockwise direction, meaning that she can't move counter-clockwise. So from any house i, she can only go to i+1 (mod n, but in this case, since the houses are arranged in a ring, perhaps it's better to think in terms of distances.\n\nWait, the ring is unidirectional, so the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So if she is at house 4, she can only go to 5, 6, ... up to 1, but not the other way.\n\nWait, wait, the ringroad is one-way and also is clockwise. So the direction is fixed. So the houses are arranged in a circle, and you can only move forward to the next house in the clockwise direction. So the movement is only possible from house i to i+1 mod n.\n\nBut how do we model the distance between two houses?\n\nWait, the ring is circular. So the distance from house A to house B is (B - A) mod n, but since movement is only allowed clockwise, that's the only way. So the minimal time to get from A to B is (B - A) mod n, because she can't go the other way.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is strictly clockwise, the path from A to B is always the same as going clockwise. So the distance is the minimal steps needed in the clockwise direction. So for any two houses A and B, the distance is (B - A) if B > A, or (n - (A - B)) if B < A. So it's the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nBut when calculating the total time, we have to consider that she might have to make loops around the ring. Like, for example, moving from 4 to 2 when n=4 would require going 4 → 1 → 2, which is 2 steps.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each task i, she needs to be at a_i at the start of processing task i. Each task takes 0 time, except the movement between them. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, including the initial step from 1 to a_1, then a_1 to a_2, and so on until a_{m}.\n\nBut wait, no. Because she might have to pass through some intermediate steps multiple times. For example, if a_i is earlier than a_j in the sequence but j comes later, she might need to loop around the ring.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to model the positions as a sequence, starting at 1, then moving to a_1, then a_2, and so on. For each step, compute the required movement, and sum all these movements' times.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move in a clockwise direction along a ring of houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the ring is one-way and clockwise, Xenia can only move from house `i` to house `i+1` (mod `n`). Therefore, the distance between two houses `A` and `B` is calculated as `(B - A) % n`.\n\n2. **Task Processing Order**: Xenia must process each task in the given order. For each task `i`, she must be at the specified house `a_i` at the start of processing it.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**: Starting from house 1, compute the distance to each subsequent task location. Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    # Calculate the distance from current to a\n    if a > current:\n        dist = a - current\n    else:\n        dist = n - current + a\n    total_time += dist\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `total_time` set to 0.\n- **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task location `a` in the list:\n  - Compute the clockwise distance from the current house to `a`.\n  - Update the total time with this distance.\n  - Move to the next task location.\n- **Output**: Print the accumulated total time, which is the minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time by considering each necessary move in the clockwise direction, adhering to the constraints of the problem.",
