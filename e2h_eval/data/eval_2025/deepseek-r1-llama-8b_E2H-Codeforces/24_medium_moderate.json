She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to model what actions she can take and figure out the optimal sequence to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. There are a few possibilities here.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs. For example, if some tabs to the left of l are open, she needs to get the cursor to a position where she can close them. Similarly for the right side beyond r.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs.\n2. Closing those left tabs.\n3. Possibly moving again to another position to close the right tabs.\n4. Closing those right tabs.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes she can do both closures in one movement without having to move back and forth too much.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's figure out which tabs need to be closed. Any tab less than l or greater than r must be closed. So, the initial state is that all tabs are open, and we need to close those outside [l, r].\n\nNow, the initial position is 'pos'. So, the steps involve moving to a certain point and closing the necessary tabs.\n\nLet's consider different cases.\n\nCase 1: All tabs outside [l, r] are already closed. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nBut probably, that's not the case unless l=1 and r=n, or when pos is such that the required tabs are already the only ones left.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state is that all tabs are open. So, she has to close the ones outside [l, r], regardless of their current state.\n\nSo, let's think about how to structure the solution.\n\nI think the minimal steps would be determined by the following factors:\n\n- Whether she needs to close tabs on the left of l.\n- Whether she needs to close tabs on the right of r.\n- Her initial position relative to l and r.\n\nSo, let's define some variables:\n\nleft = whether there are any tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1). So, if l > 1, then we need to close tabs 1..l-1.\n\nright = whether there are any tabs to the right of r (i.e., r < n). So, if r < n, then we need to close tabs r+1..n.\n\nIf neither left nor right need to be closed, then output 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to calculate the steps.\n\nEach closure action (either left or right) takes 1 second, but before that, she may need to move the cursor to the correct position.\n\nSo, let's model the steps needed for each closure.\n\nFor the left closure:\n\nShe needs to move to a position where she can close all left tabs. That position must be at least l, because closing all left tabs from a position i >= l will close 1..i-1, which includes all the tabs left of l.\n\nSimilarly, for the right closure, she needs to be at a position <= r, because closing all right tabs from i <= r will close i+1..n.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nSuppose she is at position i. If she chooses to close all tabs to the left, that means all tabs with indices less than i. So, if she's at i, closing left will close 1..i-1.\n\nSimilarly, closing right closes i+1..current_max.\n\nBut after some tabs are closed, the current_max changes. So, the initial a and b are n and 1, respectively.\n\nWait, no. Wait, a is the minimum index of unclosed tabs, and b is the maximum.\n\nSo, when you close left tabs, the new a becomes the minimum of the remaining tabs. For example, if you're at position i and close left, then the new a is max(1, ...) no, wait, no. Because a is the min of the unclosed tabs. So, if you have tabs 1..n and you close left up to i-1, then the new a is i.\n\nSimilarly, when you close right, the new b is i-1? Or wait, no. Because after closing right, the new b is i-1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAfter closing tabs to the left, all tabs left of i are closed. So, the remaining tabs are i, i+1, ..., current_b. So, the new a is i, because that's the smallest remaining index.\n\nSimilarly, if you close right, then the remaining tabs are ... up to i. So, the new b is i.\n\nSo, for the initial step, a=1, b=n.\n\nWhen she moves, the possible positions are constrained by the current a and b.\n\nWait, but when she moves, she can only move between a and b.\n\nSo, when she is at position i, and she wants to move left, she can go to a, but a is the minimum of the open tabs. Similarly, moving right can't go beyond b.\n\nBut during the process, a and b change as she closes tabs.\n\nHmm, this complicates things because a and b are dynamic.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model this as a state where the current a and b are known, along with the current position.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 100, maybe a BFS approach is feasible, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute the minimal steps based on the initial position, l, r, and the need to close left and right.\n\nLet me try to model the steps for each possible scenario.\n\nSo, first, determine if we need to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nThen, for each case, compute the minimal steps.\n\nLet's see.\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close (l=1 and r=n). Then steps are 0.\n\nElse:\n\nWe have two possibilities: need to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nSubcases:\n\nA) Need to close both left and right.\n\nB) Only need to close left.\n\nC) Only need to close right.\n\nD) Already have all required tabs open.\n\nSo, let's think about each subcase.\n\nCase A: Both left and right need to be closed.\n\nHow?\n\nShe can:\n\n1. Move to the position where she can close the left.\n\n   - This position is l, because she needs to close all tabs before l.\n\n   - The cost is the number of steps to move from pos to l.\n\n   - But wait, she can't jump over closed tabs. So, the path from pos to l must be through open tabs.\n\n   Hmm, but initially, all tabs are open. So, moving from pos to l is straightforward.\n\n   So, the number of steps is |pos - l|.\n\n   Then, she can close the left in 1 step.\n\n2. Then, she needs to move to a position where she can close the right.\n\n   The right closure requires her to be at or before r, but also, the position should allow her to close all the right tabs.\n\n   Wait, no. To close the right, she can be at any position i where i is <= r, because closing right from i would close i+1 to b (which was previously n, but now, after closing left, the new b is r).\n\n   Wait, after closing left, the new a is l, and the new b remains as r, because the right hasn't been closed yet.\n\n   So, after closing left, she is at position l.\n\n   Now, she needs to reach a position where she can close the right.\n\n   The right closure requires her to be at some position i where i is <= r.\n\n   So, she needs to move from l to r.\n\n   The distance is |l - r| steps.\n\n   Then, she can close the right in 1 step.\n\n   Total steps: (|pos - l|) + 1 (close left) + (|l - r|) + 1 (close right) = |pos-l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nBut wait, is there a more optimal way?\n\nAlternatively, she could first close the right, then the left.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nOption 1: Close left first.\n\nMove from pos to l: steps |pos - l|.\n\nClose left: +1.\n\nThen, move to r: steps |l - r|.\n\nClose right: +1.\n\nTotal: |pos-l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first.\n\nMove from pos to r: steps |pos - r|.\n\nClose right: +1.\n\nThen, move to l: steps |r - l|.\n\nClose left: +1.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWhich option is better depends on whether |pos - l| + |l - r| is less than |pos - r| + |r - l|.\n\nWait, |l - r| is same as |r - l|. So, the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|.\n\nWhich is smaller.\n\nSo, if pos is closer to l, then Option 1 is better.\n\nIf pos is closer to r, then Option 2 is better.\n\nWait, no. Because in Option 1, she moves to l (cost |pos - l|), then to r (cost |l - r|), while in Option 2, she moves directly to r (cost |pos - r|), then to l (cost |r - l|).\n\nSo, total for Option 1: |pos - l| + |l - r|.\n\nOption 2: |pos - r| + |r - l|.\n\nBut since |l - r| is the same as |r - l|, the difference is whether |pos - l| is less than |pos - r|.\n\nWait, no. Because in Option 1, the movement from l to r is |l - r|, which is same as |r - l|.\n\nSo, the sum for Option 1 is |pos - l| + |r - l|.\n\nSum for Option 2 is |pos - r| + |r - l|.\n\nSo, which is better?\n\nIt depends on whether |pos - l| is less than |pos - r|.\n\nBecause |r - l| is fixed.\n\nSo, if pos is closer to l than to r, then Option 1 is better.\n\nElse, Option 2.\n\nSo, the minimal steps when both left and right are needed is min( (|pos-l| + |r-l| + 2 ), (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2 ) )\n\nWait, but |r-l| is same as |l-r|, so adding it twice isn't helpful. Wait no, because in both options, the same term appears.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nOption 1: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption 2: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut |l - r| is equal to |r - l|. So, the difference is |pos - l| versus |pos - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for both options is (distance from pos to l or r) plus (fixed distance between l and r) plus 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose pos is 3, l=2, r=4.\n\nOption 1: move from 3 to 2 (1 step), close left (1), then move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 5 steps.\n\nOption 2: move from 3 to 4 (1 step), close right (1), then move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1). Also 5 steps.\n\nIn this case, both options give the same result.\n\nAnother example: pos is 5, l=2, r=4.\n\nOption 1: move to 2: 3 steps, close left: 1, then move to 4: 2 steps, close right:1. Total 7.\n\nOption 2: move to 4: 1 step, close right:1, then move to 2: 2 steps, close left:1. Total 5.\n\nSo, in this case, Option 2 is better.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for both cases is the minimal between moving to l first or r first.\n\nThus, for Case A, the steps are:\n\nsteps_left_right = (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) ) + (|l - r|) + 2.\n\nWait, because |l - r| is fixed, and we choose the minimal between moving to l or r first.\n\nWait, no. Because when you move to l first, the total movement is |pos - l| + |l - r|.\n\nWhen you move to r first, it's |pos - r| + |r - l|.\n\nWhich is the same as |pos - l| + |l - r| or |pos - r| + |l - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal is the smaller of |pos - l| and |pos - r|, plus |l - r|, plus 2.\n\nWait, but in the previous example, when pos is 5, l=2, r=4.\n\n|pos - l| = 3, |pos - r| = 1.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1 + (2) = 3, plus 2 gives 5 steps.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula for steps when both left and right are needed is:\n\nsteps = (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) ) + (|l - r|) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait: |l - r| is the same as |r - l|, so adding it once.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the formula.\n\nCase B: Only left needs to be closed.\n\nIn this case, she doesn't need to close any right tabs.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Move to l (from current pos): steps |pos - l|.\n\n2. Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nIs that sufficient?\n\nWait, because after closing left, the a becomes l, and the b remains as n, but she doesn't need to do anything else.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, yes, steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase C: Only right needs to be closed.\n\nSimilarly, steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBecause she can move to r, close right, which will close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo, steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase D: Neither left nor right needs to be closed.\n\nSteps are 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute whether left needs to be closed (if l > 1) and right needs to be closed (if r < n).\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf both, compute steps as (min distance to l or r) + |l-r| + 2.\n\nIf only left, steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nIf only right, steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial a and b?\n\nWait, when she starts, a=1, b=n.\n\nSo, moving to l is allowed because l is within a and b.\n\nSame for r.\n\nSo, moving to l or r is always possible.\n\nBut what if l is not reachable? Well, l is <= r, and initially, all are open.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nWait, but in some cases, after closing left, the a becomes l, so any movement beyond l is not possible, but in this problem, she can close left only once.\n\nWait, but in the case where she needs to close both left and right, she does both, so after closing left, the a is l, but she still can move to r, which is >= l.\n\nSo, movement is allowed.\n\nSo, the initial model seems correct.\n\nBut let's test with the examples given.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nLeft needs to be closed (since l=2>1), right also needs to be closed (r=4<6).\n\nSo, steps:\n\nWe need to compute the minimal steps for both.\n\nCompute min(|3-2|, |3-4|) = min(1,1)=1.\n\nAdd |2-4|=2.\n\nPlus 2 steps: 1+2+2=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 6 3 1 3.\n\nSo, l=1, so no left to close. r=3 <6, so right to close.\n\nSteps: |3-3|=0 +1=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: 5 2 1 5. So, no tabs to close. Steps 0.\n\nSo, the model works.\n\nAnother test case: pos is 5, l=2, r=4, n=6.\n\nAs before, steps are min(3,1) + 2 + 2= 1+2+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: pos=1, l=3, r=5, n=10.\n\nSo, left needs to be closed (3>1), right needs to be closed (5<10).\n\nCompute min(|1-3|=2, |1-5|=4) → 2.\n\nPlus |3-5|=2. So 2+2+2=6 steps.\n\nWait, but let's think:\n\nMove from 1 to 3: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove to 5: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal 6 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: pos=4, l=3, r=5, n=10.\n\nLeft is 3>1, right is 5<10.\n\nMin(|4-3|=1, |4-5|=1) → 1.\n\nPlus 2 steps (3-5 is 2).\n\nTotal 1+2+2=5.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when l=1 and r=n: no steps.\n\nNow, what about when l=1 but r is less than n.\n\nLike, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nNo left to close. Right to close (r=3<5).\n\nSteps: |3-3|=0 +1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=5, r=5, n=10, pos=8.\n\nShe needs to close left (since l=5>1) and right (r=5<10).\n\nSo, steps:\n\nmin(|8-5|=3, |8-5|=3) →3.\n\nPlus |5-5|=0.\n\nTotal steps: 3+0 +2=5.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nMove from 8 to 5: 3 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove to 5 again: 0 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal 5 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but after closing left, the a becomes 5. So, she can't move beyond that. So, when moving to 5, she can't go beyond, but since she's already at 5, nothing changes.\n\nSo, the model holds.\n\nAnother test case: l=4, r=6, n=10, pos=2.\n\nShe needs to close left (4>1) and right (6<10).\n\nCompute min(|2-4|=2, |2-6|=4) → 2.\n\nPlus |4-6|=2.\n\nTotal steps: 2+2+2=6.\n\nSo, 6 steps.\n\nSo, the model seems solid.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n   print 0\n\nelse:\n\n   if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n      option1 = (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2\n\n      option2 = (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2 → same as option1 with different order.\n\n      steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n   elif left_needed:\n\n      steps = distance from pos to l + 1\n\n   else:\n\n      steps = distance from pos to r + 1\n\nSo, the code can implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nRead the input line as four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_needed as l > 1.\n\nCompute right_needed as r < n.\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nif both needed:\n\n   d1 = abs(pos - l)\n\n   d2 = abs(pos - r)\n\n   min_distance = min(d1, d2)\n\n   distance_lr = abs(l - r)\n\n   steps = min_distance + distance_lr + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nPrint steps.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nBoth needed.\n\nd1 = 1, d2=1. min is 1.\n\ndistance_lr = 2.\n\nsteps = 1+2+2=5.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3.\n\nOnly right needed.\n\nabs(3-3)=0 +1=1.\n\nSample 3:5 2 1 5.\n\nNeither needed. 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needed: 3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:5 <5 → no.\n\nsteps: |5-3|=2 +1=3.\n\nWhich makes sense.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needed:3>1.\n\nright_needed:5<5 → no.\n\nsteps: |1-3|=2 +1=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, I'll write the Python code accordingly.\n\nThe code needs to read from stdin, compute and write to stdout.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead the input as a string, split into four integers.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nThen follow the logic above.\n\nImplement the steps.\n\nWait, but what if l ==1 and r ==n? Then, no steps.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        d1 = abs(pos - l)\n\n        d2 = abs(pos - r)\n\n        min_d = min(d1, d2)\n\n        distance_lr = abs(l - r)\n\n        steps = min_d + distance_lr + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but wait. What if l == r?\n\nFor example, l=4, r=4.\n\nSo, left_needed is 4>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed is 4 <n → depends on n.\n\nSo, code correctly handles that.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: l=5, r=5, n=10.\n\nSo, left_needed:5>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:5 <10 → yes.\n\nCompute min_d between pos and 5, plus (0) + 2.\n\nSo, steps is min_d + 0 +2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
