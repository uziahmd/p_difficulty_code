Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Feed the Golorp\". From what I understand, a golorp is like a small program in Befunge, and it consumes variables. Each variable can be a digit from 0-9. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can satisfy the golorp's requirements. If it's impossible, we output \"false\".\n\nHmm. So the input is a string representing the golorp's name. The output should be a list of variable values in the order they're used in the golorp's program. Or 'false' if it's not possible.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input, it's an array of strings. Oh wait, no—the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check:\n\nInput is a single string between 13 and 1024 characters long. So each test case is one string, and the output is a list of outputs for each of the four test cases. Or perhaps the sample input is a representation. Wait, the sample shows four inputs and four outputs. So probably, the actual problem is that each input is a string, and the output is a single string or 'false'.\n\nWait, no. Looking back: the problem statement says that the input is a single string. But the sample shows four test cases. Oh, wait, no—looking at the sample, the input is a list of four strings, but the output is a list of four results. So perhaps the actual problem is that the input is a list of several test cases, each being a string, and the output is a list of results for each.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"the input is a single string\"—so perhaps the sample is a bit misleading. Wait, maybe the sample input is just an example, and the actual problem has multiple test cases. Hmm, but in the problem description, it says that the input is a single string.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the given sample is part of the problem statement, showing the input and output, but the actual code will process a single input string and output the result as a single string (either the lex smallest sequence or false). Because the sample shows four different inputs and outputs, but perhaps each is a separate test case. But the problem says that the input is a single string, which suggests that perhaps the sample is a composite, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the actual problem is that each line is a separate test case, but the input is read as a single string, with lines separated somehow. Or perhaps the sample is just illustrative.\n\nWell, perhaps the key is to model the problem correctly regardless of the input format.\n\nSo, the main task is: given a Befunge-like program (a string), determine the minimal sequence of variable values (each 0-9) that can be fed into the program such that it runs without errors, and returns the lex smallest such sequence. If no such sequence exists, output 'false'.\n\nI think the key here is to model the constraints that the program imposes on the variables, then find the lex smallest assignment that satisfies all constraints.\n\nSo first, I need to parse the Befunge program and figure out how the variables are used.\n\nIn Befunge, the variables are stored in memory as a stack. Each variable is a cell in a grid. The instruction pointer moves around the grid, and when it hits a '@', it pops the top of the stack as an integer and uses it as the variable value.\n\nSo, for our problem, each time the program uses a variable (i.e., when it encounters an '@'), it must have a certain value. Our goal is to assign values to the variables such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sequence is lex smallest.\n\nBut wait, in Befunge, the variables are global, so each '@' refers to the same variable. So for each '@', the corresponding variable must have a specific value based on the stack's state at that point.\n\nWait, no. In Befunge, each variable is a cell in the grid. When you do something like `v@`, it pops the top of the stack and uses it as the value for variable v. So each '@' corresponds to a specific variable.\n\nThus, for the entire program, every '@' must refer to a variable that has been assigned a value. So, the variables used in the program must be assigned values in such a way that, when the program runs, each '@' is popped from the stack and matches the current value of the variable.\n\nBut wait, the program's execution is dependent on the stack's state as it proceeds. So the values pushed onto the stack by previous commands affect the variables used later.\n\nWait, but in our case, the program is given, and the variables are determined by the program's flow. So to model the constraints, we need to consider the order in which variables are accessed and the dependencies between them.\n\nThis seems complex. How can we model the constraints?\n\nAlternative approach: simulate the program with variables as placeholders, and track the constraints each '@' imposes on the variables.\n\nBut variables can be assigned in any order, but their values must be consistent with the constraints imposed by the program's execution.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to represent the dependencies between variables. For example, some variables are used before others, and thus their values must be set before the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the program can be modeled as a series of steps where certain variables are accessed, and their values are determined by the stack state at that step.\n\nBut this sounds complicated.\n\nAnother idea: since the variables are digits, perhaps we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, where each variable has a possible value (0-9), and the constraints are the required values at each '@' based on the stack operations.\n\nBut how to model the constraints?\n\nLet me think about the stack in Befunge. Each command can push or pop from the stack. When an '@' is encountered, it pops the top of the stack and uses it as the variable's value.\n\nSo, for each '@', the variable's value is determined by the current top of the stack at that point in the program's execution.\n\nBut the stack's state depends on all prior commands. So the value of a variable may depend on the results of other variables, which could create cycles of dependencies.\n\nHmm, but how can we model this? It might be challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the program as a series of constraints where each variable's value is determined by the stack state at the time of the '@' command.\n\nBut since variables can be pushed and popped from the stack, the values can be dependent on each other in complex ways.\n\nAn alternative approach is to simulate the program step by step, keeping track of the stack and the variables, but that's not feasible for large programs because the number of possibilities would be too big.\n\nWait, but since the variables can only take 10 possible values, maybe a breadth-first search approach is feasible, trying all possible combinations of variables, checking which ones satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut the problem is that the number of variables can be up to, say, the number of unique '@' commands in the program. For a 1000-character program, that's potentially hundreds of variables, leading to 10^500 possibilities—way too big.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way to model the constraints. Let's think about the dependencies between variables.\n\nEach '@' command requires that, at the time it's executed, the top of the stack is a certain value. So, for example, if the program does '00+@', then the variable 'v' will be assigned the sum of the first two variables plus zero. Wait, no—wait, in Befunge, '+' adds the top two elements of the stack, popping them both and pushing the sum. So '00+@' would pop two zeros, add them to get zero, then use that as the value of variable 'v'.\n\nSo, the value of 'v' is 0.\n\nBut what if the program is something like '01+@', which would add the first element (1) and the second (0), getting 1, so 'v' is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps each '@' can be represented as an equation involving other variables. For example, in a program like '12@', the variable 'v' is the sum of 1 and 2, so v = 3.\n\nBut this depends on the order of operations. For example, '1+2@' would compute 1+2=3 and assign it to 'v'. Similarly, '1@2+@' would assign v=1, then w=2+1=3.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. It's not clear how to model the dependencies when variables are computed in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the constraints as a system of equations, where each '@' represents an equation that relates variables. Then, solving this system would give us the required variable assignments.\n\nBut how to derive these equations?\n\nEach '@' in the program corresponds to a value that is computed from the stack at that point. The stack's state is built from previous commands, which may involve other variables.\n\nSo, for example, if the program is '123+@', then the variable 'v' is assigned the sum of 1, 2, and 3, which is 6. But this is a fixed value, so v must be 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the program is 'v@w@x', then each '@' pops the top of the stack. So the first '@' assigns v to the current top, which was pushed earlier. The next '@' pops the new top, which is w, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the program's execution as a series of steps, noting which variables are accessed and in what order. Then, for each variable, determine what its value must be based on the context in which it's used.\n\nBut again, this seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: think of the program as a DAG where each node represents a variable, and edges represent dependencies. Then, perform a topological sort and assign variables in that order.\n\nBut how to build this DAG?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each '@' command imposes a constraint that the variable's value is equal to the current stack top. The stack's state is modified by the preceding commands, which may involve other variables.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into determining, for each '@', what the value of that variable must be, based on the commands before it.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's model the program step by step, keeping track of the stack and the variables used. For each '@', the value of the variable is the top of the stack. But the stack is built from the program's commands.\n\nSo, for each '@', the variable's value is determined by the current state of the stack, which is a function of all the previous commands.\n\nBut this seems like it's leading us nowhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the program can be considered as a series of function calls or expressions, where each '@' is a function that returns the current stack top, and the functions may depend on other functions.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the program's execution can be represented as a function that computes the required values of the variables. For each variable, its value is determined by the expression in the program that leads to its '@' command.\n\nSo, for example, if the program is '123+@', then the variable is the sum of 1, 2, 3, which is 6. So v=6.\n\nIf the program is 'v@w@x', then each '@' refers to a variable that was previously pushed onto the stack. So during the first '@', the top of the stack is v, so v is assigned. Then, the next '@' pops w, assigning it. Then x is assigned.\n\nWait, but in this case, the variables v, w, x are assigned in the order they appear, but their values are determined by the stack state at each '@'.\n\nBut how to model this for the purposes of finding variable assignments.\n\nThis feels similar to dataflow analysis, where each variable's value is determined by the results of certain computations.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the constraints using a directed graph where nodes represent variables, and edges represent the dependencies. Then, we can assign variables in topological order, ensuring that all dependencies are satisfied.\n\nBut building this graph would require analyzing the program to determine which variables depend on others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of equations, where each variable is expressed in terms of others.\n\nBut again, the interdependencies make this difficult.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to represent the constraints as a binary decision diagram, but that's probably overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each variable's value is determined by the path through the program that led to its '@' command.\n\nSo, for each '@', we can represent the value as a function of other variables. But how?\n\nAnother thought: for the program to be valid, the variables used must be assigned values such that, when the program is run, each '@' pops the correct value. So, perhaps we can model the program as a series of constraints where each variable is assigned a value that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nBut how to extract these constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the stack operations as a series of equations. For example, each command before an '@' affects the stack in a way that determines the value of the variable.\n\nBut without knowing the exact stack state, it's hard to model.\n\nWait, perhaps the program can be executed symbolically. That is, instead of using actual numbers, we can represent variables as symbols and track their dependencies.\n\nFor example, if the program is '12@', the variable 'v' is assigned 3, as 1 + 2.\n\nIf the program is 'v@w@x', then 'v' is the top of the stack when the first '@' is encountered. Then 'w' is the top when the second '@' is encountered, and 'x' is the top when the third '@' is encountered.\n\nBut the stack's state is built from the commands before the '@'s. So, in 'v@w@x', the first '@' pops 'v' (which was pushed earlier), then 'w' is pushed, then 'x' is pushed. So, the values are assigned in the order 'v' is popped, then 'w', then 'x'.\n\nBut how does this translate into constraints on the variables?\n\nWait, perhaps for each '@', the variable's value is equal to the sum of all the pushes and pops before it. Or perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each '@' can be seen as a function that depends on the previous operations. For instance, in '12@', 'v' is 3. In 'v@w@x', 'v' is whatever was on the stack when the first '@' was encountered.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', \n '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', \n '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', \n '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\nSample Output:\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nWait, but each line in the input is a separate test case. So for each of these four strings, the output is either a sequence or 'false'.\n\nSo, the program needs to process each input string as a separate golorp and output the corresponding sequence.\n\nSo, the task is: for each given Befunge program string, determine the lex smallest sequence of variable values that satisfies the program, or output 'false' if it's impossible.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the program to find the constraints on the variables and find the lex smallest assignment.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: The Befunge program's execution can be thought of as a series of operations that manipulate the stack. Variables are the values on the stack at various points.\n\nEach '@' pops the top of the stack and assigns it to a variable. So, for the program to be valid, each '@' must pop a value that hasn't been used before in a conflicting way.\n\nBut this is still abstract.\n\nPerhaps we can model the program's behavior by replacing each '@' with the variable it refers to, and then determine the constraints on these variables based on the surrounding operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to represent each '@' as a function that depends on the previous commands. For example, if the program is 'a@b@c', then 'a' is the current top, then 'b' is the new top after a is popped, then 'c' is the new top after b is popped.\n\nSo, the value of 'a' is determined before 'b' and 'c', but 'b' and 'c' may depend on 'a' in some way.\n\nBut again, without knowing how the stack is manipulated, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another approach: for each '@', the variable's value is equal to the current stack top. The stack is modified by the commands before the '@'. So, the value of each variable is determined by the sequence of operations leading up to its '@'.\n\nBut how can we model this for all variables in a way that allows us to find their possible values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking whether the program can be evaluated without errors when variables are assigned in a certain way, and finding the lex smallest such assignment.\n\nBut since the variables can be any digits, this is a massive search space.\n\nHmm, perhaps the variables can be determined in the order of their last occurrence in the program. That is, the earliest '@'s refer to variables that are defined later, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the classic problem of solving expressions with variables, where each variable's value is determined by the context in which it's used.\n\nBut without more concrete ideas, perhaps I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, thinking about the constraints again: each '@' must pop a value, which is the variable's value. So, for the program to be valid, the stack must be in a state that allows each '@' to pop the correct value.\n\nBut the stack is built dynamically by the program's commands. So, for example, if the program is '123@', the variable is 6. If the program is 'v@w@x', then 'v' is popped first, then 'w', then 'x', so the stack must have those values in that order.\n\nWait, but in this case, the variables 'v', 'w', 'x' are all independent except for their order of assignment. So 'v' must be the value that was pushed before 'w' and 'x' were pushed.\n\nBut this doesn't impose any direct constraints beyond the order of assignment.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each variable's value is determined by the stack at the moment of the '@' command, which is influenced by all prior commands.\n\nSo, for each '@', the variable's value is equal to the current stack top, which is the result of executing all the commands before it.\n\nThus, the value of the variable is a function of the initial stack state and the program's commands.\n\nBut the initial stack state is empty. So, for each variable, its value is determined by the program's execution up to its '@' command, starting from an empty stack.\n\nBut how can we model this to find the variable assignments.\n\nWait, perhaps the program can be represented as a function that, when run with an initial stack, returns the values of the variables used in '@' commands.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding an initial stack (a list of variables) such that when the program runs, each '@' command pops the correct variable value, and the resulting assignment is lex smallest.\n\nBut the initial stack is a list of variables, each a digit. The order of the initial stack corresponds to the order in which variables are used.\n\nWait, but the initial stack is a stack, meaning that the first element is the top. So, when the program runs, each '@' pops the top of the stack.\n\nSo, the initial stack is a list of variable values, in the order they are pushed. The first element is the top of the stack.\n\nSo, for the program to be valid, the initial stack must be such that when the program is executed, each '@' pops the correct variable value, and all variables are assigned accordingly.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: find the lex smallest initial stack (as a string) such that the program, when run with this stack, successfully assigns all variables, and returns the assignment.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the initial stack can be represented as a list of digits, and the program can be simulated step by step, applying the commands and tracking the stack and variable assignments.\n\nBut simulating this for all possible initial stacks is impractical because the number of possibilities is enormous.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial stack can be determined by the constraints imposed by the '@' commands.\n\nEach '@' command imposes a constraint that the current top of the stack must be a certain value. But since the stack is built from the initial stack and the program's commands, perhaps we can model this as a series of equations.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose the initial stack is S = [s1, s2, ..., sn], where s1 is the top.\n\nAs the program runs, it executes commands that modify the stack. Each command is either a number (pushing it onto the stack) or an operation (+, -, *, etc.), or an '@' which pops the top and assigns it to a variable.\n\nSo, the initial stack S must be such that, when the program is executed, each '@' pops the correct value.\n\nThus, the problem is to find an initial stack S such that for each '@' in the program, the current top of the stack is equal to the value assigned to that variable.\n\nMoreover, the variables must be assigned values in such a way that the initial stack S is consistent with the program's operations.\n\nBut how can we model this.\n\nPerhaps the initial stack S can be considered as a function of the variables used in the program. Each '@' command in the program defines an equation that relates the variables in the initial stack to the values popped.\n\nWait, but this seems abstract.\n\nAlternative idea: represent the initial stack as a list of variables, and the program's commands as operations that manipulate this stack. Each '@' then pops the top and assigns it to a variable, which must match the variable's value.\n\nBut again, without knowing the program's effect, it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: the initial stack must be such that, for each '@' in the program, the current top of the stack is the value assigned to that variable. So, the initial stack must be arranged in such a way that, when the program is executed, each '@' pops the required value.\n\nBut how to model the program's effect on the stack.\n\nPerhaps the initial stack can be represented as a list of variables, and the program's commands can be processed step by step, modifying the stack and assigning variables.\n\nBut this approach would require processing the program for each possible initial stack, which is computationally infeasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a way to represent the constraints on the initial stack S without explicitly trying all possibilities.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of equations where each '@' imposes a constraint on the initial stack S.\n\nBut how.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose the initial stack is S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n], with s_1 being the top.\n\nAs the program runs, each command modifies the stack.\n\nWhen an '@' is encountered, the top of the stack is popped and assigned to a variable.\n\nThus, each '@' in the program corresponds to an equation: s_i = var_value, where var_value is the value popped at that step.\n\nBut the stack's state changes as the program runs, so s_i depends on the prior stack modifications.\n\nThus, the variables' values are linked through the program's commands.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations that can be solved to find the initial stack.\n\nBut the equations can be complex, depending on the program's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the program can be represented as a function that, given the initial stack, returns the variable assignments.\n\nOur goal is to find the lex smallest initial stack S such that when the function is applied, all '@' commands are satisfied.\n\nBut how to compute this function.\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the program as a series of operations and, for each '@', note which variable it refers to and what the current stack top must be.\n\nBut again, this is abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the program's execution as a series of transformations on the initial stack.\n\nEach command either pushes a value, performs an operation, or pops a value (for '@').\n\nSo, the initial stack S must be such that, after processing all commands, each '@' pops the correct variable value.\n\nBut how to find S.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial stack can be determined by the sequence of operations and the constraints imposed by the '@' commands.\n\nFor example, each '@' in the program requires that the current top of the stack is a certain value. So, the initial stack must be arranged so that, when the program is run, each '@' pops the required value.\n\nBut how to model the stack's evolution.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by working backwards.\n\nWe can model the initial stack as being built by the program's commands. Each '@' requires that the variable is popped from the stack, so the stack must have that variable's value at that point.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the initial stack is a list of digits, perhaps we can represent it as a string and generate all possible permutations, then check which one satisfies the program.\n\nBut for a 10-length initial stack, this is 10! = 3.6 million possibilities—manageable. But for longer stacks, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the maximum length of the initial stack depends on the program's complexity. For a 1000-character program, the initial stack could be very long, making this approach infeasible.\n\nThus, this approach is only suitable for small initial stack lengths.\n\nBut perhaps, given the problem constraints, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for a 10-length stack, it's 3.6e6 possibilities, which is manageable for a Python script. But for longer stacks, it's not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but what is the maximum possible length of the initial stack? It depends on the program. For example, in a program that does a lot of push operations, the initial stack could be quite long.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the constraints reduce the possible initial stacks significantly.\n\nSo, perhaps a BFS approach is possible, where each state represents the current stack and the variables assigned so far, and we explore possible initial stacks in lex order, checking whether the program can be satisfied.\n\nBut even this seems challenging, as the state space is huge.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires the lex smallest initial stack, perhaps we can generate the initial stack incrementally, trying digits from left to right, and for each choice, see if it's possible to complete the initial stack in a way that satisfies the program.\n\nThis is similar to generating the lex smallest string by trying digits in order and backtracking when a dead end is reached.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Generate the initial stack digit by digit, choosing the smallest possible digit at each position, and check if it's possible to complete the initial stack such that the program can be satisfied.\n\n2. Once a valid initial stack is found, return it as the lex smallest.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe challenge is, for a given partial initial stack, how to determine whether it's possible to complete it such that the program's constraints are met.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be addressed with memoization and pruning.\n\nBut implementing this efficiently is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial stack can be determined by the constraints imposed by the program's '@' commands.\n\nFor each '@', the variable's value is determined by the stack at that point. So, perhaps we can model the initial stack as a list of variables that must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nBut without a clear way to model these conditions, it's challenging.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the program can be run in a symbolic manner, tracking the dependencies between variables and the initial stack.\n\nEach '@' in the program would then impose a condition that the current top of the stack equals the variable's value. This would create a system of equations that can be solved.\n\nBut how to represent these equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the program can be represented as a function that, given the initial stack, returns the variable assignments. Then, for each possible initial stack, we can compute the variables and check for validity.\n\nBut again, this is computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but for the lex smallest initial stack, perhaps we can find the earliest position where a choice can be made, try the smallest possible digit, and proceed recursively.\n\nBut with memoization to avoid redundant checks.\n\nThis approach is known as backtracking with pruning.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Enumerate the initial stack digit by digit, from left to right.\n\n- At each step, try the smallest possible digit (0 first, then 1, etc.), and see if it's possible to complete the initial stack such that the program's constraints are satisfied.\n\n- Once a valid initial stack is found, return it.\n\nBut how to check feasibility.\n\nFor each partial initial stack, simulate the program's execution, keeping track of the stack and variable assignments, and see if all '@' commands are satisfied.\n\nBut this simulation must be done for each partial initial stack, which could be computationally expensive.\n\nBut given the constraints of the problem (each variable is 0-9), perhaps it's manageable for small initial stack lengths.\n\nBut for longer stacks, it's impractical.\n\nThus, this approach may work for small cases but not for larger ones.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects us to handle small cases, as per the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the initial stacks are 4 digits long, and the solution is found quickly.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is acceptable.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the input string into a list of commands.\n\n2. For each command, determine which variables are accessed via '@' and record their positions.\n\n3. Simulate the program for a given initial stack S, to see if all '@' commands are satisfied.\n\n4. Use a backtracking approach to find the lex smallest initial stack S that satisfies the program.\n\nBut how to efficiently implement this.\n\nFirst, the parsing step:\n\nThe input string represents the Befunge program. We need to process each character, noting when a '@' is encountered, and record the position of each variable.\n\nSo, for each '@', we note the index in the program where it occurs, and collect all the variables in order.\n\nAdditionally, we need to process the commands between '@'s to determine how the stack evolves.\n\nWait, but the program may have multiple '@'s, and the initial stack must be arranged such that each '@' pops the correct value.\n\nThus, the initial stack must be arranged in such a way that, after processing all commands before the first '@', the top of the stack is the value assigned to the first variable.\n\nSimilarly, after processing all commands between the first and second '@', the top of the stack must be the value assigned to the second variable, and so on.\n\nSo, the initial stack is a sequence of variables that, when the program is run, each '@' pops the correct variable.\n\nThus, the initial stack must be such that, after running the program up to the first '@', the top is the first variable's value.\n\nAfter that, the program's commands modify the stack, and when the second '@' is hit, the top must be the second variable's value, and so on.\n\nThus, the initial stack can be thought of as a series of segments, each leading up to an '@' command.\n\nEach segment consists of a series of commands (pushes, operations, etc.) followed by an '@' which captures the current top of the stack as the variable's value.\n\nThus, the initial stack must be such that, for each segment, the top of the stack after the segment's commands is the variable's value.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for each segment, the initial stack must be arranged such that, when the commands in the segment are run, the top of the stack is the variable's value.\n\nBut the initial stack is the same across all segments.\n\nThus, each segment imposes a constraint on the initial stack.\n\nThese constraints can be combined to form a system that must be satisfied by the initial stack.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to solving this system of constraints to find the lex smallest initial stack.\n\nBut how to model these constraints.\n\nEach segment can be represented as a function that takes the initial stack and returns the variable's value.\n\nThus, for the first segment (before the first '@'), the function is the identity function, as the initial stack is S. So the first variable's value is S[-1] (since S is a stack, the top is the last element).\n\nFor the second segment (between the first and second '@'), the function is the composition of the commands in that segment, which manipulates the stack. The result of this function, given the initial stack S, must be equal to the second variable's value.\n\nSimilarly, each subsequent segment applies a function to the initial stack, returning the variable's value.\n\nThus, the problem is to find an initial stack S such that, for each segment i, f_i(S) = v_i, where v_i is the value assigned to the ith variable.\n\nHere, f_i is the function representing the commands in the ith segment.\n\nOnce we have these functions, the problem is to find S that satisfies all f_i(S) = v_i for i=1..n.\n\nBut the v_i are variables that can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the variables are the '@' commands in the program, and each must be assigned a value. So, the v_i's are the variables to be determined.\n\nThus, the problem is to find an initial stack S and variable assignments such that for each i, f_i(S) = v_i.\n\nBut since S is the initial stack, which is a list of digits, this forms a system of equations.\n\nBut how to solve this.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each segment, we can represent f_i as a function that takes S and returns v_i.\n\nBut for each segment, the function f_i depends on the initial stack S and the commands in the segment.\n\nWait, but S is the initial stack, which is a list of digits. So, each f_i is a function from S to v_i.\n\nThus, the constraints are:\n\nf_1(S) = v_1\n\nf_2(S) = v_2\n\n...\n\nf_n(S) = v_n\n\nAnd each v_i is a digit between 0 and 9.\n\nBut S is also a list of digits, so each element of S is between 0 and 9.\n\nThus, the problem is to find S and the variables v_i such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations, but it's non-linear due to the functions f_i.\n\nBut perhaps, for each segment, f_i can be represented as a linear function of S.\n\nWait, for example, if a segment consists of a series of pushes and additions, then the function f_i could be a linear combination of the elements of S.\n\nBut this depends on the specific commands in the segment.\n\nThus, for each segment, we can precompute a function f_i(S) that can be expressed as a linear combination of S's elements, possibly with coefficients derived from the segment's commands.\n\nBut how.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nConsider a segment where the commands are '1+2*3+4@'.\n\nWhen this segment is run, starting from an initial stack S, the result is computed as follows:\n\n- Push 1 → stack becomes S + [1]\n\n- Add 1 and 2 → stack becomes S + [3]\n\n- Multiply 3 and 3 → stack becomes S + [9]\n\n- Add 4 → stack becomes S + [13]\n\n- Pop 13 → variable is 13.\n\nBut 13 is not a single digit, which is invalid. So, this segment would not contribute to a valid variable assignment.\n\nBut in our problem, the variables must be digits, so any function f_i(S) must produce a digit between 0 and 9.\n\nThus, for a segment to be valid, f_i(S) must be a digit.\n\nBut back to the function representation.\n\nIn the above example, the function f_i(S) is S[0] + S[1] + ... + S[k], multiplied by some coefficients.\n\nBut perhaps for each segment, the function f_i can be represented as a linear combination of the elements of S, with coefficients determined by the commands in the segment.\n\nIf this is the case, then the system of equations becomes a set of linear equations, which can be solved for S.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's consider that each element of S is a variable s_0, s_1, ..., s_{m-1}, where m is the length of S.\n\nThen, each segment i can be represented as a function f_i(s_0, s_1, ..., s_{m-1}) = v_i, which is a linear combination of the s_j's, possibly with coefficients derived from the segment's commands.\n\nIf this is the case, then the system can be represented as a matrix equation A * S = V, where A is the coefficient matrix, S is the vector of initial stack elements, and V is the vector of variable values.\n\nOnce this matrix is constructed, we can solve for S and V.\n\nBut how to compute the coefficients for each segment.\n\nHmm.\n\nEach command in a segment can be represented as an operation that transforms the stack. Pushing a number is straightforward—it adds a new element to the stack. Operations like '+', '-', '*' modify the top elements.\n\nBut when a segment ends with an '@', the function f_i is the top of the stack after processing all commands in the segment.\n\nThus, the function f_i is the result of applying the segment's commands to the initial stack S",
