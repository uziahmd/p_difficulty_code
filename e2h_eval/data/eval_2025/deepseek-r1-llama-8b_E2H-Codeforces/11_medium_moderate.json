A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some resources, and we need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given the available resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe are given the following variables:\n- n: number of friends.\n- k: number of bottles of soft drink.\n- l: milliliters per bottle.\n- c: number of limes.\n- d: slices per lime.\n- p: grams of salt.\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend.\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- Each friend needs nl ml of drink.\n- One slice of lime.\n- np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, all friends together require n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt.\n\nHmm, right. Because each friend makes one toast, so each needs their own slice and portion.\n\nSo the total resources:\n\n1. Drink: Each toast requires n * nl ml. The total drink available is k * l ml.\n   So maximum possible toasts from drink is (k * l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Lime slices: Each toast needs n slices. Since each lime has d slices, total slices available are c * d.\n   So maximum toasts from limes is (c * d) // n.\n\n3. Salt: Each toast requires n * np grams. Total salt is p grams.\n   So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values, because all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Calculate drink_max = (k * l) / (n * nl)\n- Calculate lime_max = (c * d) / n\n- Calculate salt_max = p / (n * np)\n- The answer is the minimum of these three, but since they are integer divisions, I should use floor division.\n\nWait, but in Python, using // does integer division, which automatically floors when the numerator is smaller than the denominator. But wait, what if the division isn't exact? For example, 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, but integer division gives 2. So that's correct because you can't have half a toast.\n\nSo, in code, I can compute each maximum as an integer by doing integer division.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the sample input to verify.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink = 4*5=20ml.\nnl=3 → per toast, each friend needs 3ml. So per toast, total drink needed is 3*3=9ml. So 20//9 = 2 (since 9*2=18 ≤20). So drink_max is 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). So 80//3=26 (since 3*26=78 ≤80). So lime_max is 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, np=1 → per toast, each friend needs 1g, so total per toast is 3g. So 100//3=33 (3*33=99 ≤100). So salt_max is 33.\n\nThe minimum among 2,26,33 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: \n\nSecond input is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5.\n\nDrink: 100 *10 = 1000 ml. Each toast needs 5 *4=20ml. 1000 //20 =50.\n\nLimes: 1*19=19 slices. Each toast needs 5 slices. 19//5=3 (5*3=15 ≤19). So 3.\n\nSalt: 90 grams. Each toast needs 5*3=15g. 90//15=6.\n\nMinimum is 3.\n\nThird input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10.\n\nDrink: 1000 *1000=1e6. Each toast needs 10*50=500ml. 1e6//500=2000.\n\nLimes: 25 *23=575 slices. Each toast needs 10 slices. 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: 1 gram. Each toast needs 10 *1=10g. 1//10=0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into integers.\n\nCompute each resource's maximum possible toasts, then take the minimum.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input line, split into variables.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n2. Compute drink_max = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n3. Compute lime_max = (c * d) // n\n\n4. Compute salt_max = p // (n * np)\n\n5. result = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n\n6. Output the result as a string.\n\nBut wait, what if any of these denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so denominators can't be zero. So no division by zero issues.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 20ml. n*nl=3*3=9. 20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → 80 slices. 80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 → 3*1=3. 100//3=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33)=2.\n\nOutput is '2'.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → 1000ml. 5*4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 →19 slices. 19//5=3.\n\np=90, np=3 →5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6)=3.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 →1e6ml. 10*50=500. 1e6//500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575 slices. 575//10=57.\n\np=1, np=1 →10*1=10. 1//10=0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo, now write the code.\n\nRead the variables, compute each max, find the min, print it as a string.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if n=1?\n\nLike, n=1, all resources would be divided by 1, so no change.\n\nAnother edge case: when any of the resources can't support even one toast.\n\nLike, when (k*l) < n*nl → drink_max is 0.\n\nSimilarly, if c*d <n → lime_max 0.\n\nOr p <n*np → salt_max 0.\n\nThus, the code handles all cases.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the output is the number of toasts each friend can make. So yes, the code is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must drink the same amount.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each toast requires:\n   - `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` ml).\n   - `n` slices of lime.\n   - `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams).\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Compute the maximum number of toasts possible with the available drink. This is done by dividing the total drink available (`k * l`) by the amount needed per toast (`n * nl`).\n   - **Lime Slices**: Compute the maximum number of toasts possible with the available lime slices. This is done by dividing the total lime slices available (`c * d`) by the number of slices needed per toast (`n`).\n   - **Salt**: Compute the maximum number of toasts possible with the available salt. This is done by dividing the total salt available (`p`) by the amount needed per toast (`n * np`).\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, the result is the minimum value among the three computed values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers representing the given variables.\n- **Compute Toasts for Each Resource**: Using integer division, we compute the maximum possible toasts for each resource based on the constraints.\n- **Determine the Result**: The minimum value among the three computed values gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends have enough resources to make the same number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required values using basic arithmetic operations and ensures that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
