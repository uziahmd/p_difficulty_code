    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where given a number m, I need to find all positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. Then, I have to output the count of such numbers and the numbers themselves in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and multiples of 25 contribute two, and so on. So the formula for trailing zeros is the sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, etc., until the division result is zero.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how can I find all possible n's for a given m? Because the function that gives the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all give exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nFor example, in the sample input where m is 1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! is 120 (one zero), 6! is 720 (one zero), and so on up to 9!. But then 10! has two zeros because it includes two 5's.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the lower bound and upper bound of n where the trailing zeros equal m.\n\nBut how do I find these bounds efficiently?\n\nI think a binary search approach would work here. Because the function of trailing zeros is strictly increasing as n increases. So, for a given m, there exists a certain n where the count is exactly m. But sometimes, there might be a range of n's that all have the same count.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the count increases when n crosses a multiple of 5. For example, between 4! and 5!, the count jumps from 0 to 1. Between 24! and 25!, it jumps from 4 to 6 (because 25 contributes an extra 5). So, sometimes, the count doesn't change for consecutive numbers. Wait, no—wait, 24! has 4 trailing zeros, 25! has 6. So the count increased by 2. So, for m=5, the numbers 25-29 will have 6 trailing zeros? No, wait: let me calculate.\n\nWait, 25! has 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → total 6 zeros. 26! also includes 26, which doesn't add another 5, so 6 zeros. Similarly, 29! will have 6 zeros because none of them are multiples of 5 beyond 25. But then 30! adds 30/5=6, which brings the count to 6 + 6 = 12? Or wait, wait:\n\nWait, 25! has 6 zeros. 26! same as 25! since 26 isn't a multiple of 5. So for n=25,26,27,28,29, the count is 6. Then n=30: 30/5=6, 30/25=1 → total 7. So the trailing zeros increase by 1 at 30.\n\nSo for m=6, the numbers 25,26,27,28,29 all have 6 zeros. So the output would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the way to find all n's is to find the first n where the count is m, and the last n where the count is m. Then, the numbers between them (inclusive) are all the required n's.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros in n! is at least m. Then, check if the count is exactly m. If not, perhaps m is too high, but wait, no—since for m=6, 25 is the first n where the count is 6.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find the minimal n where the count is >=m, and then see if that count equals m. If yes, then find the maximal n where the count is m. The numbers between minimal and maximal form the list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a binary search can be used to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n_low where the trailing zeros are >= m.\n- Check if the count for n_low is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions (but wait, that shouldn't happen because the function is non-decreasing).\nWait, no. Because for example, if m=100000, it's possible that no n has exactly that many zeros. Or wait, no. Because the function is always increasing, but each step may increase by more than 1.\n\nWait, no. The function is strictly increasing because each time you add a multiple of 5, it contributes at least one zero. So for any m, there exists a range of n's where the count is exactly m. So for any m, the output will have at least one n.\n\nWait, is that correct? Suppose m=3. Let's see:\n\nn=15: 15/5=3, 15/25=0 → total 3. So n=15 is in the solution set. Are there others?\n\nn=16: same as 15, because 16 isn't a multiple of 5. So 16 is included. Similarly, 17,18,19,20? Wait, wait, n=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → 4, which is higher than 3. So wait, no—then the count for n=15 is 3, and for n=16,17,18,19, it's still 3. So for m=3, the numbers 15,16,17,18,19 are the solution.\n\nSo yes, for any m, there is at least one n. So the initial approach is valid.\n\nSo, to find the lower bound (the first n with count >=m), but we need to check whether the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binary search can find the lower bound where the count is >=m, and the upper bound where the count is <=m. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a binary search to find the minimal n where the count is m. Then, find the maximum n where the count is m.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n. Let's think: the minimal n is the smallest n where count(n) == m.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal n is the largest n where count(n) == m.\n\nBut how to find these using binary search.\n\nWait, perhaps for the minimal n, I can perform a binary search between some lower and upper bounds, and find the minimal n where count(n) == m.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for the maximal n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the n where count(n) == m and count(n+1) > m, and then include all n's from the lower bound to this n.\n\nWait, let's think about how the counts change. For a certain m, the numbers n for which count(n) == m form a consecutive sequence. So once I find the minimal n where count(n) == m, I can find the next n where count(n) > m, and the previous n where count(n) < m. Then, all numbers in between are the solution.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have a multiple of 25, 125, etc., the count can increase by more than 1. So for example, n=24 has count 4, n=25 has count 6. So for m=5, there is no solution because 25 is the first n where count is 6, and before that, the count was 4.\n\nSo, in that case, the output would be zero, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows m=1, and the output is 5 numbers. So for m=5, perhaps there are no numbers n with exactly 5 trailing zeros, but wait, no.\n\nWait, let me compute count(25):\n\ncount(25) = 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → total 6.\n\nWhat about 24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0 → 4.\n\nSo for m=5, there is no n where count(n) is 5. So the output would be zero.\n\nWait, but the sample input says m=1, which has 5,6,7,8,9. So for m=1, the output is 5 numbers.\n\nSo, in general, for some m, there is no n that satisfies count(n) = m. So the output could be zero.\n\nSo, the problem is: for a given m, find all n where count(n) = m. If none, output zero and nothing else.\n\nSo the first step is to find if there exists any n with count(n) = m.\n\nThen, if such n exists, collect all the consecutive n's starting from the first occurrence of m, up to the last occurrence before the count increases beyond m.\n\nSo, how to find the first n where count(n) = m.\n\nWe can perform a binary search for the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but binary search requires that the function is monotonic. Since count(n) is strictly increasing, for a given m, the count can be found, but the way to find the first occurrence is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use binary search to find the leftmost n where count(n) >=m, then check if count(n) is m. If yes, then find the rightmost n where count(n) is m.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where count(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Check if count(low) == m. If not, then no solution.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose m=5. Then, the smallest n where count(n)>=5 is 25, but count(25)=6>5. So in that case, there is no solution.\n\nSo, in that case, the code should output 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Binary search to find the first n where count(n) >=m. Let's call this low.\n\n- Compute count(low). If it's greater than m, then no solution.\n\nWait, no. Because for m=5, the count(25) is 6>5, but for m=6, it's 6.\n\nSo, if count(low) > m, then no solution.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nOnce we have low, we need to find the highest n where count(n) ==m.\n\nSo, perhaps another binary search can find the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, after finding low, we can incrementally check higher n's until count exceeds m.\n\nBut that could be time-consuming for large m.\n\nAnother approach is to use binary search for the upper bound.\n\nWait, let's think: the numbers n that satisfy count(n) ==m are a consecutive range. So, once we have the low, we can find the smallest n where count(n) >m, and subtract 1. That would give us the upper bound.\n\nYes, because the count is non-decreasing. So, the first occurrence where count(n) >m is the next n after the last n with count m.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1, the first n where count(n) >1 is 10. So the upper bound is 10-1=9.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find the minimal n (low) where count(n) >=m.\n\n- If count(low) !=m → no solution.\n\n- Else, find the smallest n where count(n) >m → call it high.\n\n- The numbers from low to high-1 are all the n's that satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Implement a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    res =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\n2. Binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Let's call this low.\n\n   How?\n\n   We can set low to 0 and high to 5*m, because 5*m is an upper bound. Because 5*m will contribute at least m zeros.\n\n   Then perform binary search:\n\n   while low < high:\n\n       mid = (low + high)//2\n\n       c = count_zeros(mid)\n\n       if c < m:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid\n\n   After the loop, low is the minimal n where count >=m.\n\n3. Check if count_zeros(low) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\n4. Else, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >m. Let's call this high.\n\n   Again, binary search:\n\n   low_high = low\n\n   high_high = 5*(m+1)  # or some higher value.\n\n   while low_high < high_high:\n\n       mid = (low_high + high_high)//2\n\n       c = count_zeros(mid)\n\n       if c >m:\n\n           high_high = mid\n\n       else:\n\n           low_high = mid +1\n\n   Now, high is high_high -1.\n\n5. Collect all numbers from low to high, inclusive.\n\n6. Output the count and the numbers.\n\nNow, testing this logic with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nStep 1: find low.\n\nlow starts as 0.\n\nWe perform binary search between 0 and 5*1=5.\n\nLet me see:\n\nmid=2: count is 0.\n\nSo low becomes 3.\n\nmid=4: count is 0.\n\nlow becomes 5.\n\nmid=5: count is 1>=1 → high=5.\n\nLoop ends with low=5.\n\nCheck count(5)=1 → yes.\n\nThen, find high where count(n)>1.\n\nSet low_high=5, high_high=5*(1+1)=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nmid=7: count(7)=1 → not >1 → set low_high=8.\n\nmid=(8+10)/2=9: count(9)=1 → no.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9 → same.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should re-examine the binary search for the upper bound.\n\nWait, for step 4, the binary search is looking for the first n where count(n) >m.\n\nSo, in this case, m=1. We need to find the first n where count(n) >1.\n\nWhich is n=10, since 10/5=2, count=2>1.\n\nSo, during the binary search:\n\nlow_high=5, high_high=10.\n\nmid=7: count is 1<=1 → set low_high=8.\n\nmid= (8+10)/2=9: count is 1 <=1 → low_high=10.\n\nNow, low_high == high_high=10. Loop exits.\n\nhigh is 10-1=9.\n\nSo, the numbers are from 5 to9, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nCompute low:\n\nbinary search for low where count >=5.\n\nLooking for numbers where count is 5.\n\nWait, what is count(20)? 20/5=4, 20/25=0 →4.\n\ncount(24): 24/5=4, 24/25=0 →4.\n\ncount(25):5+1=6>5.\n\nSo, low would be 25.\n\nBut count(25) is 6>5 → no solution. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nFind low where count >=6.\n\ncount(25)=6 → so low is 25.\n\nCheck count is 6.\n\nThen, find the first n where count(n)>6.\n\ncount(30):30/5=6, 30/25=1 → total 7>6.\n\nSo, high is 30-1=29.\n\nSo the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input m.\n\nThen, implement the helper function.\n\nImplement the binary search for low.\n\nIf count is not equal to m, output 0.\n\nElse, perform another binary search to find the first n where count>n.\n\nCollect the numbers from low to high-1.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nDefine count_zeros(n).\n\nFunction to find low.\n\nIf count_zeros(low) !=m → print 0.\n\nElse, find high.\n\nNumbers are [low, ..., high-1].\n\nPrint the count and the numbers.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string, like ['1', '5'] in the sample, which suggests that the input is read as a single line split into parts.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is an integer m. So, in code, perhaps read via input().strip(), then convert to integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as ['1','5'], but that's probably a typo, because the actual input is a single integer.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The only line of input contains an integer m\". So, in code, m = int(input().strip())\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplement count_zeros:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        cnt +=n\n    return cnt\n\nBut for n=0, returns 0.\n\nNow, binary search for low.\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5 * m  # because 5*m is a multiple of 5, so count >= m.\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) //2\n\n    c = count_zeros(mid)\n\n    if c < m:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid\n\nAfter loop, low is the minimal n where count >=m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(low) !=m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n    find high where count >m.\n\n    low_high = low\n\n    high_high = 5*(m+1)  # because count(5*(m+1)) is at least m+1.\n\n    while low_high < high_high:\n\n        mid = (low_high + high_high)//2\n\n        c = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if c >m:\n\n            high_high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low_high = mid +1\n\n    high = high_high -1\n\n    numbers = list(range(low, high+1))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'—so the first line is the count, followed by the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo, the code needs to print the count, then a new line, then the numbers separated by spaces, then a new line.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nSo, for m=1, the first output is 5, followed by the five numbers.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, it's shown as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' for the first case, which implies that the first line is the count, followed by the second line being the numbers.\n\nWait, no, the sample shows that the output is a list of two strings, the first being '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and the second being '0'. So, that suggests that the first line is the count, and the second line is the space-separated numbers.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the actual output is a single line with the count, then a new line, then the numbers separated by spaces, and another new line. Or perhaps, the output is two lines: the first line is the count, the second line is the numbers.\n\nWait, looking at the sample output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nSo, the output is a list of two elements. The first element is a string that represents the count followed by the numbers, with a newline separating them. The second element is the output for the second test case (probably m=5, which has output 0).\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is illustrative, but perhaps the actual problem expects that for each test case, you output the count followed by the numbers in a single line, separated by spaces.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"print k — the number of values of n such that ... Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\nSo, the output is two lines: first line is k, second line is the k numbers separated by spaces.\n\nWait, no. Looking back:\n\nProblem statement says: \"First print k — the number of values of n ... Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\nSo, the output is two lines: the first line is k, the second line is the k numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo, in the sample, the first case outputs 5, followed by the five numbers on the next line.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's presented as a list of two strings: the first is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which seems to combine the count and the numbers into one line, but perhaps that's just the representation.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is to print the count on the first line, and the numbers on the second line, each separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for the first test case, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, two lines.\n\nIn code, after collecting the numbers:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nSo, for the first test case, the code would output 5 on the first line, then 5 6 7 8 9 on the next.\n\nSo, the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif the count is found, then:\n\nk = high - low +1\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high+1))))\n\nElse:\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in the case where m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo, no need to handle m=0.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nImplement count_zeros.\n\nBinary search for low.\n\nCheck count.\n\nIf no, print 0.\n\nElse, find high.\n\nCollect numbers.\n\nPrint k and the numbers.\n\nNow, test cases.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nAs before, the code finds low=5, count is 1.\n\nHigh is 9.\n\nSo, numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nPrint 5, then 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nTest case 2: m=5.\n\nLow is 25, count is 6>5 → output 0.\n\nTest case 3: m=6.\n\nLow is 25, count is 6.\n\nFind high where count>6: 30.\n\nhigh_high is 30-1=29.\n\nSo, numbers are 25-29.\n\nSo, output is 5, then 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nLow is 15, count is 3.\n\nFind high where count>3: 20.\n\nhigh=20-1=19.\n\nSo, numbers 15-19.\n\nCount is 5.\n\nSo, output is 5, then 15 16 17 18 19.\n\nAnother test case: m=0 → but according to the problem, m is >=1.\n\nSo, code is okay.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if m=0? Well, according to the problem, m is at least 1, so code doesn't need to handle that.\n\n- For very large m, say m=1e5, the binary search should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the high for the first binary search is 5*m.\n\nIs that sufficient?\n\nBecause 5*m will have at least m factors of 5, but perhaps higher numbers may have more.\n\nWait, for example, m=6.\n\n5*6=30. 30 has count 7.\n\nBut the low is 25, which is less than 30.\n\nWait, but the binary search would find the correct low.\n\nSo, the initial high is 5*m, which is an upper bound.\n\nYes, because 5*m has count >=m.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nAnother point: for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nWait, let's compute count(10)=10/5=2 → count is 2.\n\ncount(14): same as 10, since 14 isn't a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nSo, for m=2, the code should output 5 numbers.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet this criterion using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is given by the sum of \\( n \\) divided by 5, \\( n \\) divided by 25, \\( n \\) divided by 125, and so on.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as `low`) such that the count of trailing zeroes in \\( low! \\) is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Once `low` is found, use another binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as `high`) such that the count of trailing zeroes in \\( high! \\) is greater than \\( m \\). The upper bound for our solution will be `high - 1`.\n\n3. **Validation and Range Extraction**: After determining `low`, check if the count of trailing zeroes at `low` is exactly \\( m \\). If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values. Otherwise, extract all integers between `low` and `high - 1` inclusive, as these are the values of \\( n \\) that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        cnt += n\n    return cnt\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\n# Find the lower bound where count >= m\nlow = 0\nhigh = 5 * m  # Initial high estimate\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    c = count_zeros(mid)\n    if c < m:\n        low = mid + 1\n    else:\n        high = mid\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find the first n where count > m\n    low_high = low\n    high_high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low_high < high_high:\n        mid = (low_high + high_high) // 2\n        c = count_zeros(mid)\n        if c > m:\n            high_high = mid\n        else:\n            low_high = mid + 1\n    high = high_high - 1\n    k = high - low + 1\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **count_zeros Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by 5 and summing the quotients.\n- **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: This step ensures we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n- **Validation Check**: After finding the lower bound, we verify if it indeed results in exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, the result is zero.\n- **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: This step finds the point where the count of trailing zeroes exceeds \\( m \\), helping us determine the upper limit of our valid range.\n- **Range Extraction and Output**: The valid \\( n \\) values are those between the lower and upper bounds (inclusive), which are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles large values of \\( m \\) effectively.",
