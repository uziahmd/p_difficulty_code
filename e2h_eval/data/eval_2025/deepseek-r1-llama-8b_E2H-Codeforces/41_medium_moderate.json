There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm. The input gives n spots, each can have a height between 0 and h. For each spot, if the height is a, we get a² profit. The restrictions are that in each range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a problem where for each spot, I need to decide the height, but ensuring all the restrictions are satisfied. But since the restrictions are on ranges, it's not just individual spots but overlapping ranges.\n\nWait, the constraints are small: n, h, m up to 50. So maybe a dynamic programming approach or trying all possibilities could work.\n\nLet me think about what variables are involved. Each spot has a height, and each restriction affects a range. So, for each spot i, the height a_i must satisfy all restrictions that include i in their range. But some restrictions might overlap, meaning a spot could be part of multiple restrictions.\n\nFor example, in the sample, spot 3 is part of two restrictions: one from 2-3 and another from 3-4. So both restrictions apply to spot 3, meaning its height must be at most the minimum of both x_i values of the applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, yes! Because if spot i is covered by multiple restrictions, each of those restrictions imposes a maximum height for that spot. So the actual maximum allowed height for spot i is the minimum of all x_j where the restriction j covers i.\n\nSo first, for each spot i, I can compute the effective maximum height as the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that include i in their [l_j, r_j] range.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a restriction's x_j applies to the entire range l_j to r_j. So any spot in that range cannot exceed x_j. Therefore, for a spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_j among all restrictions that cover i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each spot i, compute the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i. Then, the maximum height for i is min(h, min_x_for_i). Wait, no, because h is the global maximum. So the effective maximum for i is min( h, min_x_i ), where min_x_i is the minimal x_j across all restrictions covering i.\n\nWait, no. Because h is the maximum possible for each spot, regardless of restrictions. So each spot's height can't exceed h, but also can't exceed any x_j for restrictions that include it.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and the minimum of x_j for all j where l_j <=i <=r_j.\n\nSo first, I can precompute for each spot i the effective maximum height. Let's call this max_height[i].\n\nOnce I have max_height[i], then the problem becomes: assign a height a_i to each spot, such that a_i <= max_height[i], and maximize the sum of a_i squared.\n\nAh! Because each a_i is bounded by max_height[i], which is the minimal of the relevant x_j and h. So the problem reduces to choosing a_i in 0..max_height[i] to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis is a much simpler problem. Now, how do I choose each a_i to maximize the sum of squares, given their individual upper bounds?\n\nI remember that for maximizing the sum of squares, each term should be as large as possible, subject to their constraints. So, for each spot, the optimal a_i is either 0 or the maximum allowed. Because the square function is increasing for non-negative integers. So, to maximize the sum, each a_i should be set to the maximum possible.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because for a single variable, the maximum of x² is achieved when x is as large as possible.\n\nYes, because for x >=0, x² is an increasing function. So, for each spot, setting a_i to the maximum allowed (max_height[i]) will give the maximum possible contribution.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to set each a_i to max_height[i]. Then, the total profit is the sum of a_i squared for all i.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute the effective maximum height, which is the minimum of h and all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j].\n\n2. Sum the squares of these effective maximum heights.\n\nThat's the plan. So the problem reduces to computing for each i the min_x_i, then setting a_i = min(max_height[i], h), but wait, no: the max_height[i] is already min over x_j and h. So a_i is exactly max_height[i].\n\nSo now, the main task is to process all the restrictions and for each spot i, find the minimal x_j among all restrictions that include i.\n\nHow to compute this efficiently?\n\nSince n is small (up to 50), I can for each spot i, iterate through all m restrictions and check if i is in [l_j, r_j]. For each such j, collect x_j, then take the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, for each spot, collect all x_j where l_j <=i <=r_j, then the effective maximum is min(h, min(x_j)).\n\nSo let's think about how to implement this.\n\nWe can create an array effective_max of size n+1 (since spots are 1-based) initialized to h. Then, for each restriction, we look at the interval [l_j, r_j], and for each spot i in this interval, we take the minimum between current effective_max[i] and x_j. Wait, no. Because for each spot i in the interval, the restriction says that the maximum height is at most x_j. So the effective maximum for i is the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that include i.\n\nBut processing each spot for each restriction may be feasible since n and m are small.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\nInitialize effective_max[i] = h for all i.\n\nFor each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   current_min = x\n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n       if current_min < effective_max[i]:\n\n           effective_max[i] = current_min\n\nSo for each restriction, we go through each spot in its range and update their effective_max[i] to the minimum between their current value and x.\n\nWait, no. Because for a particular spot i, if it's included in multiple restrictions, each time a new restriction is processed, we take the minimum between the existing effective_max[i] and the new x.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because each new restriction can further lower the maximum allowed height for spot i.\n\nSo, processing each restriction in order and updating each spot in the range seems manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- Initialize effective_max array with h for all spots.\n\n- For each of the m restrictions:\n\n   Read l, r, x.\n\n   For i from l to r:\n\n       if x < effective_max[i]:\n\n           effective_max[i] = x\n\nBecause taking the smaller x ensures that all subsequent restrictions are considered.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, each effective_max[i] holds the minimal x among all applicable restrictions, capped at h.\n\nThen, for each spot i, the optimal a_i is effective_max[i], and the total profit is sum(a_i^2).\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\neffective_max = [h] * (n+1)  # assuming 1-based indexing.\n\nfor each of m restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if x < effective_max[i]:\n\n            effective_max[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 1..n:\n\n    sum += effective_max[i]^2\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but in Python, the exponent operator is **, not ^. So that's a typo to fix.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitially, effective_max = [3,3,3,3]\n\nProcess first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1.\n\ni=1: effective_max[1] is min(3,1) → 1.\n\neffective_max now: [3,1,3,3]\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3.\n\ni=2: effective_max[2] is min(3,3) → 3.\n\nNo change.\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3, x=2.\n\ni=3: effective_max[3] is min(3, 2) → 2.\n\nSo after all, effective_max is [3,1,3,2]. But wait, the indices are 0,1,2,3. So for spots 1,2,3, the effective_max is 1,3,2.\n\nWait, no. Let's reindex correctly. Because in the code, effective_max is 1-based, right? Because the spots are labeled 1 to n.\n\nSo for the first sample, after processing:\n\nspot 1: 1\n\nspot 2:3\n\nspot3:2\n\nSo the sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 =1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo effective_max starts as [10,10,10,10,10].\n\nProcessing first restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8.\n\nFor i=2: effective_max[2] = min(10,8)=8.\n\ni=3: min(10,8)=8.\n\nNow effective_max is [10,8,8,10,10].\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7.\n\ni=3: current effective_max[3] is 8. x=7 is smaller. So set to 7.\n\ni=4: effective_max[4] is min(10,7)=7.\n\nSo final effective_max for spots 1-4:\n\nspot1:10\n\nspot2:8\n\nspot3:7\n\nspot4:7\n\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this logic works.\n\nSo the code should read n, h, m.\n\nInitialize effective_max as [h]*(n+1), since spots are 1-based.\n\nThen, for each of the m restrictions, read l, r, x, and for each i from l to r, set effective_max[i] to min(effective_max[i], x).\n\nFinally, sum the squares.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is not covered by any restriction? Like in the second sample, spot1 is only limited by h, so it's 10.\n\nWhat if multiple overlapping restrictions for a spot. Like spot5 is covered by a restriction with x=5 and another with x=3. Then effective_max would be 3.\n\nSo, the code handles that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1, l=1, r=1, x=0. Then the only spot can be 0, profit is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Restriction 1: l=1, r=2, x=5. Restriction 2: l=1, r=2, x=3. Then effective_max[1 and 2] would be min(5,3) =3, so sum is 3² +3²= 18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nSo now, write the Python code.\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines.\n\nWait, in the input description, the first line is three integers, then each of the next m lines contains three integers.\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'].\n\nWait, actually, the sample input is written in a way that shows two separate cases, but probably in the actual code, the input is read via standard input, which is typically read as a single string split into lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is miswritten. Or perhaps in the actual code, the input is read as n, h, m, then m lines.\n\nSo in the code, it's better to read the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen for each of the m lines, read l, r, x.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\neffective_max = [h] * (n+1)  # indexes 0..n, but 0 unused\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if effective_max[i] > x:\n\n            effective_max[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum( (a*a) for a in effective_max[1:] )\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, because effective_max[1], effective_max[2], ... effective_max[n] are the heights for spots 1 to n.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the samples.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nAfter processing, effective_max[1]=1, 2=3,3=2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSecond sample: effective_max[1]=10, 2=8,3=7,4=7.\n\nSum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=0. Then effective_max is [h], so profit is h².\n\nIf m=0, the code reads zero lines, so nothing is done beyond initializing effective_max.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when x is zero? Like l=1, r=1, x=0: effective_max[1] becomes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if a restriction's x is higher than h? Like x=20, h=10. Then effective_max[i] remains 10 because x is 20>10, so min(10,20) is 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house's height contributes to the profit as the square of its height, and we must adhere to specific height constraints in certain ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given `n` spots on a street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and `h`. Additionally, there are `m` restrictions that limit the maximum height of houses in specific ranges. The goal is to maximize the total profit from these houses while respecting all restrictions.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each spot, the maximum allowable height is determined by the minimum value of `h` and all applicable restrictions. This means for each spot, we need to consider the smallest height constraint imposed by any restriction that affects it.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize an array `effective_max` where each element represents the maximum allowable height for the corresponding spot, initially set to `h`.\n   - For each restriction, update the maximum allowable heights for all spots within the specified range to be the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n   - Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the effective maximum heights for all spots.\n\n4. **Complexity**: Given the constraints (n, h, m up to 50), this approach runs efficiently with a time complexity of O(m * n), which is feasible for the given limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\neffective_max = [h] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if effective_max[i] > x:\n            effective_max[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum(a * a for a in effective_max[1:])\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n- **Initialization**: The `effective_max` array is initialized to `h` for all spots.\n- **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate over the specified range and update each spot's maximum allowable height to the minimum of the current value and the restriction's height.\n- **Calculating Profit**: Sum the squares of the effective maximum heights for all spots to get the total profit, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit from building the houses.",
