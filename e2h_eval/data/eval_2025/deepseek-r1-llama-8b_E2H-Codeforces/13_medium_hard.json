For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. These are arranged cyclically, meaning after H comes C again. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So, each step from one note to the next adds a semitone.\n\nA major triad has three notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3. So overall, X to Z is 7 semitones. A minor triad has X-Y as 3 semitones and Y-Z as 4, making X-Z 7 as well.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is an unordered set, so we can arrange the three notes in any order to see if they fit either pattern.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible permutation of the three notes, compute all possible adjacent distances and check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nWait, but since the triad is unordered, perhaps we should consider all possible orderings and see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal way is to sort the notes in a certain way and then compute the intervals.\n\nWait, but how are the notes represented? Each note is a string like 'C', 'C#', etc. So first, I think I need to assign each note to its position in the 12-note scale. For example, C is position 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11.\n\nSo the first step is to create a mapping from note names to their positions. That's straightforward.\n\nOnce I have the numerical representations, I can compute the distances between them.\n\nBut since the order matters for computing the distances, I'll have to consider all possible orderings of the three notes and compute the possible intervals.\n\nWait, but for three notes, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings. For each ordering, I can check if the first two notes have a distance of 4 (for major) and the next two have a distance of 3, or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to compute all possible cyclic permutations and find the correct distances.\n\nWait, another idea: for the three notes, when arranged in some circular order, the distances between consecutive notes modulo 12 must sum up to 7 semitones. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible permutation of the three notes, compute the distances between the first and second, second and third, and sum them. Then, check if the first and second form 4 and the second and third form 3 (major), or 3 and 4 (minor). Or perhaps, in any permutation, the two adjacent pairs sum to 7, but the individual distances determine whether it's major or minor.\n\nHmm, no. Because for a major chord, the intervals are 4 and 3, adding up to 7. For a minor chord, they're 3 and 4, also adding to 7.\n\nSo for any trio of notes, when arranged in an order where the first two have a distance of 4 and the next two have a distance of 3, it's a major chord. Similarly, if any arrangement has the first two at 3 and the next two at 4, it's minor.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create a dictionary mapping each note to its index (like C=0, C#=1, etc.)\n2. Take the three input notes, convert them to their indices.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three indices.\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z), calculate the distance from x to y (mod 12), and y to z (mod 12).\n5. Check if any permutation has (d1, d2) equal to (4,3) → major, or (3,4) → minor.\n6. If exactly one of major or minor is satisfied by any permutation, output accordingly. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nWait, but what about the arrangement where the distance could wrap around? For example, if the notes are H, C, E. H is 11, C is 0, E is 4. So the distance from H to C is 1 (since 0-11 mod 12 is 1, but wait, no—distance is measured from lower to higher. Wait, the problem says the distance is taken from the lower tone to the upper. So between two notes X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but only considering the positive direction.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The distance between X and Y is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, because Y comes after X. So for X=H (11) and Y=C (0), the distance would be (0 -11) mod 12 = 1 semitone. So, for example, H to C is 1 semitone.\n\nSimilarly, E to C is (0-4) mod 12 = 8 semitones.\n\nSo, in code, the distance between two notes is (y - x) % 12.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we compute the two distances: d1 = (y - x) % 12, d2 = (z - y) % 12.\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nSo for each permutation, we check these two possibilities.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n2. Read the three input notes, split into a list.\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\n3. Convert each note to its index.\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\n4. Generate all 6 permutations of the three indices.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = list(permutations(indices))\n\n5. For each permutation, check the two distances.\n\nFor each perm in perms:\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        return 'major'\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        return 'minor'\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so we don't have to handle cases where both major and minor are possible.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nLoop through all permutations:\n\nCheck for major condition, if found, mark as major.\n\nCheck for minor condition, if found, mark as minor.\n\nIf neither is found after checking all permutations, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, for a given permutation, it's possible that both major and minor could be satisfied. Like, is that possible?\n\nNo, because the problem states that the answer is always unambiguous. So, for any given set of three notes, it's impossible for both major and minor to be satisfied in any permutation. So, during the checking, as soon as we find a major or minor, we can break early.\n\nWait, but perhaps a triad could satisfy both conditions in different permutations. But according to the problem statement, that's not possible.\n\nSo, for our code, perhaps we can process each permutation, and once we find a major, we can immediately return 'major' and stop processing. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps we need to check all permutations until we find the first occurrence of major or minor.\n\nWait, but the problem says the answer is unique, so if a triad is major, no permutation will make it minor, and vice versa.\n\nSo, in the code, we can loop through all permutations, and for each, check if it satisfies major or minor condition. If any permutation satisfies major, then the chord is major. Otherwise, check if any permutation satisfies minor. If yes, it's minor. Else, it's strange.\n\nWait, but maybe a single permutation can satisfy both? No, because 4+3=7 and 3+4=7, but for a permutation, d1 and d2 are fixed. So, for a permutation, if d1=4 and d2=3, it's major. It can't also be minor, because that would require d1=3 and d2=4, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, we can check if it's major, else check if it's minor.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nWe can have a variable result, initially set to 'strange'.\n\nThen, for each permutation:\n\nCompute d1 and d2.\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3:\n\n   Set result to 'major' and break all loops.\n\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is4:\n\n   Set result to 'minor' and break all loops.\n\nAfter checking all permutations, output the result.\n\nBut wait, what if multiple permutations satisfy the condition for major or minor? Since the problem says the answer is unique, it's guaranteed that at most one condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnotes = input().split()\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'])}\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) %12\n    d2 = (z - y) %12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major:\n    print('major')\nelif is_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n\nWait, but this code will break as soon as it finds a major or minor. But what if, in another permutation, it also finds the same condition?\n\nLike, suppose in the first permutation, it finds major, but in another permutation, it also finds minor. But according to the problem statement, that's impossible, so the code is safe.\n\nBut in reality, for a valid chord, it's either major, minor, or strange. So, in the code, once any permutation satisfies major, we can break early.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nExample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nLet's see each triad.\n\nFirst triad: C, E, G.\n\nIndices: C is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nLooking at permutations:\n\nOne permutation is 0,4,7.\n\nd1 = 4-0 =4, d2=7-4=3 → 4 and3. So this is major.\n\nSo, the code returns 'major' correctly.\n\nSecond triad: C#, B, F.\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for a permutation where d1=4 and d2=3, or d1=3 and d2=4.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nPossible permutations:\n\n1,10,5.\n\nd1=(10-1)=9 mod12=9. Not 4 or3.\n\nAnother permutation: 1,5,10.\n\nd1=5-1=4, d2=10-5=5. So d1=4, d2=5: not matching.\n\nAnother permutation:10,1,5.\n\nd1=(1-10) mod12= (1-10) is -9, mod12 is 3. d2=(5-1)=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4. So this permutation satisfies minor.\n\nSo the code will find this and mark as minor.\n\nThird triad: A, B, H.\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nPermutation 9,10,11.\n\nd1=1, d2=1. Doesn't match.\n\nAnother permutation: 10,11,9.\n\nd1=1, d2= (9-11) mod12= (9-11 +12) =10. Not.\n\nAnother permutation: 11,9,10.\n\nd1=(9-11) mod12=10. d2=(10-9)=1. Not.\n\nAnother permutation: 9,11,10.\n\nd1=(11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)=11 mod12=11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 11,10,9.\n\nd1= (10-11) mod12= 11, d2= (9-10) mod12=11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 10,9,11.\n\nd1= (9-10) mod12=11, d2=(11-9)=2.\n\nNot matching.\n\nSo none of the permutations satisfy major or minor, so the output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say, C, E, G: as above, it's major.\n\nAnother test case: C, D#, G.\n\nWait, C is 0, D# is 3, G is7.\n\nWhat's the permutation? Let's see: 0,3,7.\n\nd1=3, d2=4. So 3 and4: minor.\n\nSo this would be minor.\n\nAnother test case: E, G, C.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nIn permutation 4,7,0.\n\nd1=3, d2= (0-7) mod12=5. Not.\n\nAnother permutation:4,0,7.\n\nd1=(0-4) mod12=8. No.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation:7,4,0.\n\nd1=(4-7) mod12= (4-7) is -3 → 9. No.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to try all permutations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test all possible cases.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with writing the code as per the logic.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The note_to_index mapping is correct.\n\nWait, the note_order is as given: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should correctly map each note.\n\nAnother potential issue: when the distances wrap around.\n\nLike, H is 11, and the next note is C (0). So distance is 1.\n\nWhich is correctly handled by (y-x) mod12.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nSo now, write the Python code.\n\nMake sure to import permutations.\n\nRead the three notes, split into a list.\n\nConvert each note to its index.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nCheck each permutation.\n\nIf any permutation leads to a major or minor, set the result.\n\nFinally, output accordingly.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The problem is based on the distances between consecutive notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: First, we map each note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale. This helps us convert note names into numerical indices for easier distance calculations.\n2. **Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the type of triad, we generate all possible permutations of the three given notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes. A major triad is identified if the distances are 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor triad is identified if the distances are 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Check Conditions**: We check each permutation to see if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation satisfies the condition, we classify the triad accordingly. If none fit, the triad is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Read input\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Convert notes to their indices\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\n# Check all permutations of the three notes\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major:\n    print('major')\nelif is_minor:\n    print('minor')\nelse:\n    print('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: We create a dictionary to map each note to its respective index in the 12-note scale. This allows us to convert note names into numerical values for distance calculations.\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Using the `itertools.permutations` function, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes. This ensures we consider every possible arrangement to find the correct triad type.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Condition Checking**: We check each permutation to see if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. If a permutation satisfies either condition, we classify the triad and stop further checks. If no permutation fits, we classify the triad as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the notes to accurately determine the type of triad, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases.",
