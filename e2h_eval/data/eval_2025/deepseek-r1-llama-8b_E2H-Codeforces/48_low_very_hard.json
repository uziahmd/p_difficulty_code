            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals, and handling other bases.\n\nFirst, let me understand the input. The first line is a and b, which are integers. But b could be 'R', which signifies that we're dealing with Roman numerals. Then the next line is c in base a. My task is to convert this c into base b, but if b is R, then output the Roman numeral representation.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n2. Read the number c in base a.\n3. If b is R, then convert c (from base a) to its Roman numeral equivalent.\n4. Else, convert c (base a) to base b as a string without leading zeros.\n\nNow, the challenges are:\n\n- How to handle the conversion between different numeral systems, especially considering that Roman numerals have specific rules for their representations.\n- Implementing the Roman numeral conversion correctly, including subtractive notation for certain values like IV, IX, etc.\n- Handling large numbers, since the input c can be up to 103 digits long, which is a big number. So, I need an efficient way to process this without running into performance issues.\n\nLet's break down each part.\n\nPart 1: Converting from base a to base b when b is not R.\n\nThis is straightforward. We can treat c as a string in base a and convert it into a base 10 integer, then convert that to base b as a string.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle the conversion? Let's think about the steps:\n\nFor example, c is '123' in base 8. We need to compute its value in base 10 and then represent it in base 2.\n\nSo, the function would involve iterating over each digit of c, multiply the current result by a, add the next digit, and so on. Then, take that result and convert it into base b.\n\nBut what about cases where a or b is larger than 10? Well, in our case, a and b are up to 25, so digits can be 0-9, A-T, etc., depending on their base. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input c is given in base a, which can be any base up to 25. So, for example, a could be 16, and c could have letters like A-F.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So the digits can be 0-9, then A-Z (but only uppercase?), but according to the problem statement, the input is given as a string. So I'll need to parse each character in c to its corresponding value in base a.\n\nSo, the first thing is to create a function that takes a string (c) and converts it into an integer in base 10.\n\nBut how to parse each character into its numerical value based on the base a?\n\nI need a helper function to map each character to its value. For example, in base 10, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. Similarly, in base 16, same.\n\nSo, create a function char_to_value(c, base) that returns the integer value of the character c in the given base.\n\nSimilarly, when outputting in base b, I need to convert each digit to the corresponding character. For example, in base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output should omit leading zeros. So, the function to convert from base 10 to base b must not include leading zeros.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIf b is not R:\n   - Convert c (base a) to a base 10 integer N.\n   - Convert N to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nIf b is R:\n   - Convert c (base a) to a base 10 integer N.\n   - Convert N to a Roman numeral string.\n\nNow, the first step is to handle both conversions.\n\nBut the tricky part is handling the Roman numeral conversion, including all the subtractive cases.\n\nSo, I need a function that takes a base 10 integer and returns its Roman numeral representation.\n\nImplementing Roman numeral conversion correctly is crucial here. Let's think about how to approach that.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of tuples that maps values to their Roman symbols, ordered from highest to lowest. Then, for each symbol, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the corresponding Roman letters.\n\nBut the subtractive cases complicate things. For example, 4 is IV, 9 is IX, 40 is XL, etc. So, the list",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can be either a standard numeral system or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves handling two main tasks: converting numbers between different bases and converting numbers to Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the bases `a` and `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Convert to Base 10:** Convert the number `c` from base `a` to a base 10 integer. This is done by parsing each character of `c` and computing its value in base 10.\n3. **Determine Output Base:** Check if the output base `b` is 'R' (Roman numerals). If it is, convert the base 10 integer to a Roman numeral string. Otherwise, convert the base 10 integer to the specified base `b`.\n4. **Conversion Functions:** Implement helper functions for converting characters to their respective values and vice versa, handling both standard bases and Roman numerals.\n5. **Output the Result:** Print the result without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + ord(c) - ord('A')\n\ndef value_to_char(n, base):\n    if n < 10:\n        return str(n)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + n - 10)\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    a_b = input_lines[0].strip().split()\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b_str = a_b[1]\n    \n    c_line = input_lines[1].strip()\n    c = c_line.split()[0]\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to base 10\n    n = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        n = n * a + char_to_value(ch, a)\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        base = int(b_str)\n        digits = []\n        if n == 0:\n            print('')\n            return\n        while n > 0:\n            remainder = n % base\n            n = n // base\n            digits.append(value_to_char(remainder, base))\n        print(''.join(reversed(digits)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into the bases `a` and `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Base 10:** Each character of `c` is converted to its corresponding value in base 10 by iterating through each digit and applying the base conversion rules.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** If the output base is 'R', the base 10 integer is converted to a Roman numeral using a lookup table that handles both standard and subtractive cases.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion:** For other bases, the base 10 integer is converted to the specified base by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders.\n5. **Output:** The result is printed as a string without leading zeros, ensuring the correct format for both Roman numerals and standard bases.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion and ensures correctness for all valid inputs within the problem constraints.",
