Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to find the smallest possible d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they're not sorted, it's harder to figure out the coverage gaps.\n\nOnce the lanterns are sorted, I can look for the regions between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, I need to ensure that the area between them is fully covered. Also, the ends (0 and l) must be covered by at least one lantern.\n\nWait, right. Because if a lantern is at position a_i, then its coverage is [a_i - d, a_i + d]. But since the street is from 0 to l, any lantern near the end must cover beyond the end otherwise d needs to be large enough to cover it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort all lantern positions.\n2. Check if the first lantern covers 0: i.e., a_0 - d <= 0. If not, then d must be at least a_0.\n   Similarly, check if the last lantern covers l: a_n-1 +d >= l. If not, d must be at least l - a_n-1.\n3. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, say a_i and a_j (i < j), the gap between them is from a_i +d to a_j -d. Wait, no—actually, the coverage of a_i is up to a_i +d, and the coverage of a_j starts at a_j -d. So the gap is the distance between a_i +d and a_j -d. If this gap is positive, then the region is not covered. So to cover the entire street, for each pair, the required d must satisfy a_j -d ≤ a_i +d, which means a_j - a_i ≤ 2d.\n\nSo for all consecutive pairs, the maximum required d from that pair is (a_j - a_i)/2.\n\nAdditionally, the first lantern must cover 0, and the last must cover l.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nLet's denote the sorted array as A = sorted( ai list )\n\nThen:\n\n- For the first element, A[0], the leftmost coverage is A[0] -d. To cover 0, we need A[0] -d ≤0 → d ≥ A[0]\n\nWait, wait no. Because if A[0] is at position x, then to cover 0, the radius d must be at least x. Because 0 is x units away, so d must be ≥x.\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern, A[-1], the rightmost coverage is A[-1] +d. This must be ≥l → d ≥ l - A[-1].\n\nSo the initial idea is:\n\nCompute the maximum of:\n\n- A[0] (to cover 0)\n- (A[i+1] - A[i])/2 for all consecutive pairs\n- (l - A[-1])\n\nThe maximum of these three will give the minimal d needed.\n\nBecause:\n\n- The first condition ensures that 0 is covered.\n- The second conditions ensure that each pair of consecutive lanterns has their midpoint covered, thus ensuring that the entire street is covered between them.\n- The third condition ensures that l is covered.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: n and l.\n2. Read the list of ai's.\n3. Sort the ai's.\n4. Compute the initial d as the maximum of:\n   a. A[0]\n   b. For each consecutive pair, (A[i+1] - A[i])/2\n   c. l - A[-1]\n5. The minimal required d is the maximum of all these values.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute the conditions:\n\na. A[0] = 0 → contributes 0.\n\nb. Consecutive differences:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n5-3=2 → 1\n7-5=2 →1\n9-7=2→1\n14-9=5 →2.5\n15-14=1→0.5\n\nSo the max in b is 2.5.\n\nc. l - A[-1] =15 -15=0.\n\nSo overall maximum is max(0, 2.5, 0) → 2.5. Which is 2.5, but wait, the sample output is 2.5000000000. So yes.\n\nWait wait, no. Wait the sample input is 7 15, and the lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, it's 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nConsecutive differences:\n\n0 to3: 3 → 1.5\n3 to5:2 →1\n5 to7:2→1\n7 to9:2→1\n9 to14:5→2.5\n14 to15:1→0.5\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which would imply d is 2.5. But the sample output for the first case is 2.5.\n\nWait, but looking back at the sample input given:\n\nIn the example, the first sample's output is '2.5000000000', which matches.\n\nBut wait, the second sample:\n\nInput is '2 5\\n2 5' → sorted is [2,5].\n\nCompute the conditions:\n\na. A[0] =2 → contributes 2.\n\nb. 5-2=3 →1.5.\n\nc.5-5=0.\n\nMaximum is 2. So sample output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: let's imagine n=1. So only one lantern.\n\nSuppose l=10, ai=5. Then:\n\nd must be at least 5 (to cover 0) and at least 5 (to cover l=10). But wait, 5 +d must be >=10 →d >=5. So total d is 5.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=10, positions 0 and 10.\n\nEach lantern's d must be >=0 (since A[0]=0) and >=10 (since A[-1] is 10, l=10 →10-10=0. So the first condition is 0, the last is 0. The consecutive pair is 10-0=10 →5. So the maximum is 5. So d is 5.\n\nWait, but with d=5, the first lantern covers 0-5 to 5. The second covers 5 to 15. So 0 is covered, 10 is covered. The street is from 0 to 10, so all points are covered.\n\nSo the logic holds.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=20. Positions 0,10,20.\n\na. A[0]=0 →d >=0.\n\nb. 10-0=10 →5.\n\n20-10=10 →5.\n\nc. 20-20=0.\n\nSo maximum is 5. So d=5. Indeed, each lantern covers up to 5 away. So 0 covers 0-5, 10 covers 5-15, 20 covers 15-25. So the entire 20 is covered.\n\nWait, wait, no. 0-5 and 20-25: but the street is up to 20. So 0-5, 5-15, 15-25. So 0-20 is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when some lanterns are overlapping? Like n=3, l=10, positions 2,4,6.\n\nSorted: 2,4,6.\n\na. A[0]=2 →d >=2.\n\nb. 4-2=2 →1.\n\n6-4=2→1.\n\nc. 10-6=4 →d must be at least 4.\n\nSo the maximum is 4.\n\nWith d=4:\n\n Lantern 2 covers 0-6, lantern 4 covers 0-8, lantern6 covers 2-10.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input, process the ai's, sort them, compute the required maximum as described.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nIf n is 0, but according to constraints, n>=1, so no need.\n\nCompute initial_d as max(A[0], l - A[-1]).\n\nCompute the max_gap for consecutive pairs.\n\nFor i from 0 to n-2:\n\ndiff = A[i+1] - A[i]\n\nrequired_d = diff / 2\n\nif required_d > current_max_gap, update.\n\nFinally, d is the maximum between initial_d and current_max_gap.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0\n\n# Condition 1: A[0] >=0? No, because A[0] is the first lantern. To cover 0, d must be >= A[0].\n# Wait no: for the first lantern, 0 must be within d of A[0]. So 0 >= A[0] -d → d >= A[0] -0 → d >= A[0]?\n\nWait, wait. No.\n\nWait, for the first lantern, the coverage is [A[0] -d, A[0] +d].\n\nTo cover 0, 0 must be in this interval. So 0 >= A[0] -d → d >= A[0] -0 → d >= A[0].\n\nYes. So condition a is that d must be >= A[0].\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern, the coverage is up to A[-1] +d. It must cover l. So A[-1] +d >= l → d >= l - A[-1].\n\nSo in code:\n\ninitial_d = max( A[0], l - A[-1] )\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair:\n\ndiff = A[i+1] - A[i]\n\nrequired_d = diff / 2\n\nmax_d_candidate = max( initial_d, required_d )\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, max_d_candidate )\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple consecutive pairs that contribute higher required_d?\n\nWe need to take the maximum among all of them.\n\nSo code:\n\ncurrent_max = initial_d\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n    req = diff / 2\n    if req > current_max:\n        current_max = req\n\nThen, the minimal d is current_max.\n\nWait, but initial_d is already the maximum between A[0] and (l - A[-1]). So during the loop, for each pair, the required_d is compared to the current_max, which includes those two terms.\n\nWait no. Let me see:\n\nInitially, current_max is the maximum between A[0] and (l - A[-1]).\n\nThen, for each pair, we calculate req = (A[i+1]-A[i])/2, and if it's larger than current_max, we update.\n\nSo after processing all pairs, the current_max is the maximum between initial_d and all the req.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nCase 1: Only one lantern.\n\nn=1.\n\nSo A[0] is the only lantern.\n\nd must be >= A[0] (to cover 0), and >= l - A[0] (to cover l).\n\nSo initial_d is max(A[0], l - A[0]).\n\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nThus, d is initial_d.\n\nCase 2: All lanterns are at the same point.\n\nE.g., n=3, l=10, positions [5,5,5].\n\nThen:\n\nA[0]=5, so d must be >=5.\n\nl - A[-1] is 10-5=5, so initial_d is 5.\n\nConsecutive differences are 0, so req is 0.\n\nThus, d=5.\n\nWhich is correct, as the single point 5 covers the entire street if d is 5 (covers from 0 to 10).\n\nWait no. If all lanterns are at 5, then with d=5, their coverage is 0-10, which covers the entire street.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when the street is entirely covered by the first lantern.\n\nFor example, n=1, l=5, ai=3.\n\nThen d must be >=3 (to cover 0) and >=2 (to cover 5: 3+d >=5 →d>=2).\n\nSo initial_d is max(3, 2) =3.\n\nWhich is correct because the first lantern's coverage is 0-6, which covers the entire street.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, ai=[1,9].\n\nA[0]=1 →d >=1.\n\nA[-1]=9 →d >=1 (since 9 +d >=10 →d >=1).\n\nConsecutive pair: 9-1=8 →req=4.\n\nSo initial_d is 1, but the consecutive pair requires 4.\n\nThus, d is 4.\n\nWhich makes sense: the first lantern covers 0-5, the second covers 8-13. So the street is 0-10, and the middle part 5-8 is covered by the second lantern's left side? Wait no.\n\nWait, first lantern at 1, d=4: covers 1-4 → no, wait no: 1-4 is the left part. Wait, 1-4 is from 1-d= -3 (but that's beyond 0) to 1+d=5. So the first lantern covers 0 to 5. Second lantern at 9, d=4: covers 5 to 13, but the street is up to 10. So the combined coverage is 0-5 and 5-10. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input: first line is n and l.\n\nSecond line is n integers, possibly with spaces.\n\nThen, sort the list.\n\nCompute initial_d.\n\nLoop through consecutive pairs.\n\nCompute the max.\n\nPrint the result with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, the output format is to print each value with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo for the first sample, the output is '2.5000000000'.\n\nIn Python, we can format the number accordingly.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\ninitial_d = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\nmax_d = initial_d\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n    req = diff / 2\n    if req > max_d:\n        max_d = req\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but wait: what if n is 1? Then, in the loop, n-1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run. Correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\ninitial_d = max(0, 15-15)=0.\n\nThen, for each pair:\n\n0-3: 3/2=1.5 → current_max becomes 1.5.\n\n3-5:2/2=1 → no change.\n\n5-7:1 → no.\n\n7-9:1 → no.\n\n9-14:5/2=2.5 → current_max is now 2.5.\n\n14-15:1/2=0.5 → no change.\n\nSo final max_d is 2.5.\n\nSample output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nai = 2,5.\n\nsorted: 2,5.\n\ninitial_d: max(2, 5-5=0) →2.\n\nconsecutive pair:5-2=3 →1.5.\n\nmax_d is 2.\n\nSo output is 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, l=10, ai=5.\n\ninitial_d is max(5, 10-5=5) →5.\n\nNo loop. So output 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, l=10, ai=[0,10].\n\ninitial_d: max(0, 10-10=0) →0.\n\nconsecutive pair:10-0=10 →5.\n\nso max_d is 5.\n\nOutput is 5.0000000000.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- When l is 0? But constraints say l>=1.\n\nWait, the input constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109.\n\nWait, the problem statement says l is the length of the street, which is 0 to l. So l is at least 1.\n\nSo no division by zero or anything.\n\nAnother thing: floating point precision.\n\nBut in Python, using floats is fine.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nI think this should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are illuminated by lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern lights up a segment of the street within a distance \\( d \\) from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently determining the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Coverage Check**: Calculate the initial required radius \\( d \\) based on the first and last lanterns. The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0), so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover the end of the street (l), so \\( d \\) must be at least the difference between l and the position of the last lantern.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the required radius to cover the gap between them. The required radius for a gap between two lanterns is half the distance between them. Track the maximum of these values as it represents the minimum radius needed to cover the largest gap.\n4. **Determine the Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the initial coverage check and the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\ninitial_d = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\nmax_d = initial_d\n\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    diff = ai[i + 1] - ai[i]\n    req = diff / 2\n    if req > max_d:\n        max_d = req\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to efficiently check the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial Coverage Check**: Ensures that the first lantern covers the start of the street and the last lantern covers the end.\n- **Gap Coverage**: By checking each consecutive pair of lanterns, we ensure that no segment of the street is left uncovered by calculating the necessary radius to bridge any gaps.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the smallest possible radius \\( d \\) efficiently, covering all necessary segments of the street.",
