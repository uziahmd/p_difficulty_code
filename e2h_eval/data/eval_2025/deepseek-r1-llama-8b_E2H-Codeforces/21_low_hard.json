The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even, and an even and odd gives odd. So a_i + b_j is odd only when one is even and the other is odd.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is determine which chests can be unlocked with which keys. Let me think: for a chest to be unlockable, it needs a key of opposite parity. That is, if the chest's a_i is even, the key must be odd; if a_i is odd, the key must be even.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to count how many chests are even and how many are odd, and similarly for keys. Then, we can pair them optimally.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\n- Let E_a be the number of chests where a_i is even.\n- Let O_a be the number of chests where a_i is odd.\n- Similarly, let E_b be the number of keys where b_j is even.\n- O_b be the number of keys where b_j is odd.\n\nThen, to unlock a chest, we need to pair it with a key of opposite parity.\n\nBut the maximum number of chests we can unlock depends on how we match the keys to the chests.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests (E_a and O_a).\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys (E_b and O_b).\n3. For each type of chest (even or odd), find how many keys of the opposite type are available.\n\nFor example, to unlock even chests, we need odd keys. So the maximum possible is min(E_a, O_b). Similarly, for odd chests, we need even keys: min(O_a, E_b).\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate because some keys might be used in either way. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to maximize the sum of the two possibilities, but without overlapping usage of the same key or chest.\n\nAlternatively, since each key can be used once and each chest once, maybe the total number of chests we can unlock is the maximum between:\n\nmin(E_a, O_b) + min(O_a, E_b), but also considering that we cannot exceed the total m keys.\n\nWait, no. Because the two min functions could add up, but perhaps the total number of keys used would be O_b + E_b, but that's equal to m. Wait, no, because O_b is the number of odd keys, which can be used for E_a chests. And E_b is the number of even keys, which can be used for O_a chests.\n\nSo the total chests opened would be min(E_a, O_b) + min(O_a, E_b).\n\nWait, but is that always possible? Or are there cases where the sum exceeds n?\n\nNo, because E_a + O_a = n, and O_b + E_b = m. So min(E_a, O_b) is the number of even chests that can be unlocked with odd keys, and min(O_a, E_b) is the number of odd chests unlocked with even keys. Adding these gives the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but what if O_b is larger than E_a? Then, all E_a even chests can be unlocked with O_b keys. Then, the remaining O_b - E_a keys can't be used anymore because there are no more even chests. Similarly for the other case.\n\nSo, the maximum possible is min(E_a, O_b) + min(O_a, E_b). But wait, perhaps sometimes it's better to use a different allocation. Like, maybe instead of using all possible even chests with the available odd keys, we could use some to save keys for other purposes.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can only be used once, and each chest once. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo, a_i are: 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So E_a is 3, O_a is 2.\n\nb_j are 8 (even), 4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So E_b is 3, O_b is 1.\n\nSo, min(E_a, O_b) = min(3,1) =1. min(O_a,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each chest and key has a number, and a chest can be unlocked if the sum of its number and the key's number is odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, we count how many chests have even numbers (E_a) and how many have odd numbers (O_a). Similarly, we count how many keys have even numbers (E_b) and how many have odd numbers (O_b).\n2. **Match Keys to Chests**: For each chest, we need a key of opposite parity to unlock it. Therefore, even-numbered chests require odd-numbered keys, and odd-numbered chests require even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openable Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and available odd keys plus the minimum of odd chests and available even keys. This ensures we use the keys optimally without exceeding their availability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nE_a = 0\nO_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        E_a += 1\n    else:\n        O_a += 1\n\nE_b = 0\nO_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        E_b += 1\n    else:\n        O_b += 1\n\nmax_even_chests = min(E_a, O_b)\nmax_odd_chests = min(O_a, E_b)\n\nprint(max_even_chests + max_odd_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Matching Keys and Chests**: By determining the number of even and odd keys, we can match them to the chests of the opposite parity to maximize the number of chests opened.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently counts and matches parities in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.\n\nThis approach ensures we use the keys optimally to unlock the maximum number of chests, considering both parity constraints and key availability.",
