    "thought": "Okay, I'm trying to solve this programming problem. Let's read it carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about directed graphs and something called p-reachable. Hmm. Let me break down what a p-reachable graph is.\n\nA directed graph is p-reachable if it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So these are edges where u can reach v, v can reach u, and u is less than v. But wait, no—wait, no, because in a directed graph, reachability isn't symmetric. Oh right! Wait, no, the definition says u and v are reachable from each other. So for an edge (u, v), both u must be reachable from v and v must be reachable from u. So u and v form a strongly connected component of size at least 2.\n\nWait, but wait, the pair (u, v) with u < v and they can reach each other. So each such pair contributes to p. So p counts the number of such pairs in the graph.\n\nOur task is to find the minimal number of nodes required to create such a graph with exactly p pairs. Then, among all such minimal-node graphs, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs. A unidirectional pair is one where (u, v) is an edge but (v, u) is not, and u != v. Also, there's no path from v back to u.\n\nWait, no, the definition says: (u, v) is unidirectional if u ≠ v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So it's about directed edges that aren't part of any mutual reachability.\n\nSo first, I need to model how to construct a graph with exactly p such pairs, using as few nodes as possible. Then, for the minimal node count, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's think about how to model the minimal node case. Since each p requires a pair of nodes u and v where u < v and they can reach each other, perhaps the best way is to have a structure where each new p adds the minimal possible nodes.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal nodes are achieved by arranging the graph into components where each component contributes as many p as possible with the least nodes. Like, each component is a strongly connected component of size k, which contributes C(k, 2) pairs. Because for every pair of nodes u and v in a strongly connected component, u can reach v and v can reach u. So each such pair contributes 1 to p.\n\nBut wait, in a strongly connected component of size k, the number of such pairs is exactly (k*(k-1))/2. So for example, a component of size 2 contributes 1 to p. Size 3 contributes 3 pairs. Size 4 contributes 6, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a set of integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_m such that the sum of s_i*(s_i -1)/2 equals p. We want to minimize the total number of nodes, which is the sum of s_i.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum of s_i given that the sum of s_i choose 2 is p? Because each s_i is the size of a strongly connected component.\n\nFor instance, when p=0, we just need a single node, so sum is 0. When p=1, the minimal is 2 nodes, forming a single component contributing 1. For p=3, the minimal is 3 nodes, which is one component of size 3, contributing 3. Alternatively, could we do two components: one of size 2 (contribution 1) and another of size 2 (another 1). That would sum to 2+2=4 nodes, which is worse than 3. So no.\n\nSo the approach is to represent p as the sum of triangular numbers, i.e., each s_i is such that s_i*(s_i-1)/2 is a term in the sum.\n\nWait, but the sum is p = s_1*(s_1-1)/2 + s_2*(s_2-1)/2 + ... + s_m*(s_m-1)/2.\n\nWe need to find a set of s_i's such that their sum is minimized.\n\nThis is similar to representing p as a sum of triangular numbers, using as few terms as possible, but each term corresponds to a component. Because adding more components would require more nodes but may allow for a lower total.\n\nWait, no. Because each s_i contributes s_i^2 - s_i to the sum. So to minimize the sum of s_i, given that the sum of s_i^2 - s_i equals 2p, since p = sum(s_i*(s_i-1)/2).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsum(s_i choose 2) = p.\n\nWhich is sum(s_i^2 - s_i)/2 = p → sum(s_i^2 - s_i) = 2p.\n\nWe need to minimize sum(s_i) subject to sum(s_i^2 - s_i) = 2p.\n\nThis seems like a problem where the minimal sum is achieved when the s_i's are as large as possible. Because for a fixed sum of squares, larger s_i's contribute less to the sum of s_i.\n\nWait, for example, suppose p is 3. We can have s_1=3, sum is 3, 3²-3=6=2*3. Or, s_1=2 and s_2=2: sum is 4, 2²-2 + 2²-2 = 2 + 2 =4, which is 2p=6? No, wait 2+2=4, which is less than 6. Hmm, so that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, wait p is 3, which is the sum of s_i choose 2. So for two components of size 2, each contributes 1, sum is 2. Which is less than 3. So that's not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let's re-express the problem.\n\nEach s_i is the size of a component. The contribution to p is s_i*(s_i-1)/2.\n\nSo for p=3, possible options are:\n\n- One component of size 3: contributes 3 → sum is 3, and nodes used are 3.\n\n- One component of size 4: contributes 6, which is larger than 3. So not acceptable.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. If we have a component of size 4, the contribution is 4*3/2=6. So that's too much.\n\nSo for p=3, the only option is a single component of size 3, requiring 3 nodes.\n\nAnother example: p=6.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- One component of size 4: contributes 6, uses 4 nodes.\n\n- Two components of size 3: each contributes 3, total 6. Sum of nodes is 6.\n\nSo in this case, 4 nodes are better.\n\nWait, but why? Because 4 nodes give a sum of 4, which is less than 6.\n\nSo, the minimal number of nodes depends on how we partition p into the sum of s_i*(s_i-1)/2.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal sum of s_i, given that the sum of s_i choose 2 is p.\n\nThis seems like a problem where the minimal sum is achieved by using the largest possible s_i's.\n\nBecause for a given sum of squares, larger s_i's give a smaller sum of s_i.\n\nWait, let's see: for a fixed sum of squares, say S = a² + b² + c² + ..., what arrangement of a, b, c gives the minimal sum a + b + c + ...?\n\nI remember that for a fixed sum of squares, the sum is minimized when all the variables are equal. Wait, no, wait: for a given sum of squares, the sum is minimized when the variables are as unequal as possible. Wait, no, actually, it's the opposite. For example, given x² + y² = C, the sum x + y is minimized when x=y. Because, for fixed C, the function x+y is minimized when variables are as equal as possible due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nWait, no, that's for the minimum of x + y given x² + y² = C. The minimum occurs when x = y.\n\nWait, no, that's for the Euclidean norm. So in our case, for a fixed sum of s_i squared minus s_i, which is 2p, the sum of s_i is to be minimized.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when we use the largest possible s_i's, because each large s_i contributes more to the sum of squares but less to the sum.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of it as an optimization problem.\n\nWe need to minimize sum(s_i) subject to sum( s_i² - s_i ) = 2p.\n\nLet me denote f(s_i) = s_i² - s_i. The constraint is sum(f(s_i)) = 2p.\n\nWe want to minimize sum(s_i).\n\nLet me think about this: for a fixed sum of f(s_i), what's the minimal sum of s_i.\n\nI think that for each individual s_i, given that f(s_i) is fixed, the minimal s_i is when s_i is as large as possible. Because f(s_i) increases as s_i increases beyond a certain point, but for a fixed f(s_i), a larger s_i would have a larger f(s_i), which might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to maximize each s_i as much as possible given the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum occurs when all the s_i's are as large as possible.\n\nSo the strategy is to find the largest possible s such that s*(s-1)/2 ≤ p. Once we subtract that from p, we proceed recursively.\n\nFor example, let's take p=6.\n\nThe largest s where s*(s-1)/2 ≤6 is s=4, because 4*3/2=6.\n\nSo we take s=4, contributing exactly 6, so m=1, nodes=4.\n\nAlternatively, for p=7:\n\nThe largest s where s*(s-1)/2 ≤7 is s=4, contributing 6. Remaining p=1.\n\nNow, the next largest s where s*(s-1)/2 ≤1 is s=2, contributing 1. So total nodes 4+2=6.\n\nSo the sum is 6.\n\nIs that the minimal? Let's see if another approach could yield a smaller sum.\n\nSuppose instead of s=4 and s=2, perhaps using s=3 twice. Each contributes 3, total 6. So sum of s_i's is 3+3=6. Same as before.\n\nSo same number of nodes.\n\nSo it's the same.\n\nAnother example: p=5.\n\nLargest s with s*(s-1)/2 <=5 is s=3 (3*2/2=3). Remaining p=2.\n\nNext, s=2 (contributing 1). Remaining p=1.\n\nThen, s=2 again (contributing 1). So total nodes 3+2+2=7.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a different partitioning? Like s=3 and s=2.\n\nWait, s=3 contributes 3, leaves p=2. Then s=2 contributes 1. So total nodes 3+2=5. That's better.\n\nWait, but wait: 3+2=5 nodes, but 3+2's contributions are 3+1=4, which is less than 5. So no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute.\n\nWait, p=5.\n\nIf we take s=3: contributes 3, leaving p=2.\n\nThen take s=2: contributes 1, leaving p=1.\n\nWait, but then we need another component of size 2, which contributes 1, making total 3+2+2=7, but that's 3+2+2=7 nodes, which seems excessive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to take s=3, then s=2, but then we have p=5-3=2. So for the remaining 2, perhaps s=2 is 1, and then another s=2 for 1. So 3+2+2=7 nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, maybe take s=4: 4*3/2=6 >5. So no. So s=3 is the maximum possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach isn't optimal.\n\nWait, maybe for p=5, the minimal nodes is 5.\n\nHow?\n\nWait, think about having a component of size 4. It contributes 6, which is larger than 5. So no.\n\nSo s=3 is the largest possible, contributing 3, leaving p=2.\n\nTo get p=2, the next largest is s=2, contributing 1. Now p=1 remains.\n\nWait, but s=2 can't contribute 1 again unless we have another component of size 2.\n\nSo that's 3+2+2=7 nodes.\n\nAlternatively, can we have a component of size 3 and another of size 2, contributing 3+1=4, which is less than 5. So that's not enough.\n\nWait, so perhaps for p=5, the minimal nodes is 5.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think.\n\nWait, 5 can be represented as 3 + 1 + 1. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using three components: 3, 2, and 2.\n\nWait, but that's 3+2+2=7 nodes.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps the minimal number of nodes is determined by the minimal number of components whose contributions sum to p, and each component's contribution is as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as finding the minimal n where the maximum possible sum of s_i choose 2 is >= p, but the minimal sum of s_i is achieved by taking the largest possible s_i's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the smallest n such that the maximum possible sum of s_i choose 2 is >=p.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given n, the maximum number of pairs is when all nodes are in one component. The minimal number of nodes is achieved when you take the largest possible components first.\n\nSo the minimal number of nodes is the minimal n where the sum of s_i choose 2 >=p, and each s_i is as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the ceiling of the square root of 2p, but that's a vague thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the minimal integer m where m(m-1)/2 >= p.\n\nBecause, if you have a single component of size m, it contributes m(m-1)/2 pairs. So if m(m-1)/2 >=p, then a single component is sufficient, and the number of nodes is m.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for some p, using multiple components allows a smaller total node count.\n\nFor example, for p=3: m=3, 3 nodes. But if you have two components of size 2 each, sum is 4 nodes, which is worse.\n\nSo, the minimal node count is indeed m, where m is the smallest integer such that m(m-1)/2 >=p.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nCase 1: p=0.\n\nm is 0, since 0* (-1)/2 is 0.\n\nCase 2: p=1.\n\nm=2, since 2*1/2=1.\n\nCase 3: p=3.\n\nm=3, since 3*2/2=3.\n\nCase 4: p=4.\n\nm=3, since 3*2/2=3 <4, so next m=4, 4*3/2=6>=4.\n\nSo the minimal nodes is 4.\n\nWait, but wait: can you have a graph with 4 nodes, arranged in a way that contributes exactly 4 pairs.\n\nYes: for example, a component of size 3 (contributing 3 pairs) and a component of size 2 (contributing 1 pair). Total 4 pairs. Nodes:3+2=5.\n\nBut that's worse than 4 nodes, which would contribute 6 pairs. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but if p=4, the minimal nodes is 4, because a single component of 4 nodes contributes 6 pairs, which is more than 4. So that's not acceptable.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states that the graph must have exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable.\n\nSo, for p=4, the sum of s_i choose 2 is 4.\n\nSo, how can that be achieved with minimal nodes.\n\nOption 1: One component of size 3 (3 pairs) and another component of size 2 (1 pair). Total 4 pairs, nodes 3+2=5.\n\nOption 2: One component of size 4 (6 pairs) is too much.\n\nOption 3: Two components of size 3: 3+3=6 pairs. No.\n\nOption 4: One component of size 4 is 6 pairs. No.\n\nSo the only way is 3+2, sum 5 nodes.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to achieve p=4 with fewer nodes?\n\nLike, 4 nodes arranged as two separate components of size 2. Each contributes 1 pair. Sum 2 pairs. No, that's not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the minimal n such that the maximum possible sum of s_i choose 2 is >=p. But in that case, n is chosen so that the sum can be as small as needed.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's try to think differently.\n\nEach component contributes s_i choose 2 pairs. So the sum is p = sum(s_i choose 2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum of s_i.\n\nWe can model this as an integer partition problem where each part is s_i, and the sum of s_i choose 2 is p.\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum of s_i's.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum for a given p?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that for a given sum of s_i, the sum of s_i choose 2 is maximized when the components are as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given sum of s_i, the sum of s_i choose 2 is maximized when the components are as large as possible.\n\nSo, to find the minimal sum of s_i such that the sum of s_i choose 2 is at least p.\n\nWait, but no, because p is fixed. So perhaps for a given p, the minimal sum of s_i is achieved when the components are as large as possible.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Find the largest possible s such that s*(s-1)/2 ≤ p.\n\n2. Subtract that value from p, add s to the sum.\n\n3. Repeat until p becomes zero.\n\nThis will give the minimal sum of s_i's.\n\nWait, let's test this with p=4.\n\nFirst step: find largest s where s(s-1)/2 ≤4.\n\ns=3: 3*2/2=3 ≤4.\n\nSubtract 3 from 4: p=1.\n\nNext step: largest s where s(s-1)/2 ≤1: s=2.\n\nSubtract 1, p=0.\n\nSum is 3+2=5 nodes.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nAnother test: p=5.\n\nStep 1: s=3, contribution 3. p=2.\n\nStep 2: s=2, contribution 1. p=1.\n\nStep 3: s=2 again, contribution 1. p=0.\n\nSum is 3+2+2=7 nodes.\n\nBut earlier I thought perhaps a better way exists, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, but for p=5, can we have a component of size 4, which contributes 6, which is more than 5. So no.\n\nSo the minimal nodes are 7.\n\nBut wait, is that the minimal? Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: can we have a component of size 3 and another of size 3. That gives 3+3=6>5. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a component of size 3 and a component of size 2: 3+1=4<5. So no.\n\nSo yes, the minimal is 7 nodes.\n\nAnother example: p=6.\n\nFirst step: s=4, 4*3/2=6. So sum is 4.\n\nThat's perfect.\n\nSo the minimal nodes is 4.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- To compute the minimal number of nodes, we greedily take the largest possible s each time, subtracting s*(s-1)/2 from p, and adding s to the total nodes.\n\n- Repeat until p is zero.\n\nNow, the second part is to find, among all minimal node count graphs, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo for each such graph (which has minimal nodes), what's the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nA unidirectional pair is an edge (u, v) where u can reach v, but v cannot reach u, and u≠v.\n\nIn the context of the problem, since each component is strongly connected, edges within a component are bidirectional. So the only unidirectional edges can be between different components.\n\nBut wait, in a directed graph, it's possible to have edges between components.\n\nSo for example, if there's a component A and component B, any edge from A to B is unidirectional if B cannot reach A.\n\nSo to maximize the number of unidirectional edges, we need to arrange the graph so that for as many edges as possible between components, the direction is such that it's unidirectional.\n\nBut wait, since all edges within a component are strongly connected, any edges between components can be unidirectional if the source component can reach the target, but the target can't reach back.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nAfter determining the minimal node count (say, n nodes divided into components s_1, s_2, ..., s_m), what is the maximum possible number of unidirectional edges between these components.\n\nEach edge from a component to another can be unidirectional or not, depending on whether there's a path from the source component to the target, but not vice versa.\n\nWait, but in the minimal node graph, the components are strongly connected. So for any two components A and B, if there's an edge from A to B, then for that edge to be unidirectional, there must be no path from B back to A.\n\nBut since the graph is a DAG between components (because if there were a cycle between components, then those components would be merged into a single component), each component is a node in a DAG.\n\nSo the maximal number of unidirectional edges is achieved when the DAG is a linear chain, where each component points to the next, and there are no edges back.\n\nIn this case, the number of unidirectional edges is the sum over all pairs (i, j) where i < j and there's an edge from i to j, but not from j to i.\n\nWait, but in the DAG, each edge from i to j contributes to the unidirectional count if j cannot reach i.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional edges, we can arrange the DAG as a complete linear order, where each component points to all higher-numbered components, and there are no edges back.\n\nSo, for m components, the maximum number of unidirectional edges is the sum from i=1 to m-1 of s_i * (sum_{j=i+1 to m} s_j).\n\nBecause each node in component i can have edges to all nodes in components j>i, and none can have edges back.\n\nSo the total number is sum_{i=1 to m} (s_i * (sum_{j=i+1 to m} s_j)).\n\nSo, the problem now is, for the given decomposition of p into s_1, s_2, ..., s_m, compute this sum.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Decompose p into s_1, s_2, ..., s_m, where s_i is as large as possible, subtracting s_i*(s_i-1)/2 from p each time.\n\n2. Compute the minimal number of nodes, which is the sum of s_i.\n\n3. For the given s_i's, compute the maximum number of unidirectional edges as sum_{i=1 to m} s_i * (sum_{j=i+1 to m} s_j).\n\nNow, let's test this with the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: p=3.\n\nDecomposition: s=3. So m=1.\n\nCompute unidirectional edges: since there's only one component, no edges between components. So 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2: p=4.\n\nDecomposition: s=3, p=1 left. Then s=2. So s = [3,2].\n\nSum of s_i: 5.\n\nUnidirectional edges: 3*2=6.\n\nSo output is 5 6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3: p=0.\n\nNo components. So 0 nodes, 0 unidirectional edges.\n\nAnother test case: p=6.\n\nDecomposition: s=4, which contributes 6. So m=1.\n\nUnidirectional edges: 0.\n\nAnother test case: p=5.\n\nDecomposition: s=3 (3), p=2 left.\n\ns=2 (1), p=1 left.\n\ns=2 again (1). So s = [3,2,2].\n\nSum is 7.\n\nUnidirectional edges: 3*2 + 2*2 + 2*0 (since j starts after i). Wait, no, wait the formula is sum for i=1 to m-1 of s_i * sum_{j=i+1 to m} s_j.\n\nSo for s = [3,2,2], m=3.\n\ni=1: sum j=2,3: 2+2=4 → 3*4=12.\n\ni=2: sum j=3: 2 → 2*2=4.\n\nTotal: 16.\n\nSo the maximum unidirectional edges is 16.\n\nSo for p=5, the output is 7 16.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nThe graph has 3 components: A (size 3), B (size 2), C (size 2).\n\nEach node in A can have edges to all nodes in B and C.\n\nEach node in B can have edges to all nodes in C.\n\nSo the number of edges from A to B is 3*2=6.\n\nEdges from A to C: 3*2=6.\n\nEdges from B to C: 2*2=4.\n\nTotal edges: 6+6+4=16.\n\nEach of these edges is unidirectional because there's no path from B to A, C to A, or C to B.\n\nThus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 16.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a function to decompose p into s_i's, as per the greedy approach.\n\nThen, compute the sum of s_i for the minimal nodes.\n\nThen, compute the sum of s_i * (sum of s_j for j>i) across all i < j.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead p.\n\nIf p is zero:\n\n   min_nodes = 0\n\n   max_unidirectional = 0\n\nElse:\n\n   Initialize s_list as empty.\n\n   while p > 0:\n\n       find the maximum s where s*(s-1)/2 <= p.\n\n       add s to s_list.\n\n       subtract s*(s-1)/2 from p.\n\n   min_nodes = sum(s_list)\n\n   compute the sum for unidirectional edges:\n\n       total = 0\n\n       sum_total = sum(s_list)\n\n       for each s in s_list except the last:\n\n           total += s * (sum_total - s - current s's previous sum?)\n\n           Wait, no: for each i from 0 to len(s_list)-2:\n\n               sum_j = sum of s_list[i+1 : ]\n\n               total += s_list[i] * sum_j\n\n       So, for s_list = [a, b, c], sum_j for a is b + c.\n\n       For b, sum_j is c.\n\n   So, the code is:\n\n   total_unidirectional = 0\n\n   current_sum = sum(s_list)\n\n   for s in s_list[:-1]:\n\n       total_unidirectional += s * (current_sum - s)\n\n       current_sum -= s\n\n   Because after processing s, current_sum is sum(s_list[s+1:]).\n\nWait, no, let's think.\n\nWait, for each s_i in s_list, except the last, the sum of s_j for j >i is (sum of all s_j) - sum of s_0 to s_{i}.\n\nWait, no: sum of j >i is sum of s_{i+1}, s_{i+2}, ..., s_{m-1}.\n\nSo, initial sum is sum(s_list) = S.\n\nFor the first element s_0:\n\nsum_j = S - s_0.\n\nFor the second element s_1:\n\nsum_j = S - s_0 - s_1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the way to compute is:\n\nCompute the prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nInitialize the sum of the rest as S = sum(s_list).\n\nFor each s in s_list:\n\n   if it's the last element: skip.\n\n   else: add s * (S - s) to the total.\n\n   subtract s from S.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ns_list = [3, 2, 2]\n\nsum_rest = 3+2+2 =7.\n\nProcess s=3: add 3*(7-3)=12. sum_rest becomes 4.\n\nProcess s=2: add 2*(4-2)=4. sum_rest becomes 2.\n\nProcess s=2: it's last, skip.\n\nTotal is 16.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nsum_rest = sum(s_list)\n\ntotal_unidirectional = 0\n\nfor s in s_list:\n\n    if s == 0:\n\n        continue\n\n    if len(s_list) ==1:\n\n        break\n\n    total_unidirectional += s * (sum_rest - s)\n\n    sum_rest -= s\n\nreturn total_unidirectional\n\nWait, no, wait.\n\nWait, in the loop, for each s in s_list, except the last, add s*(sum_rest - s) and subtract s from sum_rest.\n\nWait, no, because after processing s, the sum_rest is the sum of the remaining elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsum_rest = sum(s_list)\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(s_list)):\n\n    s = s_list[i]\n\n    if i == len(s_list) -1:\n\n        break\n\n    total += s * (sum_rest - s)\n\n    sum_rest -= s\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, code-wise, let's write this.\n\nNow, the problem is, for a given p, to find the largest s such that s*(s-1)/2 <= p.\n\nWe can compute s as the floor of (sqrt(8p +1)+1)/2.\n\nWait, solving s(s-1) <= 2p.\n\ns² - s -2p <=0.\n\nThe roots are s=(1 ± sqrt(1 +8p))/2.\n\nThe positive root is (1 + sqrt(1+8p))/2.\n\nSo s_max is floor( (1 + sqrt(8p +1))/2 )\n\nWait, for example, p=3: sqrt(25)=5 → (1+5)/2=3 → s=3.\n\np=4: sqrt(33)=~5.744 → (1+5.744)/2 ~3.37 → s=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code can compute s as the integer part of (1 + sqrt(1+8*p )) / 2.\n\nBut wait, sometimes this might not be correct. For example, p=6: sqrt(49)=7 → (1+7)/2=4. So s=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut let's test p=5: 8*5+1=41 → sqrt(41)=~6.403 → (1+6.403)/2 ~3.7 → s=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: p=7: sqrt(57)=~7.55 → (1+7.55)/2 ~4.275 → s=4.\n\nWhich is correct, since 4*3/2=6 ≤7.\n\nSo, the code can compute s as the floor((sqrt(8p+1)+1)/2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equation is s(s-1) <=2p.\n\nThe maximum s is the largest integer where this holds.\n\nSo, for p=5: 2p=10.\n\ns(s-1) <=10.\n\ns=4: 4*3=12>10 → no.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6<=10.\n\nSo s=3 is correct.\n\nSo, the code can compute s as the floor( (sqrt(8p +1) +1)/2 ), but sometimes, perhaps, it's better to compute s via binary search.\n\nBut for the purposes of programming, perhaps using the mathematical formula is efficient enough.\n\nBut we need to handle cases where (s)*(s-1)/2 is larger than p.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the maximum s where s*(s-1)/2 <=p.\n\nWe can compute s as the integer part of ((sqrt(8p +1) +1)/2).\n\nBut then check if s*(s-1)/2 exceeds p. If so, decrease s by 1.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nLet me think.\n\nCompute s_initial = floor( (sqrt(8p +1)+1)/2 )\n\nif s_initial*(s_initial-1)//2 >p:\n\n   s_initial -=1\n\nElse:\n\n   keep as is.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, compute s_initial as the integer part, then adjust.\n\nLet me test for p=5.\n\nsqrt(41)=6.403.\n\n(6.403 +1)/2= 3.701 → floor is 3.\n\n3*2/2=3 ≤5.\n\nSo correct.\n\np=7: sqrt(57)=7.549.\n\n(7.549+1)/2=4.274 → floor is4.\n\n4*3/2=6 ≤7.\n\nSo correct.\n\np=6: sqrt(49)=7.\n\n(7+1)/2=4 →4*3/2=6=6.\n\nSo correct.\n\np=8: sqrt(65)=8.062.\n\n(8.062+1)/2=4.531 → floor 4.\n\n4*3/2=6 <=8.\n\nBut 5*4/2=10>8. So s=4.\n\nWait, but 4*3/2=6 <=8.\n\nBut perhaps s=4 is the correct choice.\n\nWait, but 4*(4-1)/2=6. So p=8-6=2 left.\n\ns=2: 2*1/2=1 <=2.\n\np=1 left.\n\ns=2 again: 1 <=1.\n\nSo s_list is [4,2,2], sum 8 nodes.\n\nWait, but is that the minimal? Or could we have s=4, s=3.\n\nWait, 4*3/2=6, p=8-6=2.\n\nThen s=3: 3*2/2=3>2 → no.\n\nSo no, s=2 is the next.\n\nSo the code correctly finds s=4, then 2, then 2.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly compute s for each step.\n\nSo, implementing this:\n\ndef find_max_s(p):\n\n    if p ==0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    s = int( ( ( (8 * p +1)**0.5 ) +1 ) // 2 )\n\n    # Now check if s*(s-1)/2 >p.\n\n    if s*(s-1)//2 >p:\n\n        s -=1\n\n    return s\n\nWait, but what about when p=0?\n\nWell, when p=0, s=0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting:\n\np=3:\n\ns= (sqrt(25)+1)/2= (5+1)/2=3 → 3*2/2=3<=3.\n\ncorrect.\n\np=4: s=3, 3*2/2=3<=4.\n\ncorrect.\n\np=5: s=3, 3*2/2=3<=5.\n\ncorrect.\n\np=6: s=4, 4*3/2=6<=6.\n\ncorrect.\n\np=7: s=4, 4*3/2=6<=7.\n\ncorrect.\n\np=8: s=4, 4*3/2=6<=8.\n\ncorrect.\n\np=9: s=4, 4*3/2=6<=9.\n\nBut wait, 5*4/2=10>9.\n\nSo s=4.\n\nBut 4+ (9-6)=3, which would be s=2, then 1.\n\nWait, no, 9-6=3.\n\ns=2: 1.\n\np=3-1=2.\n\ns=2 again: 1.\n\np=2-1=1.\n\ns=2 again: 1.\n\nWait, no.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and both nodes are reachable from each other. This implies that each pair (u, v) must form a strongly connected component.\n\n2. **Decomposing p into Components**: To minimize the number of nodes, we decompose p into the sum of triangular numbers. Each triangular number represents the contribution of a strongly connected component. The goal is to use the largest possible components first to minimize the total number of nodes.\n\n3. **Finding Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal node count is determined, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. This is achieved by arranging the graph as a linear chain where each component points to the next without any cycles between components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    p = int(input[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    s_list = []\n    remaining_p = p\n    while remaining_p > 0:\n        s = int((( (8 * remaining_p + 1)**0.5 ) + 1) // 2)\n        if s * (s - 1) // 2 > remaining_p:\n            s -= 1\n        s_list.append(s)\n        remaining_p -= s * (s - 1) // 2\n    \n    min_nodes = sum(s_list)\n    if len(s_list) == 0:\n        print(f\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    total_unidirectional = 0\n    sum_rest = sum(s_list)\n    for i in range(len(s_list)):\n        s = s_list[i]\n        if i == len(s_list) - 1:\n            break\n        total_unidirectional += s * (sum_rest - s)\n        sum_rest -= s\n    \n    print(f\"{min_nodes} {total_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer p.\n2. **Handling Edge Case for p=0**: If p is zero, the output is directly \"0 0\" since no nodes or edges are needed.\n3. **Decomposing p**: Using a loop, we decompose p into the sum of triangular numbers. For each iteration, the largest possible component size is calculated and added to the list until p is reduced to zero.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Nodes**: The sum of all component sizes gives the minimum number of nodes required.\n5. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: By iterating through the component sizes and summing the contributions of each component pointing to subsequent components, we calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal node count and maximize unidirectional pairs using a greedy decomposition method.",
