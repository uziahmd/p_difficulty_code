    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I'm given a string, and I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, first, what's a substring? Oh right, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, in 'abc', substrings are like 'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'b', etc.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum possible length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice in the given string. And if no such substring exists (like when all substrings are unique), we return 0.\n\nWait, but wait—what about the examples given?\n\nIn the first sample input, it's 'abcd'. All substrings are unique, so the output is 0.\n\nIn the second example, 'ababa', the longest is 3 because 'aba' appears at positions 0-2 and 2-4. So that's two occurrences, overlapping allowed.\n\nThird example, 'zzz' has 'zz' as the longest, appearing multiple times.\n\nSo, how do I find this efficiently?\n\nLet me consider the brute force approach first. For each possible length from the maximum possible down to 1, check all substrings of that length to see if any appears more than once. Once I find the maximum length with duplicates, return it.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 100 characters, the maximum possible substring length is 99 (for checking substrings of length 99). But for each possible length, I have to generate all possible substrings and track their occurrences.\n\nWait, but for each possible length L, starting from the largest possible (length of the string -1) down to 1, I can iterate through all possible substrings of length L, store them in a set or a dictionary, and see if any substring repeats.\n\nOnce I find the maximum L where this condition holds, I can return it. If none found for L = n-1, then decrease L by 1, and so on.\n\nThis approach should work because the maximum possible L is n-1, but for n=100, that's 99 steps, each step involving checking all substrings of that length.\n\nWait, but for each L, how many substrings do I have? For a string of length n, for a given L, there are n - L + 1 substrings.\n\nSo for L=99, n-L+1 is 2. So two substrings. For L=98, 3 substrings, and so on until L=1, which has 100 substrings.\n\nBut even for the worst case, 100 * 100 = 10,000 operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n2. For each L, collect all substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once.\n4. If yes, return L as the answer.\n5. If after checking all Ls, none satisfy, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing step 2 and 3: for a given L, generate all possible substrings of length L and track their occurrence.\n\nWe can use a set to keep track of the substrings we've seen. For each substring, if it's already in the set, return True (meaning we have a duplicate). Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nWait, but this is not sufficient because for a given L, multiple substrings can share the same value. So for example, if the same substring appears multiple times, we need to detect that.\n\nSo the steps for each L:\n\n- Initialize an empty set.\n- Loop i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n   - current_substring = s[i:i+L]\n   - if current_substring is in the set, return True (found a duplicate)\n   - else, add it to the set.\n- After all i, if no duplicates, proceed to next L.\n\nIf any L returns True, we return L as the maximum possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n   create a set.\n   for i in 0 to len(s)-L inclusive:\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n       if substring in set:\n           return L\n       else:\n           add to set\nIf no L found, return 0.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 'zzz' the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1), 'zz' (i=2)? No, wait, len(s)=3.\n\nSo for L=2, the substrings are s[0:2], s[1:3]. Both are 'zz', so when i=1, substring is 'zz' which is already in the set. So for L=2, the function would return True, so the maximum is 2.\n\nAnother example, 'ababa' has length 5. Let's check L=4: substrings are 'abab' and 'baba'—no duplicates. Then L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So when i=2, substring is 'aba' which is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each L, we loop through all possible i and check each substring. As soon as any substring is found to have been seen before, we return L.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for a given L, the set is built incrementally. So for each i, we check if the substring is in the set. If yes, return L.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, in terms of time complexity, for each L, it's O(n) operations. Since L can go up to n-1, the total is O(n^2), which for n=100 is manageable.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input string, perhaps via input().strip().\n\nThen, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, wait: for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1)—wait, no. Because for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1. For example, 'aa' has L=1 (since both 'a's are substrings of length 1). Wait, no, 'aa' has substrings 'a' and 'a' of length 1. So for 'aa', the maximum L is 1.\n\nWait, but for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1. Because for example, in 'ababa', which is length 5, the maximum L is 3.\n\nSo in code, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, no. Because for len(s) = 2, the maximum L is 1, so range(1, 0, -1) is just [1].\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for each L, we're looping from i=0 to i = (n - L). Because for each L, the number of substrings is n - L + 1. So in the code, the 'range' is from 0 to n - L inclusive.\n\nWait, in the code, the 'for i in range(n - L + 1)' will correctly loop from 0 to (n-L), which is correct.\n\nSo, for example, n=5, L=3: n-L+1 is 3, so i runs 0,1,2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nTest case 1: 'abcd'\n\nn=4.\n\nCheck L=3: substrings 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → no duplicates. So code prints 0.\n\nTest case 2: 'ababa'\n\nn=5.\n\nCheck L=4: substrings 'abab' and 'baba' → no duplicates.\n\nL=3: 'aba', 'bab', 'aba' → when i=2, substr is 'aba' which is in the set.\n\nSo code returns 3.\n\nTest case 3: 'zzz'.\n\nn=3.\n\nCheck L=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). When i=1, substr is 'zz' which is already in the set. So code returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'\n\nn=5.\n\nL=4: substrings 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So for i=1, substr is in the set. So code returns 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabb'\n\nLooking for the maximum L.\n\nn=8.\n\nCheck L=7: substrings 'aabbaa' and 'bbaabb' → no duplicates.\n\nL=6: various substrings, but I think some may repeat. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that for L=4: 'aabb' occurs multiple times.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum is 4.\n\nBut regardless, the code will find the maximum L possible.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the string is all the same character, e.g., 'aaa':\n\nn=3.\n\nCheck L=2: substrings 'aa' (i=0), 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'abacab'.\n\nLooking for the maximum L.\n\nHmm, substrings of length 4: 'abac', 'bac a'? Not sure. Maybe the maximum is 3.\n\nBut regardless, the code will find it.\n\nWhat about a single character? Like 'a' → output 0.\n\nYes, because n=1, len(s)-1 is 0, so L starts at 0, but the loop is from n-1 (which is 0) down to 1, so the loop doesn't run, and it returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab'.\n\nThe maximum L is 4: 'abab' appears at position 0 and 2.\n\nSo code should return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code looks solid.\n",
