There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The main rule is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one. So, for example, if one has played 2 games, the other must have played either 1 or 2 as well.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play. We need to write a program that takes an integer n (number of players) and outputs this maximum.\n\nHmm, let's think about how the tournament could be structured to maximize the winner's games.\n\nLet me consider small examples first.\n\nFor n=2: There's only one match. Winner plays once. So output is 1.\n\nFor n=3: The winner needs to play two matches. Like, in the first round, player 1 beats player 2, then in the next round, player 1 (who has already played once) can play against player 3, who also has zero games. Since 1-0 is within 1, it's allowed. So output is 2.\n\nWait, but what about n=4? Let's see.\n\nIn the first round, there are 4 players. Suppose the bracket is set up so that player 1 wins their first game. Now, in the second round, player 1 would face someone who's also won once. But wait, after the first round, only two players remain: player 1 and someone else, say player 2. Then in the final, player 1 plays against player 2, both having played once. So total games for player 1 is 2. Is that the maximum possible?\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. So that makes sense.\n\nWait, but the sample says when n=10, the output is 4. How does that happen?\n\nHmm, maybe the structure is such that the winner plays in a way that their opponents have varying numbers of games, allowing the maximum progression.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to model this as a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each step adds the sum of the previous steps plus some function.\n\nWait, another way to think: each time the winner plays, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less or one more.\n\nWait, the winner starts at 0 games. Each time they win, they increase their count by 1. So to have as many games as possible, we need to arrange the opponents such that each new opponent allows the next game.\n\nWhat's the pattern here?\n\nLet me try to find a pattern by computing for small n:\n\nn=2: max games=1\nn=3: 2\nn=4: 2\nn=5: Let's see. Maybe the winner can play 3 games.\n\nHow?\n\nFirst game: 0 vs 0 → becomes 1.\nSecond game: 1 vs 1 → becomes 2.\nThird game: 2 vs 2 → becomes 3.\n\nSo for n=5, the maximum is 3.\n\nWait, but let's see if that's possible with 5 players.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in each step, the number of players decreases.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is the largest k such that the sum of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + ... +k <= n.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the maximum games, the winner must have a certain number of wins, each time adding to their count based on the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k where the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number is <= n.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k games.\n\nWait, the first game is 0 vs 0, which is allowed. After that, the winner has 1 game.\n\nIn the next game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. So, if the opponent is someone who just won their first game (1 game), that's allowed.\n\nThen, the winner has 2 games.\n\nNext, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nBut the winner has 2, so the opponent must have 1 or 2.\n\nIf the opponent has 2, then the winner can proceed.\n\nSo, each step, the next opponent's required games are either one less or same.\n\nSo, the number of games the winner can play is determined by how many layers of this selection we can create.\n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's model this as the maximum number of games.\n\nLet f(k) be the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\nWe can compute f(k):\n\nf(0) = 1 (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that each game can only occur between players whose previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimum number of players needed for `k` games is the sum of the first `k+2` Fibonacci numbers.\n\n1. **Identify the Fibonacci Pattern**: The problem can be transformed into finding the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k+2` Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to `n`.\n2. **Compute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to the point where their sum exceeds `n`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: Using the generated Fibonacci numbers, find the maximum `k` where the sum of the first `k+2` numbers is just less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    # Now find the largest k where fib[k+2] <= n\n    # Since fib starts as [1,1], let's see:\n    # For k=1, sum is fib[3] (which is 2), etc.\n    # We need to find the largest index m such that fib[m] <= n, then k = m-2\n    # Wait, let me think again.\n    # Let's say fib is built as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...\n    # Each step adds the next Fibonacci number.\n    # The maximum number of games is the largest k where fib[k+2] <= n.\n    # Because for k=1: fib[3]=2, which is 2 players, so max games is 1.\n    # So, we'll loop through the fib list and find the largest value <=n.\n    # Then, the position in the fib list minus 2 gives us the max games.\n    max_fib = 0\n    for i in range(len(fib)):\n        if fib[i] > n:\n            break\n        max_fib = fib[i]\n    return max_fib - 2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 1 and 1 until the next number exceeds `n`.\n2. **Finding the Maximum Valid Fib Number**: We iterate through the generated Fibonacci numbers to find the largest number that does not exceed `n`.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Games**: The index of this largest valid Fibonacci number minus 2 gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for larger values of `n`.",
