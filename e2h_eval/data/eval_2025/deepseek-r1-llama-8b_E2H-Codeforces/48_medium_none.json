He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Shapur is trying to capture Valerian by opening doors. The problem involves converting a number from base a to base b, but with some special rules if the base is Roman (i.e., 'R').\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the input consists of multiple test cases. For each case, we have two lines: the first line has a and b, which are integers representing the starting base and the target base. The second line has a string representing a number c in base a. We need to convert c into base b, following specific rules for Roman numerals if applicable.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, the second part of each door could be an integer or 'R'. So, the target base can be either a normal integer or 'R', which implies that it's using the Roman numeral system.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\n- If b is 'R', then the output should be the Roman numeral representation of the number in base 10.\n- Otherwise, the output should be the number written in base b, without any letters (using digits only).\n\nHmm, but wait—no, actually, looking back at the problem statement, the second part of each door is either an integer or 'R'. So, the target base is either an integer or 'R' (which represents the Roman system). So, when converting, if the target base is 'R', then the number is converted to a Roman numeral string. Else, it's converted to base b as a string of digits, possibly including letters like A, B, etc., since bases can be higher than 10.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the second part is either an integer or R. But in the context of the problem, when you're writing the number in base b, if b is not R, then you write it in base b using the standard digits. So for example, if b is 2, then the number would be represented as a binary string, without letters. But if b is R, then the number is converted into Roman numerals.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe second part is either an integer b or R. So, when processing each test case, the target base is either an integer or R. So, in the code, for each test case, we first parse whether the target base is R or an integer.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst test case: a=10, b=2, c='1' (in base 10). So we convert 1 from base 10 to base 2, which is '1'.\n\nSecond test case: a=16, b=R. So the target is to convert c (which is in base 16) into Roman numerals. So the input is '5', which is 5 in base 16 (so value 5 in base 10), converted to Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird test case: a=5, b=R. c is '4' in base 5, which is 4 in decimal, so Roman is 'IV'.\n\nFourth test case: a=2, b=2. c is '1111001' in base 2. So converting to base 2 is the same, but leading zeros are omitted, so output is '1111001'.\n\nFifth test case: a=12, b=13. c is 'A' in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. When converting to base 13, 10 is less than 13, so it's 'A' again.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read a and b. Determine if b is 'R' or an integer.\n2. Read c, which is a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal (base 10) number.\n4. Then, depending on b:\n   - If b is 'R': convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n   - Else: convert the decimal number to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n5. Output the result.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Parsing a and b correctly (since b could be 'R').\n- Converting c from base a to decimal.\n- Depending on b, either converting to Roman or to base b's digit representation.\n\nNow, let's think about each of these steps.\n\nFirst, parsing a and b.\n\nWe'll read the first line as a string, split into two parts. Each part can be either an integer or 'R'. For example, if the line is '10 2', then a=10, b=2. If it's '16 R', then a=16, b is 'R'.\n\nSo in Python, for each test case:\n\nline = input().split()\na = int(line[0])\nb = line[1] if len(line) > 1 else line[0]\nWait, no. Because in the first line, the two numbers are a and b. So line will have two elements, except when b is 'R'? Or wait, no—the first line is two integers a and b, but b may be replaced by 'R'.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the second part is either an integer or R. So the first line is two integers, but the second is either an integer or 'R'. So, in the input, the first line will have two parts, the second of which is either a number or 'R'.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first test case is '10 2\\n1' — so a=10, b=2.\n\nAnother example: '16 R\\n5' — a=16, b='R'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each test case:\n    a, b_str = input().split()\n    a = int(a)\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        target_base_is_roman = True\n        b = None  # we don't need the value of b\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        target_base_is_roman = False\n\nWait, but wait: the second line in the input is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So for each test case, the input is two lines: the first is a and b, the second is c.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead all test cases, process each one by one.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input, it's given as a list of strings. But perhaps the actual input is via stdin, with each test case being two lines.\n\nIn any case, in code, I can read lines until EOF, processing each pair.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, each test case is given as two lines: the first is a and b, the second is c.\n\nSo in code, something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ntest_cases = []\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_b_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n    a, b_str = a_b_line.split()\n    a = int(a)\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        target_base_is_roman = True\n        b = None\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        target_base_is_roman = False\n    # process c_line\n    c = c_line\n    # process and print\n\nWait, but how many test cases are there? Because the sample input shows multiple test cases, each with their own a, b, and c. So, the code needs to loop through each pair of lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor _ in range(1000):  # arbitrary high limit\n    a_b = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    a, b_str = a_b.split()\n    a = int(a)\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        target_is_roman = True\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        target_is_roman = False\n\n    # Now process c from base a to decimal\n    num = from_base_a_to_decimal(c, a)\n    if target_is_roman:\n        roman = int_to_roman(num)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        s = int_to_base(num, b)\n        print(s)\n\nWait, but for each test case, we have to process and print.\n\nSo, the key functions needed are:\n\n1. from_base_a_to_decimal: converts a string in base a to its decimal equivalent.\n\n2. int_to_roman: converts a decimal number to a Roman numeral string.\n\n3. int_to_base: converts a decimal number to a string in the given base, using the appropriate digits (0-9, A-Z for bases up to 36, but in our case, the base is at most 25, so letters go up to P (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 25 is P? Wait, no: for bases higher than 10, letters represent 10, 11, etc. So for base 25, the digits are 0-9, A=10, B=11,..., P=25-10=15? Wait, no, wait: the letters are added beyond 9. So for base b, digits are 0,1,2,...,9,A,B,C,... up to (b-1). So for example, base 16 has digits 0-9, A-F (since 16 digits). So for base 25, the digits are 0-9, then A=10, B=11, ... up to P=24 (since 25-1=24).\n\nSo, for the function int_to_base, we need to generate the correct string representation for a given base, without leading zeros.\n\nNow, let's tackle each function.\n\nFirst, from_base_a_to_decimal.\n\nThis function takes a string c and base a, and returns the integer value of c in base a.\n\nHandling leading zeros: the problem states that the output should omit leading zeros, but for the intermediate steps, perhaps the input c can have leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, if c is '0001' in base 10, the decimal value is 1.\n\nImplementing from_base_a_to_decimal:\n\nWe can iterate over each character in the string c, and compute the value.\n\nDigits allowed depend on the base a.\n\nIn base a, each digit must be less than a. So, for each char in c, we need to check if it's a valid digit in base a.\n\nBut the problem says that c is a valid number in base a, so we don't have to handle invalid inputs.\n\nSo, for each character in c:\n\ndigit_value = 0\n\nfor each char in c:\n\n   if char is between 0-9: digit = int(char)\n\n   else if uppercase: digit = 10 + ord(char) - ord('A')\n\n   else if lowercase: similar, but maybe the problem uses uppercase only? Wait, the problem says that c is in base a, but in the input, the string is given as is. So in the sample input, 'A' is given as a valid digit in base 12.\n\nWait, but in the input, the c string can contain letters, but according to the problem statement, c is in base a. So, for base a, the digits can be 0-9, A, B, C, etc., up to (a-1). So, for example, in base 16, digits can be 0-9, A-F.\n\nSo, the function from_base_a_to_decimal needs to parse each character in c and compute the value.\n\nImplementing that:\n\ndef from_base_a_to_decimal(c, a):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in c:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            d = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            d = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\n        num = num * a + d\n\n    return num\n\nWait, but what if a is 1? No, because in the problem statement, a is at least 2.\n\nYes, the constraints say 2 <= a, b <=25.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nNext, int_to_roman: convert a decimal number to a Roman numeral string.\n\nThis is a standard problem, but with some nuances.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules for subtractive notation (like IV=4, IX=9, XL=40, etc.), and also for larger numbers.\n\nThe algorithm typically builds the Roman string by breaking the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and for each part, appends the corresponding Roman symbols.\n\nBut we need to handle cases where a subtractive form is used (like 4 is IV, not IIII).\n\nAn efficient way is to use a list of tuples that map values to their Roman representations, including the subtractive forms.\n\nThe standard approach is to create a list like:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for each value in the list, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the corresponding Roman string each time.\n\nSo, for example, for 389:\n\nWe start with 389.\n\nTake 1000: no.\n\nThen 900: no.\n\n500: no.\n\n400: no.\n\n100: 389 >=100 → append 'C', subtract 100 → 289.\n\nAgain, 100: yes, append 'C' → 189.\n\nAgain, 100: yes, append 'C' → 89.\n\nNext, 90: 89 <90, no.\n\n50: 89 >=50 → append 'L', subtract 50 →39.\n\n40: 39<40, no.\n\n10: 39>=10 → append 'X', subtract 10 →29.\n\nAgain, 10: 29→19, append 'X' → now 19.\n\nAgain, 10: 19→9, append 'X' → 9.\n\nThen, 9: 9 → append 'IX', subtract 9 →0.\n\nSo the total is 'CCCCLXXXIX'.\n\nSo the function can be implemented as follows:\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n\n    return res\n\nThat's a standard approach.\n\nNow, the third function is int_to_base, which converts a decimal number to a string in the given base, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, if the base is 2, and the number is 5, the output is '101'.\n\nIf the base is 13 and the number is 10, the output is 'A'.\n\nBut wait, for base 13, 10 is represented as 'A', 11 as 'B', up to 12 as 'M'?\n\nWait, no: for base b, the digits are 0,1,2,...9,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,..., up to (b-1). So for base 13, the digits are 0-9, then A for 10, B for 11, ..., M for 12.\n\nWait, no: because 0-9 are 10 digits, then letters start at 10, so for base b, the maximum digit is b-1. So for base 13, the digits go up to 12, which is represented as 'M' (since 10 is A, 11 is B, 12 is C? Wait, no: 10 is A, 11 is B, 12 is C, 13 would be D, etc. Wait, no. Wait, in base systems beyond 10, each letter represents a value from 10 onwards. So for base 13:\n\ndigits are 0,1,2,...9,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L.\n\nBecause 0-9 is 10 digits, and then 10 letters, making 20 possible digits for base 13.\n\nWait, no. Wait, base 13 has 13 possible digits. So 0-9 is 10, then A (10), B (11), C (12), D (13). Wait, but base 13 digits can only be 0-12. So D represents 13, which is beyond the base, so that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. In base 13, each digit can be 0-12. So the digits are represented as 0,1,2,...9,A,B,C (since 10 is A, 11 is B, 12 is C). So for base 13, the digits are 0-12, represented by 0-9 and A-C.\n\nSo, for a number n, when converting to base b:\n\nWe repeatedly divide n by b, collecting the remainders. For each remainder, if it's less than 10, we add the digit as a string. If it's 10 or more, we add the corresponding letter.\n\nSo, for example, n=10 in base 13: 10 /13 is 0, remainder 10 → 'A'.\n\nn=12: 12 → 'C'.\n\nn=13: 13/13 =1, remainder 0 → '0' followed by 'A' (since 1 is '1'). So 13 in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nWait, no, 13 in base 13 is equal to 1*13^1 + 0*13^0 =13, which is written as 'A0' in base 13, but leading zeros are omitted, so it's 'A'.\n\nWait, but when converting, the process is:\n\nnumber = 13\n\ndigits = []\n\nwhile number >0:\n\n    rem = number % b\n\n    if rem <10:\n\n        digits.append(str(rem))\n\n    else:\n\n        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem -10))\n\n    number = number // b\n\nSo, for 13, b=13:\n\nnumber is 13.\n\nrem =13%13=0 → digits.append('0').\n\nnumber becomes 1.\n\nloop continues:\n\nrem=1%13=1 → digits.append('1').\n\nnumber becomes 0.\n\ndigits are ['0','1'] → reversed is '10' → which is 1*13 +0=13.\n\nBut the output should be 'A' because 13 in base 13 is 10, which is 'A'.\n\nWait, so I'm misunderstanding the process. Because in base 13, 13 is represented as 10 (since 1*13 +0=13). So when we have a remainder of 10, which is >=10, so we represent it as 'A'.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, for 13:\n\nn=13, b=13.\n\ndivmod(13,13) → (1,0). So remainder is 0 → digit is '0'.\n\nThen n=1.\n\ndivmod(1,13) → (0,1). Remainder is 1 → digit is '1'.\n\nSo the digits collected are ['0','1'], which when reversed gives '10' → but in base 13, '10' is 13 in decimal.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output should be 'A' because the target base is 13.\n\nWait, this suggests that the function int_to_base is not simply taking the remainders and mapping them, but perhaps when the target base is higher than 10, the digits are represented differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIt says that the fourth part is empty, implying that the door's second part is either an integer or R.\n\nWait, but when the target base is not R, it's a normal base, and the output should be the number written in base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nIn the sample input, the last test case is:\n\nInput: a=12, b=13, c='A'\n\nWhich is 'A' in base 12 (value 10). So converting to base 13, which is 10, which is 'A'.\n\nSo, the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, for the function int_to_base, when the base is higher than 10, the digits are represented as per their value, using letters A-Z.\n\nThus, the function needs to correctly represent each digit based on its value, whether it's less than 10 or higher.\n\nSo, the approach for int_to_base is:\n\nWhile n>0:\n\n   rem = n % b\n\n   if rem <10: add str(rem) to the list.\n\n   else: add the corresponding letter (A=10, B=11, ..., Z=35). But since in our case, b is up to 25, rem can be up to 24, so letters go up to Y (10-24: A-Y).\n\nWait, no. Because for base 25, the digits are 0-24. So 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 Y.\n\nSo, for each rem:\n\nif rem <10: add str(rem)\n\nelse: rem -10 is the offset, so 'A' + (rem-10) is the character.\n\nBut in Python, 'A' is ord 65. So for rem=10: 65 + 0 → 'A'; rem=11: 'B', etc.\n\nSo, for rem in 0-9: use str(rem)\n\nElse: chr(65 + (rem -10)).\n\nBut wait, rem can be up to b-1. Since b can be up to 25, rem can be up to 24.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, b):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % b\n\n        if rem < 10:\n\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n\n        else:\n\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n\n        n = n // b\n\n    # reverse the digits and join\n\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but let's test this function.\n\nTest case 1: n=5, b=2 → 101 → '101'.\n\nint_to_base(5,2):\n\n5//2=2, rem 1 → '1'\n\n2//2=1, rem 0 → '0'\n\n1//2=0, rem 1 → '1'\n\ndigits are ['1', '0', '1'] → reversed → '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nTest case 2: n=10, b=13 → 'A'.\n\nn=10: rem=10 → 'A' → digits ['A'], n=0.\n\nreversed is 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nTest case 3: n=13, b=13.\n\nn=13:\n\n13%13=0 → '0' → digits.append('0')\n\nn=1.\n\n1%13=1 → '1' → digits.append('1')\n\ndigits are ['0','1'] → reversed is '10' → which is '10', but according to the sample input, when the target base is 13, 13 in base 13 is '10', but in the sample input, when a=12, b=13, c='A' (which is 10 in base 12, value 10 in decimal), the output is 'A'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the fifth test case:\n\na=12, b=13, c='A' → which is 'A' in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. So converting to base 13, which is 10, which is 'A'.\n\nSo, the function for n=10, b=13 returns 'A'.\n\nBut according to the function above, when n=10, b=13:\n\nrem =10 → 'A' → digits=['A'], then n=0 → returns 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=14, b=13 → 14/13=1 rem 1 → digits are ['1','1'] → reversed → '11' → which is 'B' in base 13.\n\nWait, no: 11 in base 13 is 1*13 +1=14.\n\nBut the function returns '11', which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the fifth test case, the output is 'A' because 10 is 'A' in base 13.\n\nSo, the function seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=25, b=25.\n\n25 /25 =1 rem 0 → '0'\n\n1/25=0 rem 1 → '1'\n\ndigits are ['0','1'] → reversed is '10' → which is '10' in base 25. But 10 is represented as 'A' in base 25.\n\nWait, no: in base 25, 10 is represented as 'A'.\n\nSo, in the function, for n=25, the code returns '10', but according to the rules, 10 in base 25 is 'A'.\n\nSo, there's a problem here.\n\nWait, wait. Because in the function, for rem=10, it appends 'A' to the digits list.\n\nSo, for n=25, b=25:\n\nn=25 → rem =25 %25=0 → '0', n=1.\n\nn=1 → rem=1 → '1', n=0.\n\ndigits are ['0','1'] → reversed is '10' → which is '10' in base 25.\n\nBut according to the rules, 10 in base 25 should be 'A'.\n\nSo, the function is wrong.\n\nAh! So, the function's logic is incorrect for bases higher than 10.\n\nBecause, when the base is higher than 10, any digit that is 10 or higher is represented by a letter.\n\nWait, no: the function is supposed to represent each digit according to its value. So for a base 25, each digit can be 0-24.\n\nSo, for a digit value of 10, it's represented as 'A'; 11 as 'B', etc.\n\nSo, in the case of n=25 in base 25:\n\nn=25.\n\ndivmod(25,25) → (1,0). So rem=0 → '0', add to digits.\n\nn=1.\n\ndivmod(1,25) → (0,1) → rem=1 → '1', add to digits.\n\ndigits are ['0','1'] → reversed → '10'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, 10 in base 25 should be 'A'.\n\nSo, the function is returning '10', but it should return 'A'.\n\nWait, no. Because 10 in base 25 is 25 in decimal, which is the same as 10 * 25^1 + 0 → but wait, no. 10 in base 25 is 2*25^1 + 0 → no, wait, 10 in base 25 is 10 (but that's 25 in decimal). No, wait, base 25 represents numbers as sum of digits multiplied by powers of 25.\n\nSo, 10 in base 25 is 1*25^1 + 0*25^0 =25.\n\nBut 25 in base 25 is represented as '10' because 10 is 2*25^1 + 0 → no, wait no: 10 in base 25 is 25 in decimal. But 25 is 25^1, which is '10' in base 25.\n\nSo, the function is correct in returning '10' for n=25, b=25.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the output should be in base b. So in this case, the output is '10'.\n\nBut why in the sample input, when the number is 10 in base 13, it's printed as 'A'?\n\nBecause 10 in base 13 is 'A', which is correct.\n\nSo, the function is correct for bases where the digits are 0-9 and letters A-Z for 10 and above.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output should be the number written in base b as a string.\n\nSo, for base 25, 10 is 'A' as a single digit, but in the function, 10 is represented as 'A', but when the number is 25, which is 10 in base 25, it's '10'.\n\nSo, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, no. The function is supposed to represent the entire number in base b as a string.\n\nSo, for example, if the number is 25 (decimal), and the base is 25, then it's written as '10' in base 25.\n\nBut in the function, when we have n=25, b=25:\n\ndigits are [0,1], reversed as '10'.\n\nSo the function returns '10', which is correct.\n\nWait, but 10 in base 25 is 25 in decimal, which is 10 in base 25.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nBut earlier, in the sample input, the fifth test case:\n\nc is 'A' in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. So converting to base 13, the function returns 'A' as expected.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nBut then why in the earlier test case of n=25, base 25, the function returns '10' instead of 'A'?\n\nBecause 10 in base 25 is '10', not 'A'. Because 10 in base 25 is a two-digit number: the first digit is 1 (for 25^1), and the second is 0 (for 25^0). So, the function is correct.\n\nSo, the function is correct as written.\n\nWait, but what about when the base is 13 and the number is 10? It should return 'A', which the function does.\n\nSo, I think the function is correct.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement these functions in Python.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: c is '0' in base a.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that c is a non-negative integer, and it's guaranteed that if the number is in Roman numerals, it's <=300010. But in other cases, it's <=101510.\n\nBut in code, when converting c from base a, if c is '0', the decimal value is 0.\n\nBut when target base is R, 0 cannot appear because the problem says that the number won't be zero.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\nSo, for target base R, the number is non-zero.\n\nBut for other bases, c can be zero, which would result in zero after conversion.\n\nSo, in code, when target is not R, and the converted number is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nBut in the function int_to_base, if n is zero, it returns '0'.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle this.\n\nAnother edge case: leading zeros in c.\n\nWhen converting, leading zeros are allowed in c, but the output must omit leading zeros.\n\nFor example, c is '0001' in base 10 → decimal is 1 → output is '1'.\n\nSo, the function from_base_a_to_decimal correctly handles leading zeros.\n\nNow, another issue: the problem says that the output must not have leading zeros. So, in the function int_to_base, if the resulting string starts with '0's, they are removed.\n\nWait, but in the function, the digits are collected in reverse order. So, for example, if the number is 0, the function returns '0'.\n\nIf the number is 5, and base is 16, it's '5'.\n\nIf the number is 10, base 16: 'A'.\n\nIf the number is 16 in base 16: 16 is 10, so 10 is 'A' → but wait, no: 16 in base 16 is '10' → which is '10' in hex.\n\nWait, 16 in base 16 is 10 in hex, which is '10' → but according to the function, the digits are collected as 0 and 1, reversed to '10'.\n\nSo, function is correct.\n\nSo, the code should be fine.\n\nAnother edge case: when the base is 1. But the problem says base is at least 2, so no problem.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nFor each, read a and b_str.\n\nCompute whether the target base is R.\n\nParse c from base a into a decimal number.\n\nConvert to the target base's representation.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nImplement helper functions:\n\nfrom_base_a_to_decimal.\n\nint_to_roman.\n\nint_to_base.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut wait: the problem statement mentions that in the sample input, the outputs are in the form of a list, but in reality, the code should read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's presented as a list of strings, but in reality, it's probably a series of test cases, each with two lines.\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo, in code, the structure is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef from_base_a_to_decimal(c, a):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n        num = num * a + d\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n    return res\n\ndef int_to_base(n, b):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % b\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // b\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    for _ in range(1000):  # assuming up to 1000 test cases\n        a_b = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        a, b_str = a_b.split()\n        a = int(a)\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            target_is_roman = True\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            target_is_roman = False\n\n        # convert c to decimal\n        num = from_base_a_to_decimal(c, a)\n\n        # process based on target\n        if target_is_roman:\n            roman = int_to_roman(num)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            if num == 0:\n                print('0')\n            else:\n                s = int_to_base(num, b)\n                print(s)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the outputs are all in uppercase letters except for the numeric ones.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output should be the string representation, e.g., 'V', 'IV', etc.\n\nIn the function int_to_base, when the digit is >=10, it's represented by uppercase letters.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst test case:\n\na=10, b=2, c='1' → decimal 1.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, considering special rules for the Roman numeral system. The problem involves reading multiple test cases, each with two lines of input: the first line specifying the starting base and the target base (which can be 'R' for Roman numerals), and the second line specifying the number in the starting base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We read each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains the starting base `a` and the target base `b` (which can be 'R'). The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion Functions:** We use helper functions to convert the number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) number, then convert this decimal number to either a Roman numeral string or a string in the target base `b`.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** This function converts a decimal number to its Roman numeral representation using predefined mappings for thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.\n4. **Base Conversion:** This function converts a decimal number to a string representation in a specified base, handling digits beyond 9 using letters A-Z.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef from_base_a_to_decimal(c, a):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n        num = num * a + d\n    return num\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n    return res\n\ndef int_to_base(n, b):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % b\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // b\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    for _ in range(1000):  # Assuming up to 1000 test cases\n        a_b = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        a, b_str = a_b.split()\n        a = int(a)\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            target_is_roman = True\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            target_is_roman = False\n\n        # Convert c to decimal\n        num = from_base_a_to_decimal(c, a)\n\n        # Process based on target\n        if target_is_roman:\n            roman = int_to_roman(num)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            if num == 0:\n                print('0')\n            else:\n                s = int_to_base(num, b)\n                print(s)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads each test case line by line, processing the starting base and target base, and the number in the starting base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal:** The function `from_base_a_to_decimal` converts the given number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) number.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The function `int_to_roman` converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral string using a list of tuples that map values to their Roman equivalents.\n4. **Base Conversion:** The function `int_to_base` converts the decimal number to a string in the specified base, handling digits beyond 9 by converting them to letters.\n\nThis approach ensures that each test case is processed efficiently, correctly converting numbers between bases and handling special cases for Roman numerals.",
