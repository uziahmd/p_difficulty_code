String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Vasily the Bear wants to count the number of beautiful strings. Let's read the problem carefully and figure out what needs to be done.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is one that consists only of 0s and 1s. It must have exactly n zeros and m ones. But wait, no, the problem says it's beautiful if after some modifications, it can reach that state. Or wait, no—wait, the initial string can be modified in certain ways, but the resulting string must satisfy the beautiful condition.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) modifications.\" Hmm, I think that part might not be directly relevant for the beautiful string definition. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read.\n\nThe string is beautiful if it meets two criteria: it consists only of 0s and 1s, and the counts are exactly n zeros and m ones. But how do we get there? Because the initial string could be modified through certain operations.\n\nWait, no, the beautiful string is any string that can be obtained by modifying some other string (including possibly itself) according to the rules. So the question is to count all possible strings that can be transformed into a beautiful string via zero or more allowed modifications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the beautiful string is the target, and we need to find all possible strings that can reach it. No, maybe not. The problem says that the beautiful string is one that, when you perform the modifications, results in a string with exactly n zeros and m ones. Or maybe the beautiful string is the original string before any modifications, but it can't be modified because the counts already meet the condition.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria: it consists of 0s and 1s, with exactly n 0s and m 1s. We can obtain character g from s with some modifications.\" Oh, so the modifications are allowed, but the resulting string after modifications must have the correct counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the string s can be modified in such a way that it becomes a beautiful string, which has exactly n 0s and m 1s. Or perhaps s is the beautiful string, meaning that after any number of modifications, including zero, it can become a string with the required counts.\n\nNo, the problem says that the beautiful string is s, which satisfies that its final state after modifications has exactly n zeros and m ones. Wait, no, perhaps s is the original string, and after some modifications, it becomes a beautiful string. Or wait, the problem says that s is beautiful if it can be modified to have exactly n zeros and m ones.\n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should re-express the problem:\n\nA string is beautiful if after some number of modifications, it can become a string that consists of exactly n zeros and m ones. Or perhaps the beautiful string is the one that, after any number of modifications, can reach that state.\n\nWait, perhaps the beautiful string is any string that can be modified (possibly zero times) to become a string with exactly n zeros and m ones. So our task is to count all such possible original strings that can be transformed into a beautiful string via the allowed modifications.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"count the number of beautiful strings.\" So the beautiful string is the one that satisfies the criteria. So the beautiful string is a string s which meets the two conditions: it consists of 0s and 1s, has exactly n zeros and m ones. Additionally, after some modifications, it can obtain g as its last character.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again:\n\n\"A string s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria: String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times. We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\"\n\nWait, so the beautiful string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. Additionally, the string s can be modified (possibly zero times) to have a certain last character g. So for the string s to be beautiful, after some modifications, the last character is g.\n\nWait, no. The way it's written is that s is beautiful if it meets those two criteria: the counts of 0s and 1s, and that you can obtain g by modifying s. So the beautiful string must satisfy both the count condition and be modifiable to end with g.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the beautiful string is one that has exactly n 0s and m 1s, and can be modified (possibly zero times) to have g as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones after some modifications. The modifications allowed are replacing the last two characters of the string with one character, either '0' or '1', depending on the original characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: A beautiful string must consist of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. Additionally, it must be possible to modify the string (possibly zero times) such that the resulting string ends with the character `g`.\n\n2. **Modifications Insight**: The modification operation allows us to replace the last two characters of the string with a single character. This means that the length of the string can decrease by one each time a modification is made. However, the final string must still have exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n\n3. **Key Insight**: For a string to be beautiful, the initial string must be such that after any number of modifications, it can end with the character `g`. This implies that the length of the string must be at least `max(n, m)` because each modification reduces the length by one, and we need enough characters to form both `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to count valid strings of different lengths and configurations. We will define a state `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` is the number of zeros, `j` is the number of ones, and `k` is the length of the string minus the maximum of `n` and `m`.\n\n5. **Transition**: For each state, consider adding a '0' or '1' to the end of the string, ensuring that the resulting counts do not exceed `n` or `m` respectively. If the length allows, consider modifying the last two characters to reduce the length by one.\n\n6. **Base Case**: Initialize the DP table with the base case where the string is empty.\n\n7. **Result Calculation**: Sum up all valid states that meet the criteria for the beautiful string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (n == 0 and m == 0):\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_len = max(n, m)\n\n# dp[i][j][k] = number of ways to have i zeros, j ones, and current length k (relative to max_len)\n# k ranges from 0 to max_len - 1\ndp = [[[0] * (max_len) for _ in range(m + 1)] for __ in range(n + 1)]\n\n# Base case: empty string\ndp[0][0][0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    for j in range(m + 1):\n        for k in range(max_len):\n            current = dp[i][j][k]\n            if current == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Option 1: add a '0' if possible\n            if i < n:\n                new_i = i + 1\n                new_j = j\n                new_k = k + 1\n                if new_k <= max_len:\n                    dp[new_i][new_j][new_k] = (dp[new_i][new_j][new_k] + current) % MOD\n            \n            # Option 2: add a '1' if possible\n            if j < m:\n                new_i = i\n                new_j = j + 1\n                new_k = k + 1\n                if new_k <= max_len:\n                    dp[new_i][new_j][new_k] = (dp[new_i][new_j][new_k] + current) % MOD\n            \n            # Option 3: perform a modification if possible\n            if k >= 1:\n                # After modification, the length decreases by 1\n                # So previous length was k+1, now it's k\n                prev_k = k + 1\n                if prev_k > max_len:\n                    continue\n                \n                # To reach here, the last two characters were modified into one.\n                # So the total number of 0s and 1s remains the same as before the modification.\n                # But the length decreases by 1.\n                \n                # The last two characters could have been:\n                # - '00' -> becomes '0'\n                # - '11' -> becomes '1'\n                # - '01' or '10' -> becomes '0' or '1' depending on which two are replaced.\n                \n                # Wait, no.

Maybe the modification can only be applied if the last two characters are considered.\n                \n                # So to model this, for each state (i, j, k), if k >= 1, then we can consider the possibility that the previous state was (i, j, k+1) and a modification was performed.\n                # But how?\n                \n                # Alternatively, for each state (i, j, k), if the next state (i, j, k+1) exists, then we can consider that a modification might have been done from (i, j, k+1) to (i, j, k).\n                # But I'm not sure about this approach.\n                \n                # Perhaps another way: for each state (i, j, k), if k >= 1, then we can look at the state (i, j, k+1) and see if a modification would lead to (i, j, k).\n                \n                # Wait, no.

So if we are in state (i, j, k), it could have come from state (i, j, k+1) via a modification.\n                \n                # So for each state (i, j, k), if k >= 1, then we can add the value from (i, j, k+1) to (i, j, k), but only if the modification is valid.\n                \n                # But how do we determine if a modification is possible?

But how?\n                \n                # Wait, performing a modification reduces the length by 1. So if we have a state (i, j, k+1), we can modify it to (i, j, k). But the counts remain the same.\n                \n                # So for each state (i, j, k), we can add the value from (i, j, k+1) to (i, j, k), but only if the previous state exists.\n                \n                # So in the DP transitions, for each state (i, j, k), if k >= 1, then:\n                # dp[i][j][k] += dp[i][j][k+1]\n                \n                # But wait, this assumes that any state (i, j, k+1) can be modified to (i, j, k), which isn't always true. Because the modification depends on the last two characters.\n                \n                # So this approach overcounts because not all states (i, j, k+1) can be modified to (i, j, k).\n                \n                # Therefore, this suggests that the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n                \n                # Given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, considering that the modification can only be applied if the length allows, but not worrying about the specific characters being modified. This will give an incorrect result, but perhaps the problem expects this approach.\n                \n                # Alternatively, perhaps the key insight is that the modification can only change the last character, but not the counts. So for the string to be modifiable to end with g, the counts must allow for that.\n                \n                # Therefore, the solution is to count all strings that can be reduced to a beautiful string through any number of modifications. But since each modification reduces the length by one, the initial string must have a length that is at least `max(n, m) + t`, where t is the number of modifications needed.\n                \n                # But this is getting too vague. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the initial string must have a length that is at least `max(n, m)`, and then count all such strings that can be modified down to a beautiful string.\n                \n                # So the plan is:\n                # 1. The initial string must have length >= max(n, m).\n                # 2. The string must consist of exactly n zeros and m ones.\n                # 3. The string must be modifiable to end with g.\n                \n                # Wait, but the counts are fixed. So the string must have exactly n zeros and m ones, and its length must be such that it can be reduced to a string of length `min(n, m)`, but I'm not sure.\n                \n                # Another Idea: The minimal possible length of the beautiful string is `|n - m|`, but that's not directly useful.\n                \n                # Given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute all possible beautiful strings and then see which can be modified to end with g.\n                \n                # But given the constraints (n and m up to 105), this approach is feasible.\n                \n                # So the steps are:\n                # 1. Generate all possible strings with exactly n zeros and m ones.\n                # 2. For each such string, check if it can be modified to end with g.\n                # 3. Count the number of such strings modulo 1e9+7.\n                \n                # However, generating all possible strings is computationally expensive for n and m up to 105, as the total number of such strings is C(n + m, n), which can be very large (e.g., for n=105, m=105, it's about 1e211).\n                \n                # Therefore, this approach is not feasible.\n                \n                # Alternative Idea: Realize that the modification allows the string to end with g, but the counts remain the same.

Perform a modification if possible, which reduces the length by 1, leading to state (i, j, k-1) if possible.\n                \n                # The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 1.\n                \n                # Finally, sum all dp[n][m][k] for k from 0 to max_len, but also ensure that the string can be modified to end with g.\n                \n                # Wait, but how do we ensure that the string can be modified to end with g? That part is unclear.\n                \n                # Perhaps the key is that the final string (after all modifications) must end with g. So, for the initial string to be able to reach a string ending with g, it must have a certain structure.\n                \n                # Alternatively, perhaps the initial string can be modified any number of times, but the final string must have exactly n zeros and m ones and end with g. So the initial string must be such that it can be reduced to a string of length `L = n + m - t`, where t is the number of modifications, and the last character is g.\n                \n                # This seems complicated, so perhaps the initial approach of dynamic programming is the way to go, but we need to adjust the transitions to account for the modification operations.\n\n# After considering the problem, the correct approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking the counts of zeros and ones, and the current length of the string relative to the maximum required length. The modifications are handled by considering transitions that reduce the length by one when applicable.\n\n# Now, implementing the dynamic programming approach:\n\nInitialize a 3D DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to form a string with `i` zeros, `j` ones, and a current length of `k`.\n\nThe transitions are:\n1. Add a '0' to the end, leading to `(i+1, j, k+1)`.\n2. Add a '1' to the end, leading to `(i, j+1, k+1)`.\n3. Perform a modification if the length allows, reducing the length by one.\n\nFinally, sum all valid states where the counts are exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and the length is within the allowable range.\n\nHere's the code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif n == 0 and m == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_len = max(n, m)\n\n# dp[i][j][k] = number of ways to have i zeros, j ones, and current length k\ndp = [[[0] * (max_len + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)] for __ in range(n + 1)]\ndp[0][0][0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    for j in range(m + 1):\n        for k in range(max_len + 1):\n            current = dp[i][j][k]\n            if current == 0:\n                continue\n\n            # Option 1: add a '0' if possible\n            if i < n and k + 1 <= max_len:\n                dp[i + 1][j][k + 1] = (dp[i + 1][j][k + 1] + current) % MOD\n\n            # Option 2: add a '1' if possible\n            if j < m and k + 1 <= max_len:\n                dp[i][j + 1][k + 1] = (dp[i][j + 1][k + 1] + current) % MOD\n\n            # Option 3: perform a modification if possible\n            if k >= 1:\n                # Modification reduces the length by 1\n                # So the previous length was k + 1\n                # We can only perform a modification if the previous length was >= max_len\n                # Because otherwise, the string cannot be modified further to reach the required counts\n                # Wait, no. The modification can be performed regardless of the current length, as long as it's >= 1\n                # But for the string to be modifiable, the previous state must have allowed the modification\n                # However, since we're considering all possible ways, perhaps it's sufficient to add the current state's value to the state with k-1\n                # Because the modification can be performed any number of times\n                # So for each state (i, j, k), we can add to (i, j, k-1) the current value, but only if k >= 1\n                if k - 1 >= 0:\n                    dp[i][j][k - 1] = (dp[i][j][k - 1] + current) % MOD\n\n# Now, sum all dp[n][m][k] for k in 0 to max_len, but only if the string can end with 'g'\n\nresult = 0\nfor k in range(max_len + 1):\n    if k == 0:\n        if n == 0 and m == 0:\n            result = (result + 1) % MOD\n        continue\n    # To end with 'g', the last character must be 'g'. How can that happen?\n    # It can be because the string was built by adding a 'g' or by modifying the last two characters to 'g'.\n\n    # But in our DP, we don't track the last character. So perhaps this approach misses some information.\n\n    # Therefore, the current DP approach is insufficient because it doesn't track the last character, which is crucial for determining whether the string can end with 'g'.\n\n    # So, we need to modify the DP to track the last character.\n\n# So, let's adjust the DP to track the last character.\n\n# Re-defining the DP state:\n# dp[i][j][k][last_char], where last_char can be 0, 1, or None (for the first character).\n\n# But this increases the state space significantly. However, given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\n# Let's try to re-define the DP:\n\nmax_len = max(n, m)\nlast_char_options = [0, 1]\n\n# Initialize a 4-dimensional DP: dp[i][j][k][l], where l is the last character (0 or 1)\ndp = [ [[[0 for _ in last_char_options] for __ in range(max_len + 1)] for ___ in range(m + 1)] for ____ in range(n + 1)]\ndp[0][0][0][0] = 1\ndp[0][0][0][1] = 1\n\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    for j in range(m + 1):\n        for k in range(max_len + 1):\n            for l in range(len(last_char_options)):\n                current = dp[i][j][k][l]\n                if current == 0:\n                    continue\n\n                # Option 1: add a '0' to the end\n                if i < n and k + 1 <= max_len:\n                    new_i = i + 1\n                    new_j = j\n                    new_k = k + 1\n                    new_l = 0\n                    dp[new_i][new_j][new_k][new_l] = (dp[new_i][new_j][new_k][new_l] + current) % MOD\n\n                # Option 2: add a '1' to the end\n                if j < m and k + 1 <= max_len:\n                    new_i = i\n                    new_j = j + 1\n                    new_k = k + 1\n                    new_l = 1\n                    dp[new_i][new_j][new_k][new_l] = (dp[new_i][new_j][new_k][new_l] + current) % MOD\n\n                # Option 3: perform a modification if possible\n                if k >= 1:\n                    # Previous length was k + 1\n                    if k + 1 > max_len:\n                        continue\n\n                    # For each possible last character in the previous state\n                    for prev_l in range(len(last_char_options)):\n                        prev_val = dp[i][j][k + 1][prev_l]\n                        if prev_val == 0:\n                            continue\n\n                        # After modification, the last character is determined by the previous last two characters\n                        # We can model this by checking if the previous last character allows the modification to result in 'g'\n                        # But this is complicated, as the modification depends on the previous two characters.\n\n                        # For simplicity, assume that any modification can be performed, and the last character is carried over.\n                        # This is an approximation, but perhaps necessary for the problem.\n                        # In reality, the modification changes the last character, so this approach would not capture that correctly.\n\n                        # Therefore, this part is not fully accurate, leading to incorrect results.\n\n                        # Hence, the problem is more complex, and the initial DP approach without tracking the last character is insufficient.\n                        # Given the time constraints, perhaps it's best to proceed with the initial approach, acknowledging that it may not handle the modification correctly.\n\nresult = 0\nfor k in range(max_len + 1):\n    if k == 0:\n        if n == 0 and m == 0:\n            result = (result + 1) % MOD\n        continue\n    # We need to find all strings that end with 'g' and have exactly n zeros and m ones.\n    # But our DP doesn't track the last character, so we can't directly compute this.\n    # Therefore, the initial approach is incomplete.\n    # As a result, this problem is beyond my current understanding, and I'm unable to provide a correct solution.\n```\n\n### Final Note\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the constraints, the provided code is a starting point but does not fully solve the problem correctly.
