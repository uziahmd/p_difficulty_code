He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a certain string s of length n. The input gives all possible improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths from 1 to n-1), and I need to output a string where each character is 'P' or 'S', indicating whether the corresponding input string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, the challenge is that I don't know which is which, but I have to assign P or S such that exactly half of them are P and the other half S, and the assignments must be consistent with some possible string s.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that the given strings are indeed prefixes and suffixes of some existing string s. So my job is to find an assignment where each string is either a prefix or suffix of s, and the counts are equal.\n\nFirst, let me think about what makes a string a prefix or a suffix.\n\nFor a string t to be a prefix of s, it must be that t is the first k characters of s, for some k between 1 and n-1.\n\nSimilarly, for t to be a suffix of s, it must be the last k characters of s, for some k between 1 and n-1.\n\nNow, how can I determine which t's are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nI remember that in such problems, the correct approach often involves building the possible string s step by step. For example, the minimal way to construct s is to take the common prefixes and then see what the next character could be based on the suffixes.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the correct s must have the longest prefix that is also a suffix. Or wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps we can find the possible candidates by considering the maximum possible overlap.\n\nLet me think. For each possible position k, the first k characters must form a prefix, and the last k must form a suffix. But how do I determine which one is which?\n\nAnother approach: group the strings by their length. For each length l, there are two strings: one is a prefix candidate, the other a suffix candidate. Or maybe not necessarily, because some longer strings might include them as part of their prefixes or suffixes.\n\nWait, but each string of length l has exactly two occurrences in the input—no, wait the problem says that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for each l in 1..n-1, there are two strings: perhaps one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, or maybe both are prefixes or both are suffixes. Hmm, no, that's not possible because if both were prefixes, then the suffix would have to start with the same characters, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because otherwise, it's impossible for s to have both as prefixes or both as suffixes.\n\nSo for each l, one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. That seems plausible.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each length l, among the two strings, one will be a prefix, the other a suffix.\n\nOnce I can figure out for each l which is the prefix and which is the suffix, I can build s step by step.\n\nHow?\n\nLet's consider the first position. For l=1, the two strings are a single character each. One is the first character of s (prefix), the other is the last character (suffix). So, one of them is s[0], the other is s[-1]. So, for l=1, one is P and the other is S.\n\nSimilarly, for l=2, the two strings are possible prefixes and suffixes of length 2. But how to determine which is which.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the correct s can be determined by considering the maximal possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is such that for each position, the current character is determined by the prefix and suffix constraints.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal possible s that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: for each possible l, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of s, and the suffix of length l must be a suffix of s. Also, for l = k-1, the prefix of length k must be an extension of the prefix of length k-1, and similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is to find the correct s, and once s is known, I can easily assign P or S to each input string.\n\nBut the problem is that s is unknown, so I can't directly find it. Instead, I have to deduce it from the given strings.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I can model this as a graph, where each node represents a possible state of the current position in s, and edges represent adding a new character based on the available prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to realize that for the correct s, the set of all prefixes and suffixes must form a consistent structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps can work:\n\n1. For each possible l (from 1 to n-1), collect the two possible strings of length l. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\n2. The correct s must have the following properties:\n\n   a. All prefixes are a chain: prefix_l is a prefix of prefix_{l+1}.\n\n   b. Similarly, the suffixes must form a chain: suffix_l is a suffix of suffix_{l+1}.\n\n3. For each l, the prefix of length l must be a substring starting at position 0 in s, and the suffix of length l must be a substring ending at position n-1.\n\n4. The first character of s is the prefix of length 1, and the last character is the suffix of length 1.\n\n5. Then, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character of s, and so on.\n\nSo, the process is to find a string s of length n such that for each l, the prefix and suffix of length l are as per the input.\n\nWait, but how to find s without knowing which are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can construct s step by step.\n\nStart with the two possible options for the first character (the two l=1 strings). For each option, try to build s by checking the constraints for l=2, l=3, etc., until we can't proceed further. If a path leads to a valid s, then that's our answer.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, this approach may be feasible.\n\nBut let's think about how to implement this.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths.\n\n   For each l in 1..n-1, collect the two strings of length l.\n\n   For each l, decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n   Wait, but how? We don't know yet. So perhaps the way to proceed is to try all possibilities, but that could be computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but for each l, the two options are that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So for l=1, the two strings are a and b. Either a is the first character and b is the last, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for l=1, we have two possibilities.\n\nThen, for l=2, each possibility depends on l=1's choice.\n\nThis could lead to a lot of branching, but since n is small (up to 100), maybe manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nLet's consider that the correct s must have the property that for every l, the prefix of length l is a proper extension of the previous prefix, and similarly for the suffixes.\n\nWait, but not necessarily. Because the suffix of length l could be a different string than the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by taking the maximal possible prefix and then the maximal possible suffix.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe correct s must satisfy that for each l, the prefix of length l is a prefix of s, and the suffix of length l is a suffix of s. Additionally, for the entire string, the prefix and suffix of each l must agree in their overlapping parts.\n\nWait, for example, the suffix of length l must be a suffix of s, so the first l-1 characters of the suffix of l must match the prefix of l-1 of s. Similarly, the prefix of l must extend the prefix of l-1.\n\nWait, this suggests that for the correct s, the prefix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l.\n\nBecause when you have s, the prefix of l is s[0..l-1], and the suffix of l is s[n-l..n-1]. But these two may or may not be related.\n\nBut for s, the prefix of l and the suffix of l can be any strings, unless l exceeds (n - (n-l)) = 2l -n. Wait, perhaps for l <= n/2, the suffix of l starts after the prefix of l.\n\nWait, let's see for l=3 and n=5. The prefix is positions 0-2, the suffix is positions 2-4. So the third character is the same in both. So for l=3, the suffix's first character is s[2], which is the third character of the prefix. So the suffix of l=3 must start with the second character of the prefix of l=3.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l must be a string that starts with the (l - (n - (n - l)))th character of the prefix of l. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a given l, the suffix of l in s is s[n-l ... n-1]. The prefix of l is s[0 ... l-1]. So if l + l > n, then the suffix of l starts before the end of the prefix of l. So, for l = 3 and n=5, the suffix starts at position 2, which is within the prefix.\n\nIn this case, the suffix of l=3 is s[2..4], which overlaps with the prefix of l=3, which is s[0..2].\n\nSo, the suffix of l=3 must start with s[2], which is the third character of the prefix of l=3.\n\nSimilarly, for l=2 and n=5: suffix starts at 3, which is beyond the prefix of l=2 (positions 0-1). So the suffix of l=2 doesn't overlap with the prefix.\n\nSo, for each l, if l <= (n - l), i.e., l <= n/2, then the suffix of l starts in the middle of the prefix of l, so the suffix must start with a certain part of the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps this can help us find the correct mapping of which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l are candidate_prefix and candidate_suffix.\n\nTo determine which is the real prefix and suffix:\n\n- For each possible pair (A, B) where A is the prefix and B is the suffix, check if for all l, the suffix B starts with the appropriate part of the prefix A.\n\nWait, but that's a lot of checks. Alternatively, perhaps the correct mapping is the one where for each l, the suffix starts with the last (n - l) characters of the prefix.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, for each l, the suffix of l is s[n-l ... n-1]. The prefix of l is s[0 ... l-1]. So, for l <= n/2, the suffix of l starts at position s[n-l], which is s[l ... n-l-1] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as for each l, the suffix of l must be a string that starts with the (l - (n - l))-th character of the prefix of l. No, maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible pair of prefix and suffix for a given l, check if the suffix starts with the last part of the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the suffix must be a substring of s that ends at the end of s. The prefix is a substring that starts at the beginning. So, for l <= n - l, the suffix of l starts at position (n - l) which is >= l. So the suffix starts at position >= l, which is after the prefix starts. Thus, the suffix of l does not overlap with the prefix of l.\n\nWait, no: for l = 3 and n =5, the suffix starts at 2, which is within the prefix (positions 0-2). So the suffix starts at position 2, which is within the prefix. So the suffix of l=3 is s[2..4], and the prefix is s[0..2]. So the suffix starts at the third character of the prefix.\n\nThus, the suffix of l must start with the (n - l)-th character of the prefix of l, because s[n-l] = s[ (n-l) ] = the (n-l)-th character of s, which is s[ (n-l) ].\n\nWait, no: s is 0-based. So for l=3, n=5: the suffix starts at position 2, which is s[2], which is the third character of the prefix (since the prefix is s[0..2]). So the suffix of l=3 is a string that starts with s[2], which is the last character of the prefix of l=3.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l must start with the last character of the prefix of l.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So, for a given l, the suffix of l must start with the last character of the prefix of l.\n\nWait, no: because for l=3, n=5, the suffix starts at position 2, which is the third character of the prefix. So the suffix's first character is the same as the third character of the prefix.\n\nThus, for l=3, the suffix must be a string whose first character is equal to the third character of the prefix of l=3.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l must start with the (l-1)th character of the prefix of l.\n\nWait, because the prefix is length l, and the suffix starts at position (n-l). For l <= n/2, n-l >= l. So, for l=3, n=5: n-l =2. So the suffix starts at position 2, which is l-1 (since 3-1=2). So for l=3, the suffix starts at l-1.\n\nWait, more generally, for l <= n-l, the suffix starts at position (n-l). Since l <= n-l implies that n-l >= l, which means that (n-l) - (l-1) = n-2l +1 >=0.\n\nSo, for l <= n/2, the suffix starts at position (n-l), which is >= l. So the suffix starts at position (n-l), which is greater than l-1 only when n-l > l-1 → n>2l-1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the suffix starts at position (n-l) in s, and the prefix is s[0..l-1]. So, the suffix starts at (n-l) and goes for l characters.\n\nThus, for l <= n-l, the suffix starts at position (n-l), which is >= l. So, the suffix starts at position (n-l), which is greater than l-1 only when n-l > l-1 → n> 2l-1.\n\nWait, perhaps for l <= n/2, the suffix starts at (n-l) >= l, so the suffix starts after the prefix. So, the suffix's first character is s[n-l], which is the (n-l)th character of s.\n\nBut the prefix of l is s[0..l-1]. So, for l <= n/2, the suffix starts at s[n-l], which is beyond the prefix's end. So, the suffix's first character is s[n-l], which is not part of the prefix.\n\nBut for l > n/2, the suffix starts before the end of the prefix. So, for l=4, n=7: suffix starts at 3, which is within the prefix of 4 (positions 0-3).\n\nSo, for l > n/2, the suffix overlaps with the prefix.\n\nThus, for each l:\n\nIf l <= n/2:\n\n   The suffix starts at (n-l), which is beyond the prefix's end (since l <= n/2 → n-l >= l → n-l > l-1 → s[n-l] is beyond s[l-1]).\n\n   So, the suffix of l is s[n-l ... n-1], and the prefix is s[0...l-1]. These two are completely separate; the suffix doesn't share any characters with the prefix.\n\nIf l > n/2:\n\n   The suffix starts at (n-l), which is less than l. So, the suffix overlaps with the prefix.\n\n   The suffix's first (n-l) characters overlap with the prefix. Specifically, the suffix of l starts at position (n-l), which is the same as the prefix's position (n-l) if n-l < l.\n\n   Wait, for l=4, n=7: n-l=3. So the suffix starts at 3, which is within the prefix (0-3). So, the suffix is s[3..6], which overlaps with the prefix s[0..3].\n\n   So, the first (n-l) characters of the suffix are the same as the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\n   So, for l > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThis is a crucial observation.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix must satisfy:\n\nIf l <= n/2 → the suffix can be any string of length l, as it's entirely after the prefix.\n\nIf l > n/2 → the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix of l.\n\nThus, for each l, the suffix must be a string of length l that starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix of l, if l > n/2.\n\nThis is a key insight.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each l, among the two possible strings, determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nWe need to assign for each l which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, ensuring that:\n\n- For l <= n/2: the suffix can be any string of length l.\n\n- For l > n/2: the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be as follows:\n\n1. For each l, collect the two possible strings.\n\n2. Try all possible assignments of which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. For each assignment, check if it satisfies the constraints for l > n/2.\n\n4. Once a valid assignment is found, build the s string step by step.\n\n5. Once s is built, assign P and S to each input string accordingly.\n\nBut trying all possible assignments for each l could be computationally expensive, especially since for l=1, there are two choices, and for l=2, each choice could affect higher l.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, and for each l, there are two options, the total number of possibilities is 2^(n-1), which is way too big for n=100.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying all possibilities, perhaps we can find the correct assignment by using the constraints for l > n/2.\n\nFor l > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, for l > n/2, the suffix of l must be equal to the prefix of (n-l) concatenated with some suffix of length (l - (n-l)) = 2l -n.\n\nBut wait, for l > n/2, the suffix of l is s[n-l ... n-1], which is of length l.\n\nThe prefix of l is s[0 ... l-1], which is of length l.\n\nThe suffix of l must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, for l > n/2, the suffix of l must be equal to the first (n-l) characters of the prefix of l, followed by some string of length (l - (n-l)) = 2l -n.\n\nSo, the suffix of l is a combination of the prefix of (n-l) and some new part.\n\nSo, for l > n/2, the suffix is determined by the prefix.\n\nThus, for l > n/2, the suffix must be a string that starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, for each l > n/2, the two possible strings for that l must be checked to see which one starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix of l.\n\nWait, but the prefix of l is not known yet. So this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the correct s can be constructed by considering the longest possible prefix and then seeing what the suffix must be.\n\nWait, another Idea: for each possible l, the prefix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l.\n\nBut only for l > n/2, because for l <= n/2, the suffix and prefix are non-overlapping.\n\nSo, for l > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, for each l > n/2, the suffix must be equal to the prefix of (n-l) followed by some string.\n\nSo, for each l > n/2, among the two possible strings, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix. And the suffix must start with the prefix of (n-l).\n\nThus, for each l > n/2, the two strings can be checked:\n\nSuppose the prefix is A, the suffix is B.\n\nThen, B must start with the first (n-l) characters of A.\n\nBut since we don't know which is the prefix and which is the suffix, we can check for both possibilities.\n\nWait, but for each l, there are two possibilities: the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for l > n/2, for each of the two possibilities (A is prefix, B is suffix) or (B is prefix, A is suffix), we need to check if the suffix starts with the prefix of (n-l).\n\nThus, the algorithm can proceed as follows:\n\n- For l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   For each l, consider the two strings as candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n   For each possible assignment (candidate1 as prefix, candidate2 as suffix) and (candidate2 as prefix, candidate1 as suffix):\n\n      Check if for this assignment, all l > n/2 satisfy the condition that the suffix starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, we can proceed to build s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, but for l > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix. So, for each l > n/2, the suffix must be equal to the prefix of (n-l) plus some string.\n\nBut since the suffix is of length l, and the prefix of (n-l) is of length (n-l), the suffix is exactly the prefix of (n-l) plus a new string of length (l - (n-l)) = 2l -n.\n\nWait, but since n and l are fixed, 2l -n can vary.\n\nThus, for each l > n/2, the suffix must be the prefix of (n-l) followed by some string.\n\nSo, for each l > n/2, among the two strings, one is a possible prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nThe suffix must start with the prefix of (n-l). So, for each l > n/2:\n\n   For each of the two possible assignments (A is prefix, B is suffix) and (B is prefix, A is suffix):\n\n      Check if the suffix (B or A) starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix (A or B).\n\nIf this holds for all l > n/2, then this assignment is valid.\n\nOnce such an assignment is found, s can be constructed as follows:\n\n   s starts with the prefix of l=1.\n\n   For each subsequent l, the prefix is the prefix of l-1 plus the next character.\n\n   The suffix of l is built based on the suffix of l-1.\n\nWait, perhaps s can be built by combining the prefix and suffix chains.\n\nBut how to get the actual s.\n\nWait, perhaps s can be built by finding the minimal common superstring of all prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAlternatively, since for l=1, s starts with either A or B, and for l=2, s continues with the next character, which is determined by the prefix of 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nAnother Idea: After assigning which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes, we can build s by:\n\n- Start with the prefix of 1, which is either A or B for l=1.\n\n- For l=2, the prefix is the prefix of 1 plus the next character, which must be a string of length 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes:\n\n- The suffix of 1 is the last character of s.\n\n- The suffix of 2 is the last two characters of s.\n\nBut how to tie this together.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nOnce the assignment of P and S is determined, s can be built by merging the prefix chain and the suffix chain.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be uniquely determined by the assignment of P and S.\n\nOnce the assignment is done, the s can be built by starting with the prefix of 1, and for each l, the next character is determined by the prefix of l.\n\nBut again, the problem is that without knowing the assignment, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's try to find the correct s by considering that the suffixes must fit into the overall s.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best way is to:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n2. Try all possible assignments for the first l=1, which has two possibilities.\n\n3. For each such assignment, try to build s step by step.\n\n   a. For l=1, the prefix is either A or B, and the suffix is the other.\n\n   b. For l=2, the prefix must be a string formed by adding a character to the prefix of l=1.\n\n   c. The suffix of l=2 must be a string that ends with the suffix of l=1.\n\n   d. Continue this until either a contradiction is found, or s is built.\n\nBut even this could be time-consuming, but for n=100, it's manageable.\n\nBut how to represent the state during the process.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible assignment of P and S for l=1, we can build s step by step, checking at each step whether the constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nFor each possible assignment of the first l=1:\n\n   Assume that the first string is the prefix (P) and the second is the suffix (S).\n\n   Then, s starts with the first character of the prefix.\n\n   The last character of s is the suffix of l=1.\n\n   For l=2:\n\n      The prefix must be a string of length 2, which is formed by adding a character to the prefix of l=1.\n\n      The suffix must be a string of length 2, which is formed by adding a character to the suffix of l=1.\n\n      Also, for l=2, if 2 > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-2) characters of the prefix.\n\n      So, we can check whether the suffix starts with the first (n-2) characters of the prefix.\n\n      If yes, proceed.\n\n   Continue this for each l up to n-1.\n\n   If all constraints are satisfied, then this assignment is valid.\n\nOnce a valid assignment is found, the s can be built, and the P/S can be assigned.\n\nBut wait, the assignment of P/S for each l is part of the problem. So perhaps the initial assignment is to find for each l which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nWait, but perhaps the process can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each possible assignment of the first l=1 (two possibilities):\n\n   For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n      For the current l, assign one of the two strings as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n      Check whether for this assignment, the suffix starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix, if l > n/2.\n\n      Also, ensure that the prefix is a proper extension of the previous prefix.\n\n      If all conditions are satisfied, proceed.\n\nOnce all l are processed, the assignment is valid.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, but for n=100, it's manageable.\n\nBut how to represent this.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to construct s incrementally.\n\nAssume that for l=1, the prefix is P1 and suffix is S1.\n\ns starts with P1[0], ends with S1.\n\nFor l=2:\n\n   The prefix must be P2, which is P1[0] + c, where c is some character.\n\n   The suffix must be S2, which is S1[1] + d, where d is some character.\n\n   Also, if 2 > n/2 (i.e., n <4), then S2 must start with P2[0.. (n-2)].\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the correct s can be determined by the fact that the suffix of l=1 is the last character of s, and the prefix of l=1 is the first character.\n\nFor l=2, the suffix must be the last two characters of s. The prefix must be the first two.\n\nThus, the suffix of l=2 is s[n-2 ... n-1], and the prefix is s[0 ... 1].\n\nSo, for l=2, if 2 > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-2) characters of the prefix.\n\nWhich for n=5, l=3: the suffix must start with the first 1 character of the prefix.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, for each l > n/2, the suffix of l must be the prefix of (n-l) followed by some suffix.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each l from n/2 +1 to n-1:\n\n   Take the two strings of length l.\n\n   Check for each possible assignment (A is prefix, B is suffix) and (B is prefix, A is suffix):\n\n      Does the suffix start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix?\n\n   If for any assignment, this is true, then that assignment is a candidate.\n\n   Record the possible pairs for each l.\n\nBut this is still a bit unclear.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince for each l > n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix, perhaps the correct assignment is the one where for each l >n/2, the suffix is the same as the prefix of (n-l) plus some other string.\n\nThus, for each l >n/2, the suffix must be a string that begins with the prefix of (n-l).\n\nThus, for each l >n/2, among the two strings, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. The suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nSo, for each l >n/2, the two possible strings can be checked in both possible orders.\n\nFor example, for l=3 and n=5, n-l=2.\n\nSo, the suffix must start with the first 2 characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, if the prefix is 'aba', the suffix must start with 'ab'.\n\nSo, the suffix can be 'aba' (same as prefix), but wait, no: the suffix is of length l=3, and the prefix is of length l=3.\n\nWait, for l=3, n=5, n-l=2. So the suffix must start with the first 2 characters of the prefix.\n\nSo, if the prefix is 'abc', the suffix must start with 'ab', meaning the suffix can be 'abcd' but wait, l=3, so the suffix is of length 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find, for each l >n/2, the two possible strings, and check if one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, and the suffix starts with the prefix of (n-l).\n\nOnce this is done for all l>n/2, the assignment is correct.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet's consider that the correct s can be built by merging the prefix and suffix chains.\n\nThe prefix chain is a sequence where each prefix is formed by adding a character to the previous prefix.\n\nThe suffix chain is a sequence where each suffix is formed by adding a character to the previous suffix.\n\nMoreover, for l >n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nThus, the suffix chain is determined by the prefix chain.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For l=1, assign one string as prefix (P1) and the other as suffix (S1).\n\n2. s starts with P1[0], ends with S1.\n\n3. For l=2:\n\n   P2 must be P1 + c, where c is a new character.\n\n   S2 must be S1 + d, where d is a new character.\n\n   Also, if 2 >n/2, then S2 must start with the first (n-2) characters of P2.\n\n4. For each subsequent l, the prefix is built by adding a character to the previous prefix, and the suffix is built by adding a character to the previous suffix.\n\n   Also, for l >n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\nOnce all l are processed, the assignment is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that for each l, we have to choose which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut perhaps the correct assignment can be found by considering that the suffix chain must be compatible with the prefix chain.\n\nThus, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nLoop over all possible assignments of the first l=1.\n\nFor each assignment:\n\n   Build the prefix chain and suffix chain.\n\n   Check for each l >n/2 whether the suffix starts with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\n   If all l >n/2 are satisfied, then this assignment is correct.\n\nOnce found, output the P/S assignment.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nFirst, read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\nThen, for each possible assignment of the first l=1:\n\n   Assign P1 and S1 (the two strings of length 1).\n\n   Then, build the prefix chain and suffix chain.\n\n   For l from 2 to n-1:\n\n      The two strings of length l are candidates.\n\n      We need to assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n      For each possible assignment (current_p, current_s):\n\n         Check if current_p starts with the first (n-l) characters of the previous prefix.\n\n         Wait, no: for l >n/2, the suffix must start with the first (n-l) characters of the prefix.\n\n         So, for l=2 and n=5, n-l=3. So, the suffix must start with the first 3 characters of the prefix.\n\n         So, in this case, the suffix must be equal to the first 3 characters of the prefix, plus some new characters.\n\n         But for l=2, the suffix is of length 2, which is less than n-l=3. So this can't happen.\n\n         Wait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of building s.\n\nOnce the assignment is correct, s can be built by:\n\ns = prefix_1[0] + prefix_2[0:1] + ... + prefix_{n-1}[0:n-2]\n\nAnd the suffixes are built by:\n\nsuffix_1 = s[-1]\nsuffix_2 = s[-2:] \nand so on.\n\nBut again, without knowing the assignment, it's difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe correct s can be uniquely determined by the constraints of the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nOnce s is determined, the assignment of P and S is straightforward.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding s, given the constraints.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind s such that for each l, the prefix and suffix strings are present in the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that s must be such that for each l, the prefix of l is a prefix of s, and the suffix of l is a suffix of s.\n\nThus, s must be a superstring that contains all the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how to find such s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by taking the minimal possible extensions.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe correct s can be built by starting with the common prefix of all possible l=1, l=2, etc.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet's consider that for l=1, the prefix is P1 and suffix is S1.\n\ns starts with P1[0], ends with S1.\n\nFor l=2, the prefix is P2, which is P1 followed by some character.\n\nThe suffix is S2, which is S1 followed by some character.\n\nAdditionally, for l=2",
