He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, which must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. The count can be equal to both, but that's also allowed.\n\nThe string I'm given must satisfy these conditions. So, I need to verify:\n\n1. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order is strictly a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\n2. The counts of each character after their respective steps must satisfy the condition for C's addition.\n\nLet me break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, I'll need to check the structure of the string. It should have all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. So any 'a' after a 'b' would make it invalid. Similarly, a 'b' after a 'c' is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, I need to compute the counts.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nThese counts should satisfy the following:\n\nAfter B appends, the string has count_a a's and count_b b's. Then C appends count_c c's, which must equal either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nBut wait, what about the initial steps? Because before B appends, only 'a's exist. So when B appends, he adds some 'b's, ensuring that count_b is at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, before C appends, the string has count_a a's and count_b b's. So when C appends, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n- The string is in the form a+ b+ c+ (no other characters in between).\n- count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n- Also, since after B's step, the string has at least one a and one b, we must have count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So in the final string, count_a and count_b are each at least 1.\n\nSo, to restate the conditions:\n\n1. The string starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, followed by one or more 'c's. So the order is strict.\n\n2. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\n3. count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nBecause each step appends at least one character.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the initial string from A has some 'a's (could be 1 or more), B appends some 'b's (could be 1 or more). So in the string after B's step, count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nThen, C appends some 'c's, which could be any number as long as it equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check that the string is in the form a+b+c+, i.e., no mixing of letters.\n\n- Compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n- Ensure that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\n- Also, count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES; else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where C appends zero 'c's? No, because the problem states that C appends \"some number\" of 'c's. So count_c must be at least 1.\n\nSo, let me think about the steps for the code.\n\nFirst, parse the string S.\n\nCheck that the string is structured correctly: all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nHow to do this?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and see if the pattern is a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn the string 'aaabccc', the a's are first, then b's, then c's.\n\nIn 'bbacc', the first character is 'b', so the a's part is empty. So that's invalid.\n\nIn 'aabc', the a's are okay, then 'a' comes again, which is not allowed because it's after a 'b'? Wait, no, in 'aabc' the second character is 'a' again. So the string has 'a's, then 'a's again, which is not allowed. So it's invalid.\n\nWait, no, the string 'aabc' would be structured as 'aa' followed by 'bc', which is invalid because 'b' comes before 'c' but after 'a's. So the order is a's, then b's, then c's. Any other arrangement is invalid.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, once a 'b' appears, all subsequent characters must be 'b's until 'c's start. Similarly, once a 'c' appears, all remaining must be 'c's.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can loop through each character and track the current allowed characters.\n\nInitialize state as 'a'.\n\nOnce a 'b' is encountered, state changes to 'b'.\n\nOnce a 'c' is encountered, state changes to 'c'.\n\nAt any point, if a character is not allowed in the current state, the string is invalid.\n\nAdditionally, the state must go from 'a' to 'b' to 'c' in order, and cannot go back.\n\nFor example:\n\nState transitions:\n\nstart -> 'a'\n\nif 'b' is found, transition to 'b'\n\nif 'c' is found in 'a' state, invalid.\n\nif 'a' is found after 'b', invalid.\n\nSimilarly, in 'b' state, only 'b's and 'c's allowed.\n\nIn 'c' state, only 'c's allowed.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Initialize current_state as 'a'.\n\n- For each character in S:\n\n   - if current_state is 'a':\n\n      - if char is 'a': continue.\n\n      - elif char is 'b': current_state becomes 'b'.\n\n      - elif char is 'c': invalid, return False.\n\n   - elif current_state is 'b':\n\n      - if char is 'b': continue.\n\n      - elif char is 'c': current_state becomes 'c'.\n\n      - elif char is 'a': invalid, return False.\n\n   - elif current_state is 'c':\n\n      - if char is not 'c': invalid.\n\nSo, if any of the checks fail, the string is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, we can proceed to count the a's, b's, c's.\n\nCompute count_a = number of 'a's before first 'b'.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's between first 'b' and first 'c'.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's from first 'c' to end.\n\nThen, check:\n\ncount_c must equal count_a or count_b.\n\nAlso, count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about some test cases.\n\nExample 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nStructure: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c equals count_a (3=3), so valid.\n\nOutput: YES.\n\nExample 2: 'bbacc'\n\nStructure: first character is 'b', so state goes to 'b'.\n\nThen next is 'b' again, then 'a'—invalid because after 'b' state, 'a' is not allowed.\n\nSo, the string is invalid, output NO.\n\nExample 3: 'aabc'\n\nStructure: 'a', 'a'—then 'b' comes. So after 'a's, 'b's start. Then 'c' comes. So state changes to 'c'. But then another 'c' is fine. So structure is valid.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c equals count_b (1=1), so valid.\n\nOutput: YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba'—invalid because after 'b's, 'a' comes again.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc'—structure is correct.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c equals both, so YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc' → count_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1. Does count_c equal a or b? 1 != 2 and 1 !=3. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbcc' → count_c=2. If count_a is 2, count_b is 3, then 2 equals a's count. So YES.\n\nWhat about 'abcde'—but the problem says only a, b, c. So input is guaranteed to be only those.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check the structure.\n\n2. Count a, b, c.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to a or b.\n\n4. Also, a and b counts are >=1, c count >=1.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can read the string, then process each character.\n\nWe can track the state as follows.\n\nInitialize state to 'a'.\n\nThen, for each character:\n\n- if state is 'a':\n\n   if char is 'a': continue.\n\n   if char is 'b': state becomes 'b'.\n\n   if char is 'c': invalid.\n\n- elif state is 'b':\n\n   if char is 'b': continue.\n\n   if char is 'c': state becomes 'c'.\n\n   if char is 'a': invalid.\n\n- elif state is 'c':\n\n   if char != 'c': invalid.\n\nIf any invalid occurs, mark as invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is valid, compute counts.\n\ncount_a is the number of 'a's before the first 'b' (or entire string if no 'b's, but in that case, after B appends, string has at least one 'b', so if the string has no 'b's, it's invalid.)\n\nWait, no: the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'b'. So the string must have 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. So if the string has 'a's followed by 'c's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo during the structure check, after 'a's, if any 'c's come without 'b's, it's invalid.\n\nThus, in the code, if the state transitions from 'a' to 'c' without going through 'b', it's invalid.\n\nSo, during the structure check, the code will catch that.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, then the counts can be computed.\n\nHow to find the indices where 'b's start and 'c's start.\n\nAlternatively, split the string into segments.\n\nIn code:\n\nWe can find the index where 'b's start and where 'c's start.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the positions of the first 'b' and first 'c'.\n\nFor example:\n\ns = 'aaabccc'\n\nfirst_b = s.find('b') → 3.\n\nfirst_c = s.find('c') → 5.\n\nThen, count_a = first_b.\n\ncount_b = len(s) - first_b - (len(s) - first_c) ?\n\nWait, no. Between first_b and first_c, it's the 'b's.\n\nSo count_b = first_c - first_b.\n\ncount_c = len(s) - first_c.\n\nBut wait, the 'b's may not be contiguous. Like 'ababac'—but in the structure check, this is invalid because after 'a's, you can't have 'b's interleaved with 'a's. So the code structure check ensures that all 'b's are together, followed by 'c's.\n\nSo, for a valid string, the first_b is the index where the first 'b' occurs, and all 'b's are from first_b onwards until first_c.\n\nSo, count_a = first_b.\n\ncount_b = first_c - first_b.\n\ncount_c = len(s) - first_c.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that after first_b, all are 'b's until first_c.\n\nBut the structure check ensures that, so in code, once the structure is correct, the counts can be computed as such.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, the string 'aabbbbc' has first_b=2, first_c=5. So count_b is 5-2=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter the structure check passes, compute first_b and first_c.\n\nBut wait, what if the string has no 'b's? According to the problem statement, B appends some 'b's, so the string must have at least one 'b'. So in that case, the structure check will have failed because after 'a's, if there's a 'c' without 'b's, it's invalid.\n\nSo, in the code, after the structure check, we can safely assume that first_b is less than first_c, and both are present.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck the structure.\n\nThen, compute the counts.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nAlso, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, now, how to implement the structure check.\n\nImplementing the state machine.\n\nWe can have a variable called current_state, which can be 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n\nInitially, current_state = 'a'.\n\nThen, for each char in S:\n\n   if current_state == 'a':\n\n       if char == 'a': continue.\n\n       elif char == 'b': current_state = 'b'.\n\n       else: # char is 'c'\n\n           structure is invalid.\n\n   elif current_state == 'b':\n\n       if char == 'b': continue.\n\n       elif char == 'c': current_state = 'c'.\n\n       else: # 'a'\n\n           structure invalid.\n\n   elif current_state == 'c':\n\n       if char != 'c': invalid.\n\nIf any invalid, the whole thing is invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_valid_structure(s):\n\n    current_state = 'a'\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        if current_state == 'a':\n\n            if c == 'a':\n\n                continue\n\n            elif c == 'b':\n\n                current_state = 'b'\n\n            else:\n\n                return False\n\n        elif current_state == 'b':\n\n            if c == 'b':\n\n                continue\n\n            elif c == 'c':\n\n                current_state = 'c'\n\n            else:\n\n                return False\n\n        elif current_state == 'c':\n\n            if c != 'c':\n\n                return False\n\n    # After processing all characters, current_state must be 'c'\n\n    return current_state == 'c'\n\nWait, no. Because the string must have at least one 'c' since C appends some 'c's.\n\nSo, the function returns True only if the structure is correct, which includes having 'c's.\n\nSo, after processing, current_state must be 'c'.\n\nOtherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo, the function returns whether the structure is correct.\n\nOnce that's done, compute the counts.\n\nNow, handling the case where the structure is correct.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's said that the string may have 'a's, 'b's, 'c's in the correct order, but it's possible that there are zero 'a's or 'b's, but according to the problem statement, after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So, in the final string, count_a and count_b must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but the initial string is created by A appending some 'a's, then B appending some 'b's.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_a is the number of 'a's in A's string plus B's 'b's. Wait no: A creates a string of some 'a's, then B appends 'b's, so the 'a's are in the beginning.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_a is the same as the original A's string.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_a is the number of 'a's in the string, which is at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, count_b is the number of 'b's, which is at least 1.\n\ncount_c is the number of 'c's, which is at least 1.\n\nSo, during the structure check, we have already ensured that all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo, the counts:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's (from the start until first 'b')\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's (from first 'b' until first 'c')\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's (from first 'c' to end)\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check structure\n\ncurrent_state = 'a'\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    if current_state == 'a':\n\n        if c == 'a':\n\n            continue\n\n        elif c == 'b':\n\n            current_state = 'b'\n\n        else:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    elif current_state == 'b':\n\n        if c == 'b':\n\n            continue\n\n        elif c == 'c':\n\n            current_state = 'c'\n\n        else:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    elif current_state == 'c':\n\n        if c != 'c':\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\nif not valid or current_state != 'c':\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # Now compute counts\n\n    first_b = s.find('b')\n\n    first_c = s.find('c')\n\n    # count_a is the number of 'a's before first_b\n\n    count_a = first_b\n\n    # count_b is the number of 'b's between first_b and first_c\n\n    count_b = first_c - first_b\n\n    # count_c is the number of 'c's after first_c\n\n    count_c = len(s) - first_c\n\n    # Also, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1\n\n    if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the string has no 'b's? Like 'aaaaaccccc'.\n\nIn that case, during the structure check, after 'a's, 'c's come, so the code would have set current_state to 'c' and processed the 'c's. So the structure check returns True if the entire string is 'a's followed by 'c's.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, after B appends, the string must have at least one 'b' and 'a'. So the string after B's step is invalid if no 'b's.\n\nSo, in the code, the structure check would pass, but in the counts, count_b would be 0, which is invalid.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing counts, we have to check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nWait, in the code above, the counts are computed as:\n\ncount_a = first_b → which is the index of first 'b'.\n\nBut if there is no 'b's, first_b is -1, so count_a is -1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the code, during the structure check, if there are no 'b's, then after 'a's, the next character is 'c's. So the structure is 'a's followed by 'c's. So the structure check would have current_state 'a', then 'c' is encountered, which is invalid. So the structure check returns false.\n\nWait, let's see: for s = 'aaaaaccc'.\n\nProcessing the first 'a's: current_state is 'a'.\n\nWhen the 'c' is encountered, in 'a' state, 'c' is not allowed, so structure is invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly marks it as invalid.\n\nThus, in the code, the structure check ensures that there is at least one 'b' and 'c' in the correct order.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the string is 'abbbc'.\n\nStructure is correct.\n\ncount_a = 1, count_b = 3, count_c = 1.\n\nWhich is valid.\n\nBut if the string is 'abbbc' → yes.\n\nWhat about a string like 'abc' → valid.\n\nBut what about a string like 'abcb'? That's invalid because after 'c', 'b' appears.\n\nSo, the structure check catches that.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTesting another case: 'aabbbc'.\n\nStructure is valid.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is neither 2 nor 3. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc'.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c=3 equals both a and b. So output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → invalid because after 'bb', 'a' comes again. Structure check fails.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle that.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck the structure as per the above.\n\nIf structure is invalid, output NO.\n\nElse, compute counts.\n\nCheck if counts meet the criteria.\n\nIf yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must be structured such that it starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and ends with one or more 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Structure**: Ensure the string is structured correctly. This means it should start with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and end with 'c's without any interleaving or out-of-order characters.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's. Also, ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ncurrent_state = 'a'\nvalid = True\n\nfor c in s:\n    if current_state == 'a':\n        if c == 'a':\n            continue\n        elif c == 'b':\n            current_state = 'b'\n        else:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    elif current_state == 'b':\n        if c == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif c == 'c':\n            current_state = 'c'\n        else:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    elif current_state == 'c':\n        if c != 'c':\n            valid = False\n            break\n\nif not valid or current_state != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    first_b = s.find('b')\n    first_c = s.find('c')\n    \n    count_a = first_b\n    count_b = first_c - first_b\n    count_c = len(s) - first_c\n    \n    if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1 and count_c >= 1:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code iterates through each character of the string, checking if it follows the correct sequence of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. If any character appears out of order, the string is deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: After confirming the structure, the code counts the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's using their positions in the string.\n3. **Validation**: The counts are checked to ensure they meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, the number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's, and each character type must appear at least once.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity and the count conditions of the string, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
