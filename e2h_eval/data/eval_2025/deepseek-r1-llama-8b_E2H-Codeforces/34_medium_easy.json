And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Hmm.\n\nSo, the input consists of two integers n and k. Then a sequence of n integers representing the sleep times for each day. We need to find the average of the sums of each consecutive k-day window, right?\n\nWait, let me think. For example, if n=3 and k=2, then there are 2 windows: [a1,a2] and [a2,a3]. We sum each, get their total, and divide by the number of weeks, which is n-k+1. So the average is (a1+a2 + a2+a3) / 2 in that case.\n\nBut when n is large, like up to 2e5, we can't just compute each window naively because that would be O(n*k), which might be too slow. Oh right, but wait, what's the maximum n? It's 2e5. If k is 2e5 as well, then O(n*k) is 4e10 operations, which is way too much. That's definitely going to be a problem. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nHmm, so what's the efficient way to compute the sum of all sliding windows of size k?\n\nI remember there's a technique called prefix sums that can help with this. Let me think about how prefix sums can be used here.\n\nThe idea is to precompute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements. So for the array a, prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = a[0], prefix_sum[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Wait, or maybe I should define it as prefix_sum[i] being the sum of the first i elements, so a[0] is prefix_sum[1].\n\nThen, the sum of a window from index i to j (inclusive, where j = i+k-1) can be computed as prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i].\n\nBut in our case, the window starts at day 0 (if considering 0-based indexing) and spans k days. So for each window starting at index s, the sum is a[s] + a[s+1] + ... + a[s+k-1].\n\nSo using prefix sums, each window can be calculated in O(1) time, after building the prefix sum array.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n2. For each window (there are n - k + 1 windows), calculate the sum using the prefix sums.\n3. Sum all these window sums.\n4. Divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nThat makes sense. Now, how do I implement this efficiently?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n- Read the array a.\n- Compute the prefix sum array. Maybe a list where prefix_sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements. So prefix_sum[0] is 0, prefix_sum[1] is a[0], prefix_sum[2] is a[0]+a[1], etc. So the sum from s to s + k -1 is prefix_sum[s + k] - prefix_sum[s].\n- Iterate through each possible starting position s (from 0 to n - k). For each s, compute the sum as prefix_sum[s + k] - prefix_sum[s].\n- Keep a running total of all these sums.\n- After processing all windows, divide the total by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n- Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=k. So there's only one window, the sum is the entire array, average is that sum.\n\nCase 2: k=1. So each day is its own window. The average is the same as the average of the array, which can be computed directly as (sum(a))/(n).\n\nBut since the method works for any k, including 1, it's okay.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the data types. Since n can be up to 2e5, and each a_i up to 1e5, the sum can be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, multiplied by 2e5 windows, leading to 4e15, which fits in a 64-bit integer. So using Python's integers shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut when calculating the average, we'll have to handle floating points. So perhaps we should use floating point variables for the sum.\n\nWait, but in Python, even if you sum everything as integers, dividing by a number will automatically convert to float.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the array a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the sum of all windows by iterating s from 0 to n -k:\n\nsum_total += (prefix_sum[s + k] - prefix_sum[s])\n\nThen average = sum_total / (n - k +1)\n\nOutput this average with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, the output needs to be printed with at least 6 decimal digits, but more is allowed.\n\nIn Python, formatting can be done using something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average), which gives 10 decimal places. But the problem allows any error within 1e-6, so as long as the output has enough precision, it's fine.\n\nWait, but sometimes when the average is an integer, we need to print .0000000000, as in the first sample.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nsum_total = 0\n\nfor s in range(n - k +1):\n\n    sum_window = prefix[s +k] - prefix[s]\n\n    sum_total += sum_window\n\naverage = sum_total / (n -k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is exactly 7 weeks' sum divided by 7. So the code correctly calculates that.\n\nTesting on the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSum of windows:\n\n3+4=7, 4+7=11. Sum_total is 18. Average is 18/(3-2+1)=9.\n\nSample Output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nYes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOnly one window, sum is 10. Average is 10.\n\nSample Output is '10.0000000000'.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\nWait no, looking back, the third input line is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'\n\nWait, n=8, k=2. So number of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window is:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSumming all these:\n\n3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201,960, +790=202,750.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\nFirst window: 1+2=3\n\nSecond: 2+4=6 → total 9\n\nThird:4+100000=100004 → total 100013\n\nFourth:100000+123=100123 → total 200136\n\nFifth:123+456=579 → total 200715\n\nSixth:456+789=1245 → total 201,960\n\nSeventh:789+1=790 → total 202,750.\n\nSo sum_total is 202,750.\n\nAverage is 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 202750 ÷7:\n\n7*28964 = 202,748. So 202,750 is 202,748 +2, so 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nNow, what about the computational efficiency? For n=2e5, the code runs in O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large numbers, but Python handles big integers well.\n\n- Making sure that the prefix sum is correctly computed.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, the loop for s runs from 0 to (n-k), inclusive? Because range in Python is exclusive on the upper end. So if n-k+1 is the number of windows, then s can go from 0 to (n-k) inclusive.\n\nYes, because for s in range(n -k +1): 0,1,...,n-k.\n\nBecause for example, n=3, k=2: n-k+1=2, so s runs 0 and 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code looks correct.\n\nThus, the plan is solid. Now, write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the code, how is the second line read? Because the first line is n and k, and the second line is the a array.\n\nIn the input examples, the second line may have multiple spaces, but in code, using split() takes care of that.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead n, k from input line 1.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nCompute sum of all windows.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, now writing the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case is given as ['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...], but in reality, the actual input is read from standard input as two lines.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\ntotal = 0\nfor s in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += prefix[s + k] - prefix[s]\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample outputs, the third case is printed with 10 decimal digits but ends with 7. Like 28964.2857142857. So the code should format to 10 decimal digits, regardless of trailing zeros.\n\nYes, the format string ensures that.\n\nTesting this code with the samples should give correct outputs.\n\nWhat about when n=1, k=1? It will compute sum as a[0], average is a[0], formatted correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, k=2. The average is a[0] + a[1], average is (a[0]+a[1])/(1). So correct.\n\nEdge case when k= n: sum is sum(a), average is sum(a)/1.\n\nI think the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of k days, and we need to find the average of these sums over all such windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Given a sequence of n days, each with a sleep duration, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day windows. The number of such windows is (n - k + 1).\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation Using Prefix Sums**: Instead of calculating each window sum individually (which would be inefficient for large n), we use prefix sums to compute each window sum in constant time. The prefix sum array helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Compute the prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the input array.\n   - For each possible starting position of a window, compute the sum using the prefix sums.\n   - Sum all these window sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The approach runs in O(n) time, which is efficient even for the upper constraint of n = 200,000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nfor s in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += prefix[s + k] - prefix[s]\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array is built such that `prefix[i]` holds the sum of the first i elements of the input array. This allows us to compute any subarray sum in constant time.\n3. **Window Sums**: For each starting index of a window, the sum is computed using the prefix sums. This avoids the need for nested loops and reduces the complexity.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then formatted to 10 decimal places for output.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures accurate results within the required precision.",
