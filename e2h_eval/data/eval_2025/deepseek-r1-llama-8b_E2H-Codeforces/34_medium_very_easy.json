And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm. So Polycarp has recorded his sleep times for n days, and we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks of k consecutive days. Oh right, because a week in Berland is k days long. So the number of weeks we'll consider is (n - k + 1), right?\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. Like when n=3, k=2, and the array is [3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. So their sums are 7 and 11, which averages to (7+11)/2 = 9. That's why the output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the approach here is to compute the sum of each consecutive k-day window and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5. Oh right, because n is up to 200,000, so any O(nk) solution would be too slow. We need an O(n) solution.\n\nWait, how can we compute the sum of each sliding window efficiently? Oh right, the sliding window technique with a prefix sum array.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements.\n2. For each window starting at position i (0-based), the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n3. Sum all these window sums and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nWait, but wait. How do we handle the indices correctly? Because the array is 0-based or 1-based? Well, in code, arrays are 0-based, but let's think about how to structure it.\n\nLet me think: for an array a[0..n-1], the first window is a[0..k-1], the next is a[1..k], etc., until a[n-k..n-1].\n\nSo the sum for the j-th window (starting at index j) is sum from j to j+k-1. Using the prefix sum array, where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc., the sum would be prefix[j + k] - prefix[j].\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array.\n- Iterate j from 0 to (n-k) inclusive.\n- For each j, add (prefix[j + k] - prefix[j]) to the total sum.\n- Then, the average is total_sum / (n - k + 1).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input: n and k, then the list of a's.\n\nCompute the prefix sum. Let's make it 0-based, with prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each j in 0 to (n-k), compute the window sum as prefix[j + k] - prefix[j], and accumulate this into the total.\n\nOnce the total is computed, divide by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, the numbers could be very large. But since we're dealing with floating points, we need to handle them properly.\n\nIn Python, we can use floating point division. However, for precise calculations, maybe using integers and then dividing at the end is better, but since we have to output with high precision, perhaps it's better to compute everything as floats.\n\nWait, no, because all a_i are integers. So the sum of each window is an integer, and the average is a rational number. So we can compute the total sum as an integer, then perform exact division, but in Python, using floating point division should be sufficient.\n\nBut wait, when n is up to 2e5 and k up to 2e5, the number of windows is up to 2e5 as well. So in the worst case, n=2e5, k=1: each window is a single element, and there are 2e5 windows. So we have to process each of them quickly.\n\nSo the approach with prefix sum and O(n) processing is acceptable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nInitialize prefix as a list where prefix[0] = 0, and for i >=1, prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1].\n\nThen, for j in range(0, n - k +1):\n\nsum += prefix[j +k] - prefix[j]\n\nThen, average = sum / (n -k +1)\n\nPrint this average with at least 6 decimal places.\n\nWait, but in Python, the way to print with exactly 10 decimal digits is to format it as %.10f, but sometimes it may show trailing zeros. But the problem allows for any format as long as the error is within 1e-6 relative or absolute.\n\nWait, the output says to print with at least 6 digits after the decimal point. So we can print with, say, 10 digits, which is more than enough.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nfor j in range(n -k +1):\n    total += prefix[j +k] - prefix[j]\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but what about cases where the division is not exact? Like in the example where the third test case has a sum of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo, using floating point division in Python will give us the correct value.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nprefix = [0,3,7,14]\n\nj can be 0 and 1.\n\nj=0: sum is 3+4=7. j+k=2. prefix[2]-prefix[0]=7-0=7.\n\nj=1: sum is 4+7=11. prefix[3]-prefix[1]=14-3=11.\n\nTotal is 18. Divided by 2 gives 9.\n\nSample Output is 9.0000000000.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n10\n\nOnly one window, sum is 10. Average is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample:\n\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\nNumber of windows is 7.\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1]=1\n\nprefix[2] =3\n\nprefix[3]=7\n\nprefix[4]=100007\n\nprefix[5]=10007+123=101130?\n\nWait, no, wait a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nSo:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =1\n\nprefix[2] =1+2=3\n\nprefix[3] =3+4=7\n\nprefix[4] =7 +100000=100007\n\nprefix[5] =100007 +123=101130\n\nprefix[6] =101130 +456=105586\n\nprefix[7] =105586 +789=106375\n\nprefix[8] =106375 +1=106376\n\nSo for each window:\n\nj ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nFor j=0: sum is prefix[2]-prefix[0]=3-0=3.\n\nj=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=7-1=6.\n\nj=2: prefix[4]-prefix[2]=100007-3=99904.\n\nj=3: prefix[5]-prefix[3]=101130-7=101123.\n\nj=4: prefix[6]-prefix[4]=105586 -100007=55879.\n\nj=5: prefix[7]-prefix[5]=106375 -101130=5245.\n\nj=6: prefix[8]-prefix[6]=106376 -105586=790.\n\nAdding all these:\n\n3 +6=9; +99904=99913; +101123=201136; +55879=257015; +5245=262260; +790=263050.\n\nTotal is 263050.\n\nNumber of windows is 7, so average is 263050 /7 = 37764.2857142857 approximately.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 28964.2857142857. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, did I make a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input is 8 2, and the a array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So n=8, k=2, so 7 windows.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the window sums.\n\nWait, the windows are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3.\n\n[2,4] sum 6.\n\n[4,100000] sum 100004.\n\n[100000,123] sum 100123.\n\n[123,456] sum 579.\n\n[456,789] sum 1245.\n\n[789,1] sum 790.\n\nWait, adding all these:\n\n3 +6=9.\n\n+100004=100013.\n\n+100123=200136.\n\n+579=200715.\n\n+1245=201960.\n\n+790=202750.\n\nHmm, but according to this, total is 202750. So 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857.\n\nAh, so I must have made a mistake in the prefix sum approach earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the prefix sum computation.\n\nLet me recompute the prefix sum.\n\na is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1].\n\nSo:\n\nprefix[0] =0.\n\nprefix[1] =1.\n\nprefix[2] =1+2=3.\n\nprefix[3] =3+4=7.\n\nprefix[4] =7 +100000=100007.\n\nprefix[5] =100007 +123=101130.\n\nprefix[6] =101130 +456=105586.\n\nprefix[7] =105586 +789=106375.\n\nprefix[8] =106375 +1=106376.\n\nSo, for j=0: sum is prefix[2] - prefix[0] =3-0=3.\n\nj=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=7-1=6.\n\nj=2: prefix[4]-prefix[2] =100007-3=100004.\n\nj=3: prefix[5] - prefix[3] =101130-7=101123.\n\nj=4: prefix[6]-prefix[4] =105586-100007=5589.\n\nj=5: prefix[7]-prefix[5] =106375-101130=5245.\n\nj=6: prefix[8]-prefix[6] =106376-105586=790.\n\nAdding all these:\n\n3 +6=9.\n\n+100004=100013.\n\n+101123=201136.\n\n+5589=206725.\n\n+5245=212970.\n\n+790=213760.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So 3+6=9, plus 100004 is 100013, plus 101123 is 201136, plus 5589 is 206725, plus 5245 is 212970, plus 790 is 213760.\n\nSo total is 213760. Number of windows is 7, so 213760 /7 = 30560. 213760 divided by 7: 7 * 30560 = 213920, which is larger than 213760. Hmm, wait 30560 *7 is 213,920. So 213760 is less than that. So 30560 minus (160/7). So 213760 /7 is 30559.71428571428... approximately.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 28964.2857142857. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the windows.\n\nWait, n=8, k=2. So the number of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window is two consecutive elements.\n\nLet me list all the windows and their sums:\n\nWindow 1: [1,2] → 3.\n\nWindow 2: [2,4] →6.\n\nWindow3: [4,100000] →100004.\n\nWindow4: [100000,123] →100123.\n\nWindow5: [123,456] →579.\n\nWindow6: [456,789] →1245.\n\nWindow7: [789,1] →790.\n\nSumming them:\n\n3+6=9.\n\n+100004=100013.\n\n+100123=200136.\n\n+579=200715.\n\n+1245=201960.\n\n+790=202750.\n\nWait, that's 202750.\n\nSo 202750 /7 is 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo why did my prefix sum method give 213760? Because I must have miscalculated the prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the prefix sum.\n\nLet me recalculate the prefix sum.\n\nprefix[0] =0.\n\nprefix[1] = a[0] =1.\n\nprefix[2] =a[0] + a[1] =1+2=3.\n\nprefix[3] =3 +4=7.\n\nprefix[4] =7 +100000=100007.\n\nprefix[5] =100007 +123=101130.\n\nprefix[6] =101130 +456=105586.\n\nprefix[7] =105586 +789=106375.\n\nprefix[8] =106375 +1=106376.\n\nSo for j=0: sum is prefix[2] - prefix[0] →3.\n\nj=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1] →7-1=6.\n\nj=2: prefix[4] - prefix[2] →100007-3=100004.\n\nj=3: prefix[5]-prefix[3] →101130-7=101123.\n\nj=4: prefix[6] - prefix[4] →105586 -100007=5589.\n\nj=5: prefix[7] - prefix[5] →106375 -101130=5245.\n\nj=6: prefix[8] - prefix[6] →106376 -105586=790.\n\nAdding all these:\n\n3 +6 =9.\n\n+100004 =100013.\n\n+101123 =201136.\n\n+5589 =206725.\n\n+5245 =212970.\n\n+790 =213760.\n\nWait, that's 213760, but that's conflicting with the manual sum of 202750.\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the prefix sum approach isn't capturing the correct window. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how the sliding window works.\n\nWait, in the sliding window, for j=4, the window is a[4] and a[5], right? Because j starts at 0, and each window is of size k=2.\n\nSo, j=0: 0 and 1.\n\nj=1:1 and 2.\n\nj=2:2 and3.\n\nj=3:3 and4.\n\nj=4:4 and5.\n\nj=5:5 and6.\n\nj=6:6 and7.\n\nWait, but the array is 0-based, so a[4] is the fifth element.\n\nWait, in the a array given, the fifth element is 123.\n\nSo for j=4, the window is a[4] and a[5], which are 123 and 456. Their sum is 579.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, j=5 is a[5] and a[6], 456 and 789: sum 1245.\n\nj=6 is a[6] and a[7], 789 and 1: sum 790.\n\nSo when we compute prefix[j +k] - prefix[j], for j=4, j+2=6, prefix[6] - prefix[4] is 105586 -100007=5589. But 5589 is not equal to 579.\n\nWait, that's the mistake! Because 5589 is way bigger than 579.\n\nSo that indicates that the prefix sum approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, the prefix sum is built as prefix[0] =0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So for j=4, prefix[j] is prefix[4] =100007, and prefix[j +k] is prefix[6] =105586. So 105586-100007=5589.\n\nBut in reality, the sum is a[4] +a[5] =123 +456=579. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nBecause the prefix sum is a cumulative sum, but when you compute prefix[j +k] - prefix[j], it's the sum from a[0] to a[j +k-1], minus sum from a[0] to a[j-1], which is the same as sum from a[j] to a[j +k-1]. So for j=4, j +k =6, the sum is a[4] + a[5], which is 123 +456=579.\n\nBut according to the prefix sum, prefix[6] - prefix[4] is 105586 -100007=5589.\n\nWait, that's way off. So that means I made a mistake in the way I built the prefix sum.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the prefix sum is being built incorrectly.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the prefix sum step by step.\n\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix[0] =0.\n\nprefix[1] = a[0] =1.\n\nprefix[2] =a[0] +a[1] =3.\n\nprefix[3] =3 +a[2]=3+4=7.\n\nprefix[4] =7 +a[3]=7 +100000=100007.\n\nprefix[5] =100007 +a[4]=100007 +123=101130.\n\nprefix[6] =101130 +a[5]=101130 +456=105586.\n\nprefix[7] =105586 +a[6]=105586 +789=106375.\n\nprefix[8] =106375 +a[7]=106375 +1=106376.\n\nSo for j=4, j +k =6. So prefix[6] - prefix[4] is 105586-100007=5589. But the actual sum for the window starting at j=4 is a[4] +a[5]=123+456=579.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh, I see now. Because in the way j is defined. Wait, j is the starting index of the window in the original array. So for j=4, the window is a[4] and a[5], but according to the prefix sum, prefix[j +k] - prefix[j] is a[0] to a[j +k -1], minus a[0] to a[j-1]. So for j=4, it's a[0] to a[5] (since j +k =6) minus a[0] to a[3], which is a[4] +a[5] =123+456=579. So why is the prefix sum giving 5589?\n\nWait, no. Because for j=4, j +k is 6, so prefix[6] is sum up to a[5], and prefix[4] is sum up to a[3]. So prefix[6] - prefix[4] is a[4] + a[5] + ... +a[5]? No, no: a[4] +a[5] is just two elements, but the difference is sum from a[4] to a[5], which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the indexes. Because in the code, for each j, the window is j to j +k -1.\n\nSo for j=4, the window is a[4], a[5], and j +k =6, so the sum is prefix[6] - prefix[4], which is sum(a[0..5]) - sum(a[0..3]) = sum(a[4..5]) =579.\n\nBut according to the prefix sum, it's 105586 -100007=5589.\n\nWait, that's not correct. So why?\n\nBecause 105586 is the sum up to a[5], and 100007 is the sum up to a[3]. So subtracting gives a[4] +a[5] =123+456=579. But 105586-100007 is 5589. So that's impossible unless I made a mistake in the prefix sum.\n\nWait, 100007 is the sum up to a[3], which is 1+2+4+100000=100007.\n\nThen a[4] is 123, a[5] is 456. So sum up to a[5] is 100007 +123 +456=101586.\n\nWait, but according to the prefix sum, prefix[6] is 105586. That's way higher.\n\nWait, this suggests that I have a bug in how I built the prefix sum.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the prefix sum step by step:\n\nStarting with prefix[0] =0.\n\nprefix[1] = a[0] =1.\n\nprefix[2] = prefix[1] +a[1] =1+2=3.\n\nprefix[3] =3 +a[2]=3+4=7.\n\nprefix[4] =7 +a[3]=7 +100000=100007.\n\nprefix[5] =100007 +a[4]=100007 +123=101130.\n\nprefix[6] =101130 +a[5]=101130 +456=105586.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo 105586 -100007=5589.\n\nBut the actual sum is 123+456=579.\n\nSo this indicates that the prefix sum is incorrect. But wait, why?\n\nBecause 100007 is the sum up to a[3], which is 1+2+4+100000=100007.\n\nAdding a[4]=123: sum becomes 100007+123=101130.\n\nAdding a[5]=456: sum is 101130+456=105586.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 105586 -100007 is indeed 5589, but the actual sum is 579. This is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the window indices.\n\nWait, j=4: the window is a[4] and a[5], so sum is a[4] +a[5] =123+456=579.\n\nBut according to the prefix sum, prefix[j +k] - prefix[j] is prefix[6] - prefix[4] =105586-100007=5589.\n\nWhich is 5589, not 579.\n\nSo clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, but j +k is 4+2=6. So prefix[6] is sum of a[0] to a[5], which is 1+2+4+100000+123+456=105586.\n\nprefix[4] is sum up to a[3], which is 100007.\n\nSo 105586-100007=5589, which is the sum of a[4]+a[5] + ... +a[5]? That can't be. Because a[4] and a[5] sum to 579.\n\nWait, this suggests that the way I'm computing the prefix sum is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a confusion between 0-based and 1-based indices.\n\nAh, perhaps I'm using 0-based for the a array, but the prefix sum is 1-based.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn code, the a array is 0-based. The prefix sum is 0-based, where prefix[0] =0, prefix[1] =a[0], prefix[2] =a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nSo for j=4, the window is a[4] and a[5], which are the fifth and sixth elements.\n\nThe sum is a[4] + a[5] =123 +456=579.\n\nAccording to the prefix sum, prefix[j +k] - prefix[j] is prefix[6] - prefix[4] =105586 -100007=5589.\n\nBut 105586 is a[0]+a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+a[5] =1+2+4+100000+123+456=105586.\n\n100007 is a[0]+a[1]+a[2]+a[3] =100007.\n\nSo 105586 -100007 is a[4] +a[5] =123+456=579.\n\nWait, 123+456 is 579, but 105586-100007 is 5589.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nWait, 123+456 is 579. 5589 is 9 times larger. So perhaps I'm adding a zero somewhere.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the prefix sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a typo in the code. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the code, for i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nSo for i=0, prefix[1] =0 +a[0]=1.\n\ni=1: prefix[2]=1 +a[1]=3.\n\ni=2: prefix[3]=3 +a[2]=7.\n\ni=3: prefix[4]=7 +a[3]=100007.\n\ni=4: prefix[5]=100007 +a[4]=101130.\n\ni=5: prefix[6]=101130 +a[5]=105586.\n\ni=6: prefix[7]=105586 +a[6]=106375.\n\ni=7: prefix[8]=106375 +a[7]=106376.\n\nSo for j=4, prefix[j +k] is prefix[6], which is 105586.\n\nprefix[j] is prefix[4], which is 100007.\n\n105586 -100007 =5589.\n\nBut 5589 is much larger than 579.\n\nSo this indicates that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut why? Because 5589 is the sum of a[4] +a[5] + ... +a[5]? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the window is not j to j +k -1, but j to j +k.\n\nNo, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is adding a[k] instead of a[k-1].\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using j as the starting index, but the window is j to j +k, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be using j +k -1 as the end.\n\nWait, no, because j is the starting index in the array, and the window is j, j+1, ..., j +k -1.\n\nSo for j=4, the window is a[4], a[5], which is correct.\n\nSo the sum should be 579.\n\nBut according to the prefix sum, it's 5589.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy?\n\nBecause the prefix sum is including a[6] in some way.\n\nWait, no, prefix[6] is the sum of a[0] to a[5], which is correct.\n\nSo 105586 -100007 is a[4] +a[5] = 123+456=579. So 105586-100007=579.\n\nWait, but 105586-100007 is 5589.\n\nSo that's a problem. It suggests that the prefix sum is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the prefix sum.\n\nWait, 100007 +123 is 101130. 101130 +456=105586. That's correct.\n\nSo 105586-100007=579.\n\nBut in the code, the difference is 5589.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, the a array is being treated as 1-based, but the indices are 0-based.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using 1-based indices for a, but the prefix sum is 0-based.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up 0-based and 1-based in the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is building the prefix sum correctly, but the way j is being used is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering j as the starting index in 1-based terms, but the a array is 0-based.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nSuppose the a array is 0-based.\n\nThe window for j=4 (0-based) is a[4] and a[5].\n\nThe sum is a[4] +a[5] =579.\n\nBut according to the prefix sum, prefix[6] - prefix[4] =579.\n\nWait, but in the code, prefix[6] is 105586, prefix[4] is 100007.\n\n105586 -100007 = 579.\n\nBut wait, 105586 is the sum of a[0] to a[5], which is 1+2+4+100000+123+456=105586.\n\n100007 is the sum up to a[3], which is 1+2+4+100000=100007.\n\nSo 105586 -100007=579.\n\nSo why in the code is the difference 5589?\n\nBecause 105586 -100007 is 579, not 5589.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, 105586 minus 100007 is 579.\n\nSo why in the code it was giving 5589?\n\nWait, perhaps I had a typo in the code. Like, perhaps I added a[6] instead of a[5].\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, during the loop, a[i] is being taken as a[i+1].\n\nNo, the code is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nSo for i=5, prefix[6] = prefix[5] +a[5] =101130 +456=105586.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo why is the difference between prefix[6] and prefix[4] 5589?\n\nBecause 105586-100007=579.\n\nSo 579 is the correct sum.\n\nSo in the code, when j=4, the sum is 579.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the code's result, I thought it was 5589. That was a mistake.\n\nSo in reality, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code for the third sample should produce 202750, which when divided by 7 is 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all the cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the a array.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum of all window sums.\n\nDivide by the number of windows.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nCase where k=n: only one window, sum is sum(a), average is sum(a)/1.\n\nCase where k=1: sum is sum of all a, average is sum(a)/(n).\n\nCase where k=0: but k>=1 per the constraints.\n\nWhat about when n=2e5? The code needs to process 2e5 elements efficiently.\n\nIn Python, even for 2e5, the code is O(n) and should run quickly.\n\nNow, handling the output: the average must be printed with at least 6 decimal digits. So formatting to 10 decimal digits should suffice.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nnum_windows = n - k + 1\nfor j in range(num_windows):\n    total += prefix[j + k] - prefix[j]\n\naverage = total / num_windows\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks of k consecutive days. The goal is to efficiently compute this average using a sliding window technique to handle large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Given `n` days and `k` days per week, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible windows of `k` consecutive days. The number of such windows is `n - k + 1`.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using a prefix sum array allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each window in constant time after an initial O(n) preprocessing step.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times array. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n4. **Sum Calculation**: For each window starting at index `j`, the sum is computed as `prefix[j + k] - prefix[j]`. Accumulate these sums to get the total sum of all windows.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nnum_windows = n - k + 1\nfor j in range(num_windows):\n    total += prefix[j + k] - prefix[j]\n\naverage = total / num_windows\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for `n` (number of days), `k` (days per week), and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is constructed to allow efficient range sum queries.\n3. **Window Sums Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, each window's sum is computed in constant time and accumulated into the total sum.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with high precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively, providing the correct result within the required precision.",
