After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that particular subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, the input is n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters. For each subject, we need to find which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each subject across all students. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, determine if in any subject j, their mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read the input: n and m, followed by n strings each of length m.\n2. For each subject j:\n   a. Collect all the marks from each student in that subject.\n   b. Find the maximum mark among them.\n3. For each student, check if in any subject j, their mark is equal to the max for j.\n4. Count how many students satisfy this condition.\n\nWait, but for each subject, we can record the maximum value. Then, for each student, we just compare each of their marks against the corresponding subject's max. If any of them matches, then the student is successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures. We can represent each subject's max as a list or array. So for m subjects, we have a list where each element is the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nOnce that's done, for each student's marks, we iterate through each subject and check if any of their marks equals the subject's max. If yes, count the student.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines into a list called students_marks.\n- For each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n   - Iterate over each student's j-th character, convert to integer.\n   - Find the maximum value among these.\n   - Store this max in a list subject_maxs[j].\n- Now, for each student in students_marks:\n   - For each j in 0..m-1:\n      - Get the j-th mark of the student.\n      - Compare with subject_maxs[j]. If equal, mark the student as successful and break.\n- Count the number of successful students.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nWhat if m is zero? But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, because constraints say 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. So no problem.\n\nWhat about when all students have the same mark in a subject? Then the max is that mark, and every student is the best in that subject. So any student will be counted as successful.\n\nFor example, if all students have '5' in subject 1, then every student is successful because they are the best in subject 1.\n\nAnother case: a student might not be the best in any subject, so they shouldn't be counted.\n\nAlso, the problem says that each student's marks are a string of m characters, each a digit from 1-9. So converting each character to an integer is straightforward.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\nRead n and m. Since the input is given as a single line, perhaps as a single string, but looking at the sample input, it's given as two lines. Wait, the sample input is:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWait, actually, maybe the input is provided as multiple lines. So the first line is n and m, then n lines follow.\n\nSo in code, I need to read n and m from the first line, then read the next n lines as the students' marks.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done using input(). So:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents_marks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    marks = input().strip()\n    students_marks.append(marks)\n\nThen, for each subject j, collect the max mark.\n\nsubject_maxs = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        char = students_marks[i][j]\n        num = int(char)\n        if num > current_max:\n            current_max = num\n    subject_maxs[j] = current_max\n\nWait, wait. For each subject j, loop through each student i, get the j-th character, convert to integer, and track the maximum.\n\nOnce subject_maxs is built, then for each student, check if any position j has their mark equal to subject_maxs[j].\n\nSo:\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    student_marks = students_marks[i]\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(student_marks[j]) == subject_maxs[j]:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        successful += 1\n\nThen, print(successful).\n\nYes, that should handle everything.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo students_marks are:\n\"223\"\n\"232\"\n\"112\"\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0: characters are '2','3','1' → max is 3\nSubject 1: '2','3','1' → max is 3\nSubject 2: '3','2','2' → max is 3\n\nSo subject_maxs = [3,3,3]\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: marks are '2','2','3'\nCheck each subject:\nsubject 0: 2 vs 3 → no\nsubject 1: 2 vs 3 → no\nsubject 2: 3 vs 3 → yes. So counts as successful.\n\nStudent 1: '2','3','2'\nsubject 0: 2 < 3 → no\nsubject 1: 3 ==3 → yes. So counts.\n\nStudent 2: '1','1','2'\nall are less than 3 → no. So not counted.\n\nThus, output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nWait, wait, the input is written as '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'?\n\nWait, no, the second part is another test case? Or perhaps the sample input is two test cases? Because the output is two numbers.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the first sample input is ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], and the output is ['2', '3'].\n\nSo the program needs to process two test cases? Or perhaps it's a misrepresentation, and the actual input is two separate cases, each on their own lines.\n\nWait, no. The input is one per line, so the first line is n and m. Then n lines follow, each being a student's marks. So in the sample, the first input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nWhich is one test case, and then another test case after. But that would complicate the code. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is a representation of multiple test cases, but in reality, the code must handle only one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is: the first line contains n and m. Next n lines describe the gradebook.\n\nSo the sample input is probably a representation of two separate test cases, but perhaps the user made a mistake.\n\nBut in the code, the program should process one test case.\n\nSo for the second sample, let's see:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\nStudents:\n\n91728 → '9','1','7','2','8'\n\n11828 → '1','1','8','2','8'\n\n11111 → '1','1','1','1','1'\n\nFor each subject j (0 to 4):\n\nj=0: 9, 1, 1 → max is 9.\n\nj=1: 1, 1, 1 → max is 1.\n\nj=2:7,8,1 → max is 8.\n\nj=3:2,2,1 → max is 2.\n\nj=4:8,8,1 → max is 8.\n\nSo subject_maxs = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: his marks are 9,1,7,2,8.\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 9 ==9 → yes. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 1: his marks are 1,1,8,2,8.\n\nCheck:\n\nsubject 0:1 <9 → no.\n\nsubject 1:1 ==1 → yes. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2: all marks are 1 except the last subject, which is 1. So for none of the subjects does he have the max.\n\nSo only two students are successful? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, student 1's marks are 1,1,8,2,8. Subject 2 is 8, which is the max. So he is successful because in subject 2 he is the best.\n\nWait, no, for subject 2, the max is 8, which is achieved by student 1 (his third subject mark is 8). So he is the best in subject 2.\n\nWait, wait, no:\n\nWait, in subject 2, the marks are 7,8,1. So the max is 8, which is student 1's mark.\n\nSo student 1 is the best in subject 2, so he is successful.\n\nWait, what about the third student, who has 1 in all except the last subject, which is 1 as well. So none of his marks reach the subject max. So he isn't counted.\n\nSo the total is 2 successful students.\n\nBut the sample output is 3. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the second test case. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's output is 3, meaning each student is successful. So why?\n\nLooking at the second test case:\n\nStudents:\n\nStudent 1: '9','1','7','2','8'\n\nStudent 2: '1','1','8','2','8'\n\nStudent 3: '1','1','1','1','1'\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nj=0: max is 9 (student 1)\n\nj=1: max is 1 (students 1,2,3)\n\nj=2: max is 8 (student 2)\n\nj=3: max is 2 (student 2)\n\nj=4: max is 8 (student 1 and 2)\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 1:\n\n- j=0: 9 ==9 → yes.\n\nSo he is successful.\n\nStudent 2:\n\n- j=1: 1 ==1 → yes.\n\nAlso, j=2:8 ==8 → yes.\n\nSo he is successful.\n\nStudent 3:\n\nHe has 1 in all subjects except j=4, which is 1 as well.\n\nBut for any j, is his mark equal to subject_maxs[j]?\n\nNo. Because subject_maxs for j=0 is 9, j=1 is 1 (so his 1 is equal), but wait, j=1 is 1, so yes, he is the best in subject 1.\n\nWait, wait: for subject j=1, the max is 1, which is achieved by all three students. So in that subject, all are tied for the best. So each student is considered the best in subject 1.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says: a student is the best at a subject if no student got a higher mark. So if multiple students have the same maximum mark, they are all considered the best in that subject.\n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo if a student has the maximum mark for a subject, regardless of others having the same, they are the best.\n\nWait, no, the wording is ambiguous. Let me read again.\n\n\"A student is the best at some subject if there exists a subject he is the best at.\"\n\nWait, the definition says: \"a student is the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nAh! So for a subject, if a student has the maximum mark, then they are the best in that subject.\n\nIf two students have the same maximum, then both are the best in that subject.\n\nWait, no. Because for a subject, the maximum is x. Any student who has x is the best, because there's no student with higher than x.\n\nSo for example, if two students have x in a subject, then both are the best in that subject.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, each student is considered the best if they are the sole highest. Or wait, no: the wording is that a student is the best in the subject if there is no student with a higher mark.\n\nSo if a student has a mark equal to the maximum, they are the best.\n\nSo for each subject, the best students are those who have the maximum mark.\n\nSo in the second test case:\n\nSubject 0: max is 9 (only student 1 has it). So only he is the best in subject 0.\n\nSubject 1: max is 1. All three students have 1, so all three are the best in subject 1.\n\nSubject 2: max is 8 (student 2 has it). Only he is the best.\n\nSubject 3: max is 2 (student 2 has it). So only he is the best.\n\nSubject 4: max is 8 (student 1 and 2 have it). So both are the best.\n\nSo now, each student is the best in at least one subject.\n\nStudent 1 is best in subject 0 and 4.\n\nStudent 2 is best in subject 1, 2, 3.\n\nStudent 3 is best in subject 1.\n\nSo all three are successful. Hence, the output is 3.\n\nSo in my previous analysis, I forgot that for subject 1, all three students are considered the best. So student 3 is the best in subject 1. Hence, he is successful.\n\nThat explains why the output is 3.\n\nSo the code I wrote correctly identifies whether a student is the best in any subject.\n\nBecause for each subject, the code records the maximum, and for each student, it checks if any of their marks equals that maximum. So for subject 1, since the maximum is 1, all students have 1, so all three will have 1 == subject_maxs[1], thus they are considered successful.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each as a string.\n\nThen for each j in 0 to m-1:\n\n   for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n       take students_marks[i][j], convert to int.\n\n   find the maximum of these, store in subject_maxs[j].\n\nThen, for each student i:\n\n   check if any j in 0..m-1: students_marks[i][j] == subject_maxs[j].\n\nIf yes, count as successful.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents_marks = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nsubject_maxs = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students_marks[i][j])\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n    subject_maxs[j] = max_mark\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    is_success = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(students_marks[i][j]) == subject_maxs[j]:\n            is_success = True\n            break\n    if is_success:\n        successful +=1\n\nprint(successful)\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTesting the second sample:\n\nAfter processing, each student is considered for each subject.\n\nStudent 3 (the third one) has in subject 1, a mark of 1, which is the max. So he is counted as successful.\n\nThus, the code returns 3.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues.\n\nWhat about when m is 1?\n\nFor example, n=2, m=1.\n\nStudent 1: '9'\n\nStudent 2: '8'\n\nSo subject_max is 9.\n\nStudent 1's mark is 9, which equals the max, so he's successful.\n\nStudent 2's mark is 8, which is less than 9, so not successful.\n\nThus, output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1.\n\nOnly one student, so he is the best in the only subject. Output is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: all students have the same marks for all subjects.\n\nE.g., n=3, m=2.\n\nAll students have '55'.\n\nSo for subject 0: max is 5. All students are best.\n\nSame for subject 1.\n\nSo each student is considered the best in both subjects. Thus, all 3 are successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent 1: '22'\n\nStudent 2: '12'\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (both have 2). So both are best.\n\nSubject 1: max is 2 (student 1 has 2, student 2 has 2).\n\nSo both students are best in both subjects. Thus, both are successful.\n\nSo the code correctly counts them.\n\nI think the code covers all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`, followed by the marks of each student.\n2. **Determine Subject Maxima:** For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject.

The subsequent `n` lines contain strings representing the marks of each student for each subject.\n2. **Finding Subject Maxima:** For each subject, iterate through all students' marks to find the maximum mark. Store these maxima in an array where each index corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Checking Success:** For each student, compare their marks against the maxima for each subject. If they match any subject's maximum, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Counting Successes:** Keep a count of how many students are successful and print this count at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input and checks each student against the subject maxima, ensuring we correctly identify all successful students.",
