For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. The input is three notes, and I need to check if they form a major or minor triad when arranged in the correct order. If they don't fit either, it's 'strange'. Also, the answer is unambiguous, so no cases where both major and minor apply.\n\nWhat defines a major triad? It's when the distances between consecutive notes are 4 and 3 semitones. So, in some permutation of the three notes, when sorted in a certain way, the first two have a 4-semitone distance, and the next pair has 3. Similarly, for a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones.\n\nWait, but how do the notes wrap around? Oh right, the scale is cyclic. So after H comes C again. So the distance calculation must consider that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible permutation of the three notes, arrange them in some order.\n2. For each such arrangement, calculate the distances between the first and second, and between the second and third.\n3. Check if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n4. If exactly one condition is met (major or minor), output accordingly. Otherwise, if none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, since the triad is an unordered set, I should consider all possible orderings. However, since there are only 3! =6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nBut calculating all 6 permutations might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the notes in a way that allows me to compute the distances efficiently.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the notes as positions on a circle. Each note has a numerical position: for example, C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11. Then, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Because the scale is cyclic, the distance is calculated by moving upwards from X to Y.\n\nSo for the three notes x, y, z, I can represent each as their numerical values.\n\nOnce I have the numerical representations, I can compute all possible orderings and check the required conditions.\n\nWait, but checking all 6 permutations is feasible. But perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe, instead of permuting, we can find all possible cyclic orders and see if any of them meet the criteria.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: For a set of three distinct notes, there are six possible orderings. For each ordering, compute the two intervals (distance between first and second, then second and third). Then, check if any of those intervals match the major or minor pattern.\n\nLet me outline the steps more concretely.\n\n1. Create a dictionary mapping each note name to its corresponding number. Like 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc., up to 'H' being 11.\n\n2. Read the three input notes, split them into a list, say notes = [note1, note2, note3].\n\n3. Convert each note into its numerical value using the dictionary. Let's call them n1, n2, n3.\n\n4. Generate all possible permutations of these three numbers. Since they are distinct, each permutation represents a different ordering.\n\nWait, but what if there are duplicate notes? Oh, the problem states it's a triad, which is exactly three notes, but doesn't specify if they are distinct. Wait, no, the problem says \"three notes\" but doesn't say they must be distinct. Hmm, but looking at the examples, like 'C E G' implies distinct. Oh, but the problem statement says \"unordered set of no less than three notes.\" Wait, the definition of a chord is an unordered set of at least three notes, but for triads, exactly three. So perhaps, the input will have three distinct notes. Or maybe not? Well, the problem says Vasya has to classify the given triad, which is three notes, but it's unclear if duplicates are allowed.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" Looking back, in the sample input, all three notes are distinct. So perhaps, in the problem, the triad consists of three distinct notes.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly say so. Hmm. But for the sake of this solution, I'll assume that all three notes are distinct because otherwise, the distance between same notes would be zero, making it impossible to have the required 3 and 4 semitone steps. So perhaps, the input always consists of three",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into numerical values, generating all permutations of these values, and checking the distances between consecutive notes in each permutation to classify the triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Numerical Values**: Each note is mapped to a numerical position on a cyclic scale from 0 to 11.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes can affect the classification, generate all permutations of the three numerical notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes in semitones.\n4. **Check Triad Conditions**: Determine if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad by checking the required distances (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 semitones for minor).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Mapping each note to its corresponding numerical value\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_values = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\nn1, n2, n3 = input_notes\n\n# Get their numerical values\ntry:\n    v1 = note_values[n1]\n    v2 = note_values[n2]\n    v3 = note_values[n3]\nexcept KeyError:\n    print(\"strange\")\n    exit()\n\n# Function to calculate the distance from x to y (y - x) mod 12\ndef distance(x, y):\n    return (y - x) % 12\n\n# Check all permutations of the three notes\nfor perm in permutations([v1, v2, v3]):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = distance(a, b)\n    d2 = distance(b, c)\n    if (d1 == 4 and d2 == 3) or (d1 == 3 and d2 == 4):\n        if (d1 == 4 and d2 == 3):\n            print(\"major\")\n        else:\n            print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted into a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating distances between notes.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is considered.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference modulo 12, accounting for the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Triad Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation meets the criteria, we classify the triad accordingly. If none do, it is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the notes to determine their triad type accurately.",
