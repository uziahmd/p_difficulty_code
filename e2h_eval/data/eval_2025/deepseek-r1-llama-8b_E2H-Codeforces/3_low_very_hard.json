Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The street is a line from 0 to l. Each lantern i is at position ai. The area it covers is [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to make sure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no—actually, since the street is from 0 to l, any part of the coverage beyond those points is irrelevant. So for each lantern, its effective coverage is the maximum between (ai -d) and 0, and the minimum between (ai + d) and l. But wait, no, because if the lantern is at ai=15 and l=15, then d=0 would only cover 15, but maybe not needed. Wait, no, the lanterns can have d as small as needed, but the street must be completely covered.\n\nWait, no: for a lantern at position a, its coverage is [max(0, a-d), min(l, a+d)]. But when considering multiple lanterns, the union of their coverage areas must include the entire [0, l].\n\nSo, the approach is to find the minimal d such that the union of all [a_i -d, a_i +d] intervals covers [0, l].\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the critical points where the coverage starts and ends. For each lantern, the leftmost point it covers is a_i -d, the rightmost is a_i +d. The entire street must be covered, so 0 must be >= the leftmost point of some lantern, and l must be <= the rightmost point of some lantern.\n\nWait, no: for the entire street to be covered, the union of all intervals must cover from 0 to l. So, the first interval must start before or at 0, but perhaps that's not necessary because other intervals might cover earlier points. Wait, no—no, the earliest point covered is the minimum of (a_i -d). So to cover 0, the minimum a_i -d must be <=0. Similarly, the maximum a_i +d must be >=l.\n\nWait, no. Because the union of the intervals must include every point from 0 to l. So, the leftmost point covered is the minimal a_i -d across all i. That minimal value must be <=0. Similarly, the rightmost point is the maximal a_i +d, which must be >=l.\n\nBut wait, no: for example, suppose there's a lantern at a=5, with d=3. Then a-d=2, which is greater than 0. So the minimal a_i -d is 2, but the street starts at 0, which is not covered by this lantern. However, another lantern could cover it. So the minimal a_i -d is not sufficient. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the points between the sorted lantern positions. Because the optimal d will be determined by the gaps between these points.\n\nWait, let's consider the process of determining the required d.\n\nFirst, sort all the lantern positions in increasing order. Then, for each consecutive pair of lanterns, say at positions x and y, the required d must be at least (x - previous_point) / 2, but I'm not sure. Or wait, no: for two lanterns at positions a and b (sorted), the region between a and b must be fully covered by either their own coverage or by other lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal required d is determined by the maximum of two values:\n\n1. The minimal d needed to cover from 0 to the first lantern.\n2. The minimal d needed to cover the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. The minimal d needed to cover from the last lantern to l.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each of these segments, we need to have coverage. So let's break down the street into regions that need to be covered.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nSort all lantern positions a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order. Add 0 and l to the beginning and end of the list, but wait, no—wait, perhaps the regions to consider are:\n\n- From 0 to a_1\n- Between a_i and a_{i+1} for i from 1 to n-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves analyzing the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns and ensuring these gaps are covered by the minimal radius \\( d \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n2. **Calculate Gaps**: Identify the gaps between consecutive lanterns, as well as the start (from 0 to the first lantern) and end (from the last lantern to \\( l \\)) of the street.\n3. **Determine Coverage for Each Gap**: For each gap, compute the required radius \\( d \\) to cover it. This is done by finding the midpoint of each gap or extending the coverage from the nearest lanterns.\n4. **Compute Maximum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) required is the maximum of the computed radii for all gaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n, l = int(input[0]), int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    # Check if there's no coverage beyond 0\n    prev = -float('inf')\n    max_d = 0.0\n    for ai in a:\n        if ai - prev > max_d:\n            max_d = (ai - prev + max_d) / 2\n        prev = ai\n    # Check from last lantern to l\n    if prev < l:\n        d = l - prev\n        if d > max_d:\n            max_d = d\n    \n    # Check from 0 to first lantern\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        d = a[0]\n        if d > max_d:\n            max_d = d\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to easily identify consecutive lanterns and the gaps between them.\n2. **Gaps Calculation**: We consider three types of gaps: from 0 to the first lantern, between consecutive lanterns, and from the last lantern to \\( l \\).\n3. **Radius Calculation for Gaps**: For each gap, the required radius \\( d \\) is determined by the midpoint or extending from the nearest lanterns to ensure coverage.\n4. **Maximum Radius**: The largest radius needed to cover any gap is the answer, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with minimal \\( d \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal radius \\( d \\) by focusing on critical points and gaps, ensuring optimal coverage with minimal computational complexity.",
