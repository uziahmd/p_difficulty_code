There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket could limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. So the maximum is 2 games, not 3. Oh right, because after the initial two wins, the final would be the third game. Wait, no—wait, n=4 has 3 games total, but the winner can only play 2? Or am I misunderstanding the sample?\n\nWait the sample says n=10 gives output 4. So what's happening here.\n\nLet me try to model this. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how many layers of matches they can go through while respecting the rule that each new opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible sequence of games where each step adds an opponent who has either played the same number of games as the winner or one less.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each time the winner plays a new game, their number of games increases by one, and their next opponent must have played either k-1 or k games.\n\nAlternatively, think of the maximum number of games as the maximum possible value such that the sum of the first m terms is >=n. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait another approach: the winner starts with 0 games. Each new game increases their count by 1. For each new game, the opponent must have either 0, 1, ..., up to the current number of games minus one.\n\nWait, no. The rule is that two players can play if their number of games differ by at most one. So when the winner has played k games, the next opponent can have either k-1, k, or k+1 games? Wait no, because the opponent hasn't played more than the winner. Because the winner has to have more games than the opponent, since they're facing them in a later round.\n\nWait, no. Because the winner is the one advancing through the bracket. So for any match between the winner and another player, the winner must have played either the same number of games or exactly one more than the opponent.\n\nSo when the winner has played k games, the next opponent must have played either k-1 or k games.\n\nWait, no: the condition is that the numbers differ by at most one. So for any pair, the difference is <=1.\n\nBut the winner is the one who has played the most up until that point. Because otherwise, the opponent couldn't have played more games than the winner—they would have been eliminated earlier.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose the winner has played k games, and the opponent has played k+1. Then the difference is 1, which is allowed. But that would mean the opponent has played more games than the winner, which seems impossible because they must have won their previous games to reach that point.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe rule says: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the other.\n\nSo, for any two players x and y, |x_games - y_games| <=1.\n\nIn the context of a knockout tournament, for any two players that face each other, both must have won all their previous games. So the number of games each has played must be equal to their number of wins.\n\nBut for the winner, their number of games played is equal to the number of wins, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo when the winner plays against someone else, say in their next game, the opponent must have either played the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo the question is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given that each opponent in their path must have played either one less or the same number of games as the winner before their match.\n\nThis feels similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step depends on the sum of previous possibilities.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\nFor example:\n\n- To play 1 game (k=1), you need at least 2 players. So f(1)=2.\n\n- To play 2 games (k=2), you need at least 3 players. Because the winner plays two games. First, they play someone who has 0 games (they haven't played yet). Then, in the next game, they play someone else who has 1 game (they must have won once before).\n\nWait, wait. No. Let's see: For k=2, the winner must have played two games. The first game: the opponent has 0 games. The second game: the opponent must have either 1 or 2 games.\n\nWait, no. Because before the second game, the winner has played 1 game, so the opponent must have played either 0, 1, or 2 games. But in the second game, the opponent can't have played more than 1 because otherwise, they would have had to have played more games than the winner, which is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play m games.\n\nLet me define m as the maximum number of games the winner can play. We need to find the largest m such that the minimal number of players required for m is <=n.\n\nSo, for each m, compute the minimal required players, and find the largest m where this minimal is <=n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to precomputing for each m the minimal number of players needed, and then finding the maximum m where this minimal is <=n.\n\nNow, how do we compute the minimal number of players for a given m?\n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem. Let's model it.\n\nLet dp[m] be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play m games.\n\nBase cases:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (no games played, but that's not a case we'll consider)\ndp[1] = 2 (needs one opponent)\n\nFor m >=2:\n\nTo reach m games, the winner must have played m-1 games and then another game. In the m-th game, the opponent must have played either m-2 or m-1 games.\n\nWait, no. Because in the (m)th game, the winner has played m-1 games so far. So the opponent must have played either m-2 or m-1 games.\n\nSo, the minimal number of players needed for the m-th game is the sum of the minimal players needed for (m-1) games (winner's previous games) and the minimal players needed for the opponent's previous games (which is either m-2 or m-1, whichever is smaller).\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required is the sum of dp[k] for k from 0 to m-1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the minimal number of players needed to form a structure where the winner can play m games.\n\nEach time, the winner's next game requires an opponent who has either m-1 or m-2 games played.\n\nSo, for each m, the minimal number of players required is dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2], but wait, that's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor m=1: dp[1]=2.\n\nm=2: the winner needs to play two games. The first requires one opponent, then the second requires another opponent who has played one game. So for the second game, the opponent must have played one game. So the minimal setup is to have a structure where the winner plays two games, each time adding one more.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players is the (m+1)-th Fibonacci number? Or something similar.\n\nWait, let's compute some small m values.\n\nm=1: 2 players.\n\nm=2: The winner plays two games. The first game is against someone with 0 games. The second game is against someone who has 1 game. So, the minimal setup is 3 players: the winner (1) plays against 2 (game 1), then against 3 (game 2). So for m=2, dp[2] = 3.\n\nm=3: The winner needs to play three games. For the third game, the opponent must have played two games. So, the opponent must have played two games, which implies that they themselves have come from a structure where they played two games. So, for the third game, the opponent's part requires dp[2] players. But the winner's part requires dp[2] as well? Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, for m=3, the winner has played 3 games. The third game's opponent must have played 2 or 3 games. Wait, no—since the winner has played 3 games, the opponent can have played 2 or 3.\n\nWait, but the opponent can't have played 3 games because that would require the opponent to have beaten someone in the third game as well. That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, for the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games. So the minimal setup is that the winner has played 2 games, and the opponent has played 2 games.\n\nSo, the minimal number of players is dp[2] (for the winner's path) plus dp[2] (for the opponent's path). So dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[2] = 3+3=6.\n\nWait, but that's 6 players. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nIf we have 6 players:\n\nPlayers 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2 → winner 1.\n\nRound 2: 1 vs 3 → winner 1.\n\nRound 3: 1 vs 4 → winner 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the winner only played 3 games, but the opponent in the third game (4) only played one game. So why does this setup work?\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players for m is the sum of the first m terms of a certain sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m is the (m+1)-th term in the Fibonacci sequence, but starting differently.\n\nWait, let's try to compute dp for m=1,2,3,4.\n\nm=1 → dp=2\n\nm=2 → dp=3 (2+1)\n\nm=3 → dp=5 (3+2)?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for m=3, the opponent needs to have played 2 games. So the winner's path is m=3, which requires 3 games, and the opponent's path is m=2, which requires 3 players. So dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3+2=5.\n\nWait, maybe.\n\nWait, for m=3, the winner's path is 3 games. The third game's opponent must have played 2 games. So the minimal setup is that the winner has played 2 games (against two opponents), and the third opponent has played 2 games.\n\nSo the total players needed are (number of players for 3 games) + (number of players for 2 games) - 1 (since the winner is counted in both).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to model the problem as follows.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have a number of games that is either one less or equal to the winner's current games.\n\nSo for each m, the minimal number of players is the sum of the minimal players needed for each of the steps.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal number of players for m is equal to the sum of the minimal players needed for m-1, m-2, ..., 1. Or perhaps it's the sum of the first m terms of a certain sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m is the (m+1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor m=1, minimal players is 2.\n\nFor m=2, minimal is 3.\n\nFor m=3, minimal is 5.\n\nFor m=4, minimal is 8.\n\nThat's the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2,3,5,8,... which is 2,3,5,8,13,...\n\nYes, because each step adds the previous two.\n\nSo the formula is dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2], with dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3.\n\nSo for m=1:2, m=2:3, m=3:5, m=4:8, m=5:13, etc.\n\nSo, for example, when n=10, the maximum m is 4 because dp[4]=8 ≤10, and dp[5]=13>10.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the Fibonacci-like sequence where dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3, dp[m] = dp[m-1]+dp[m-2], and find the largest m where dp[m] ≤n.\n\nThen, the answer is m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute dp up to the maximum possible m where dp[m] ≤1018.\n\n2. For each test case n, find the largest m where dp[m] ≤n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Initialize a list dp where dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3.\n\n- For each m starting from 3, compute dp[m] = dp[m-1]+dp[m-2].\n\n- Continue until dp[m] exceeds 1018.\n\n- For a given n, find the largest m such that dp[m] ≤n.\n\nSo, let's compute dp up to m where dp[m] is just above 1018.\n\nCompute:\n\nm | dp[m]\n\n1 | 2\n\n2 |3 \n\n3|5 \n\n4|8 \n\n5|13 \n\n6|21 \n\n7|34 \n\n8|55 \n\n9|89 \n\n10|144 \n\n11|233 \n\n12|377 \n\n13|610 \n\n14|987 \n\n15|1597 \n\nWait, 1597 is larger than 1018. So the maximum m for n=1018 is 14, since dp[14]=987 ≤1018, and dp[15]=1597>1018.\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum games are 14.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Compute this dp array up to m=15.\n\n- For each n, find the maximum m such that dp[m] ≤n.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, we can precompute the dp list.\n\nWe can set a list, say fibs, where fibs[0]=2, fibs[1]=3, then each subsequent is sum of the previous two.\n\nWait, indexes may vary, but in code, it's easier to start from 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can start with a list called max_games, where max_games[i] represents the minimal number of players needed to achieve i games.\n\nSo, max_games[1] = 2, max_games[2]=3.\n\nThen, for i from 3 to max_m, max_games[i] = max_games[i-1] + max_games[i-2].\n\nWe can compute this until the next term exceeds 1018.\n\nOnce we have this list, for each n, we can perform a binary search to find the largest i where max_games[i] <=n.\n\nThe binary search is efficient even for n up to 1e18, which is way beyond our constraints.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Precompute the list.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Binary search for the largest i where max_games[i] <=n.\n\n- Output i.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nLet's write the code.\n\nFirst, precompute the list.\n\nmax_players = [0, 2, 3] # index 0 unused, 1:2, 2:3.\n\nThen, for i from 3 to ...:\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = max_players[i-1] + max_players[i-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    max_players.append(next_val)\n\n    i +=1\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to precompute all necessary terms.\n\nLet me compute the list step by step.\n\nCompute until the value exceeds 1018.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with i=3.\n\nmax_players[3] = 3+2=5.\n\ni=4: 5+3=8.\n\ni=5: 8+5=13.\n\ni=6:13+8=21.\n\ni=7:21+13=34.\n\ni=8:34+21=55.\n\ni=9:55+34=89.\n\ni=10:89+55=144.\n\ni=11:144+89=233.\n\ni=12:233+144=377.\n\ni=13:377+233=610.\n\ni=14:610+377=987.\n\ni=15:987+610=1597.\n\nSo, for i=15, the value is 1597>1018.\n\nSo the list will have up to i=14.\n\nSo the code can precompute up to i=15, but for n=1018, the maximum is 14.\n\nSo in code, let's create a list where the index represents the number of games.\n\nmax_games = [0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597]\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute it programmatically.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nCompute a list, fibs, starting with 2 and 3.\n\nfibs = [2, 3]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nSo, for each n, we need to find the largest m such that fibs[m-1] <=n.\n\nBecause fibs[0] is 2 (m=1), fibs[1]=3 (m=2), etc.\n\nWait, let me clarify the indices.\n\nIn the list, fibs[0] is 2, which is m=1.\n\nfibs[1] is 3, which is m=2.\n\nfibs[2] is 5, which is m=3.\n\nSo, for a given m, the corresponding value is fibs[m-1].\n\nThus, for n, find the maximum m where fibs[m-1] <=n.\n\nSo for example, for n=2, the maximum m is 1.\n\nFor n=3, m=2.\n\nFor n=5, m=3.\n\nSo the code can proceed as:\n\nRead n.\n\nFind the largest m where fibs[m-1] <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [2,3]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\n# Now, find the maximum m.\n\n# The list is fibs, where fibs[0]=2 (m=1), fibs[1]=3 (m=2), etc.\n\n# So, for each m, the value is fibs[m-1].\n\n# We can use bisect_right to find the insertion point.\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1\n\nprint(index)\n\nWait, but let's test for n=10.\n\nfibs is [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\n\nWait, for n=10, the values are:\n\nLooking for the largest m where fibs[m-1] <=10.\n\nfibs[0]=2 <=10.\n\nfibs[1]=3 <=10.\n\nfibs[2]=5 <=10.\n\nfibs[3]=8 <=10.\n\nfibs[4]=13>10.\n\nSo the index is 4 (since bisect_right returns 4, subtract 1 gives 3). So m=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=4.\n\nLooking for the largest m where fibs[m-1] <=4.\n\nfibs[3]=8>4. So check m=3: fibs[2]=5>4? No, 5>4.\n\nWait, no: fibs[2] is 5, which is greater than 4.\n\nWait, n=4.\n\nLooking for the largest m where fibs[m-1] <=4.\n\nCheck:\n\nm=1: 2<=4.\n\nm=2:3<=4.\n\nm=3:5>4.\n\nSo the maximum m is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=987.\n\nfibs[m-1] =987 → m=14.\n\nn=988: fibs[14]=987, so m=14.\n\nn=1597: m=15.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n- Precompute the fibs list.\n\n- For the given n, find the largest m using bisect.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will read n from stdin, compute the list, then perform a binary search.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=2 → output 1.\n\nCase 2: n=3 → output 2.\n\nCase 3: n=4 → output 2.\n\nCase4: n=5 → output3.\n\nCase5: n=6 → output3.\n\nn=7: same as 6, since fibs[2] is5<=7, fibs[3]=8>7. So m=3.\n\nn=8→m=4.\n\nn=9→m=4.\n\nn=10→m=4.\n\nn=987→m=14.\n\nn=988→m=14.\n\nn=1597→m=15.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each game the winner plays depends on the previous games they and their opponents have played.\n\n1. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: We precompute a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play that many games. The sequence starts with 2 and 3 players for 1 and 2 games respectively.\n2. **Precomputation**: We compute the sequence up to the point where the next term exceeds the maximum possible number of players (1018).\n3. **Binary Search**: For a given number of players `n`, we use binary search to find the largest number of games `m` such that the minimum number of players required for `m` games is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\n# Precompute the minimal number of players needed for m games\nfibs = [2, 3]  # fibs[0]=2 (m=1), fibs[1]=3 (m=2)\nwhile True:\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_val > 1018:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\n# Find the maximum m where fibs[m-1] <= n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\nprint(index)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: We start with the initial values for 1 and 2 games (2 and 3 players respectively). Each subsequent value is the sum of the two previous values, following the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using the `bisect` module, we efficiently find the largest index in the precomputed list where the value is less than or equal to `n`. This index corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the solution using precomputation and binary search, making it both optimal and easy to understand.",
