Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of its location. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest radius d where every point on the street [0, l] is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model this. The street is a line segment from 0 to l. Each lantern covers a range around its position. The union of all these ranges must cover the entire street. We want the minimal d that makes this possible.\n\nSo, how do we compute the minimal d? Well, one approach is to realize that the minimal d is determined by the maximum gap between consecutive coverage areas. So, if we can arrange the lanterns in order and compute the coverage intervals, then the minimal d is such that all the gaps between these intervals are covered.\n\nWait, but the coverage isn't just the lanterns' positions; each lantern covers a certain radius d. So the problem reduces to finding the smallest d such that when you place circles (in a way) around each ai, their union covers [0, l].\n\nI think a good way to model this is by considering the sorted positions of the lanterns and then calculating the required d based on the maximum distance between consecutive points, as well as the ends.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Compute the necessary coverage for the regions before the first lantern, between two consecutive lanterns, and after the last lantern.\n3. For each of these regions, determine the minimal d that ensures they're covered.\n4. The maximum of these minimal d's across all regions will be the answer.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the required d for each region?\n\nFor example, consider the first region: from 0 to the first lantern's position. If the first lantern is at a, then the coverage starts at a - d. To cover from 0 to a, we need a - d <= 0, meaning d >= a. Because otherwise, there's a gap between 0 and a - d.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the first lantern is at a, then its coverage is [a - d, a + d]. To cover 0, the left end of the coverage must reach 0. So a - d <= 0 => d >= a. But wait, if a is zero, then any d >=0 will cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the region after the last lantern: the last lantern is at b, and its coverage is [b -d, b +d]. To cover l, we need b +d >= l => d >= l - b.\n\nFor the regions between two lanterns, say lantern i is at x_i and lantern i+1 is at x_{i+1}, then the middle region is [x_i + d, x_{i+1} - d]. Wait, no—wait, the coverage of the first lantern is up to x_i + d, and the next is starting from x_{i+1} -d. So the gap is (x_i + d) to (x_{i+1} -d). The length of this gap is (x_{i+1} - x_i) - 2d. For the entire street to be covered, this gap should be <=0. So, x_{i+1} - x_i <= 2d. Therefore, d must be at least (x_{i+1} - x_i)/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps more accurately, the coverage of each lantern overlaps with the next, so the maximum distance between them is what determines the required d.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Sort the lanterns' positions in increasing order.\n- Compute the initial d as the maximum between:\n   a. The first lantern's position (to cover from 0 to a).\n   b. The last lantern's position (to cover up to l).\n   c. The differences between consecutive lanterns divided by 2 (to ensure overlapping between lanterns).\n- The minimal d is the maximum of these values.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's think again.\n\nThe first part is: the coverage of the first lantern must include 0. So a_1 -d <=0, which implies d >= a_1 (since a_1 is sorted). But if a_1 is 0, then d can be 0. Wait, no—because if a_1 is 0, then the coverage starts at 0, so 0 is covered regardless of d. But if a_1 is not zero, then d has to be at least a_",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are covered by the light from one or more lanterns placed along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance \\( d \\) from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps us analyze the coverage from the start to the end of the street.\n2. **Compute Coverage Requirements**:\n   - **First Lantern Coverage**: Ensure the first lantern covers from the start of the street (0). The required \\( d \\) is at least the position of the first lantern.\n   - **Last Lantern Coverage**: Ensure the last lantern covers up to the end of the street (l). The required \\( d \\) is at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n   - **Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, ensure their coverage overlaps. The required \\( d \\) must be at least half the distance between consecutive lanterns to ensure they overlap.\n3. **Determine Minimum \\( d \\)**: The minimum \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the above three considerations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    first = a[0]\n    d1 = first\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    last = a[-1]\n    d2 = l - last\n    \n    max_d = max(d1, d2)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required = gap / 2.0\n        if required > max_d:\n            max_d = required\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to sequentially check coverage from the start to the end of the street.\n2. **First and Last Lanterns**: The first lantern must cover from 0, so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to \\( l \\), so \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n3. **Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them must be covered by their combined radii. Thus, \\( d \\) must be at least half the distance between any two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Result**: The maximum of these values ensures that all parts of the street are covered with the smallest possible \\( d \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum \\( d \\) by considering all necessary coverage areas and ensuring no part of the street is left uncovered.",
