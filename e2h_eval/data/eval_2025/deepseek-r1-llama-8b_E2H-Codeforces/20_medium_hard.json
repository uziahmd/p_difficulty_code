For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, for each binary string s of length 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find all possible assignments of c_s such that when you compute the maximum possible size of such a multiset, it equals f.\n\nHmm. The goal is to count the number of c assignments that result in the maximum beautiful multiset size being exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, note that each binary string s can be considered as a node in a trie-like structure. Each node represents a certain prefix, and its children are the next bits. For example, \"0\", \"00\", \"01\", etc., form a tree.\n\nIn the context of the problem, for each node s (each binary string), the c_s is the maximum allowed number of times s appears in the multiset as a prefix. Wait, no. Wait, for any string t in the multiset, all prefixes of t (including itself) must satisfy their c constraints.\n\nWait, no. For each string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the count for s. So for s, the count must be <= c_s.\n\nSo for the multiset to be beautiful, for every possible s, the number of elements in the multiset that start with s must be <= c_s.\n\nBut when considering the maximum possible size of such a multiset given the c_s assignments, the size is determined by the minimal constraints across all possible s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum over all possible s of the number of elements that can be added without violating any c_s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the constraints on each individual s. For example, for each s, the maximum number of times it can appear as a prefix is c_s. So the total number of elements in the multiset is the sum over all s of the maximum possible occurrences, but ensuring that for longer s, their counts don't exceed their c_s, and also considering that their counts include the counts of their shorter prefixes.\n\nWait, maybe this is similar to building a trie where each node has a capacity c_s. Then, for each path from the root to a leaf, the capacities along the path determine whether that path contributes to the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the minimum possible contributions based on the c_s's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a dynamic programming problem on the trie of binary strings.\n\nEach binary string s can contribute some number of occurrences to the multiset. The number is limited by c_s and the c_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, because if a string s is present, then all its prefixes must have their c constraints satisfied.\n\nSo for a string s of length m, the maximum number of times it can appear in the multiset is min(c_s, product of the c_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s).\n\nWait, no. Because for s to appear, all of its prefixes must allow it. So the count of s can't exceed c_s, but also, for each prefix t of s, the count of s can't cause the count of t to exceed c_t.\n\nWait, maybe the way to model this is that for each s, the maximum number of times s can appear is the minimum of c_s and the product of (c_t + 1) for all t that are proper prefixes of s. Because each time we add a string s, we also contribute to all of its prefixes.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. Suppose s has proper prefixes t_1, t_2, ..., t_k. Then, for each t_i, adding s increases the count of t_i by 1. So, the maximum number of times s can appear is the minimum of (c_{t_1}, c_{t_2}, ..., c_{t_k}, c_s} ) + 1? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum number of times it can be chosen is the product of (c_t) for all proper prefixes t of s, plus one? Or maybe it's the minimum of the c_t for all proper prefixes t, and then multiplied by something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each string s can be considered in terms of its depth in the trie. For example, the root is the empty string, but in our case, the shortest string is length 1. So, the root's children are the single-character strings.\n\nFor a string s of length m, the maximum number of times it can appear in the multiset is the minimum of the c_s and the product of (c_t + 1) for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nSuppose we assign c_s for each string s. Then, for each s, the number of times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset is at most c_s. But since longer strings are built upon shorter ones, the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of elements in the multiset is equal to the sum over all s of the maximum number of times s can be included, which depends on the c_s's and their hierarchy.\n\nWait, no. Because including a string s contributes 1 to each of its prefixes. So the maximum possible is determined by the constraints on all the prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the product of (c_t) for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nNo, that might not be correct either.\n\nWait, let's take the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe output is 3.\n\nThe explanation says that for the three possible c assignments, the maximum size is 2.\n\nWait, in the sample, the strings are \"0\" and \"1\". So each is a length 1 string.\n\nFor each assignment of c_0 and c_1, the maximum size is determined by how many times they can appear as prefixes.\n\nWait, but since both are length 1, their counts are just their c values.\n\nSo the maximum size is min(c_0, c_1) + min(c_0, c_1) = c_0 + c_1. Wait, no. Because each string adds 1 to the count of their prefixes. So for \"0\" and \"1\", each can be added up to their c_0 and c_1 times, respectively.\n\nSo the total number of elements in the multiset would be the sum of the number of times each s can be added, which is the sum of c_s, but subject to the fact that adding a string affects all its prefixes.\n\nWait, no. Because each string is a separate element in the multiset. So if you have two copies of \"0\", each contributes 1 to the count of \"0\".\n\nSo the total number of elements is the number of times each s is added, regardless of their prefixes.\n\nWait, no, because each element in the multiset is a binary string, and for each element, all its prefixes' counts are incremented. So, the count for s is the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nSo for example, if the multiset contains \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", etc., each of these contributes to the count of \"0\", \"00\", etc.\n\nBut for the problem, the count for each s is the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So for the multiset, each element contributes 1 to all of its prefixes.\n\nThus, the count for s is equal to the number of elements in the multiset that are >= s in the trie.\n\nSo the problem is to assign c_s such that for each s, the number of elements in the multiset that are in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the count for s is the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So if an element is \"00\", it contributes 1 to s=\"0\" and 1 to s=\"00\".\n\nSo for each s, the count is the number of elements in the multiset that are in the set {s, ss, sss, ...}, where ss is s concatenated with a bit, etc.\n\nSo the count for s is equal to the number of elements in the multiset that are extensions of s.\n\nThus, the count for s is the sum over all possible extensions of s of the number of times those strings are included.\n\nWait, no. It's the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So for each element in the multiset, all of its prefixes are counted towards their respective c_s.\n\nThus, the count for s is the number of elements in the multiset that are exactly s, or s followed by more bits, etc.\n\nSo, for example, if the multiset has \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", then the count for \"0\" is 3, for \"00\" it's 2, and for \"000\" it's 1.\n\nNow, to find the maximum possible size of the multiset, given the c_s assignments.\n\nThe maximum size is determined by the constraints on all s: for each s, the number of elements that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, the maximum size is the sum over all s of the number of elements that can be added, given the constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because adding an element affects all of its prefixes.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to find for each s the maximum number of times it can be added, considering that all of its prefixes must have their c_t constraints met.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum size is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the product of (c_t) for all proper prefixes t of s.\n\nBecause, for s to be added, all of its proper prefixes must have been added enough times.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose s is \"00\", with proper prefixes \"0\" and \"00\" (but wait, \"00\" has only \"0\" as a proper prefix). So the maximum number of \"00\" we can add is min(c_{00}, c_0).\n\nBecause each \"00\" adds 1 to the count of \"0\" and 1 to the count of \"00\".\n\nSo for the multiset to have x \"00\"s, we must have x <= c_{00}, and x <= c_0.\n\nThus, the maximum x is min(c_{00}, c_0).\n\nSimilarly, for a string s with proper prefixes t_1, t_2, ..., t_m, the maximum number of s's that can be added is the minimum of c_s and all c_t_i for each t_i.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each s added contributes to all its t_i's counts.\n\nSo, the maximum number of s's we can add is the minimum of c_s and the product of c_t_i for all t_i.\n\nWait, no. It's not a product, but rather, for each t_i, the number of s's added must be <= c_t_i.\n\nSo, the maximum x for s is the minimum of c_s and the c_t_i for each t_i that is a proper prefix of s.\n\nBecause, for example, if s has two proper prefixes t1 and t2, then x must be <= c_t1 and x <= c_t2, as well as x <= c_s.\n\nSo, the maximum x for s is min(c_s, c_t1, c_t2, ...).\n\nSo, for the entire trie, the total maximum size is the sum for each s of the maximum x(s) as defined above.\n\nWait, no. Because each x(s) is the number of times s is added, and each addition affects all the prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of elements in the multiset is the sum of x(s) for all s, where x(s) is the maximum number of times s can be added, given the constraints.\n\nYes, because each x(s) is the count of s in the multiset.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each s (strings of length 1..n) such that the sum of x(s) for all s is exactly f.\n\nBut x(s) is the minimum of c_s and all c_t where t is a proper prefix of s.\n\nSo, the sum of x(s) for all s is f.\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to assign c_s such that this sum is exactly f.\n\nConstraints are that 1<=n<=15, and k can be up to 2e5, same for f.\n\nSo, the approach is to model this as a combinatorial problem where each c_s is assigned a value, and the sum of x(s) is f.\n\nBut considering the dependencies between the x(s), perhaps we can model this with inclusion-exclusion or DP.\n\nBut with n up to 15, it's manageable.\n\nWait, the strings are all possible binary strings of lengths 1 to n. So the total number of nodes in the trie is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2(2^n -1) ? Wait, no: for each length m, there are 2^m strings. So the total number of s is sum_{m=1}^n 2^m = 2^{n+1} - 2.\n\nWait, for n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the problem can be represented as a DAG, where each node s has edges to its children (longer strings formed by appending 0 or 1).\n\nEach node s has a variable c_s, which is the maximum allowed count for x(s).\n\nx(s) is the minimum of c_s and all c_t for t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nThe sum of x(s) over all s must be exactly f.\n\nWe need to count the number of assignments to c_s where each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive, and the sum is f.\n\nSo, the key idea is to model the problem as a DAG where each node's contribution depends on its own c and the c of its parents.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the number of assignments (c_s) such that the sum of x(s) is f.\n\nBut with n=15, the number of variables is about 6e4, which is too large for standard DP approaches.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the problem in a way that for each node, the contribution is determined by the min of its c and the c of its ancestors.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively: for a node s, the x(s) is min(c_s, x(parent(s))), where parent(s) is the longest proper prefix of s. Wait, no. Because s may have multiple proper prefixes.\n\nWait, no. For example, \"10\" has proper prefixes \"1\" and \"0\", but perhaps the min is over all of them.\n\nWait, but the minimal c among all proper prefixes is the limiting factor.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum x(s) is min(c_s, min_{t is a proper prefix of s} c_t).\n\nWait, because for each proper prefix t of s, x(s) can't exceed c_t, since adding s will increment x(t) by 1.\n\nWait, no. Because x(t) is the number of times t is added, which is also affected by the addition of s and its descendants.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's re-express x(s):\n\nx(s) is the number of times s is present in the multiset. Each occurrence of s contributes 1 to x(s) and to x(t) for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nSo, the x(t) for any t must be >= x(s) for all s that have t as a proper prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because x(t) is the count of elements that have t as a prefix. So, for example, if s is a child of t, then adding s contributes 1 to x(s) and 1 to x(t).\n\nSo, x(t) is the sum of x(s') for all s' that have t as a prefix.\n\nWait, but x(s') is the number of times s' is added. So x(t) = sum_{s' is a descendant of t} x(s').\n\nTherefore, x(t) is the sum of x(s') for all s' in the subtree rooted at t.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can model the problem as a system of inequalities.\n\nEach x(s) is the number of times s is added.\n\nFor each node s, x(s) can be at most c_s.\n\nAdditionally, for each node t that is a proper prefix of s, x(s) can be at most c_t. Because each addition of s contributes 1 to x(t), so x(t) must be at least x(s), but wait, no. Because x(t) is the sum of x(s') for all s' in the subtree of t. So if s is a child of t, x(s) contributes to x(t). So x(t) >= x(s).\n\nWait, but x(t) is the sum of x(s') where s' is a descendant of t, including t itself.\n\nSo, x(t) >= x(s) for all s in the subtree of t.\n\nWait, but for the constraints, for each s, the count x(s) must be <= c_s, and for each t that is a proper prefix of s, x(s) must be <= c_t.\n\nBecause x(t) = sum of x(s') where s' is in the subtree of t, including s. So x(t) >= x(s), but x(t) must also be <= c_t. So x(s) <= x(t) <= c_t.\n\nWait, no. Because x(t) is the sum of x(s') for all s' in the subtree of t. So x(t) includes x(s) as one of its terms.\n\nSo x(t) >= x(s). But since x(s) is part of x(t), the constraint x(s) <= c_t is automatically satisfied if x(t) <= c_t, because x(t) is the sum of x(s') including x(s).\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck again.\n\nMaybe let's think about it differently. For a node s, all its proper prefixes t must have x(t) >= x(s). Because each time s is added, it contributes 1 to x(t). So x(t) is the sum of x(s') for all s' in the subtree of t.\n\nThus, x(t) is the sum of x(s') for all s' in the subtree of t. So x(t) is equal to the sum of x(s) for s in the subtree of t.\n\nWait, no. Because x(t) is the number of elements in the multiset that have t as a prefix. Each such element contributes 1 to x(t), and 1 to x(s) for every s that is a proper prefix of t.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. For example, if t is \"00\", then any element that is \"00\", \"000\", \"0000\", etc., will contribute 1 to x(\"00\"). So x(\"00\") is the number of elements in the multiset that have \"00\" as a prefix.\n\nSo x(\"00\") = number of elements in the multiset that are \"00\", \"000\", etc.\n\nSimilarly, x(\"0\") is the number of elements that are \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", etc.\n\nSo, for a node s, x(s) is the number of elements in the multiset that are s, or s followed by more bits. So x(s) is the number of elements in the multiset that are in the subtree of s (excluding s itself? Or including s? Wait, no. Including s.)\n\nSo, x(s) is the count of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nThus, for each s, x(s) is the sum of x(t) for all t that are children of s.\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the elements that have s as a prefix are s itself plus all its children. So x(s) is equal to the sum of x(t) for all t in the subtree of s (including s itself).\n\nWait, no. Because for the root (the empty string?), perhaps not. But in our case, the root is not considered, since we start from length 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the x(s) as the sum of the x(t) for all t in the subtree of s, including s.\n\nSo, x(s) = sum_{t is a descendant of s} x(t).\n\nBut then, for each s, x(s) is the count of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nBut this leads us to a system where x(s) is determined by the x(t) of its children.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the x(s) can be expressed in terms of the c_s variables.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Since x(s) is the count of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix, which is the sum of x(t) for all t in the subtree of s.\n\nThus, x(s) = x(s) + sum_{t is a child of s} x(t).\n\nWait, that would imply x(s) = ... which is circular.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each node s, x(s) is the number of elements in the multiset that are exactly s.\n\nThen, the total x(s) for s is the number of elements equal to s.\n\nBut then, the count for all prefixes t of s would include x(s) plus the x of all longer strings that have t as a prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the right way to model it.\n\nLet me define x'(s) as the number of elements in the multiset that are exactly s.\n\nThen, for each s, the count x(s) is the sum of x'(t) for all t that are prefixes of s.\n\nSo, x(s) = sum_{t | t is a prefix of s} x'(t).\n\nIn this case, the constraints are:\n\nFor each s, x(s) <= c_s.\n\nThe total number of elements in the multiset is sum_{s} x'(s).\n\nOur goal is to maximize this sum, given the constraints.\n\nBut in this problem, we're not maximizing, but we need to find the number of assignments of c_s such that the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum is determined by the constraints on x(s) for all s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum is the sum of x(s), which is the sum of the minimum of c_s and all c_t for t proper prefixes of s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum over all s of the minimum of c_s and the c_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nBecause for each s, the number of times it can be added is limited by the minimum of c_s and all c_t for t proper prefixes of s.\n\nBecause adding s contributes to each of its prefixes, so each prefix t must have at least as many elements as the number of s's added.\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"00\", and t is \"0\", then the number of \"00\" added can't exceed c_0, because each \"00\" added contributes 1 to c_0.\n\nSo, x(\"00\") = min(c_00, c_0).\n\nSimilarly, for s with multiple proper prefixes, x(s) is the minimum of all c_t for t proper prefixes of s, and c_s.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is sum_{s} min(c_s, min_{t is proper prefix of s} c_t).\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning c_s for each s (from 1 to n in length) such that sum_{s} min(c_s, min_{t proper prefix of s} c_t) = f.\n\nAnd we need to count the number of such assignments where each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of tuples (c_s) where for each s, c_s is in [0, k], and the sum of min(c_s, min_{t|t is proper prefix of s} c_t) over all s is exactly f.\n\nNow, the question is how to model this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of variables is manageable, but the number of possible combinations is still huge.\n\nSo, we need a way to represent the state in terms of the c_s variables and their dependencies.\n\nAnother idea: For each s, the value of x(s) = min(c_s, min_{t|t is proper prefix of s} c_t).\n\nThus, x(s) is determined by the c_s and the c_t of its proper prefixes.\n\nSo, for each s, x(s) can be thought of as the minimum between c_s and the minimum c_t of its proper prefixes.\n\nThus, for the root node (empty string, but not considered here), but for the leaves, like length 1, their x is min(c_s, c_root). But since the empty string isn't in our consideration, perhaps for the first level, the x(s) is just c_s.\n\nWait, for a string s of length 1, the proper prefixes are none. So, x(s) = c_s.\n\nFor a string s of length 2, the proper prefixes are the strings of length 1 that are prefixes of s. So, for s = \"01\", the proper prefixes are \"0\" and \"1\"? No, wait, proper prefixes are the prefixes shorter than s. So, for \"01\", the proper prefixes are \"0\" and \"1\" only if s starts with them. Wait, no. For \"01\", the proper prefixes are \"0\" (since \"01\" starts with \"0\"), and nothing else because \"1\" is not a prefix of \"01\".\n\nWait, no. The proper prefixes of \"01\" are all the strings that are a prefix of \"01\" and shorter than it. So, \"0\" is a proper prefix, but \"1\" is not.\n\nSo, for s = \"01\", the proper prefixes are \"0\" and \"01\" does not have \"1\" as a prefix. So, only \"0\" is a proper prefix.\n\nThus, x(\"01\") = min(c_{01}, c_0).\n\nSimilarly, for s = \"10\", the proper prefix is \"1\".\n\nSo, for each s, x(s) is the minimum of c_s and all c_t where t is a proper prefix of s.\n\nThus, the problem is to choose c_s for each s (binary strings of length 1..n) such that the sum of x(s) for all s is f.\n\nEach c_s can be 0 to k.\n\nWe need to count the number of such assignments.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this sum efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the problem in terms of the x(s) variables. Because x(s) is determined by c_s and the c_t of its proper prefixes, perhaps we can model x(s) as a function of the c variables.\n\nBut since x(s) depends on the c_t variables, which are the c's of the proper prefixes, it's a hierarchical dependency.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this using memoization or dynamic programming, processing the nodes in order of increasing length.\n\nEach node s can be processed after all its proper prefixes are processed.\n\nMoreover, for each node s, the x(s) is the minimum between c_s and the minimum of the x(t) for all t proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, because for each t proper prefix of s, x(t) is the sum of x(t') for t' in the subtree of t. But perhaps for the purpose of x(s), the minimal c among the proper prefixes is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, for each node s, x(s) is the minimum between c_s and the minimal x(t) for all t proper prefixes of s.\n\nBecause x(t) is the sum of x(t') for t' in the subtree of t. So, for s, the minimal x(t) would ensure that the addition of s does not violate any of the t's constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps x(s) is min(c_s, min(x(t) for t proper prefix of s)).\n\nIf that's the case, then for each node s, x(s) depends on the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nThus, the problem can be modeled as a system where x(s) is the minimum of c_s and the x(t) for all proper prefixes t of s.\n\nSo, the sum of x(s) over all s is f.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: choose c_s for all s, and compute x(s) as min(c_s, min(x(t) for t proper prefix of s)), and the sum is f.\n\nWe need to count the number of assignments where this sum is exactly f.\n\nNow, the key is to model the dependencies of x(s) on the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nThis suggests that we can process the nodes in order of increasing length, starting from the leaves (length n) and moving upwards.\n\nAt each step, for each node s, we can determine x(s) based on the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nBut since the c_s variables are involved, perhaps we can model this as a DP where for each node s, we track the possible x(s) values and the number of ways to achieve them, considering the constraints from the c_s variables.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, we can represent the possible ranges of x(s) based on the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nBut with n=15, and each node having 2^m possible x(s) values, this could be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each node s the possible x(s) in terms of the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, but even that seems challenging.\n\nAnother approach: since the sum needs to be f, perhaps we can model this as a knapsack problem, where each item is a node s, and the weight is x(s), which depends on the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nBut the dependencies between items complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node s, the x(s) can be represented as min(c_s, m), where m is the minimum of the x(t) for its proper prefixes.\n\nThus, the x(s) can vary between 0 and the minimum of the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nThis suggests that for each node s, the x(s) can be at most the minimum of c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a DP where for each node, we track the possible x(s) values and the cumulative sum.\n\nBut the issue is that the x(t) for proper prefixes t may depend on other variables.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the x(s) can be written as:\n\nx(s) = min(c_s, m), where m is the minimum x(t) for all proper prefixes t of s.\n\nSo, the x(s) is determined by c_s and the x(t)s.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum of x(s) for all s.\n\nWe can model this as a directed acyclic graph, where each node s has edges to its children (longer strings), and the x(s) depends on the x(t)s of its proper prefixes.\n\nBut again, the dependencies are complex.\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is f, perhaps we can model this as a generating function problem.\n\nEach node s contributes a term to the generating function based on the possible x(s) values.\n\nThe generating function for the sum is the product of the generating functions of all s, considering their dependencies.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model the dependencies in the generating function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the problem as a tree where each node s has a certain range of possible x(s) based on the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, but this is vague.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently.\n\nEach c_s can be in [0, k]. For each s, x(s) = min(c_s, m), where m is the minimum x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nThe sum of x(s) is f.\n\nWe can model the problem by considering the c_s variables and their impact on the x(s) variables.\n\nBut with n=15, and each s having up to 15 levels, perhaps a bitmask-based approach is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use memoization to represent the state as the current node and the sum so far.\n\nBut considering that the sum can be up to f, which is up to 2e5, and n is 15, this could be manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, we can compute the possible x(s) values given the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the x(s) depends on multiple variables.\n\nAnother approach: for each node s, the x(s) can be as large as min(c_s, m), where m is the minimum x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nThus, for each node s, x(s) can be up to min(c_s, m). So, the maximum x(s) is min(c_s, m), and the minimum is 0.\n\nThus, for each node s, the possible x(s) is in [0, min(c_s, m)].\n\nBut since m depends on the x(t) of proper prefixes, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum possible x(s) is min(c_s, m), where m is the minimum of the x(t) for proper prefixes t of s.\n\nThus, the x(s) is bounded by m and c_s.\n\nSo, for each node s, the possible x(s) can be from 0 to min(c_s, m).\n\nBut the problem is that m depends on the x(t) of t, which are the proper prefixes.\n\nThus, the dependencies form a directed acyclic graph, and the x(s) variables are determined in a topological order.\n\nSo, perhaps we can process the nodes in reverse order, starting from the longest strings and moving to the shorter ones.\n\nFor each node s, the x(s) can be determined once the x(t) of its proper prefixes are known.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the x(s) is the minimum of c_s and the x(t) of all proper prefixes t of s.\n\nThus, for each node s, the x(s) is the minimum between c_s and the x(t) for each proper prefix t of s.\n\nSo, for the root node (empty string), it's not considered, but for the leaves, their x is just c_s.\n\nFor a node s of length m, its proper prefixes are the nodes of lengths 1 to m-1 that are prefixes of s.\n\nThus, for each node s, the x(s) is the minimum of c_s and the x(t) for each t in the proper prefixes of s.\n\nThus, the x(s) can be computed as the minimum of c_s and the x(t) of each of its proper prefixes.\n\nThus, the problem can be broken down into computing for each node s the x(s) as the minimum of c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nOnce x(s) is computed, the sum is the sum of all x(s).\n\nThus, the problem is to find the number of assignments of c_s such that the sum of x(s) is f.\n\nNow, how to model this.\n\nIdea: The x(s) for each node depends only on the c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes. Thus, we can process the nodes in order of decreasing length (from n down to 1).\n\nFor each node s, after processing all its proper prefixes, we can determine the possible x(s) values based on c_s and the x(t) of its proper prefixes.\n\nThus, for each node s, the possible x(s) is the minimum between c_s and the x(t) of each t proper prefix of s.\n\nThus, for each node s, x(s) can be in [0, min(c_s, m)], where m is the minimal x(t) among the proper prefixes t of s.\n\nSo, for each node s, the x(s) is constrained by the x(t) of its proper prefixes and c_s.\n\nBut the x(t) themselves are constrained by their own c_t and their proper prefixes.\n\nThis seems like a system where the variables are dependent on each other.\n\nBut with n=15, perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach where for each node, we keep track of the possible x(s) values, and the number of ways to reach those values given the constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node s, we can compute a list of possible (sum_so_far, x(s)) pairs, where sum_so_far is the sum contributed by the nodes processed so far (nodes longer than s), and x(s) is the value assigned to s.\n\nThen, for each node s, we process its proper prefixes and combine the possible x(s) values.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, especially since f can be up to 2e5.\n\nBut perhaps with memoization and efficient representation, it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each node s, collect all its proper prefixes t.\n\n2. Process the nodes in order of decreasing length (from n down to 1).\n\n3. For each node s, the x(s) can be from 0 to min(c_s, min_x_t), where min_x_t is the minimum x(t) among the proper prefixes t of s.\n\n4. For each node s, the possible x(s) is the minimum between c_s and the x(t) of each t in the proper prefixes",
