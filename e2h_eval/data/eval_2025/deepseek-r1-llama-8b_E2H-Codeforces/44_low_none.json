He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems from his list. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximums each day.\n\nHmm, right. So the key is to find the best way to split the list into exactly k contiguous parts such that the sum of the maxima of each part is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It feels like a dynamic programming problem because we're trying to make optimal choices at each step, and the choices affect future possibilities.\n\nWhat's the state for the DP? Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and j days. But wait, how do we track the splits?\n\nAlternatively, another approach: For each position i and day j, we can keep track of the maximum value up to that point. Or maybe for each j, we can decide where to split after i, so that the next day starts at i+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state should be dp[j][i], representing the maximum total profit for the first i problems in j days. Then, to compute dp[j][i], we can look back to some m < i, where m is the end of the previous day's segment. So dp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m < i.\n\nBut the problem is that for each j and i, we need to know the maximum in the interval from m+1 to i. Computing this on the fly might be expensive, especially since n can be up to 2000. We need an efficient way to find the maximum quickly.\n\nMaybe precompute a 2D array that stores the maximum from any l to r. That's O(n^2), which is manageable for n=2000.\n\nSo first, let's precompute the max for all possible intervals. Let's create a 2D array max_table where max_table[l][r] is the maximum a[i] from index l to r (inclusive). To compute this, for each starting l, we can iterate r from l to n-1, keeping track of the current maximum.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP can proceed efficiently.\n\nNow, for the DP setup:\n\n- dp[j][i]: the maximum profit for the first i problems in j days.\n- Base case: dp[0][0] = 0, but probably not needed. Wait, maybe j starts from 1. Alternatively, when j=1, dp[1][n] is the maximum of the entire array.\n\nWait, no. Because if j=1, then all n problems are solved in one day, so the profit is the maximum of the entire array.\n\nFor other cases, for dp[j][i], it's the maximum over all m < i of dp[j-1][m] + max_table[m+1][i].\n\nSo, the transition is:\n\ndp[j][i] = max( dp[j-1][m] + max_table[m+1][i] ) for m from 0 to i-1.\n\nWe can build this DP table, and then the answer will be dp[k][n], which is the maximum total profit for using exactly k days.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000, and k can also be up to 2000. So the DP table size is 2000*2000 = 4e6, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the next thing is to reconstruct the solution. After computing the DP table, we need to find the splits. So for each j, and each i, we need to track where the split was made.\n\nTo do this, perhaps during the DP computation, we can keep a parent pointer or a way to track the best m for each j and i.\n\nAlternatively, after filling the DP table, we can backtrack from dp[k][n] to find the split points.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Precompute the max_table for all l and r.\n2. Initialize the DP table with dimensions (k+1) x (n+1), since j can be from 0 to k and i from 0 to n.\n3. Fill the DP table according to the transition.\n4. Reconstruct the splits by backtracking from dp[k][n].\n\nLet's think about the initial conditions. For j=1, dp[1][i] is the maximum of the first i elements, but only for i >= some value. Wait, no. Wait, for j=1, the entire array must be taken in one day, so dp[1][n] is the maximum of the whole array. For i < n, dp[1][i] is not possible because you can't split into exactly 1 day unless you take",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over exactly k days. Each day, Polycarp must solve a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The goal is to distribute the problems into k contiguous segments such that the sum of these maxima is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: First, we precompute a 2D array `max_table` where `max_table[l][r]` gives the maximum value in the subarray from index `l` to `r`. This helps in quickly determining the maximum value for any segment during the dynamic programming (DP) phase.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use a DP table `dp[j][i]` where `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems over `j` days. The transition is based on the idea that for each day `j` and problem count `i`, we consider all possible previous splits `m` and compute the profit as `dp[j-1][m] + max_table[m+1][i]`.\n3. **Reconstruct the Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[k][n]` to determine the optimal splits for each day, ensuring we reconstruct the exact distribution of problems into k segments.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute max_table\n    max_table = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for l in range(n):\n        current_max = a[l]\n        max_table[l][l] = current_max\n        for r in range(l+1, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[r])\n            max_table[l][r] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[-1]*(n+1) for _ in range(k+1)]\n    # dp[j][i]: max profit using first i problems in j days\n    # For j=1, it's the max of first i problems, but only when i = n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[1][i] = max_table[0][i-1]\n    \n    for j in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            for m in range(0, i):\n                if dp[j-1][m] != -1:\n                    current = dp[j-1][m] + max_table[m][i-1]\n                    if dp[j][i] < current:\n                        dp[j][i] = current\n    \n    # Reconstruct the solution\n    t = [0]*k\n    current_i = n\n    for j in range(k, 0, -1):\n        for m in range(current_i-1, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j-1][m] != -1:\n                t[j-1] = current_i - m\n                current_i = m\n                break\n    \n    print(dp[k][n])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: The `max_table` is filled such that each entry `max_table[l][r]` holds the maximum value in the subarray from index `l` to `r`. This allows us to quickly access the maximum value for any segment during the DP phase.\n2. **DP Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with `-1` to indicate invalid states. For the case where only one day is used (`j=1`), the profit is the maximum of the entire array.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each day `j` and problem count `i`, we look back at all possible previous splits `m` and update the DP table to reflect the maximum profit achievable.\n4. **Reconstruction**: Starting from the state `dp[k][n]`, we backtrack to determine the optimal splits for each day, ensuring we capture the segments that contribute to the maximum total profit.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum total profit using dynamic programming and ensures the solution is both optimal and efficient for the given problem constraints.",
