Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at certain points along the street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d where every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The street is a line from 0 to l. Each lantern i is at position ai. The area it covers is [ai - d, ai + d], but we have to make sure that this doesn't go beyond 0 or l. Wait, no, because if ai -d is less than 0, the coverage starts at 0. Similarly, if ai +d exceeds l, it ends at l.\n\nWait, no, the lantern's coverage is any point on the street that is at most d away. So for each lantern, the interval it covers is [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)]. But since all lanterns must cover the entire street, the union of their intervals must include [0, l].\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal d such that the union of [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)] for all i covers [0, l].\n\nNow, how do we find the minimal d?\n\nI think the approach is to consider the points where the coverage changes. Because the lanterns may not be in order, perhaps we should sort them first.\n\nWait, right. Because without sorting, the coverage could be overlapping in arbitrary ways. So first, I'll sort the lantern positions.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem becomes finding the minimal d such that the union of the intervals after expanding each ai by d (clamped to 0 and l) covers 0 to l.\n\nHow can we compute this?\n\nMaybe we can model this as checking for the largest gap between consecutive lanterns (after considering their coverage). The minimal required d would then be half of the maximum such gap, but wait, not exactly—because each lantern's coverage depends on d, which is the same for all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the largest distance between two consecutive points, considering the coverage after expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look at the coverage after expanding each lantern's coverage by d. Then, the union of these intervals must cover [0, l].\n\nSo, let's sort the ai in increasing order. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them is important.\n\nWait, but when you expand each lantern's coverage by d, the regions they cover can potentially overlap with their neighbors.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal d is such that for each i, the rightmost point of the i-th lantern's coverage is not before the leftmost point of the (i+1)-th, and similarly for the leftmost and rightmost points.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to find for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d to ensure that their expanded intervals overlap.\n\nBut that might not capture all cases because sometimes a single lantern's coverage might have to bridge multiple gaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of:\n\n- The distance between the current lantern's right end and the next lantern's left end, divided by two.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think through an example.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSecond sample:\nn=2, l=5\nPositions: 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting, they are at 2 and 5.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is [2-d, 2+d] and [5-d,5+d]. We need these to cover [0,5].\n\nWhat's the minimal d? As per the note, d=2 works.\n\nBecause the first covers from 0 to 4, the second from 3 to 5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nIf d were 1, then the first would cover [1,3], the second [4,6], which doesn't cover 0-1 or 4-5 (since l is 5). So d=2 is needed.\n\nSo what's the maximum gap here? The initial gap is from 0 to 2, which is 2 units. The middle gap is from 3 to 4 (if d was 1.5, maybe). Hmm, perhaps I should model the problem differently.\n\nAnother approach: after sorting the lanterns, for each lantern, compute the maximum of the previous lantern's right coverage and the next lantern's left coverage. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical points are the points where the coverage starts and ends. Let's think about the entire coverage as a union",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves analyzing the coverage intervals of each lantern and ensuring that their combined coverage spans the entire street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lanterns**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps us analyze the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Coverage Intervals**: For each lantern, calculate its coverage interval as \\([max(0, a_i - d), min(l, a_i + d)]\\).\n3. **Determine Critical Gaps**: Identify the gaps between the end of one lantern's coverage and the start of the next lantern's coverage. The maximum gap determines the required radius \\( d \\) to ensure full coverage.\n4. **Compute Minimum \\( d \\)**: The minimum \\( d \\) is determined by the largest gap between consecutive lanterns, ensuring that each gap is covered by expanding the radius of at least one lantern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_min_d(n, l, ai):\n    # Sort the lantern positions\n    ai = sorted(ai)\n    # Add sentinel points to handle the ends\n    ai = [0] + ai + [l]\n    \n    # Now process each pair to find the required d\n    max_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(1, len(ai)):\n        prev = ai[i-1] + d_candidate\n        current_start = ai[i] - d_candidate\n        if current_start > prev:\n            gap = current_start - prev\n            if gap > max_gap:\n                max_gap = gap\n    \n    # Find the minimal d where the maximum gap is covered\n    # Binary search over possible d values\n    left = 0.0\n    right = l\n    for _ in range(100):\n        mid = (left + right) / 2\n        # Check if mid is sufficient\n        covered = True\n        # Extend each lantern's coverage by mid\n        extended = [a + mid for a in ai]\n        extended = [max(0, a - mid) for a in extended]\n        extended = [min(l, a + mid) for a in extended]\n        # Check if the union covers [0, l]\n        current = 0\n        for a in extended:\n            if a < current:\n                continue\n            if current > l:\n                break\n            if a > current:\n                current = a\n        if current >= l:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid\n    return right\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input_lines[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = float(input_lines[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    ai_str = input_lines[idx]\n    ai = list(map(int, ai_str.split()))\n    # Convert to floats\n    ai = [float(a) for a in ai]\n    # Compute minimal d\n    d = compute_min_d(n, l, ai)\n    # Print with 10 decimal places\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lanterns**: The lanterns are sorted to analyze the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to efficiently determine the minimum \\( d \\) by checking if a given \\( d \\) can cover the entire street.\n3. **Extended Coverage**: For each candidate \\( d \\), we extend each lantern's coverage and check if the union of these intervals covers the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the smallest \\( d \\) efficiently, even for large values of \\( l \\).
