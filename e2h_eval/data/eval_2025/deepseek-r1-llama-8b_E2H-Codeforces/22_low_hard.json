After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best in that particular subject. Being the best means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, the input is n students and m subjects. Each student's marks are given as a string of m characters. For each subject, we need to find which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each subject across all students. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, determine if in any subject j, their mark equals the maximum of that subject.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read the input: n and m, followed by n strings each of length m.\n2. For each subject j:\n   a. Collect all the marks from each student in that subject.\n   b. Find the maximum mark among them.\n3. For each student, check if in any subject j, their mark is equal to the max for j.\n4. Count how many students satisfy this condition.\n\nWait, but for each subject, we can record the maximum value. Then, for each student, we just compare each of their marks against the corresponding subject's max. If any of them matches, then the student is successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures. We can represent each subject's max as a list or array. So for m subjects, we have a list where each element is the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nOnce that's done, for each student's marks, we iterate through each subject and check if any of their marks equals the subject's max. If yes, count the student.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines into a list called students_marks.\n- For each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n   - Iterate over each student's j-th character, convert to integer.\n   - Find the maximum value among these.\n   - Store this max in a list subject_maxs[j].\n- Now, for each student in students_marks:\n   - For each j in 0..m-1:\n      - Get the j-th mark of the student.\n      - Compare with subject_maxs[j]. If equal, mark the student as successful and break.\n- Count the number of successful students.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nWhat if all students have the same marks? Then for each subject, the max is the same as each student's mark. So every student would be successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the only student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, with '22' and '11'. Subject 1: max is 2, subject 2: max is 2. Only the first student is successful.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, for subject 1, both have 2, so both are max. So when checking each student, the first has 2 in subject 1, which is the max, so successful. The second has 2 in subject 2, which is also the max, so he's successful too. Oh right, because for each subject, any student who has the max is considered the best in that subject.\n\nOh wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: a student is the best in a subject if there's no one else with a higher mark. So, if two students have the same max in a subject, then neither is the best. Because someone else has the same mark. So, in that case, no one is the best in that subject.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, for a subject j, the best student is the one(s) with the highest mark, but only if no other student has a higher mark.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the definition says: a student is the best in a subject if there's no student who got a higher mark for that subject. So, for a subject, if the maximum is, say, 5, and three students have 5, then none of them is the best in that subject because they don't have a higher mark than others. Because another student might have the same as the max.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: a student is the best in a subject if there exists no student who has a higher mark. So, if the maximum is 5, and multiple students have 5, then those students are not the best in that subject because someone else has the same. Or wait, no. Wait, suppose a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`, followed by the marks of each student.\n2. **Determine Subject Maxima:** For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nsubject_max = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[i][j])\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n    subject_max.append(max_mark)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(students[i][j]) == subject_max[j]:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and stored in a list where each element represents a student's marks for all subjects.\n2. **Finding Subject Maxima:** For each subject, iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This information is stored in a list called `subject_max`.\n3. **Checking Success:** For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If a match is found, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Counting Successful Students:** Finally, count how many students are successful and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging the maximum marks for each subject and checking against each student's marks.",
