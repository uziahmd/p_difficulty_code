Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. That means all the letters from the guest and host should be present in the pile, with no extra letters and no missing ones.\n\nHmm, the input has three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile. We need to check if combining guest and host's letters gives exactly the pile.\n\nSo, my approach is to combine the two names into one string, count each character in that combined string, then do the same for the pile. If the counts match exactly, output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the total letters in the guest and host add up correctly? Oh right, because the sum of their letters must equal the pile.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines. The first two are the names, the third is the pile.\n2. Concatenate the first and second lines into a single string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, thinking about how to implement this in Python.\n\nIn Python, I can use the collections.Counter class which is perfect for this. It will create a dictionary-like object where keys are characters and values are their counts.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read the three lines. Since the input is given as a list, but in the problem statement, the input is three lines. So, I'll read them using input().strip() for each line.\n\nWait, but sometimes when reading multiple lines, using input() in a loop is better. But since there are exactly three lines, I can read them one by one.\n\nSo:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\n\nCreate counters:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nIf counter_combined == counter_pile, then print YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the lengths don't match? Because if the combined length isn't equal to the pile's length, we can immediately return NO without further checks.\n\nSo, adding a condition like len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile) would save some computation time.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if the sum of their lengths equals the pile's length. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, create the counters and compare.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read input\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Check lengths\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Create combined string\n    combined = guest + host\n    # Counters\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\nWait, no, the actual input is three lines, each being a string. So the code reads each line as a separate string.\n\nWait, no, the way the problem is written, the input is three lines. So each line is read via input().strip(). So yes, that's correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → let's count the letters.\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → same letters?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute their counts.\n\nAlternatively, the code should handle it correctly.\n\nAnother test case is when the combined length is longer than the pile's length. Then it's automatically NO.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- One of the names is empty? But according to the problem statement, each line is not empty, so no.\n\nWhat about uppercase letters? The problem says all are uppercase, so no issues.\n\nAnother edge case: all letters are same. Like guest is 'AA', host is 'A', pile is 'AAA'. Should return YES.\n\nWhat about when the combined has more of a certain letter than the pile? For example, guest is 'AAB', host is 'B', pile is 'AB' → combined is 'AABB', which has two As and two Bs. Pile has one A and one B. So counters differ, returns NO.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that all letters from both names should be present in the pile without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths**: Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n4. **Count Characters**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts**: Check if the character counts of the combined string match those of the pile. If they do, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the total number of characters matches\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    # Compare the two counters\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from the input, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Length Check**: It first checks if the total number of characters in the guest's and host's names combined matches the length of the pile. This is a quick check to avoid unnecessary computations in cases where the lengths do not match.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined target string.\n- **Character Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the code counts the frequency of each character in both the combined target string and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: Finally, it compares the two counters. If they are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly, and \"YES\" is printed. Otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
