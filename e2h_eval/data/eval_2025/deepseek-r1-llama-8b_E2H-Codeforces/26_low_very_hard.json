Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts at C and goes up to D. So in all cases, z is at least as big as y and x. So for the triangle inequality, the only necessary condition is x + y > z. Because if z is larger than or equal to y, then x + z will definitely be larger than y, and y + z is larger than x. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z is between C and D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially when B, C, D are large, like up to 5e5, iterating through each possible x, y, z would be too slow. So I need an efficient way to calculate this without brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's fix x and y. Then for each such pair (x, y), I need to find the number of z's that are >= C and <= min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are from max(C, ...) to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nWait, but z also has to be at least C and at most D. So the lower bound is C, and the upper bound is min(D, x+y-1). So the count for each (x,y) is the number of integers z where z is in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\nThe number of such z's is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if min(D, x+y-1) >= C. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo for each x and y, compute s = x + y, then z can be from C to s-1, but also cannot exceed D. So the upper limit is s-1, but if s-1 > D, then it's D. So the range is [C, t], where t is min(s-1, D).\n\nIf C > t, then there are zero options. Otherwise, the count is t - C + 1.\n\nSo the total count is the sum over all x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and for each (x,y), compute the number of valid z's as described.\n\nBut with A, B, C, D up to 5e5, iterating x from A to B (up to 5e5) and y from B to C (another 5e5) is O( (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) ), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: group the x and y in a way that allows us to compute the sum more efficiently.\n\nLet me consider that for a fixed x, y can vary from B to C. For each x, the contribution to the sum depends on how many y's in [B,C] satisfy that x + y > C, because z can be as low as C. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but maybe we can find the minimal y that, when combined with x, gives s = x + y > z_min (which is C). Or perhaps the maximum z is min(D, x + y - 1). Hmm.\n\nWait, for a given x, the minimal y is B, and maximal is C. For each y, we can compute the maximum z allowed, which is min(D, x + y - 1). So for each x, we can find the sum over y of (max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)).\n\nBut again, doing this for each x and y is too slow. So perhaps for each x, find the range of y where x + y - 1 >= C. Because if x +",

The key condition for a triangle to be non-degenerate is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: Given \\(A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D\\), we need to find valid triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).

Since \\(z\\) must be at least \\(C\\), we need \\(x + y > C\\).
