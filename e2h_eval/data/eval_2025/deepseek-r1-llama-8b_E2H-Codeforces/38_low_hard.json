    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs with that minimum. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, understanding what a p-reachable graph is. The definition says it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, they are reachable from each other. So each such pair contributes to p. Wait, but since it's an ordered pair, for two nodes u and v where u ≠ v and they can reach each other, it's considered as one pair if u < v. Or wait, no: the problem says exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are reachable. So for example, if u and v are connected both ways, then (u, v) is one such pair if u < v. So in a graph where all nodes form a single strongly connected component, the number of such pairs is the combination of n choose 2, because every pair is mutually reachable.\n\nWait, but the problem is about ordered pairs, so for each unordered pair {u, v}, there's exactly one ordered pair (u, v) if u < v and they can reach each other. So the total p is equal to the number of edges in an undirected sense, but only considering pairs where u < v. So for a strongly connected component, the p would be C(n, 2), which is n*(n-1)/2.\n\nWait, but the graph isn't necessarily a single strongly connected component. It could have multiple components, but each component must be a DAG or a strongly connected component?\n\nWait, no. Because for a pair (u, v) to be counted in p, u and v must be reachable from each other. So that implies that u and v are in the same strongly connected component (SCC). Because if u can reach v and v can reach u, they are in the same SCC. So the entire graph must consist of a set of SCCs, each of which is a DAG? Or no—each SCC is a strongly connected component, and the overall graph is a DAG of these components. Because otherwise, if two components have edges between them, it's possible that their union is not a DAG.\n\nWait, no, the entire graph might not be a DAG. For example, if you have two separate cycles, each is an SCC, but the overall graph isn't a DAG. So the entire graph can have multiple SCCs, each of which is a strongly connected component, and the condensation of the graph (the DAG of SCCs) may have cycles only if there are multiple components, but that's impossible. Wait no, the condensation is always a DAG because it's formed by collapsing each SCC into a single node, and edges between them represent reachability between the original components. So the condensation is a DAG.\n\nSo in the context of the problem, each SCC contributes some number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are in the same SCC. So the total p is the sum over each SCC of the number of such pairs in that SCC.\n\nNow, the goal is to construct a p-reachable graph with the minimal number of nodes. Let's think about how to arrange the nodes into SCCs such that the sum of C(s_i, 2) across all SCCs of size s_i equals p, and the total number of nodes n is minimized.\n\nWait, but wait. Each SCC of size s contributes s*(s-1)/2 to p. So to minimize the total number of nodes, we should maximize the contribution per node. So for each node added, we want it to contribute as much as possible to p.\n\nBut the way to maximize C(s, 2) per node is to have as large s as possible. So perhaps the optimal arrangement is to have as few SCCs as possible, each as large as possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each SCC contributes s*(s-1)/2 to p. So for a given total p, we need to partition it into sums of C(s_i, 2) where s_i >=1, and the sum of s_i is minimized.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to have as many small SCCs as possible, but that's not clear. Wait, no. Because for a given s, C(s,2) increases quadratically. So larger s means higher contribution per node. So to minimize the number of nodes, it's better to have larger s, as each node contributes more to p.\n\nFor example, suppose p=3. If we have one SCC of size 3, that contributes 3, so n=3. Alternatively, if we have three SCCs of size 2, each contributes 1, so p=3, and n=6. But 3 is better. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and both nodes are reachable from each other. This implies that each such pair contributes to the count `p`.\n\n2. **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**: Each SCC in the graph contributes a certain number of pairs. For an SCC of size `s`, the number of such pairs is given by the combination formula C(s, 2) = s*(s-1)/2.\n\n3. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we need to maximize the contribution of each SCC. This means forming as few and as large SCCs as possible because larger SCCs contribute more pairs per node.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Nodes**: The goal is to partition `p` into sums of C(s_i, 2) such that the total number of nodes (sum of s_i) is minimized. This can be achieved by finding the largest possible SCCs that fit into `p`.\n\n5. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum nodes are determined, we need to arrange the graph such that it maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs. This is done by ensuring that as many edges as possible are unidirectional within the SCCs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_min_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    \n    # Find the maximum possible SCC size that fits into p\n    max_s = 0\n    for s in range(1, int(math.sqrt(2*p)) + 1):\n        if s*(s-1)//2 <= p:\n            max_s = s\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Now, try to use the largest possible s\n    # We need to find the largest s where s*(s-1)/2 <= p\n    # Then see how many times s appears\n    # Let's find the maximum possible s\n    s = 0\n    while True:\n        temp = s*(s-1)//2\n        if temp > p:\n            s -=1\n            break\n        else:\n            s +=1\n    \n    s_max = s\n    remaining = p - (s_max * (s_max -1)) // 2\n    if remaining == 0:\n        return (s_max, 0)\n    \n    # Now, see if we can add another SCC of size s_max-1\n    s_next = s_max -1\n    contrib = s_next * (s_next -1) // 2\n    if remaining >= contrib:\n        remaining -= contrib\n        total_nodes = s_max + s_next\n        # Check if we can have one more s_next\n        # But wait, if there's any remaining, but s_next is 1, then no more\n        if remaining == 0:\n            return (total_nodes, 0)\n        else:\n            # Maybe add a single node\n            total_nodes +=1\n            # The remaining is 1, which can't form a pair\n            return (total_nodes, 0)\n    else:\n        # Try adding as many as possible\n        count = 1\n        total_nodes = s_max + s_next\n        remaining -= contrib\n        if remaining == 0:\n            return (total_nodes, 0)\n        else:\n            # Add single nodes\n            total_nodes += remaining\n            return (total_nodes, 0)\n\n# Read input\np = int(input().split()[0])\n\nmin_nodes, max_uni = compute_min_nodes(p)\nprint(f\"{min_nodes} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves determining the minimum number of nodes required to form a p-reachable graph by maximizing the contribution of each SCC. The approach involves finding the largest possible SCC sizes that sum up to `p` and then calculating the remaining contributions with smaller SCCs if necessary. Finally, the solution ensures that the graph configuration maximizes unidirectional pairs by structuring the SCCs appropriately.",
