Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But he's smart because he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. And the question is, how many hours in total can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let me think about the example they gave. The first sample input is 4 and 2. So he starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burnt ones. Since b is 2, he can make 4/2 = 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 more hours. Now he has 2 burnt candles again. He makes another 1 (because 2 /2 is 1), which gives another hour. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nAnother example is 6 and 3. So initial burn:6 hours. Now 6 burnt, divided by 3 gives 2. So 2 more hours. After burning, 2 burnt. But 2 <3, so he can't make more. Total is 6+2=8.\n\nSo the approach is: every time after burning some candles, collect the remains, see how many new candles can be made, add that to the total, and repeat until you can't make any more.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles.\n2. Burn them all, add 'a' hours.\n3. Collect 'a' burnt candles.\n4. While the number of burnt candles is >=b:\n   a. Divide by b to get new_candles.\n   b. Add new_candles to the total.\n   c. The new burnt candles are new_candles (since each new candle burns for 1 hour and becomes one burnt).\n5. Repeat until no more can be made.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each time you create new candles, they are added to the total and their burnt versions accumulate.\n\nLet me model this as variables:\n\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\n\nloop:\n    while burnt >= b:\n        new = burnt // b\n        total += new\n        burnt = new  # because each new candle will burn, adding to burnt when they go out\n\nYes, that's right. Because each new candle you make will become a burnt candle once it's used.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Initialize total = a, burnt = a\n- While burnt >= b:\n   - new = burnt // b\n   - total += new\n   - burnt = new\n- Return total\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a is less than b. Then, burnt is a, which is less than b, so nothing is added. So total is a.\n\nLike if a=3, b=5: total is 3.\n\nCase 2: a is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, a is at least 1, so no.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2. So total is 1. Can't make any new.\n\nWhat about a=5, b=2.\n\nBurn 5: total=5, burnt=5.\n\n5//2=2. So add 2, total=7. Burnt now is 2.\n\n2//2=1. Add 1, total=8. Burnt is 1. Can't do anything. So yes.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this loop.\n\nSo in Python, read a and b from input.\n\nBut the input is given as two integers on a single line. So we'll split the input into two parts.\n\nFor example, for the sample input '4 2', a=4, b=2.\n\nImplement the steps:\n\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n    new = burnt // b\n    total += new\n    burnt = new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal=4, burnt=4.\n\nLoop: 4>=2 → new=2. total=6, burnt=2.\n\nLoop: 2>=2 → new=1. total=7, burnt=1. Exit.\n\nOutput is 7.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, burnt=6.\n\n6 >=3 → new=2. total=8, burnt=2.\n\n2 <3 → exit. Output 8.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2.\n\nAs earlier, output is 8.\n\nAnother test: a=7, b=3.\n\nInitial:7 → total=7, burnt=7.\n\n7//3=2 → total=9, burnt=2.\n\n2 <3 → done. So 9.\n\nAnother test: a=2, b=2.\n\nBurn 2 → total=2, burnt=2.\n\nnew=1 → total=3, burnt=1. Can't proceed. So 3.\n\nWhich is correct: 2 hours, then 1 from 2/2=1, but then that candle is burned, adding 1 hour. Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, write the Python code.\n\nRead a and b from input. Split the input line into two integers.\n\nCompute as per above.\n\nSo the code will be something like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n    new = burnt // b\n    total += new\n    burnt = new\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nI think this should handle all the cases correctly. Let me think about possible issues.\n\nWhat if a is 0? According to the problem statement, a is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nWhat if b is 1? Like a=5, b=1.\n\nThen, initial total=5, burnt=5.\n\nEach iteration: new=5//1=5, add to total (10). Burnt becomes 5 again.\n\nThis loops forever. Oh, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the constraints, b is at least 2. So the problem says 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000. So b can't be 1. So in our code, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nYes, that should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can convert a certain number of burnt candles back into new ones to keep the process going.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Burn all the initial candles, which contributes `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycle Burnt Candles**: Collect the burnt candles and convert them into new candles whenever possible. For every `b` burnt candles, Vasily can make one new candle.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue burning the new candles and recycling the resulting burnt ones until there are not enough burnt candles left to make a new one.\n\nThe algorithm can be broken down as follows:\n1. Initialize `total` to `a` and `burnt` to `a`.\n2. While `burnt` is greater than or equal to `b`, calculate how many new candles can be made, add this number to `total`, and update `burnt` to the number of new candles.\n3. Once no more candles can be made, print the total hours.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n    new = burnt // b\n    total += new\n    burnt = new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with `a` candles, so both `total` and `burnt` are initialized to `a`.\n- **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are enough burnt candles (`burnt`) to make at least one new candle (`b`). In each iteration, we compute how many new candles can be made, add this to the total hours, and update `burnt` to the number of new candles (since each new candle will burn and become a burnt candle after an hour).\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when `burnt` is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made. The final value of `total` is the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by repeatedly converting burnt candles into new ones, ensuring that all possible resources are used optimally.",
