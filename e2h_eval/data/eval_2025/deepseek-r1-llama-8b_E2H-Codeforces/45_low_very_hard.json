There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket could limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. So the maximum is 2 games, not 3. Oh, right, because the initial structure might prevent the winner from playing more than two games.\n\nSo the problem is to model the possible paths the winner can take, ensuring that each step adheres to the game difference rule. We need to find the longest possible path.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is similar to some kind of binary tree traversal, but with constraints on the depth based on the game rules.\n\nLet me think about what determines the maximum number of games. Each game the winner plays requires that their opponent has either the same number of games played as them or one less (since the winner must have won all previous games).\n\nWait, no. The condition is that two players can play only if their number of games played differ by at most one. So when the winner is playing their k-th game, their opponent must have either k-1 or k games played.\n\nBut since the winner is always advancing, for each game they play, their opponent must have exactly one less game played than them before that match. Or maybe not—wait, the rule is about the count before the game. So when the winner is going into their i-th game, the opponent must have either i-1 or i-1 games? Wait, no—before the current game, the number of games each has played must differ by at most one.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the winner's path as a sequence of opponents, where each opponent has a number of games played that is either equal to or one less than the winner's current game count minus one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of the first k numbers (like Fibonacci sequence) is less than or equal to n-1.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the sample inputs:\n\nFor n=2, output is 1. That makes sense because there's only one game.\n\nn=3: output is 2. How? The winner plays two games: first against one player, then against the next. So in the first game, the winner has 0 games, the opponent has 0. After winning, the winner has 1 game. Then the next game, the opponent has 0, which is allowed because 1 and 0 differ by 1.\n\nn=4: output is 2. So the maximum is 2. How? Because the winner can't play three games. For example, if the winner plays two games, each time their opponent has one less. So after two games, the winner has 2, but there's no third opponent to play because that would require the opponent to have either 1 or 2 games. If the opponent had 2, then we'd have a situation where both have 2, so they can play. But perhaps the way the tournament is structured doesn't allow that.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number is <= n.\n\nBecause each new opponent in the winner's path must have a certain number of games played, leading to a structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let me think: Suppose the winner plays k games. Each game must have an opponent who has either one less or one more game played than the winner before that game.\n\nBut since the winner is always increasing his own game count, each opponent must have at most one less than the winner's current count before facing him.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is determined by the maximum possible k where F(k+2) <= n, where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc. Or maybe another variation.\n\nWait, let's try to see for small n:\n\nn=2: max",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the structure of the tournament and the given rule leads to a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the number of players, `n`.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest Fibonacci number such that this number is less than or equal to `n`. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has either the same number of games played or one less, leading to a recursive structure akin to the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We use an iterative approach to compute the Fibonacci sequence until we find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [1, 2]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    return fib[-1]\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 1 and 2. We then iteratively compute the next Fibonacci number by summing the last two numbers in the sequence.\n2. **Comparison with n**: Each new Fibonacci number is compared against `n`. Once a Fibonacci number exceeds `n`, we stop the iteration.\n3. **Result**: The last Fibonacci number computed before exceeding `n` is the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring that we handle all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
