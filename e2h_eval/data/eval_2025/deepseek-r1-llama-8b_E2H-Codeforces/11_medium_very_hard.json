A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some resources, and we need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given the available resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe are given the following variables:\n- n: number of friends.\n- k: number of bottles of soft drink.\n- l: milliliters per bottle.\n- c: number of limes.\n- d: slices per lime.\n- p: grams of salt.\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend.\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- Each friend needs nl ml of drink.\n- One slice of lime.\n- np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, all friends together require n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt.\n\nHmm, right. Because each friend makes one toast, so each needs their own slice and portion.\n\nSo the total resources needed for t toasts would be:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl\nLime: t * n (since each toast uses one slice per friend)\nSalt: t * n * np\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, for each toast, all friends are making one toast. So each toast round consumes these amounts.\n\nNow, the total drink available is k * l.\nTotal slices available: c * d.\nSalt available: p grams.\n\nSo, the maximum possible toasts t is determined by the minimum of:\n\n1. Drink: (k*l) / (n * nl). Since each toast requires n * nl ml, the total toasts can't exceed (total_drink) / (n * nl).\n2. Lime: (c*d) / n. Each toast uses n slices, so total slices divided by n gives the number of toasts.\n3. Salt: p / (n * np). Because each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nThen, the actual maximum toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nOnce we find t_max, that's the maximum number of toasts possible, but then we have to divide by n because each friend can only do t_max / n toasts? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial calculation gives the maximum t such that all three constraints are satisfied. So t is the minimal of those three, which already considers the per toast resource usage across all friends.\n\nWait, let's think with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCalculations:\n\nTotal drink: 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3*3=9ml. So 20/9 is about 2.222. So integer division would give 2.\n\nLime: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices. 80/3 is about 26.666, so 26. But wait, no. Wait, in the note, it's stated that the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Wait, no—each lime has d slices, so total slices is c*d. Then, for each toast, n slices are used. So the number of toasts is (c*d)/n.\n\nIn the sample, c*d = 10*8=80. Divided by n=3, gives 26.666, which is 26 when using integer division. But according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts, but that's incorrect. Oh wait, perhaps the note is wrong, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the note again:\n\nThe note says: The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if each toast requires n slices, which is 3, then 80 /3 is about 26 toasts. So perhaps the note is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Wait, each lime is cut into d slices, so c limes give c*d slices. For each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are used. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the sample, c*d is 10*8=80, n=3. 80//3 is 26. So that's the max toasts from lime.\n\nSimilarly, drink: total drink is 20ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3ml = 9ml. So 20 //9 is 2. So drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast requires 3*1=3 grams. So 100 //3 is 33. So salt allows 33 toasts.\n\nSo the min of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So each friend can make 2 toasts.\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the three possible maximum toasts based on drink, lime, and salt.\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the maximum number of toasts is the minimum of t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because each of those t_drink, t_lime, t_salt represents the maximum possible toasts considering each resource, but we need to take the minimum of those.\n\nWait, let me see: the maximum toasts possible is the smallest of the three, because if any of them is insufficient, the total can't exceed that.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each case, compute t_drink, t_lime, t_salt as above, then the maximum t is the minimum of these three.\n\nThen, since each friend makes t toasts, the answer is t.\n\nWait no. Wait, because each toast is a round where all friends make a toast. So the total toasts is the number of rounds. So each friend makes t toasts.\n\nSo, the final answer is t.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input line as integers.\n\n2. Compute total_drink = k * l.\n\n3. Compute drink_toast = (total_drink) // (n * nl).\n\n4. Compute total_lime_slices = c * d.\n\n5. Compute lime_toast = total_lime_slices // n.\n\n6. Compute salt_needed_per_toast = n * np.\n\n7. Compute salt_toast = p // salt_needed_per_toast.\n\n8. The maximum toasts is min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast).\n\n9. Output this maximum toasts.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20.\n\ndrink_toast = 20 // (3*3)=20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → total_lime=80. 80//3=26.\n\nsalt: 100/(3*1)=33. So min(2,26,33)=2 → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=1000.\n\nnl=4. So per toast, 5*4=20ml. So drink_toast=1000//20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → 19 slices.\n\nlime_toast = 19//5=3.8 → 3.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3. So per toast, 5*3=15g. 90//15=6.\n\nSo the min of 50,3,6 is 3. So output 3.\n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → 1e6 ml.\n\nnl=50. per toast, 10*50=500ml. 1e6//500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → 575 slices. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1. per toast, 10*1=10g. 1//10=0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0)=0 → output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute each step as above.\n\nHandle cases where any of the denominators could be zero, but according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive, so denominators are non-zero.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead input:\n\nline = input().strip().split()\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line)\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nlime_toast = total_lime // n\n\nsalt_per_toast = n * np\n\nsalt_toast = p // salt_per_toast\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n\nWait, but what about when any of the divisions result in zero?\n\nLike in sample 3, salt_toast is zero, so the min is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting it against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nSample 2: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → 3.\n\nSample3: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: when all resources are sufficient for the same number.\n\nE.g., n=2, k=10, l=10 → 100ml.\n\nnl=10 → each toast requires 2*10=20ml. 100/20=5.\n\nc=2, d=5 → 10 slices. 10//2=5.\n\np=5, np=1 → 2*1=2 per toast. 5//2=2.\n\nmin(5,5,2)=2.\n\nSo output 2.\n\nAnother edge case: when one of the resources is zero.\n\nWait, but the problem states that all inputs are positive, so that's not possible.\n\nWhat if salt is just enough for one toast?\n\nE.g., n=1, p=1, np=1 → 1//1=1.\n\nSo it works.\n\nI think this approach covers all cases.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One slice of lime per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available is `p` grams.\n\n3. **Determine Toast Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Compute the maximum number of toasts based on the total drink available, considering each friend's requirement.\n   - **Lime Limit**: Compute the maximum number of toasts based on the total lime slices available.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Compute the maximum number of toasts based on the total salt available.\n\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum of the three computed limits (drink, lime, and salt).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nlime_toast = total_lime // n\n\nsalt_per_toast = n * np\nsalt_toast = p // salt_per_toast\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**:\n   - `total_drink` is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and their capacity.\n   - `total_lime` is calculated as the product of the number of limes and their slices.\n3. **Toast Limits Calculation**:\n   - `drink_toast` is the total drink divided by the required drink per toast round (per friend).\n   - `lime_toast` is the total lime slices divided by the number of friends (each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - `salt_toast` is the total salt divided by the required salt per toast round (per friend).\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value among `drink_toast`, `lime_toast`, and `salt_toast` is taken as the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts while respecting all constraints, ensuring optimal resource utilization.",
