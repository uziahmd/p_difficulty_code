She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to model what actions she can take and figure out the optimal sequence to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. There are a few possibilities here.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs. For example, if some tabs to the left of l are open, she needs to get the cursor to a position where she can close them. Similarly for the right side beyond r.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs.\n2. Closing those left tabs.\n3. Possibly moving again to another position to close the right tabs.\n4. Closing those right tabs.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes she can do both closures in one movement without having to move back and forth too much.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's figure out which tabs need to be closed. Any tab less than l or greater than r must be closed. So, the initial state is that all tabs are open, and we need to close those outside [l, r].\n\nNow, the initial position is 'pos'. So, the steps involve moving to a certain point and closing the necessary tabs.\n\nLet's consider different cases.\n\nCase 1: All tabs outside [l, r] are already closed. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nBut probably, that's not the case unless l=1 and r=n, or when pos is such that the required tabs are already the only ones left.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state is that all tabs are open. So, she has to close the ones outside [l, r], regardless of their current state.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal steps to close all tabs except those in [l, r].\n\nSo, let's think about the process.\n\nShe can perform three types of actions each second:\n\n- Move left (if possible)\n- Move right (if possible)\n- Close left tabs\n- Close right tabs\n\nEach action takes 1 second.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find the minimal sequence of these actions that leads to all tabs outside [l, r] being closed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, determine whether there are any tabs to the left of l that need to be closed. Let's call this 'left_close' = True if l > 1. Similarly, 'right_close' = True if r < n.\n\nIf neither left nor right needs to be closed, then the answer is 0. Because she doesn't have to do anything.\n\nOtherwise, she needs to perform some operations.\n\nNow, the order of operations depends on the initial position.\n\nLet's outline the possible steps.\n\nSuppose we need to close both left and right tabs.\n\nWe can think of two main paths:\n\n1. Move to the left closure point, close, then move to the right closure point, close.\n\n2. Move to the right closure point, close, then move to the left closure point, close.\n\nWe need to calculate the time for both options and choose the minimal.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's possible to combine the movements and closures in a way that reduces the total steps.\n\nAnother possibility is that after closing one side, the available tabs change, affecting the movement for the other side.\n\nSo, perhaps we should model each possible scenario.\n\nLet me think about each possible scenario.\n\nScenario 1: No tabs need to be closed. As discussed, output 0.\n\nScenario 2: Only left tabs need to be closed.\n\nIn this case, she needs to move to a position where she can close the left tabs, and then perform the close.\n\nWhat's the best position to close? It's the leftmost position in the required segment, which is l. Because closing to the left of l will close all tabs less than l.\n\nWait, no. If she is at position i, closing the left tabs will close all from a (the current leftmost) to i-1. So, to close all tabs less than l, she needs to be at l or higher.\n\nWait, perhaps she should be at l, because then she can close all to the left, which includes everything less than l.\n\nYes. So, for the left closure, she needs to get to position l.\n\nSimilarly, for the right closure, she needs to get to position r.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Move from current pos to l: steps = |pos - l|.\n\n- Then, close left tabs: 1 step.\n\n- Then, move from l to r: steps = r - l.\n\n- Then, close right tabs: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps after closing the left, the available tabs are from l to r. So, when moving to r, the movement is within [l, r], so steps are (r - l), as each step moves one tab.\n\nSimilarly, when moving from l to r.\n\nSo, that's one scenario.\n\nAnother scenario: Maybe she can close the right first, then the left.\n\nSo, steps would be:\n\nMove to r: |pos - r|.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nThen, move to l: |r - l|.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = same as before.\n\nSo, for this case, the total steps would be |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but if she closes left first, she might have to move more steps because after closing left, the available tabs are l to r, so moving from l to r is (r - l) steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close left, then close right without moving.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing left, the cursor is at l. Then, to close right, she needs to be at r and close.\n\nSo, she must move from l to r, which takes (r - l) steps, then close right.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if she can move to a position that allows her to close both sides in fewer steps?\n\nHmm, perhaps not, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial movement can be to a position that allows her to close both sides with fewer steps.\n\nFor example, suppose she is in the middle, and after moving to l, she can close left, then move to r, then close right. But maybe there's a way to minimize the movement by choosing a path that requires less overall steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps depend on the initial position and the required l and r.\n\nLet me think through an example.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\n6 3 2 4.\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nShe can:\n\n- Move from 3 to 2: 1 step. Close left (closes 1): step 2.\n\nThen, move from 2 to 4: 2 steps (since 2→3→4). Step 3,4.\n\nClose right: step 5.\n\nTotal steps: 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nmove to l, close left, move to r, close right.\n\nTotal steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nAnother way: Could she close right first?\n\nShe is at 3.\n\nShe could move to 4, close right, which would close 5,6. Then, move to 2, close left.\n\nHow many steps?\n\n3→4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 2.\n\nMove 4→2: 2 steps (4→3→2).\n\nClose left: 3.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+2+1=5. Same as before.\n\nSo, same total.\n\nSo, in this case, both approaches give same result.\n\nBut what about when l and r are not adjacent.\n\nAnother example: suppose l=1, r=5, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close tab 6.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nOption 1: close right first.\n\nMove from 3 to 5: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 3.\n\nOption 2: close left first.\n\nShe is at 3, l=1. So, moving to 1: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nTotal steps: 3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut perhaps, in some cases, one approach is better than the other.\n\nWait, perhaps if she is closer to one side than the other.\n\nLike, pos is closer to r than l.\n\nSay, pos=4, l=2, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close 1, and 6.\n\nSo, if she moves to 2, close left (steps: 2 steps to 2, close: 3 steps total).\n\nThen, move to 5: 3 steps (2→3→4→5). Close right: 4 steps.\n\nTotal: 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, she could move to 5, close right (1 step for moving, 2 steps to close), then move back to 2, close left.\n\nWait, moving from 4 to 5: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 2 steps.\n\nMove from 5 to 2: 3 steps.\n\nClose left: 4 steps.\n\nTotal: 1+1 +3 +1 =6 steps. So, worse than the first option.\n\nSo, in this case, moving to l first is better.\n\nThus, the approach depends on which side is closer.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose between:\n\na) Close left first, then right.\n\nb) Close right first, then left.\n\nCompute the steps for both and take the minimum.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there are cases where you don't need to move all the way to l or r, but can find a better spot to close both sides with fewer steps.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's think.\n\nWhat if the initial position is somewhere in between l and r, but it's more efficient to close both sides from a certain position.\n\nFor example, suppose l=2, r=5, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close 1 and 6.\n\nWhat's the minimal steps?\n\nOption 1: Close left first.\n\nMove to 2 (1 step), close left (step 2). Then, move to 5 (3 steps: 2→3→4→5), close right (step 5). Total steps: 5.\n\nOption 2: Close right first.\n\nMove to 5 (2 steps:3→4→5), close right (step 3). Then move back to 2 (3 steps:5→4→3→2). Close left (step 4). Total steps:4.\n\nSo, option 2 is better.\n\nSo, the order matters based on which is quicker.\n\nBut wait, in this case, option 2 took 4 steps, which is better.\n\nSo, the minimal steps can vary depending on the order.\n\nHence, the approach is to compute the steps for both possible orders and choose the minimal.\n\nBut perhaps there's another scenario where she can close both sides in a single movement.\n\nWait, no, because she can only close one side per step.\n\nSo, the steps for each order are:\n\nFor option a: close left first, then right.\n\nTime to move to l: |pos - l|.\n\nPlus 1 step to close left.\n\nThen, move to r: |r - l| steps.\n\nPlus 1 step to close right.\n\nTotal: |pos-l| + 1 + (r - l) +1.\n\nFor option b: close right first, then left.\n\nTime to move to r: |pos - r|.\n\nPlus 1 step to close right.\n\nThen, move to l: |r - l| steps.\n\nPlus 1 step to close left.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| +1 + (r - l) +1.\n\nSo, the minimal between these two is the answer when both left and right need to be closed.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a third option where she can close both sides from a point in between, thus avoiding moving all the way to l or r.\n\nFor example, perhaps she can move to some position x, close left, then move to y, close right.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would be better.\n\nHmm. Let's see.\n\nSuppose l=2, r=5, pos=3.\n\nAs before, option a and b give 5 and 4 steps respectively.\n\nBut what if she can find a better x and y.\n\nWait, perhaps she can close the left by moving to 2, close left, then move to 5, close right.\n\nThat's the same as option a.\n\nAlternatively, can she close right from a position that's not r? No, because closing right from x would close all tabs to the right of x, which may include tabs beyond r. Wait, no, because in the initial state, all tabs are open. So, if she is at x, closing right will close x+1 to max_b, which is initially n.\n\nBut she needs to close all tabs beyond r. So, she needs to be at r, because then closing right will close r+1 to n.\n\nSo, she cannot close right from a position before r, because that would leave some tabs beyond r still open.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, to close the right tabs, she must be at r, and then close right.\n\nSimilarly, to close the left tabs, she must be at l, and then close left.\n\nAh, that's an important point. So, the initial assumption was correct: she must reach l and r to close those sides.\n\nSo, the earlier plan stands: the minimal steps are the minimal between the two options (close left first or right first), considering the steps needed to move to l and r, plus the two close steps.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nIf there are no tabs to close (l=1 and r=n), return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate the steps needed for both orders (close left first, close right first), and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, are there any other scenarios?\n\nWhat if l == r? Then, she has to close all tabs except l, which is a single tab. So, she needs to close left and right of l.\n\nIn that case, she can:\n\nOption 1: close left, then close right.\n\nSteps: move to l (0 steps if already there?), close left (1), then move to l (again?), close right (1).\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if l = r, say l = r =3.\n\nShe needs to close all except 3.\n\nSo, she can:\n\n- Move to 3 (if not already there).\n\n- Close left (closes 1 and 2).\n\n- Close right (closes 4 and 5... up to n).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nMovement to l: |pos - l|.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMovement to r (same as l, so 0 steps).\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 2.\n\nAlternatively, she can:\n\nMovement to r: same as l.\n\nClose right first, then close left.\n\nSame steps.\n\nSo, same calculation.\n\nSo, in this case, the steps are |pos - l| + 2.\n\nAnother case: when l is 1 and r is something else.\n\nIn this case, she only needs to close the right side (tabs after r).\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nMove to r: |pos - r|.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| +1.\n\nBecause she doesn't need to close left since l is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if r is n, she only needs to close left.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\n- Determine whether left and/or right need to be closed.\n\nIf both need to be closed:\n\nCompute steps for both orders and choose the minimal.\n\nIf only left needs to be closed:\n\nSteps = steps to move to l and close.\n\nIf only right needs to be closed:\n\nSteps = steps to move to r and close.\n\nIf neither needs to be closed: 0.\n\nSo, now, how to code this.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_close: (l > 1)\n\nCompute right_close: (r < n)\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf only left_close is true:\n\nsteps = (distance from pos to l) + 1.\n\nIf only right_close is true:\n\nsteps = (distance from pos to r) +1.\n\nIf both:\n\noption1: close left then right.\n\nsteps1 = distance(pos, l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\noption2: close right then left.\n\nsteps2 = distance(pos, r) + 1 + (r - l) +1.\n\nmin(steps1, steps2).\n\nBut wait, wait.\n\nWait, in the case where both are needed, the movement after closing left is from l to r, which is r - l steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, movement is from r to l, which is r - l steps.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nSo, the code logic would be:\n\nif left_close and right_close:\n\n    d_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n    d_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n    steps1 = d_l + 1 + (r - l) + 1  # close left, then move to r, close right.\n\n    steps2 = d_r + 1 + (r - l) + 1  # close right, then move to l, close left.\n\n    total_steps = min(steps1, steps2)\n\nelif left_close:\n\n    total_steps = (abs(pos - l)) + 1\n\nelif right_close:\n\n    total_steps = (abs(pos - r)) +1\n\nelse:\n\n    total_steps =0\n\nBut wait, what if the initial pos is between l and r, and she can just close both sides without moving to either end.\n\nNo, that's not possible. Because to close left, she must be at l, and to close right, she must be at r.\n\nWait, no. Because if she is at a position x >= l, then she can close left. But that would only close tabs before x, but not necessarily up to l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when she is at x, closing left will close all tabs from a (current leftmost) to x-1. So, if she is at x = l, then a is 1, but l is the starting point. So, closing left at l will close all tabs less than l.\n\nSimilarly, if she is at x = m > l, closing left will close all tabs less than m, which includes l and below.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if she is at x > l, closing left would close more than needed.\n\nWait, that's a mistake.\n\nWait, this complicates things.\n\nWait, the initial understanding was incorrect.\n\nWhen she is at position x, closing left will close all tabs to the left of x. Which are the tabs [a, x-1], where a is the current leftmost.\n\nBut after some tabs are closed, a may change.\n\nWait, so the key is that when she is at position x, closing left will close all the currently open tabs to the left of x.\n\nSo, if she is at x, and she hasn't closed any tabs yet, a is 1 and b is n.\n\nSo, closing left at x will close x-1, x-2, ..., a.\n\nWhich is all tabs from 1 to x-1.\n\nSo, if she is at x = l, then closing left will close all tabs from 1 to l-1.\n\nWhich is exactly what is needed.\n\nBut if she is at x = l+1, closing left will also close l, which is part of the desired segment.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that's a big issue.\n\nSo, my initial approach is wrong because it assumes that she must be at l to close the left tabs.\n\nBut actually, she can close the left tabs from any position >= l, but doing so will close more than necessary.\n\nWhich is not allowed, because the problem requires that only tabs l to r remain.\n\nSo, the approach must ensure that when she closes left, she only closes tabs less than l.\n\nThus, she must be at l when she closes the left tabs.\n\nSimilarly, she must be at r when she closes the right tabs.\n\nOtherwise, she'll close some of the desired tabs along with the unnecessary ones.\n\nSo, that changes the problem.\n\nThus, the initial approach was correct.\n\nSo, she must move to l to close the left, and to r to close the right.\n\nSo, the steps are as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the code remains as outlined.\n\nBut let me test this with the example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4.\n\nShe needs to close 1 and 5,6.\n\nShe can move to 2, close left, then to 4, close right.\n\nSteps: 1 (move to 2) +1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) +1 (close right) =5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nTest case 2 in the sample:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nShe needs to close 4,5,6.\n\nShe can close right from 3.\n\nSo, movement: 0 steps (already at 3), close right:1 step.\n\nSo, total steps:1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThird test case:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nShe needs to close nothing. So, output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=7, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close 1,5,6,7.\n\nShe can:\n\nMove to 2: 1 step, close left:2.\n\nMove to 4: 2 steps, close right:3.\n\nTotal steps:5.\n\nAlternatively, move to 4 first: 1 step, close right:2.\n\nMove to 2: 2 steps, close left:3.\n\nSame steps.\n\nSo, the code correctly calculates 5.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\nShe needs to close 1,2,9,10.\n\nSteps:\n\nOption 1: close left first.\n\nMove to 3: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:3.\n\nMove to 8:5 steps.\n\nClose right:6.\n\nTotal steps:6.\n\nOption2: close right first.\n\nMove to 8:3 steps.\n\nClose right:4.\n\nMove to 3:5 steps.\n\nClose left:6.\n\nSame steps.\n\nSo, code returns 6.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way?\n\nNo, because she can't close right from any position less than 8, as that would leave 9-10 open.\n\nWait, yes. So, she must be at 8 to close right.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close 1,5.\n\nSteps:\n\nClose left: move to 2 (1 step), close left (2 steps).\n\nClose right: move to4 (2 steps), close right (3 steps).\n\nTotal steps: 5.\n\nAlternatively, close right first:\n\nMove to4 (1 step), close right (2 steps).\n\nMove to 2 (2 steps), close left (3 steps).\n\nSame steps.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: l=1, r=5, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close 6.\n\nSteps: move to5 (2 steps), close right (3 steps).\n\nTotal steps:3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: l=5, r=5, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close 1,2,3,4,6.\n\nSo, she must be at 5 to close left and right.\n\nSo:\n\nOption1: close left first.\n\nMove to5: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:3.\n\nMove to5 again (0 steps).\n\nClose right:4.\n\nTotal steps:4.\n\nOption2: close right first.\n\nSame steps.\n\nSo, code would calculate:\n\nd_l = 2.\n\nsteps1 = 2 +1 +0 +1 =4.\n\nsteps2= same.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, now, the plan is to implement this logic.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_close: l>1.\n\nCompute right_close: r <n.\n\nIf neither, print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf left_close and right_close:\n\nCompute d_l = abs(pos - l)\n\nd_r = abs(pos - r)\n\nsteps1 = d_l +1 + (r - l) +1.\n\nsteps2 = d_r +1 + (r - l) +1.\n\nmin_steps = min(steps1, steps2).\n\nelif left_close:\n\nsteps = (abs(pos - l)) +1.\n\nelif right_close:\n\nsteps = (abs(pos - r)) +1.\n\nprint(steps).\n\nBut wait, what if l==r?\n\nThen, the code treats it as both left and right are to be closed.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when pos is outside l or r.\n\nE.g., l=2, r=4, pos=1.\n\nThen, to close left, she needs to move to 2, close left.\n\nThen, move to 4, close right.\n\nSteps: 1 (move to 2) +1 (close left) +2 (move to4) +1 (close right) =5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when pos is exactly at l or r.\n\nE.g., pos=l.\n\nThen, steps for left close is 1, then steps to r is (r - l), etc.\n\nSo, the code should handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1, r=3, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close right, which is 4..n.\n\nSo, steps: 0 (at 3) +1 (close right) =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: l=1, r=5, pos=5.\n\nShe needs to close right:6..n.\n\nSteps: 0 +1 =1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead the input line, split into four integers.\n\nCompute left_close and right_close.\n\nThen, proceed as above.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_close = (l > 1)\n\nright_close = (r < n)\n\nif not left_close and not right_close:\n    print(0)\nelif left_close and right_close:\n    d_l = abs(pos - l)\n    d_r = abs(pos - r)\n    steps1 = d_l + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    steps2 = d_r + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    min_steps = min(steps1, steps2)\n    print(min_steps)\nelif left_close:\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    print(steps)\nelif right_close:\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the first case is:\n\n6 3 2 4.\n\nThe code computes:\n\nleft_close = True (2>1).\n\nright_close=True (4<6).\n\nd_l=1, d_r=1.\n\nsteps1: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nsteps2: same.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond test case:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nleft_close=False (1 is not >1).\n\nright_close=True (3<6).\n\nsteps: distance to r=3 is 0. So, 0+1=1.\n\nThird case:5 2 1 5.\n\nleft_close=False, right_close=False.\n\nSo, 0.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: l=5, r=5, pos=3.\n\nleft_close=True.\n\nright_close=True.\n\nd_l=2, d_r=2.\n\nsteps1: 2+1+0+1=4.\n\nsteps2: same.\n\nmin is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: l=1, r=5, pos=3.\n\nright_close=True.\n\nsteps: 2 +1=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within this segment open. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and actions to minimize the total time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are any tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Movements and Actions**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need to be closed, compute the time required for two scenarios: closing the left tabs first or the right tabs first, and choose the minimum time.\n   - If only left tabs need to be closed, calculate the time to move to `l` and close them.\n   - If only right tabs need to be closed, calculate the time to move to `r` and close them.\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., `l=1` and `r=n`), the answer is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_close = l > 1\nright_close = r < n\n\nif not left_close and not right_close:\n    print(0)\nelif left_close and right_close:\n    d_l = abs(pos - l)\n    d_r = abs(pos - r)\n    steps1 = d_l + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    steps2 = d_r + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    print(min(steps1, steps2))\nelif left_close:\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    print(steps)\nelif right_close:\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Tabs to Close**: We check if `l > 1` to determine if left tabs need closing and if `r < n` to check if right tabs need closing.\n- **Calculate Steps for Both Scenarios**: When both sides need closing, we consider moving to `l` first and then to `r`, or moving to `r` first and then to `l`. The minimum steps from these two scenarios are taken.\n- **Single Side Closing**: If only one side needs closing, we directly compute the steps to move to the required position and close the tabs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering all necessary movements and actions.",
