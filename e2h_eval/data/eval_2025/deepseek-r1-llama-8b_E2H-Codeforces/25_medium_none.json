При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine if a given string t could be the result of an error in a network where two identical messages were concatenated with an overlap. If it is possible, I also need to find one possible original message s.\n\nHmm, let's read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nSo, the error happens when two identical messages are sent one after another. Because of some issue, they might merge into one. The way they merge is by overlapping as many starting characters as possible. For example, sending 'a' and then 'a' would result in 'aa', but since the first 'a' can overlap with the second, the merged message could be just 'a' if they completely overlap. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that the length of the overlap has to be positive and less than the length of the message. So for a message of length n, the maximum possible overlap is n-1. But wait, in the example, 'abrakadabra' sent twice could become 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlap of 1) or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlap of 4).\n\nSo, given a string t, I need to check if it can be formed by such a merge of two identical messages. And if so, output one possible s, else output NO.\n\nHow can I approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how t can be split into two parts, each being s, but with an overlap between them. So, t must consist of s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping part.\n\nWait, no. Because the two messages are s, and due to the error, their concatenation overlaps as much as possible. So t is equal to s concatenated with s, but with the maximum possible overlap that's allowed.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the maximum possible overlap is such that the overlapping part is as large as possible, but it's a prefix of both s's. So for s of length L, the maximum possible k (the length of the overlap) is up to L-1, but the actual k used in the error can be any value between 1 and L-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, no. Because when two s's are concatenated, the resulting string is s + s. But in case of an error, the first s and the second s are overlapped by k characters. So the resulting t is s[0..k] followed by the remaining part of the second s, which starts from position k. So, t = s[0:k] + s[k:].\n\nWait, no. Because the entire first s is being overlapped with the start of the second s. So, the total length of t would be len(s) + len(s) - k, right? Because k characters are overlapping.\n\nSo, given t, I can try to find a possible k and s such that t can be written as s + s[0:k], but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as t = s + s', where s' is a suffix of s, but the way they are merged is that the end of the first s overlaps with the beginning of the second s by k characters. So, t is formed by taking s, and then appending the second s starting at position k. So, t = s + s[k:].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for some k between 1 and len(s)-1, the string t should be equal to s concatenated with s starting from the k-th character.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over possible values of k, which is the length of the overlap. k can range from 1 to len(t) // 2. Because if k is too big, the second part can't fit. Wait, not exactly. Let's think: the total length of t must be len(s)*2 -k. Since len(s)*2 -k = len(t), and len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2. So len(t) must be >=k+1, because len(s) has to be at least k+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible k (number of overlapping characters), we can check if t can be split into s followed by s shifted by k. So, for a given k, the string t should be equal to s + s[k:], where s is the same for both parts.\n\nWait, but k is the number of overlapping characters. So, for a given k, len(s) must be such that len(t) = len(s) * 2 - k.\n\nSo, for each possible k, where 1 <=k < len(s), and len(s) = (len(t) + k)/2. Since len(s) must be an integer, (len(t)+k) must be even, and len(s) must be (len(t)+k)/2.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose t has length m. Then, len(s) = (m +k)/2. So, for each possible k, m +k must be even, and (m +k)/2 must be greater than or equal to k+1 (since len(s) must be at least k+1). Wait, no—because s is a string of length len(s), and the overlap is k, which must be less than len(s). So, len(s) >k. So, len(s) = (m +k)/2 >k → m +k > 2k → m> k.\n\nBut m is the length of t, which is len(s)*2 -k. So, len(s) = (m +k)/2. So, for each possible k, we can compute len(s) and see if it's an integer and len(s) >k.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible k in 1 to (m-1)//2:\n\nWait, wait, no. Because k can be up to len(s)-1. But len(s) is (m +k)/2. So, for a given k, len(s) is (m +k)/2. So, len(s) must be greater than k → (m +k)/2 >k → m +k > 2k → m> k. So, m must be greater than k.\n\nSo, the possible values of k can be from 1 up to (m-1), but also, len(s) must be an integer, so (m +k) must be even.\n\nSo, for each possible k in 1 to (m//2), but only those k where (m +k) is even and len(s) = (m +k)/2 >k.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to go is to iterate all possible k from 1 to (m-1), and for each, check if (m +k) is even, and len(s) is (m +k)/2, which must be greater than k.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then we can extract s as the first len(s) characters, and check if t equals s + s[k:].\n\nWait, let me think. For example, in the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. The correct s is 'abrakadabra' of length 11. The overlap k is 1. So len(s) is 11, and len(t) is 22. So 22 = 11*2 -1 → yes.\n\nSo, for each k, let's compute len(s) as (m +k)/2. We need len(s) to be integer, so m +k must be even. Also, len(s) must be >k.\n\nOnce we have len(s), we can extract s as the first len(s) characters of t. Then, check whether the rest of t from position len(s) onwards matches s[k:]. If yes, then it's a valid s.\n\nWait, but what if len(s) is longer than the available part of t? No, because len(t) = len(s)*2 -k. So, the part after len(s) is s[k:], which has length len(s) -k. So, t's length is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo, for each possible k, we can:\n\n1. Check if (m +k) is even.\n2. Compute len_s = (m +k)/2.\n3. Check if len_s >k.\n4. Extract s_candidate as the first len_s characters of t.\n5. Check if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf all these are true, then s_candidate is a possible solution.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each k in 1 to (m-1):\n\n   if (m +k) is even:\n\n       len_s = (m +k)//2\n\n       if len_s >k:\n\n           s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n           if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n               return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf none of the k's work, return NO.\n\nSo, now, the question is: how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut given that the maximum m is 100, the loop will be manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' has length 21? Or wait, let's count.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first case is ['abrakadabrabrakadabra'].\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nAnd outputs are:\n\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nWait, for the first case, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'—what's its length?\n\nLet me count: a b r a k a d a b r a b r a b r a — wait, maybe I'm getting the exact count wrong, but in any case, the code will handle it.\n\nBut according to the sample, the correct s is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. So len(t) is 11*2 -1 =21. So for k=1, len_s is (21+1)/2=11, which is correct.\n\nSo, in the code, for k=1, len_s is 11. s_candidate is t[:11]. Then, t[11:] is the next part, which should be equal to s_candidate[1:]. So, the code would find this case.\n\nAnother example: 'acacacaca'—output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nt is 'acacacaca'—let's see.\n\nLength is 9.\n\nLooking for k where (9 +k) is even.\n\nPossible k's: 1,3,5,7.\n\nFor k=3:\n\nlen_s=(9+3)/2=6. len_s>k (6>3 yes).\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck t[6:] is 'ca', and s_candidate[3:] is 'ca'—so yes.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nAnother example: 'abcabc'—output is 'NO'.\n\nBecause len(t) is 6.\n\nTrying all possible k's:\n\nk can be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nCheck for each:\n\nk=1: len_s=(6+1)/2=3.5 → not integer. So no.\n\nk=2: (6+2)=8 → len_s=4. len_s>k (4>2 yes).\n\ns_candidate is 'abcd'? Wait, no, wait t is 'abcabc'.\n\nt[:4] is 'abca'.\n\nThen, t[4:] is 'bc'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'ca'.\n\nSo 'bc' vs 'ca'—no match.\n\nk=3: (6+3)=9 → len_s=4.5 → no.\n\nk=4: 6+4=10 → len_s=5. 5>4 yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'abcab'.\n\nt[5:] is 'c'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'b' → 'c' vs 'b' → no.\n\nk=5: 6+5=11 → len_s=5.5 → no.\n\nSo none of the k's work. So output is 'NO'.\n\nAnother example: 'abababab' → output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nt's length is 8.\n\nWe need to find k where (8 +k) is even.\n\nPossible k's: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nk=2:\n\nlen_s=(8+2)/2=5. 5>2.\n\ns_candidate is t[:5] → 'ababa'.\n\nt[5:] is 'bab'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'ba' → 'bab' vs 'ba' → no.\n\nk=4:\n\nlen_s=(8+4)/2=6. 6>4.\n\ns_candidate is t[:6] → 'ababab'.\n\nt[6:] is 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'bab'.\n\nSo 'ab' vs 'bab' → no.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, for k=4, len_s=6.\n\nt[6:] is 'ab' (positions 6 and 7 of t, since it's 0-based?), but depends on how the slicing is done.\n\nWait, in Python, t[a:b] includes a up to but not including b.\n\nSo, for t = 'abababab' (length 8), t[:6] is 'ababab', t[6:] is 'ab' (indices 6 and 7).\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'abab'[4:] → 'ab'.\n\nSo t[6:] is 'ab' and s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → they match. So, yes.\n\nSo, in the code, for k=4, len_s=6, t[6:] is 'ab' which equals s_candidate[4:].\n\nSo the code would find this and return 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nAnother example: 'tatbt' → output is 'NO'.\n\nt's length is 5.\n\nCheck for k from 1 to 4.\n\nFor k=1: len_s=(5+1)/2=3 → 3>1.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nt[3:] is 'bt'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'at'.\n\nNo match.\n\nk=2: (5+2)/2=3.5 → no.\n\nk=3: (5+3)/2=4 → 4>3.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatb'.\n\nt[4:] is 't'.\n\ns_candidate[3:] is 'b' → 't' vs 'b' → no.\n\nk=4: (5+4)/2=4.5 → no.\n\nSo no possible k, so output 'NO'.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where t is exactly s + s, but without any overlap. Like 'abababab' is s='ababab' and no overlap. Wait, no, that's when k=0, but our code doesn't consider k=0 because the error requires that the overlap is at least 1.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the error is when two identical messages are sent one after another, and they are merged by overlapping. So, the minimum overlap is 1 character.\n\nSo, if the two messages are sent and there's no overlap, like sending 'ab' and then 'cd' (but same messages, so 'ab' and 'ab'), then the result is 'abab' with no overlap. But according to the note in the problem, a situation where one message is entirely appended to another (like 'abcd' is 'abcabc') is considered not an error. So, the code shouldn't consider k=0.\n\nSo, for t = 'aaaaaa' (length 6), possible k's are 1, 2, 3, 4,5.\n\nFor k=1: len_s=(6+1)/2=3.5 → no.\n\nk=2: (6+2)/2=4. 4>2.\n\ns_candidate is 'aaaa'.\n\nt[4:] is 'aa'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'aaa'.\n\nWait, t[4:] is the substring from index 4 to end, which is 'aa'. s_candidate[2:] is 'aaa' (since s_candidate is 'aaaa', s_candidate[2:] is 'aaa'). So 'aa' != 'aaa' → no.\n\nk=3: (6+3)/2=4.5 → no.\n\nk=4: (6+4)/2=5. 5>4.\n\ns_candidate is 'aaaaa'.\n\nt[5:] is 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'a' → matches.\n\nSo, s_candidate is 'aaaaa', t is 'aaaaa' + 'a' → but wait, no, because len(t) is 6, which is len(s)*2 -k → 5*2 -4=6. Yes.\n\nSo, the code would find that for k=4, s_candidate is 'aaaaa', and t is s_candidate + 'a' → which is 'aaaaa'+'a' → 'aaaaaa' → so it's valid.\n\nSo the code would return 'YES' and 'aaaaa'.\n\nWait, but what about when t is 'aabbaabb'? Let's see.\n\nt is 'aabbaabb' → len=8.\n\nCheck for possible k:\n\nk=1: len_s=(8+1)/2=4.5 → no.\n\nk=2: (8+2)/2=5. 5>2.\n\ns_candidate is 'aabba'.\n\nt[5:] is 'abb'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'bba' → 'abb' vs 'bba' → no.\n\nk=3: (8+3)/2=5.5 → no.\n\nk=4: (8+4)/2=6. 6>4.\n\ns_candidate is 'aabbaa'.\n\nt[6:] is 'bb'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'aa' → no.\n\nk=5: (8+5)/2=6.5 → no.\n\nk=6: (8+6)/2=7. 7>6.\n\ns_candidate is 'aabbaab'.\n\nt[7:] is 'b'.\n\ns_candidate[6:] is 'b' → yes.\n\nSo t is 'aabbaab' + 'b' → which is 'aabbaabbb' → no, wait, no, t is 'aabbaabb' → len(t) is 8.\n\nWait, len_s is 7, so s_candidate is 'aabbaab', which is 7 letters. t[7:] is 'b'.\n\ns_candidate[6:] is 'b' → yes.\n\nSo t is s_candidate + 'b' → 'aabbaab' + 'b' = 'aabbaabb' → yes.\n\nSo the code would return 'YES' and 'aabbaab'.\n\nWait, but the t is 'aabbaabb', which is s_candidate (aabbaab) plus 'b' → but in reality, the code would find that.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop through possible k from 1 to len(t)-1.\n\nFor each k:\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is even:\n\n       len_s = (len(t) +k)//2\n\n       if len_s >k:\n\n           s_candidate = t[ : len_s]\n\n           if t[ len_s : ] == s_candidate[ k : ]:\n\n               return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf none found, return NO.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, read the input string.\n\nThen, for each possible k in 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   if (len(t) +k) %2 ==0:\n\n       len_s = (len(t) +k)//2\n\n       if len_s >k:\n\n           s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n           if t[len_s: ] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n               print(\"YES\")\n\n               print(s_candidate)\n\n               exit\n\nAfter checking all k's, if none found, print \"NO\".\n\nWait, but wait: for k in 1 to len(t)-1, but len(t) can be up to 100, so the loop is manageable.\n\nNow, test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\nlen(t) = 21.\n\nCheck for k=1:\n\n(len(t) +k) =22 → even.\n\nlen_s=11.\n\ns_candidate = t[:11] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nt[11:] is 'brakadabra'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'.\n\nSo, 'brakadabra' == 'brakadabra' → yes.\n\nSo, returns 'YES' and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → len=9.\n\nCheck k=3:\n\n(9+3)=12 → even.\n\nlen_s=6.\n\ns_candidate = 'acacaca'.\n\nt[6:] is 'ca'.\n\ns_candidate[3:] is 'aca' → 'ca' vs 'aca' → no.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's see:\n\nt is 'acacacaca' → indexes 0-8.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'acacac'.\n\nt[6:] is 'aca'.\n\ns_candidate[3:] is 'cac' → 'aca' vs 'cac' → no.\n\nWait, but the sample expects 'acaca' as a possible s.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in k selection.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is 'acaca', which is length 5.\n\nSo len(t) is 9.\n\nSo for k=4:\n\nlen_s = (9+4)/2=6.5 → no.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up.\n\nWait, maybe the correct k is 4.\n\nWait, len_s = (9 +4)/2=6.5 → not integer.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try k=2.\n\nlen_s=(9+2)/2=5.5 → no.\n\nWait, maybe k=4 is not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the sample output says 'acacaca' is a possible s.\n\nWait, but the sample input is 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters.\n\nSo, len_s would be (9 +k)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps for k=3, len_s=6. So s_candidate is 'acacac'.\n\nt[6:] is 'aca'.\n\ns_candidate[3:] is 'cac' → 'aca' vs 'cac' → no.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the correct s is 'acaca' which is 5 letters.\n\nSo len(t) is 9.\n\nSo len_s = (9 +k)/2.\n\nIf len_s is 5, then 5 = (9 +k)/2 → 9 +k=10 → k=1.\n\nSo, for k=1:\n\nlen_s=(9+1)/2=5.\n\n5>1 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nt[5:] is 'caca'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'caca' → 'caca' == 'caca' → yes.\n\nSo, the code would find this.\n\nSo, in the code, for k=1, it's valid.\n\nAh! So I overlooked that.\n\nSo, the code would find for k=1, which gives len_s=5, and s_candidate is 'acaca', and t[5:] is 'caca', which matches s_candidate[1:].\n\nSo the code would return 'acaca' as the possible s.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nSo, the plan is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: t is 'a', which can't be formed by merging two s's because the minimal length for t is 2 (when s is 'a' and k=1, t is 'a'+'a' minus 1 → 'aa', but len(t) is 2, so 'aa' is the result. So for t='a', it's impossible.\n\nAnother edge case: t is 'aa'.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nlen_s=(2+1)/2=1.5 → no.\n\nSo, no solution.\n\nSo code returns 'NO'.\n\nBut wait, wait, for k=1, len(t) is 2. len_s=(2+1)/2=1.5 → not integer. So no.\n\nWhat about t is 'aaaa'?\n\nPossible k=1:\n\nlen_s=(4+1)/2=2.5 → no.\n\nk=2:\n\nlen_s=(4+2)/2=3. 3>2.\n\ns_candidate is 'aaa'.\n\nt[3:] is 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'a' → yes.\n\nSo, s_candidate is 'aaa'.\n\nSo t is 'aaa' + 'a' → 'aaaa' → yes.\n\nSo code returns 'YES\\naaa'.\n\nSo, the code handles this.\n\nAnother case: t is 'abab'.\n\nPossible k=2:\n\nlen_s=(4+2)/2=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'aba'.\n\nt[3:] is 'b'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'a' → 'b' vs 'a' → no.\n\nk=1:\n\nlen_s=(4+1)/2=2.5 → no.\n\nk=3:\n\nlen_s=(4+3)/2=3.5 → no.\n\nk=4: not applicable since len(t) is 4, k must be less than len_s, which for k=4, len_s=(4+4)/2=4, which is equal to k, but len_s must be larger than k.\n\nSo, len_s=4, k=4 → len_s not larger than k.\n\nSo, no solution. So code returns 'NO'.\n\nWait, but what about 'abab' can be formed by s='ab' and k=1.\n\nSo, s is 'ab' and the other s starts from position 1.\n\nSo, s + s[1:] is 'ab' + 'b' = 'abb' → no, that's not 'abab'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, no, because for k=1, len_s= (4+1)/2=2.5 → no.\n\nSo, no solution.\n\nThus, code returns 'NO'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, to implement this.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead t.\n\nCompute m = len(t).\n\nIf m <2 → cannot form, output 'NO'.\n\nElse:\n\n   for k in 1 to m-1:\n\n       if (m +k) is even:\n\n           len_s = (m +k)//2\n\n           if len_s >k:\n\n               s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n               if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                   print 'YES' and s_candidate.\n\n                   exit.\n\n   After all k's:\n\n       print 'NO'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nm = len(t)\n\nif m <2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for k in range(1, m):\n\n        if (m +k) %2 ==0:\n\n            len_s = (m +k)//2\n\n            if len_s >k:\n\n                s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n                if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n                    print(s_candidate)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the 'range' function is exclusive on the upper bound. So, for k in 1 to m-1, inclusive, the code is:\n\nfor k in range(1, m):\n\nBecause in Python, range(1, m) gives 1,2,...,m-1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', ...]\n\nFor k=1, len_s= (21+1)/2=11. 11>1.\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nt[11:] is 'brakadabra'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra' → yes.\n\nSo, code outputs 'YES' and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n['acacacaca', ...]\n\nFor k=1, len_s=(9+1)/2=5. 5>1.\n\ns_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nt[5:] is 'caca'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'caca' → yes.\n\nSo, code outputs 'YES' and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → len=6.\n\nk=2: (6+2)/2=4. 4>2.\n\ns_candidate is 'abca'.\n\nt[4:] is 'bc'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'ca' → 'bc' != 'ca' → no.\n\nOther k's don't work.\n\nSo, code returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abababab' → len=8.\n\nk=4: (8+4)/2=6. 6>4.\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\nt[6:] is 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'bab' → 'ab' vs 'bab' → no.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis said that for k=4, len_s=6.\n\nWait, s_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\nt[6:] is 'ab'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'abab'[4:] → 'ab'.\n\nSo, 'ab' == 'ab' → yes.\n\nSo, code should find this.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nt = 'abababab' → len=8.\n\nk=4:\n\n(m +k)=12 → even.\n\nlen_s=6.\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\nt[6:] is 'ab' → positions 6 and 7.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'abab'[4:] → 'ab'.\n\nSo, 'ab' == 'ab' → yes.\n\nSo, code returns 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could be the result of an error in a network where two identical messages were concatenated with an overlap. If it is possible, we also need to find one possible original message `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and merge due to an overlap. The overlap must be at least 1 character and less than the length of the message. Given a string `t`, we need to check if it can be split into two parts that form such a merged message.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible overlap length `k`, we can check if `t` can be split into two substrings `s` and `s[k:]`. The length of `t` must be equal to the combined length of `s` and `s[k:]`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible values of `k` from 1 to `len(t) - 1`.\n   - For each `k`, check if `(len(t) + k)` is even, ensuring that the length of `s` (denoted as `len_s`) is an integer.\n   - Compute `len_s` as `(len(t) + k) // 2` and ensure it is greater than `k`.\n   - Extract the candidate message `s_candidate` as the first `len_s` characters of `t`.\n   - Check if the remaining part of `t` matches the substring of `s_candidate` starting from index `k`.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: The approach efficiently checks all possible overlaps within the constraints, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nm = len(t)\nif m < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for k in range(1, m):\n        if (m + k) % 2 == 0:\n            len_s = (m + k) // 2\n            if len_s > k:\n                s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n                if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    print(s_candidate)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `m` is determined.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If `t` is too short (less than 2 characters), it cannot be formed by merging two messages, so we immediately return \"NO\".\n- **Iterating Over Possible Overlaps**: For each possible overlap length `k`, we check if the total length of `t` plus `k` is even, ensuring `s` has an integer length.\n- **Extracting Candidate Message**: We compute the potential original message `s_candidate` and verify if the rest of `t` matches the required overlap.\n- **Output Result**: If a valid overlap is found, we print \"YES\" and the candidate message. If no valid overlap is found after all checks, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine if `t` can be the result of an error in the described manner, providing the correct output for all edge cases and valid inputs.",
