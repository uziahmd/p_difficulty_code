The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using the given keys, with each key used at most once per chest.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, I need to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly for the keys.\n\nBecause each key can unlock either even or odd chests, depending on its parity.\n\nWait, no. Wait: For a key j, if b_j is even, then it can only unlock chests with a_i being odd. Because even + odd = odd. Similarly, if b_j is odd, it can unlock even a_i chests.\n\nSo, the total number of usable chests for each key depends on the key's parity.\n\nSo, the strategy would be:\n\n- Separate the keys into two groups: even and odd.\n- Similarly, separate the chests into even and odd.\n- For each group of keys, match them with the corresponding chests to maximize the usage.\n\nBut since each key can be used once, and each chest once, it's a matter of matching as many as possible.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nnum_odd_chests = the count of a_i where a_i is odd.\nnum_even_chests = n - num_odd_chests.\n\nSimilarly, num_odd_keys = count of b_j where b_j is odd.\nnum_even_keys = m - num_odd_keys.\n\nNow, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between the available keys of each parity and the available chests of the opposite parity.\n\nWait, yes! Because:\n\n- Even keys can be used to open odd chests.\nSo, the number of such chests is min(num_odd_chests, num_even_keys).\n\n- Odd keys can be used to open even chests.\nSo, the number of such chests is min(num_even_chests, num_odd_keys).\n\nAdding these two gives the total maximum chests.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → which are 3 odds (9, 6? Wait wait, 9 is odd, 14 is even, 6 is even, 2 even, 11 is odd. So a_i: 9,14,6,2,11 → 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So the counts are:\n\nnum_odd_chests = 2 (9 and 11)\nnum_even_chests = 3.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]. So, 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So:\n\nnum_odd_keys = 1 (7)\nnum_even_keys = 3.\n\nSo, even keys can unlock odd chests: min(2,3) =2.\n\nOdd keys can unlock even chests: min(3,1)=1.\n\nTotal 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: n=5, m=1.\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. So num_odd_chests=0, even_chest=5.\n\nb is [5], which is odd.\n\nSo, even_chest is 5, but since the key is odd, it can only unlock even chests. So min(5,1)=1.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4.\n\na is [10], which is even.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even.\n\nSo, for even key, you can unlock even chests. But a_i is even, so a_i + b_j would be even + even = even, which is not odd. So no chests can be opened. Hence output 0.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n\n3. Compute the sum of min(even_keys, odd_chests) + min(odd_keys, even_chests).\n\nWait, no. Because the min functions are swapped.\n\nWait, the even keys can unlock odd chests, so the number of possible uses is the minimum of even_keys and odd_chests.\n\nSimilarly, odd keys can unlock even_chests: min(odd_keys, even_chests).\n\nSo the total is the sum of those two.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute:\n\ncount_a_odd = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 1)\ncount_a_even = n - count_a_odd\n\ncount_b_odd = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 1)\ncount_b_even = m - count_b_odd\n\nmax_c = min(count_b_even, count_a_odd) + min(count_b_odd, count_a_even)\n\nThen, print max_c.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? Let me think again.\n\nWait, for example, when a key is even, it can unlock any odd a_i.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is the min of the even keys and the odd a_i.\n\nSimilarly, the odd keys can unlock even a_i, so min of odd keys and even a_i.\n\nSo, the sum is correct.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are more keys than chests? Like, if I have 100 even keys, but only 50 odd chests. Then, I can use 50 keys to unlock 50 chests, leaving 50 keys unused.\n\nWhich is fine.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a array.\n\nRead b array.\n\nCompute count_a_odd and count_a_even.\n\nCompute count_b_odd and count_b_even.\n\nCompute the sum as above.\n\nOutput the sum.\n\nThat's it.\n\nSo, now, let's test this logic against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na has 2 odds, 3 evens.\n\nb has 1 odd, 3 evens.\n\nsum = min(3,2) + min(1,3) = 2 +1=3.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na has 0 odds, 5 evens.\n\nb has 1 odd.\n\nsum = min(1, 0) + min(1,5) → 0 +1=1.\n\nSample3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na has 0 odds, 1 even.\n\nb has 0 odds,4 evens.\n\nsum is min(4,0) + min(0,1) → 0+0=0.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,3,5] → 3 odds.\n\nb: [2,4,6] → 3 evens.\n\nsum: min(3,3) + min(0,0) →3+0=3.\n\nSo all 3 chests can be unlocked.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\na: [1,2].\n\ncount_a_odd=1, even=1.\n\nb: [3,4].\n\ncount_b_odd=1, even=1.\n\nsum: min(1,1) + min(1,1) →1+1=2.\n\nYes, both chests can be unlocked.\n\nAnother case where some keys are unused.\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\na has 2 odds, 1 even.\n\nb has 3 odds, 2 evens.\n\nsum is min(2, 2) + min(3,1) →2 +1=3.\n\nSo 3 chests unlocked.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in terms of handling the input, in Python, we can read the lines, split into integers.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input was given as a single string for each line, but in the code, it's standard to read via input().split().\n\nWait, the user presented the input as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nBut in reality, the actual input would be from stdin, like:\n\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nRead b as list of integers.\n\nProceed.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_a_odd = sum(1 for x in a if x %2 !=0)\n\ncount_a_even = len(a) - count_a_odd\n\ncount_b_odd = sum(1 for x in b if x%2 !=0)\n\ncount_b_even = len(b) - count_b_odd\n\nmax_c = min(count_b_even, count_a_odd) + min(count_b_odd, count_a_even)\n\nprint(max_c)\n\nWait, but in Python, the input may have multiple lines, but the code expects two lines for a and b.\n\nWait, the second line is the a array, third is the b array.\n\nSo, the code should read n and m from the first line.\n\nThen read the next line as a.\n\nThen read the next line as b.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute as before.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when the number of elements in a is not n, or same for b? Well, according to the problem statement, the second line has exactly n integers, third has m.\n\nSo the code can assume that.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na has 2 odds (9,11), 3 evens (14,6,2).\n\nb has 1 odd (7), 3 evens (8,4,20).\n\nSo, min(3,2) is 2, min(1,3) is 1. Sum 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\na has 0 odds, 5 evens.\n\nb has 1 odd.\n\nSo, min(1,0) is 0, min(1,5) is 1. Sum 1.\n\nSample 3:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\na has 0 odds, 1 even.\n\nb has 0 odds, 4 evens.\n\nSo, min(4,0) is 0, min(0,1) is 0. Sum 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case where a has more even keys than needed.\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\na: [1,3,5] →3 odds.\n\nb: [2,4,6,8,10] →5 evens.\n\ncount_b_even is 5, count_a_odd is 3.\n\nmin(5,3)=3.\n\ncount_b_odd is 0, count_a_even is 0 → 0.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nSo, 3 chests unlocked.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where a has 1 even and 2 odds, b has 2 evens and 3 odds.\n\ncount_b_even=2, count_a_odd=2 → min 2.\n\ncount_b_odd=3, count_a_even=1 → min 1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSo, 3 chests.\n\nI think the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nSo, the code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be opened using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have opposite parities (one even and one odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each key can unlock a chest if the sum of the key number and the chest number is odd. This means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n2. **Count Parities**: We need to count how many chests have odd and even numbers. Similarly, count how many keys have odd and even numbers.\n3. **Match Keys to Chests**: \n   - Even keys can unlock odd-numbered chests.\n   - Odd keys can unlock even-numbered chests.\n4. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum values from the possible matches between even/odd keys and odd/even chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount_a_odd = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 != 0)\ncount_a_even = n - count_a_odd\n\ncount_b_odd = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 != 0)\ncount_b_even = m - count_b_odd\n\nmax_c = min(count_b_even, count_a_odd) + min(count_b_odd, count_a_even)\nprint(max_c)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the lists of chest numbers `a` and key numbers `b`.\n2. **Counting Parities**: It counts how many chests have odd and even numbers, and similarly counts the keys.\n3. **Matching Keys to Chests**: It calculates the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by using even keys on odd chests and odd keys on even chests.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the maximum possible chests that can be unlocked using the keys.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys by leveraging parity checks and simple arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
