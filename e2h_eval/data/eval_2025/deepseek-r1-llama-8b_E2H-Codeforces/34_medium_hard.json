And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. \n\nHmm, let me break down what's given. We have n days of sleep data and k consecutive days make up a week. So, the number of weeks we need to consider is n - k + 1. For each week (which is a consecutive k days), we calculate the sum of sleep hours, then find the average over all these weeks.\n\nWait, right. So for example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3. Each week contributes its sum, then divide by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the list of a_i's.\n3. For every possible window of size k in the list, compute the sum.\n4. Sum all those sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n5. Output the result with sufficient precision.\n\nNow, the constraints are important here. Oh wait, n can be up to 2e5. So we need an efficient way to compute the sums. If we do it naively, for each window we'd add k elements, which would be O(nk) time. But 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nWhat's the efficient way to compute sliding window sums? Oh right, the prefix sum method. Compute the prefix sum array, then for each window starting at i, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. This way, each window sum can be computed in O(1) time after the prefix sum is built.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So first, build the prefix sum array. Then iterate through each possible window, compute the sum using the prefix array, accumulate the total, and then compute the average.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and k from input. Then read the list of a_i's.\n\nCompute the prefix sum. Let's say prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a_0, prefix[2] = a_0 + a_1, etc. Or wait, perhaps it's better to index starting from 0. Hmm, maybe the standard way is to have prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum of all a_i's. Then for a window starting at index i (0-based) and of length k, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nYes, that sounds correct.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n- Read n, k.\n- Read the list a as integers.\n- Compute the prefix sum array. Initialize prefix[0] = 0, then for i from 0 to n-1, prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i].\n- Then, for each window starting at i (from 0 to n-k), compute the sum as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n- Accumulate all these sums into a total.\n- Finally, the average is total / (n - k + 1).\n\nWait, but wait. How many windows are there? It's (n - k + 1). Because starting from day 0 to day (n-k), inclusive.\n\nYes, right.\n\nOnce we have the total sum, dividing by the number of weeks gives us the average.\n\nNow, handling the output. The output should be a real number with at least 6 decimal digits. So, for example, if the average is 9, we print 9.0000000000. Similarly, if it's something like 10.12345678, we need to print 10.1234567800 or similar, ensuring that at least six decimal places are shown.\n\nIn Python, to format a float with exactly 10 decimal places, we can use string formatting like \"%.10f\". But wait, sometimes floating point numbers might have issues with precision. Alternatively, perhaps using division with high precision could be better, but for this problem, using floating point arithmetic should suffice as long as we format it correctly.\n\nBut wait, what if the division is not exact? For example, in the third test case in the example, the sum is 28964.2857142857... So when we divide by 7, it's approximately that.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCompute the sum of all the window sums, then average = sum_total / (n_weeks).\n\nThen, print the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So printing 10 decimal digits should be sufficient.\n\nSo in Python, how to handle this? Using the format string '%.10f' may round the number. Alternatively, perhaps using string formatting with .10f will give enough digits.\n\nWait, the sample outputs show varying decimal points. For example, in the third sample, the output is '28964.2857142857'. That's 10 digits after the decimal? Wait, let me count: 28964.2857142857 has 10 digits after the decimal. 2857142857 is 10 digits.\n\nSo perhaps we need to output exactly 10 digits after the decimal.\n\nBut in some cases, the number may have trailing zeros beyond the 10th digit. For example, 9.0000000000.\n\nSo in code, after computing the average, we can format it with 10 decimal places.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nsum_total = 0\n\nfor i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n\n    sum_window = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\n    sum_total += sum_window\n\naverage = sum_total / (n - k + 1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe windows are [3,4] sum 7, [4,7] sum 11. Total sum 18. Average 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOnly one window, sum 10. Average 10. So output is 10.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nNumber of weeks is 8-2+1=7.\n\nCompute the sums for each window:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSumming all these: 3 +6=9; 9+100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201,960; +790=202,750.\n\nWait, no: Wait, the seven windows are:\n\nIndices 0-1: 1+2=3\n\n1-2: 2+4=6\n\n2-3:4+100000=100004\n\n3-4:100000+123=100123\n\n4-5:123+456=579\n\n5-6:456+789=1245\n\n6-7:789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6=9, plus 100004 is 100013, plus 100123 is 200136, plus 579 is 200715, plus 1245 is 201960, plus 790 is 202,750.\n\nWait, 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201,960, +790=202,750.\n\nSo 202750 divided by 7 is 28964.2857142857... So the output is 28964.2857142857 with 10 digits after decimal.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable.\n\nComputing the prefix sum is O(n), which is acceptable. Then, looping through all (n -k +1) windows is O(n), which is also acceptable.\n\nPotential issues: dealing with large numbers, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when k equals n, there's only one window, so the sum is the sum of all elements.\n\nWait, yes. For example, if k = n, then the number of windows is 1, so the sum is the total sum, average is same as the total sum.\n\nSo, code-wise, it's handled automatically.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: n=k=1. Only one element. Sum is that element, average is same.\n\nEdge Case 2: All a_i are 0. The average is 0.\n\nEdge Case 3: a_i are very large, but in Python, that's fine.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=0? No, because k is at least 1 per the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back: the constraints say 1 ≤ k ≤ n. So no, k is at least 1.\n\nSo, now, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nRead n and k from input. Wait, the input comes as a single line for each test case, but in the problem statement, the sample inputs are given as separate lines. But in reality, the input is read as two lines: the first line contains n and k, the second line contains the list of a_i's.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and k.\n\nRead the second line, split into a list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the sum of each window, accumulate, then average.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input can be done via input().split().\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nsum_total = 0\nnum_weeks = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(num_weeks):\n    sum_window = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    sum_total += sum_window\n\naverage = sum_total / num_weeks\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait: what if the average is something like 9.0, which needs to be printed as 9.0000000000. The format string does that.\n\nYes, because when you format with .10f, it pads with zeros as necessary.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 2\\n3 4 7\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\nprefix is [0, 3,7,14]\n\nsum for i=0: 3+4=7.\n\ni=1: 4+7=11.\n\nsum_total = 18.\n\naverage=18/(3-2+1)=9.\n\nOutput is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=1, k=1.\n\nprefix is [0,10].\n\nsum is 10, average 10. Output is 10.0000000000.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the sum is 202750, average is 202750/7 ≈ 28964.28571428571428...\n\nWhich when formatted to 10 decimal places becomes 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute 202750 /7.\n\n202750 ÷7: 7 × 28964 = 202748 → 202750-202748=2. So 28964 + 2/7 → 0.2857142857142857....\n\nSo 28964.2857142857142857...\n\nWhen we format to 10 decimal places, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when k=3 and n=5.\n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nWindows:\n\n1+2+3=6\n\n2+3+4=9\n\n3+4+5=12\n\nSum is 6+9+12=27. Average 9.0.\n\nSo output is 9.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, k=1.\n\nEach window is a single element. So the sum is sum(a) /5.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo, the code looks correct.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly. What if the input has leading or trailing spaces? The split function handles that.\n\nWhat about zero? Well, the problem states that a_i can be 1 or more, but perhaps in other problems, they can be zero. But in this case, it's allowed as per the input description.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such windows within the given sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, we read the input values which include the number of days (n), the length of each week (k), and the sequence of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We construct a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any window of size k.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each possible window of size k. Each window's sum is calculated in constant time by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the window from the prefix sum at the end of the window.\n4. **Total and Average Calculation**: We accumulate the sums of all windows and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we format the average to ensure it is printed with exactly 10 decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nsum_total = 0\nnum_weeks = n - k + 1\n\nfor i in range(num_weeks):\n    sum_window = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    sum_total += sum_window\n\naverage = sum_total / num_weeks\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers and lists for processing.\n- **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray. `prefix[i]` gives the sum of the first `i` elements of the input list.\n- **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible window of size k, we use the prefix sum array to compute the sum in constant time, ensuring the solution is efficient even for large inputs.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then formatted to ensure precision up to 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle the problem efficiently within the constraints, providing an optimal solution for both time and space complexity.",
