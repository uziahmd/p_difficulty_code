The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2 each, and these are independent events.\n\nAfter building the towers, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\nThe goal is to compute the probability that this is possible, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So for each subset of built towers, we need to check if there's an assignment of powers that satisfies the conditions.\n\nLet me think about what the valid configurations look like.\n\nEach tower's power p_i determines which towns it covers: all towns c where |c - i| < p_i. So the coverage is (i - (p_i-1), i + (p_i-1)), but not including i - (p_i-1) and i + (p_i-1). Wait, actually, |c - i| < p_i means c can be from i-p_i+1 to i+p_i-1, inclusive. So the covered range is [i - p_i +1, i + p_i -1].\n\nBut since towns 0 and n+1 must not receive any signals, the ranges can't extend beyond them.\n\nSo for each valid configuration, the towers' ranges must tile the towns 1 to n without overlapping, and without touching 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, right. Because each town must be covered exactly once, the union of their ranges must cover exactly the towns 1..n, and the ranges can't include 0 or n+1.\n\nThis sounds a lot like tiling the line segment from 1 to n with intervals of certain lengths, such that each interval is assigned by a tower, and the intervals don't overlap and exactly cover 1..n.\n\nMoreover, the intervals must be centered at the positions of the towers, with their radius determined by the power.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to model this: the coverage intervals are determined by the towers and their powers. The coverage must form a partition of 1..n into non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a tower.\n\nSo for the entire set of towers S (subset of {1,2,...,n}), the required condition is that the intervals they cover form a partition of 1..n, and their ranges do not include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo how can we model the valid subsets S?\n\nI think the key is to find the number of valid subsets S for which the towers can be arranged in such a way that their coverage intervals form a partition of 1..n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S where S is a collection of points such that when each point i has a certain power p_i, the intervals [i - (p_i-1), i + (p_i-1)] exactly cover 1..n without overlapping and without including 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but for each subset S, the choice of p_i's must satisfy this. So for a given S, how can we determine whether it's possible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as the towers forming a certain structure. For example, perhaps S must be a set of non-overlapping points such that when you assign p_i = some value, their coverage intervals exactly fit.\n\nWait, maybe this is similar to the concept of a \"domino tiling\" or something else in combinatorics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement must form a specific kind of independent intervals. For instance, each interval is as large as possible, or follows certain rules.\n\nWait, let's consider small examples.\n\nTake n=2. The possible subsets S are:\n\n- Empty: impossible, because no coverage for 1 and 2.\n- {1}: Assign p=2. Coverage is [1-1+1, 1+1-1] = [1,1], so only town 1 is covered. But town 2 is not covered. So invalid.\n- {2}: Assign p=2. Coverage is [2-1+1=2, 2+1-1=2]. Only town 2 is covered. Town 1 is not. Invalid.\n- {1,2}: Assign p=1 each. Coverage for 1 is [1,1], for 2 is [2,2]. So 1 and 2 are covered. Also, 0 and 3 are not covered. So this is valid.\n\nSo the probability is the number of subsets S where the above condition is met, divided by 2^n.\n\nIn this case, for n=2, the valid subsets are only {1,2}. So probability is 1/4.\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nPossible valid configurations:\n\n1. All three towers present. Assign p=1 each. Then each covers only their own town. So 1,2,3 are covered. Valid.\n2. Only tower 2 is present. Assign p=2. Coverage is [1,3]. But then town 1 is covered, 2,3. But wait, 0 is not covered, 4 is also not covered (since n+1 is 4 for n=3). So yes. This is valid.\n3. Any other subset? Like {1,3}: If we assign p=1 for both, coverage is 1 and 3, but town 2 is uncovered. So no. Or assign p=2 for 1: coverage [1-1+1=1, 1+1-1=1], which is only 1. Similarly for 3. So no coverage for 2. Not valid.\n\nOr {1,2}: Assign p=1 and p=2. Then 1's coverage is just 1, 2's coverage is 1-2+1=0 to 2+2-1=3. Wait, but 0 is included, which is invalid. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no, because the coverage for 2 with p=2 would be |c - 2| < 2, meaning c is between 1 and 3. So coverage is towns 1,2,3. But 0 is not in coverage. So 0 is not covered, and 4 (n+1=4) is not covered either. So for subset {2}, assigning p=2 covers all 1-3. So it's valid.\n\nSimilarly, for subset {1,3}, perhaps assigning p=2 for 1: coverage is 0 < c < 2 → only 1. And p=1 for 3: coverage is 3. Then town 2 is uncovered. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, no. So in this case, the valid subsets are {1,2,3} and {2}.\n\nSo the number of valid subsets is 2. Since total subsets are 8, the probability is 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the second sample.\n\nSo the task is to count the number of subsets S that can form a valid configuration.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find a way to model this for general n.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a valid S.\n\nEach tower's coverage must exactly cover some consecutive towns, without overlapping, and exactly covering 1..n.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling with certain tiles, where each tile corresponds to the coverage of a tower.\n\nEach tower's coverage can be represented as a certain length. For example, if a tower is placed at position i with power p, its coverage is a segment of length 2p -1 (from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1)).\n\nWait, but the length of the coverage is 2(p-1)+1 = 2p-1.\n\nSo for the entire 1..n to be covered, the sum of these lengths must equal n.\n\nBut each tower's coverage is centered at i, and the coverage of different towers must not overlap.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a set of positions and their respective coverage lengths (which are 2p_i -1 for each p_i), such that the coverage segments exactly cover 1..n without overlapping.\n\nWait, but each coverage must be a contiguous block starting and ending at certain points, and the union must be exactly 1..n.\n\nSo the problem is similar to selecting a set of non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover the 1..n line, each centered at some i in 1..n, and each interval is of odd length (since 2p-1 is always odd).\n\nMoreover, the intervals cannot include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet me think of dp[i] as the number of ways to arrange the towers for the first i towns.\n\nBut considering that each tower's coverage is variable, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the concept of a perfect matching, where each interval is a domino-like tile of varying lengths, as long as their combined coverage is exactly n.\n\nWait, but the intervals can vary in length, as long as they are of odd lengths (since p is >=1, 2p-1 >=1, which is odd).\n\nWait, but wait: 2p-1 can be any positive odd integer, but for a tower at position i, the coverage starts at i - (p-1) and ends at i + (p-1). So the length is 2p-1, which is odd.\n\nSo each coverage is of odd length.\n\nBut the sum of odd lengths must be even? Because n could be even or odd.\n\nWait, for example, n=2: 2 is even. The coverage is two segments of length 1 each. Sum 2.\n\nFor n=3: 3 is odd. One segment of length 3 (like tower 2 with p=2, covering 1-3), or three segments of length 1 each.\n\nSo the sum of the lengths must be exactly n.\n\nBut each length is an odd number, so the sum of k odd numbers is:\n\n- If k is even, sum is even.\n- If k is odd, sum is odd.\n\nThus, for n even, the number of segments must be even. For n odd, the number of segments must be odd.\n\nHmm. Interesting.\n\nSo the problem now is to count the number of subsets S of {1, 2, ..., n} such that the union of their coverage is exactly 1..n, each coverage is an odd-length segment, and they don't overlap.\n\nWait, but how do we model the selection of which towers are present and their assigned p's?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering the set of towers as being a subset that can form a certain kind of independent intervals covering 1..n.\n\nWait, perhaps each tower must be the center of a maximal interval. That is, for each tower in S, the coverage interval is as large as possible, given that it doesn't extend beyond 0 and n+1.\n\nWait, for example, a tower at position i can have a coverage of [a, b], where a is as far left as possible (but >=1) and b as far right as possible (but <=n). But that might not necessarily lead to a valid configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the towers form a certain type of non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover 1..n.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be thought of as a perfect matching of certain intervals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think: for the first position, town 1, what can be the scenario?\n\nIf a tower is placed at 1, then its coverage must start at 1, but with p=1, it covers only 1. Then the remaining towns 2..n must form a valid configuration.\n\nAlternatively, if the tower is not placed at 1, then it's covered by another tower, say placed at k, whose coverage includes 1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, for town 1 to be covered, there must be a tower in some position i such that i - (p_i-1) <=1 <= i + (p_i-1). So i can be 1 (with p=1), or 2 with p=2 (covers 1 and 2 and 3?), but wait, for i=2, p=2, coverage is 2-1+1=2 to 2+1-1=2. No, that's p=2: |c-2| < 2 → c can be 1, 2, 3. So coverage is 1-3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is |c - i| < p_i. So for p_i=2, |c-2| < 2 → c is in (0, 3), so c=1, 2, 3. So coverage is 1,2,3.\n\nSo for n=3, if we have a tower at 2 with p=2, coverage is 1-3.\n\nThus, in that case, the entire 1-3 is covered by one tower.\n\nSo for the first position, the coverage can come from a tower placed at 1, or a tower placed at 2, or even further away.\n\nBut this complicates the dynamic programming approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a binary choice for each position: whether to place a tower or not, and if so, how much coverage it provides.\n\nBut that seems difficult.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's model the problem as a graph where each node represents the current position, and edges represent possible jumps based on the coverage of a tower.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAnother thought: for the entire 1..n to be covered, the chosen towers must form a non-overlapping set of intervals, each of odd length, covering the entire 1..n.\n\nEach interval is centered at some tower and has length 2p-1.\n\nSo, the intervals must be non-overlapping, cover 1..n, and each interval's length is an odd number.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at some tower, and ensuring that the intervals are non-overlapping.\n\nBut the towers are placed in some subset S, and each tower's position is fixed.\n\nWait, but the tower's position must be the center of the interval.\n\nSo for each interval [a, b], the center is at (a+b)/2, which must be a tower in S.\n\nMoreover, the interval must be of length l, which is 2p-1, where p is the power assigned to that tower.\n\nSo, each interval is determined by its center i and its length l (odd). The interval is [i-l//2, i+l//2], since l is 2p-1, so l//2 is (p-1).\n\nWait, for example, l=3: p=2, then the interval is [i-1, i+1], which is 3 units long.\n\nSo for a given interval [a,b], the length is b-a+1 = l, which must be odd.\n\nAnd the center is (a + b) / 2, which must be an integer, hence a and b must be of the same parity.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n}, such that S is a collection of centers for intervals of odd lengths, which together cover exactly 1..n, and the intervals are non-overlapping.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can model it with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming.\n\nLet dp[i] be the number of valid subsets for the first i towns.\n\nWe need to compute dp[n].\n\nBase cases: dp[0] = 1 (empty set), dp[1] = 1 (only tower 1 with p=1).\n\nFor i > 1, dp[i] can be computed by considering the last interval that ends at i.\n\nSo, for each possible j such that the interval [j, i] is of odd length, and j is the center, we can add the number of ways to form the first j-1 towns multiplied by the possibility of choosing this interval.\n\nWait, but j must be the center of the interval, so j = (start + end) / 2.\n\nSince the interval is [start, end], and its length is end - start + 1 = l (odd), j = (start + end) / 2.\n\nSo for the interval ending at i, the start can vary, but the length must be odd.\n\nSo, for i, the possible intervals ending at i are those where the length is odd.\n\nSo, for each possible k, such that the interval starts at i - (k-1), and has length k (so k is odd), and the start is >=1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the length.\n\nLet’s define for each position i, the maximum possible previous position j where a new interval can end.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can consider all possible interval lengths l (odd) that can end at i.\n\nFor each such l, the interval must start at i - l +1, and the center is (i - l +1 + i) / 2 = (2i - l +1)/2.\n\nWhich must be an integer, so 2i - l +1 must be even → l must be odd.\n\nWait, but l is already odd, so 2i - l +1 is even minus even? Wait, 2i is even, l is odd, so 2i - l is even minus odd → odd. Adding 1 gives even. So (2i -l +1) is even, so the center is an integer.\n\nThus, for each i and l (odd), the interval is [i - l +1, i], and the center is (i - l +1 + i)/2 = (2i - l +1)/2.\n\nWhich is an integer.\n\nSo for each i, the possible l's are 1, 3, 5, ..., up to i (since l can't be larger than i).\n\nWait, but l has to be such that i - l +1 >= 1 → l <= i.\n\nSo for each i, l can be 1,3,5,..., up to min(i, ... )\n\nSo, for the DP, we can write:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l=1,3,5,...} (ways to choose a tower at (2i - l +1)/2, and add the number of ways to cover up to (i - l) )\n\nBut wait, the interval [i - l +1, i] is covered by the tower at j = (i - l +1 + i)/2.\n\nSo, for each l (odd), j must be an integer and j must be in 1..i.\n\nThen, for each such l, the tower j must be present in S, and the rest of the towns before i - l +1 must be covered by a valid configuration.\n\nBut how do we model that in DP?\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state should include whether a tower is placed at j.\n\nNo, that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP[i] represents the number of valid subsets for the first i towns, regardless of which towers are placed.\n\nBut for each i, to compute dp[i], we consider all possible l (odd) and see if adding an interval of length l ending at i is possible.\n\nEach such interval requires that the tower at j is present, and that the interval [i - l +1, i] is covered only by j.\n\nBut how to account for that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP needs to track the last position where a tower was placed.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as a tiling problem where each tile is an interval of odd length, and the tiles are non-overlapping.\n\nBut then, for each possible interval [a, b] (of odd length), the center j must be present as a tower.\n\nSo the number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of tilings of 1..n with non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower in S.\n\nSo, for each such tiling, the subset S is uniquely determined as the set of centers of the intervals.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to tile 1..n with non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, and the centers of the intervals are in S.\n\nWait, but each such tiling directly corresponds to a valid subset S. Because S must consist precisely of the centers of the intervals.\n\nSo the problem becomes equivalent to counting the number of tilings of 1..n with non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, each with a unique center (each center is a tower in S).\n\nThus, the number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of such tilings.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to tile 1..n with non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a unique position.\n\nSo, the next step is to find the number of such tilings.\n\nLet me denote f(n) as the number of such tilings.\n\nThen, the probability is f(n) / 2^n.\n\nSo, our goal is to compute f(n) mod MOD, where MOD is 998244353.\n\nNow, the question is to find f(n), which is the number of ways to tile 1..n with non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, each centered at some position.\n\nEach interval is of length l = 2k-1 for some k >=1.\n\nSo, the length l is 1,3,5,...\n\nThus, f(n) can be computed with a DP approach.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence.\n\nDefine dp[i] as the number of ways to tile 1..i.\n\nWe need to compute dp[n].\n\nFor each i, we can consider the last interval ending at i, which has length l (odd), and then add dp[i - l] for each valid l.\n\nWait, but the last interval must start at i - l + 1, and the center j is (i - l + 1 + i) / 2 = (2i - l + 1)/2.\n\nWhich must be an integer, which it is because l is odd.\n\nSo, for each i, we can iterate over all possible l (odd) where l <= i.\n\nFor each such l, we compute j = (i*2 - l + 1)/2.\n\nThen, j must be an integer, which it is.\n\nSo, for each l, we can add dp[i - l] to dp[i].\n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l=1,3,5,..., l <=i} dp[i - l]\n\nWith base cases:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (empty tiling)\ndp[1] = 1 (only a single interval of l=1)\n\nBut wait, for dp[1], the interval is [1,1], l=1, j=1. So yes, that's allowed.\n\nLet's test this with small n.\n\nn=1: dp[1] = 1.\n\nn=2:\n\nCompute dp[2] as sum over l=1 and l=3 (but l=3>2, so only l=1.\n\nSo dp[2] = dp[2-1] = dp[1] = 1.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the valid tilings are:\n\nEither two intervals of l=1 each: [1], [2].\n\nOr one interval of l=3, but that would require j=(2*2 -3 +1)/2 = (4-3+1)/2 = 2/2=1. So interval [1,2], which is l=2, but l must be odd. So l=2 is even, which is invalid.\n\nSo, for n=2, the only valid tiling is two intervals of l=1. Thus, f(2)=1.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, dp[2] = dp[1] =1, which is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier in the example with n=2, the valid subsets were only {1,2}, which correspond to two intervals of l=1 each. So yes, f(2)=1.\n\nAnother test: n=3.\n\nCompute dp[3]:\n\nl can be 1,3.\n\nFor l=1: dp[3-1] = dp[2] =1.\n\nFor l=3: j=(3*2 -3 +1)/2 = (6-3+1)/2=4/2=2. So interval [1,3]. So dp[3-3] = dp[0]=1.\n\nSo dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nWhich matches our earlier conclusion that f(3)=2.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nn=4:\n\nCompute dp[4]:\n\nPossible l's: 1,3.\n\nFor l=1: dp[3] =2.\n\nFor l=3: j=(4*2 -3 +1)/2 = (8-3+1)/2=6/2=3. Interval [2,4]. So dp[4-3] = dp[1] =1.\n\nSo dp[4] = 2 +1=3.\n\nWhat are the tilings for n=4?\n\n1. Four intervals of l=1 each.\n\n2. Interval [1,3], and [4,4].\n\n3. Interval [2,4], and [1,1].\n\nSo f(4)=3.\n\nThus, the recurrence seems to hold.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing f(n) where f(n) is the number of ways to tile 1..n with non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a position.\n\nAnd f(n) can be computed via dynamic programming with the recurrence dp[i] = sum_{l=1,3,5,..., l<=i} dp[i-l].\n\nNow, the problem is to compute dp[n] efficiently.\n\nConstraints are up to 2e5, so O(n^2) is too slow.\n\nWe need a way to compute dp[i] quickly.\n\nLooking for patterns in the dp array:\n\nCompute dp for small n:\n\nn : dp[n]\n\n0 : 1\n\n1 :1\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:3\n\n5: ?\n\nCompute dp[5]:\n\nl=1: dp[4]=3\n\nl=3: dp[5-3]=dp[2]=1\n\nl=5: j=(5*2 -5 +1)/2= (10-5+1)/2=6/2=3. So interval [1,5]. So dp[0]=1.\n\nSo dp[5] =3 +1 +1 =5.\n\nWhat about n=5? The tilings are:\n\n1. Five intervals of l=1.\n\n2. [1,3], [4,5] → but wait, [4,5] is l=2, which is even. So invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because l must be odd. So for n=5, the tiling [1,3] and [4,5] is invalid because [4,5] is l=2.\n\nThus, perhaps my earlier analysis is incorrect.\n\nWait, wait, the interval [a, b] must have length l =b -a +1, which must be odd.\n\nSo for [4,5], l=2 is even, so it's invalid.\n\nThus, the tiling for n=5 must consist of intervals of odd lengths.\n\nSo the possible tilings for n=5 are:\n\n1. Five intervals of l=1.\n\n2. [1,5] (l=5).\n\n3. [1,3], [4,5] → but [4,5] is invalid.\n\nSo the valid tilings are:\n\n- [1,5] → contributes 1 way.\n\n- [1,1], [3,3], [5,5] → contributes 1 way.\n\nWait, but that's only two ways, but according to dp[5] =5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing some tilings.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nAnother tiling is [1,3], [4,5]: no, as [4,5] is l=2.\n\nAnother tiling is [1,3], [5,5]: yes, because [1,3] is l=3, [5,5] is l=1.\n\nSo that's another way.\n\nSimilarly, [3,5], [1,1]: another way.\n\nAlso, [2,4], [1,1], [5,5]: another way.\n\nSo total tilings:\n\n1. All l=1: 1.\n\n2. [1,5]: 1.\n\n3. [1,3], [5,5]: 1.\n\n4. [3,5], [1,1]: 1.\n\n5. [2,4], [1,1], [5,5]: 1.\n\nWait, that's 5 tilings, which matches dp[5]=5.\n\nSo the recurrence holds.\n\nThus, the DP approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute dp[n] efficiently for n up to 2e5.\n\nThe initial approach is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nThus, we need to find a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) per term, leveraging the fact that the sum is over all l=1,3,5... <=i.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again.\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - (2k+1)}, where m is such that 2k+1 <=i.\n\nBut this can be rewritten as:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{s=1 to i step 2} dp[i - s}\n\nWhich is similar to the prefix sums.\n\nBecause for i, the sum is over s=1,3,5,...,i.\n\nThus, if we precompute the prefix sums of dp, then for each i, we can compute the sum quickly.\n\nLet me define a helper array, say, prefix_sum[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} dp[k}.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the sum is over s=1,3,5,...,i, which is every other term.\n\nSo, the sum is equal to the sum of dp[i - s} for s in 1,3,5..., i.\n\nWhich is equivalent to the sum of dp[j] for j = i-1, i-3, i-5, etc., down to j >=0.\n\nThus, the sum is the same as the sum of dp[j] for j in the sequence i-1, i-3, i-5, etc.\n\nBut how can we express this in terms of prefix sums?\n\nLet me think of the indices in terms of parity.\n\nFor each i, the sum is the sum of dp[i-1], dp[i-3], dp[i-5], etc.\n\nWhich can be written as sum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - (2k+1)}.\n\nBut to compute this sum, we can note that it is equal to the sum of dp[j] for j from i-1 down to max(0, i - (some l)) stepping by 2.\n\nBut this is equivalent to summing over the dp array for certain positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be represented using the prefix sum for even and odd indices.\n\nLet me split the dp array into even and odd parts.\n\nLet me define two arrays:\n\neven_dp[i] = sum of dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] + ... up to i if i is even.\n\nodd_dp[i] = sum of dp[1] + dp[3] + dp[5] + ... up to i if i is odd.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, for each i, whether it's even or odd.\n\nThen, for a given i, the sum over s=1,3,5,...,i is equal to the sum of dp[j] where j is i-1, i-3, etc.\n\nWhich can be expressed as the sum of dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + ... until j >=0.\n\nBut how does this relate to the even and odd prefix sums?\n\nLet's think differently. Let's precompute two prefix sums:\n\nsum_even[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i} dp[2k}.\n\nsum_odd[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i} dp[2k+1}.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the sum over s=1,3,... is equal to sum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - (2k+1)}.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - 2k -1}.\n\nLet me make a substitution: j = i - 2k -1.\n\nAs k increases, j decreases by 2 each time.\n\nThus, for i, the sum is sum_{j ≡ i-1 mod 2} dp[j}, for j >=0 and j <=i-1.\n\nBut how can this be computed quickly?\n\nAnother approach is to note that the sum for i is equal to the sum of dp[j] for j = i-1, i-3, i-5, etc., which can be written as the sum of all dp[j] where j has the same parity as i-1.\n\nThus, for i, the sum is equal to the sum of all dp[j] with j >=0, j <=i-1, and j ≡ i-1 mod 2.\n\nThis can be represented as the sum of dp[j] for j in the same parity group as (i-1).\n\nSo, for each i, the sum is the sum of dp[j] where j is in the same parity as i-1, up to j=i-1.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute two prefix sums: one for even indices and one for odd indices.\n\nLet me define:\n\nprefix_even[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i} dp[2k} if 2k <=i.\n\nprefix_odd[i] = sum_{k=0}^{i} dp[2k+1} if 2k+1 <=i.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have prefix_even[i] = sum of dp[j] for j even, up to j=i.\n\nSimilarly for prefix_odd[i].\n\nThen, for a given i, the sum over s=1,3,...,i is equal to:\n\nif i is even: sum over j = i-1, i-3, ..., 1 → which is the sum of all odd j up to i-1.\n\nSimilarly, if i is odd: sum over j = i-1, i-3, ..., 3,1 → which is the sum of all odd j up to i-1.\n\nThus, the sum for i is prefix_odd[i-1] if i is even.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen i is even:\n\ni-1 is odd.\n\nThe sum is the sum of all j odd, from 1 to i-1.\n\nWhich is prefix_odd[i-1].\n\nWhen i is odd:\n\ni-1 is even.\n\nThe sum is the sum of all j odd, from 1 to i-1.\n\nWhich is also prefix_odd[i-1].\n\nWait, no. Wait, when i is even:\n\ni-1 is odd.\n\nThe sum is j = i-1, i-3, etc., which are all odd.\n\nSo, the sum is the sum of all odd j up to i-1.\n\nSimilarly, when i is odd:\n\ni-1 is even.\n\nThe sum is j = i-1, i-3, etc., which are all odd.\n\nSo, for any i >=1, the sum is prefix_odd[i-1].\n\nWait, but what about i=1:\n\ni=1, sum is j=0 (but 0 is even, but j must be >=0.\n\nWait, wait, j can be zero, but in our initial setup, dp[0]=1.\n\nWait, no: for i=1, the sum is dp[0], because l=1.\n\nWhich is dp[0] =1.\n\nBut prefix_odd[i-1] for i=1 is prefix_odd[0], which is zero (assuming dp[0] is part of even_dp).\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum for i is equal to the sum of all dp[j] where j is in the same parity as (i-1), and j <=i-1.\n\nSo, for any i>=1, the sum is the sum of dp[j] for j <=i-1 and j ≡ (i-1) mod 2.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum of all dp[j] where j is in the same parity group as i-1, and j <=i-1.\n\nThus, for each i, the sum can be found as:\n\nif i is even:\n\nsum = sum of dp[j] for j odd, j <= i-1.\n\nif i is odd:\n\nsum = sum of dp[j] for j odd, j <= i-1.\n\nSo in both cases, it's the sum of dp[j] for j odd, j <=i-1.\n\nThus, to compute this, we can maintain two prefix sums:\n\n- sum_even: sum of dp[j] for even j up to a certain point.\n\n- sum_odd: sum of dp[j] for odd j up to a certain point.\n\nBut wait, for any i, the sum is sum of dp[j] where j is odd and j <=i-1.\n\nThus, for each i, the sum is sum_odd[i-1].\n\nSo, to compute dp[i], we can calculate it as sum_odd[i-1].\n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_odd[i-1]\n\nAnd the sum_odd array can be maintained as we go.\n\nBut how to compute sum_odd[i]?\n\nWe can keep track of sum_odd and sum_even as we compute dp[i].\n\nLet me",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can set their signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.
