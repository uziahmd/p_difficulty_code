Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts at C and goes up to D. So in all cases, z is at least as big as y and x. So for the triangle inequality, the only necessary condition is x + y > z. Because if z is larger than or equal to y, then x + z will definitely be larger than y, and y + z is larger than x. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z is between C and D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially when B, C, D are large, like up to 5e5, iterating through each possible x, y, z would be too slow. So I need an efficient way to calculate this without brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's fix x and y. Then for each such pair (x, y), the maximum z allowed is min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must be less than x + y. So for each x and y, the number of valid z's is max(0, min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1). Because z has to be at least C and at most min(x+y-1, D).\n\nSo the total count is the sum over all x in [A,B], y in [B,C], of max(0, min(x+y-1, D) - C + 1) if x + y > C (since z must be at least C). Wait, no: because z has to be at least C, so if x + y <= C, then there are zero valid z's. So for each (x, y), if x + y > C, then the number of z's is (min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1), else zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate x from A to B.\n2. For each x, iterate y from B to C.\n3. For each (x, y), compute s = x + y.\n4. If s <= C: contribute 0.\n5. Else: compute lower_z = C, upper_z = min(s-1, D).\n   If upper_z < lower_z: contribute 0.\n   Else: contribute (upper_z - lower_z + 1).\n\nBut even with this approach, if A, B, C, D are up to 5e5, the number of x and y pairs could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. That's impossible to handle with loops in Python.\n\nSo we need a smarter way to calculate this sum without iterating each x and y.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the variables:\n\nWe have x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nWe can represent the problem as finding the sum for x in [A, B] of sum for y in [B, C] of max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, the y ranges where x + y > C are y > C - x. But since y is in [B, C], the lower bound for y is max(B, C - x + 1). So for each x, we can find the minimum y that satisfies y >= max(B, C - x + 1), and y <= C.\n\nIf the lower bound is higher than C, then no y contributes for that x.\n\nOtherwise, for each x, the valid y's are from y_min to C, where y_min = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nThen, for each x, the number of valid y's is (C - y_min + 1), provided y_min <= C.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is the sum over y in [y_min, C] of (min(x + y -",

The key condition for a triangle to be non-degenerate is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: Given \\(A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D\\), we need to find valid triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).
