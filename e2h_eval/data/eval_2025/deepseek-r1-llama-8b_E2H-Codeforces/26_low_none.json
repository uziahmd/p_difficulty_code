Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, and z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, since it's a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But wait, in this case, because of the ordering x ≤ y ≤ z (since x is up to B, y starts at B, and z starts at C which is >= y), the only condition we really need to check is x + y > z. Because if that's true, then automatically x + z > y and y + z > x will hold.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nNow, my task is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) that satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x + y > z.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to compute this efficiently, especially since the constraints can be up to 5e5, which suggests that a naive O(N^3) approach is impossible.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, note that for each x and y, z can vary between max(C, something) and min(D, x+y-1). Wait, no. Wait, z must be ≥ C and ≤ D, but also z < x + y. So the valid z's are those that are in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of valid z's is the maximum of (min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1, 0). Because if x+y-1 < C, then there are no valid z's.\n\nBut considering that x can range from A to B, and y can range from B to C, maybe we can precompute for each y, the possible x's and then calculate the contribution for each (x,y) pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to iterate over x, then for each x, iterate over y, and then compute the number of z's.\n\nBut considering that x can be up to 5e5, and y can also be up to 5e5, doing this naively would result in 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the variables:\n\nWe have x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D].\n\nAnd the condition is x + y > z.\n\nSince z must be at least C, the condition becomes x + y > C, but also z <= D. So for each x and y, the number of valid z's is the number of integers z where z >= C and z <= min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nSo for each x and y, the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C, else 0.\n\nWait, but if x + y > C is not satisfied, then there are zero z's. Otherwise, it's the number of integers from C to min(D, x+y-1), inclusive.\n\nSo the total number of valid triangles is the sum over x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and z in [C,D] where x + y > z.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each y, determine for which x and z the conditions are satisfied. Or perhaps fix z and compute the number of x and y pairs that work.\n\nWait, but z is in [C, D]. So perhaps for each z, compute the number of (x,y) pairs such that x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], and y >= B, x <= B, and x + y > z.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's easier.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider that for a given x and y, the z can vary. So for each (x, y), the number of z's is as I said before.\n\nSo the problem reduces to summing over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], the value max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C.\n\nSo the sum is the total number of valid triangles.\n\nBut again, with x and y each up to 5e5, iterating through each pair is not feasible.\n\nSo we need a way to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the ranges for x and y. Since x is up to B and y is up to C, and B <= C, the x and y are in a specific order.\n\nThe key is",
