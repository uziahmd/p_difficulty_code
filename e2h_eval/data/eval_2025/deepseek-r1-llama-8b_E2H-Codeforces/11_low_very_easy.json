A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make, given the constraints on the available resources.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. All positive integers, not exceeding 1000.\n\nWait, what do these variables represent?\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters.\nSo total drink is k * l ml.\n\nc: number of limes. Each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices are c * d.\n\np: grams of salt available.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, all n friends need n * nl ml in total.\nWait, no. Wait, each friend needs nl ml for a toast. So per toast round, total drink used is n * nl ml.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, you need n slices.\n\nAnd each toast also requires np grams of salt per friend. So per toast, total salt used is n * np grams.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of toasts T such that:\n\n1. The total drink is enough: T * (n * nl) ≤ (k * l)\n2. The total lime slices are enough: T * n ≤ (c * d)\n3. The total salt is enough: T * (n * np) ≤ p\n\nThen, T is the minimum of those three values divided by 1 (since T is the same for each constraint). Because for each resource, the maximum possible T based on that resource is (available / required per toast), and we take the smallest among those.\n\nWait, let me think again. For each resource:\n\n- Drink: total_drink = k * l\nEach toast uses n * nl. So max_T_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nBut wait, if it's not divisible, then we have to take the floor because we can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nSimilarly for limes: total_slices = c * d\nEach toast uses n slices. So max_T_lime = total_slices // n\n\nSalt: total_salt = p\nEach toast uses n * np. So max_T_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of these three maxima.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l\n2. drink_toast = n * nl\n   If drink_toast is zero? No, since n is at least 1, and nl is at least 1, so it's okay.\n   max_t_drink = total_drink // drink_toast\n3. Calculate total_limes = c * d\n   lime_toast = n (each toast needs one slice per person)\n   max_t_lime = total_limes // lime_toast\n4. Calculate salt_toast = n * np\n   max_t_salt = p // salt_toast\n5. T is the minimum of max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt\n6. Output T\n\nBut wait, what if any of these divisions result in zero? Then the overall T would be zero.\n\nSo the plan is to compute each of these three values, take the minimum, and output it.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCalculations:\n\ntotal_drink = 4 *5=20\ndrink_toast=3*3=9\nmax_t_drink=20//9=2 (since 9*2=18 <=20)\n\nWait wait, wait! Oh no! Wait, no. Wait, each toast requires n * nl. So per toast, the total drink consumed is 3 *3=9ml.\n\nSo 20 /9 is 2.222, so integer division gives 2.\n\nYes.\n\nLimes: c*d=10*8=80\nlime_toast=3 (each toast needs 3 slices)\nmax_t_lime=80 //3 = 26 (since 3*26=78<=80)\n\nSalt: p=100, salt_toast=3*1=3\nmax_t_salt=100//3=33 (since 3*33=99 <=100)\n\nSo the min of 2,26,33 is 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nn=5,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n2. **Compute Resource Requirements per Toast**: Calculate the amount of each resource needed per toast round for all friends.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts for Each Resource**: Using integer division, compute the maximum number of toast rounds possible based on each resource.\n4. **Find the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the resource that allows the fewest toast rounds. This is found by taking the minimum value from the three computed maximum toast values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = n * nl\nmax_toasts_drink = total_drink // toast_drink\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\ntoast_lime = n\nmax_toasts_lime = total_limes // toast_lime\n\nsalt_per_toast = n * np\nmax_toasts_salt = p // salt_per_toast\n\nmax_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total volume of drink available is computed as `k * l`.\n3. **Drink Toast Requirement**: The amount of drink required per toast round for all friends is `n * nl`, and the maximum number of toast rounds possible from the drink is calculated using integer division.\n4. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`, and each toast round requires `n` slices, leading to the maximum toast rounds possible from lime slices.\n5. **Salt Requirement Calculation**: The total salt available is `p`, and each toast round requires `n * np` grams of salt, determining the maximum toast rounds possible from the salt.\n6. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value from the three computed maximum toast values (drink, lime, salt) gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the limiting factor for the number of toasts, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource.",
