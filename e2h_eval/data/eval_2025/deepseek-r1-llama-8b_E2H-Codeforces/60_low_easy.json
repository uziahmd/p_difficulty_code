Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain sequences after each modification to a string S. Hmm. So each character added to S is either a '0' or '1', representing dots and dashes respectively. After each addition, I need to find the number of non-empty substrings that correspond to valid English letters in Morse code.\n\nWait, but what's considered a valid Morse code letter here? Oh right, the problem says that some 4-length strings don't correspond to any letter. But for our problem, when a substring has a length from 1 to 4, we check if it's one of the valid Morse codes. And then, each such substring contributes to the count if it's valid.\n\nSo the task is, after each step, compute the sum over all possible non-empty substrings of S (each being a Morse code sequence) whether they are valid letters.\n\nHmm, the challenge is to do this efficiently because m can be up to 3000, which isn't too bad, but for each step, we can't recompute everything from scratch—it needs to be optimized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach time we add a character, say c, to the end of S. Then, for the current S, we need to consider all new substrings that end at this new character. Because any longer substring ending here would include this new c.\n\nSo, perhaps we can maintain a dynamic programming array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nWhen we add the new character, for each possible substring ending here, we look back 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters (since the maximum length of a valid Morse code is 4). For each possible length l (from 1 to min(current position, 4)), we check if the substring ending at i with length l is a valid Morse code.\n\nIf it is, then we add dp[i - l] + 1 (the +1 is for the substring consisting of only the last l characters). Wait, no—maybe the DP approach can be structured differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the DP state as follows: for each position i in the string, we keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at i. When we add the ith character, we look back up to 4 positions and see if the substring s[i-l+1..i] is a valid Morse code.\n\nWait, but how do I represent the substrings? Maybe for each position, we can track the number of valid substrings ending at that position by considering the previous few positions.\n\nSo, for each new character, we can process it by looking at the previous 1, 2, 3, 4 steps and see if adding the current character forms a valid code. If so, then we can add to the total.\n\nBut we also need to account for the fact that when a new character is added, any new substring that ends there could be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, perhaps we can have an array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending exactly at position i. Then, the total is the sum of all dp[i] up to the current point.\n\nWhen processing the new character, for each l in 1..4:\n\n- Check if the substring ending at the current position with length l is a valid Morse code.\n- If yes, then add (dp[i - l] + 1) to the current dp[i]. The +1 is because the substring itself is new.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think again. For each l, the number of substrings ending at i of length l is equal to the number of such substrings in the previous positions plus 1 (the new one). But if the substring of length l is valid, then it contributes 1 to the total.\n\nWait, no. The way I'm thinking is that for each possible l, if the substring of length l ending at i is valid, then it's a new valid substring. So for each l, we check if s[i-l+1 ... i] is a valid code. If it is, then the number of new valid substrings ending at i is (dp[i-l] + 1). The +1 is because the substring s[i-l+1 ... i] is a new one that wasn't counted before.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each new character, iterate l from 1 to 4. For each l, if the current substring of length l is valid, then the contribution to the total is (dp[i - l] + 1). Because:\n\n- dp[i-l] represents the number of valid substrings ending just before the start of this new substring. Adding the new substring, which is of length l, adds (dp[i-l] + 1) new valid substrings",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty substrings of a given string that correspond to valid English letters in Morse code after each modification to the string. Each modification appends either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) to the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Morse Code Validity**: Each valid Morse code string is a sequence of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4, except for four specific strings that do not correspond to any letter.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position in the string.\n3. **Efficient Update**: For each new character added to the string, check the last 1, 2, 3, and 4 characters to see if they form a valid Morse code substring. Update the count of valid substrings accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse code strings of length 1 to 4\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0': ['0'],\n    '1': ['1'],\n    '00': ['00'],\n    '01': ['01'],\n    '10': ['10'],\n    '11': ['11'],\n    '000': ['000'],\n    '001': ['001'],\n    '010': ['010'],\n    '011': ['011'],\n    '100': ['100'],\n    '101': ['101'],\n    '110': ['110'],\n    '111': ['111']\n}\n\n# For each length, store all possible valid codes\nvalid_by_length = {}\nfor code in valid_codes.values():\n    l = len(code)\n    if l not in valid_by_length:\n        valid_by_length[l] = set()\n    valid_by_length[l].add(code)\n\n# Precompute all possible valid codes\nall_valid_codes = set()\nfor l in valid_by_length:\n    all_valid_codes.update(valid_by_length[l])\n\n# Now, for each length 1-4, have a set of valid codes\nvalid_1 = {'0', '1'}\nvalid_2 = {'00', '01', '10', '11'}\nvalid_3 = {'000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111'}\nvalid_4 = {'0000', '0001', '0010', '0011', '0100', '0101', '0110', '0111', \n            '1000', '1001', '1010', '1011', '1100', '1101', '1110', '1111'}\n\n# Now, for each step, process the new character and update the DP array\nm = int(input())\ndp = [0] * (4)  # dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at i steps back, but we'll manage it differently\ntotal = 0\ncurrent = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    current.append(c)\n    max_len = min(4, len(current))\n    new_dp = 0\n    for l in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        substr = ''.join(current[-l:])\n        if substr in all_valid_codes:\n            prev_pos = len(current) - l - 1\n            if prev_pos >= 0:\n                new_dp += dp[prev_pos]\n            new_dp %= MOD\n            new_dp += 1  # add the new substring itself\n            new_dp %= MOD\n    total += new_dp\n    total %= MOD\n    dp.append(new_dp % MOD)\n    print(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: We precompute all valid Morse code strings of lengths 1 to 4 and store them in sets for quick lookup.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position. For each new character added, we check the last 1, 2, 3, and 4 characters to see if they form a valid Morse code.\n3. **Efficient Update**: For each valid substring found, we update the total count by considering the number of valid substrings ending at the previous positions and adding the new substring itself.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required count after each modification, handling up to 3000 modifications quickly.",
