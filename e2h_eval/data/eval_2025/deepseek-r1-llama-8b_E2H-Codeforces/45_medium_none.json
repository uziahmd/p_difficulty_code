There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where players compete in a knockout style. The main rule is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the tournament structure affects this. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So for n players, there are n-1 games in total. But the order of these games matters because the winner's path depends on the matchups.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of games the winner can play isn't necessarily n-1. Because the structure of the bracket could limit that. For example, in a 3-player tournament, the winner plays two games: first against someone, then against the next. But wait, no—because with 3 players, there are two rounds. So the winner must play two games.\n\nBut in the sample input, when n=4, the output is 2. Hmm, why? Oh, because in a standard knockout bracket with four players, the winner would play three games: quarterfinal, semifinal, final. Wait, but according to the sample, it's 2. So maybe the initial arrangement of the bracket affects this.\n\nWait, the note says that in the third sample (n=4), the answer is 2. The explanation is that the bracket is arranged such that the winner plays two games: perhaps the winner only plays two matches because the other two players are arranged in a way that the winner doesn't have to play all possible matches.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, their game count increases by one. The rule says that before playing against someone else, their game counts must differ by at most one.\n\nSo for the winner to have k games, the other players in each round must be arranged such that each opponent has either k-1 or k-2 games played before facing the winner.\n\nBut how does this translate into the maximum possible k?\n\nLet me consider small values of n and see what the maximum k is.\n\nCase n=2: Only one game. So k=1.\n\nCase n=3: The winner plays two games. How? Let's say:\n\nGame 1: Player 1 vs Player 2. Suppose Player 1 wins. Then Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3. So two games. So k=2.\n\nCase n=4: According to the sample, the maximum is 2. Wait, how? Because in a normal bracket, the winner would play 3 games. But the sample says it's 2. So perhaps the way the bracket is structured determines the maximum.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum isn't always possible because of the constraints on the opponents' game counts.\n\nSo let's think differently. What's the pattern here?\n\nLooking for a mathematical approach. Maybe the maximum k is the largest integer such that the sum of the series 1 + 2 + ... + k is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, no. Or perhaps something like a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, thinking recursively: each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have either the same number of games as the winner minus one or same plus one.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that the number of games played by the two players before the match must differ by at most one. So when the winner is going to play their m-th game, their opponent must have either m-1 or m games played.\n\nWait, but the opponent is someone else. So for each step, the opponent must have a game count that is within one of the current count.\n\nSo the maximum possible games is the largest m such that the number of players required to reach that m is less than or equal to n.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each new game the winner plays requires at least two new players: one to play at step m, which needs m-1 games, and another to play in some previous step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time, the number of players needed grows exponentially.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor m=1: the winner plays once. They need one opponent. Total players used: 2.\n\nm=2: The winner plays twice. Each opponent must have either 0 or 1 games before facing them.\n\nWait, for the second game, the opponent could have one game. So that opponent must have beaten someone in their own path. So for the second game, the winner's opponent has one game, meaning one player was beaten. So the total players used would be 3: the initial opponent, the second opponent, and the one they beat.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for m=2:\n\nThe winner has 2 games. So:\n\nFirst game: the winner plays someone (A). Now, A has 1 game.\n\nSecond game: the winner plays someone else (B). B must have either 1 or 2 games before this match.\n\nIf B had 1 game, then B must have beaten someone (C), who is now out. So total players: A, B, C, winner. That's 4 players. So n=4, m=2 is possible. But in the sample, when n=4, the maximum is 2. So yes, that aligns.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, when n=4, the maximum is 2. So that fits.\n\nWhat about m=3? Let's see:\n\nTo get to m=3, the winner has played 3 games.\n\nEach opponent in each game must have a game count differing by at most one.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent must have either 2 or 3 games.\n\nIf opponent has 2 games: then they have beaten two others. So the opponent's tree is two games.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent is someone who has played 2 games. So that opponent has beaten two others. So total players required: the winner, opponent (2 games), their two beaten opponents, and any others?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is like a Fibonacci tree.\n\nWait, let's model this as the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games.\n\nFor k=1: 2 players.\n\nk=2: 3 players.\n\nk=3: 5 players.\n\nBecause for k=3, the winner's third game must face an opponent with 2 games. That opponent must have come from a subtree where they have beaten 2 others. So the subtree for that opponent requires 3 players (opponent and their two beaten ones). So total is 1 (winner) + 2 (their two games) + 3 (opponent's subtree) = 6? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for k games is F(k+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step adds the sum of the previous steps.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games.\n\nAt each step i (i=1 to k), the winner plays a game. Each such game must be against someone who has either i-1 or i games played.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to k terms.\n\nWait, for k=1: 2 players (F(2) = 1, but 2 is F(3)).\n\nWait, maybe it's the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players is the sum of the first k+1 Fibonacci numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's try for k=1: 2 players.\n\nk=2: 3 players.\n\nk=3: 5 players.\n\nWait, 2,3,5,... which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2,3,5,8,...\n\nSo perhaps the minimal number of players needed is fib(k+2), where fib is the Fibonacci sequence starting with fib(1)=1, fib(2)=2, etc.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nfib(1)=1\n\nfib(2)=2\n\nfib(3)=3\n\nfib(4)=5\n\nfib(5)=8\n\nSo for k=1, we need 2 players which is fib(3) = 2.\n\nk=2: 3 players, which is fib(4)=3.\n\nk=3: 5 players, which is fib(5)=5.\n\nYes, so it seems that for each k, the minimal n required is fib(k+2). Because for each step, the opponent comes from a subtree that requires fib(k+1) players, and adding the winner's previous games.\n\nSo the maximum k is the largest value where fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nWait, but in the sample input n=4, fib(5) is 5, which is larger than 4, so the maximum k is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=10. What's the maximum k?\n\nCompute fib(k+2) for various k:\n\nfib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, fib(6)=8, fib(7)=13.\n\nSo for n=10, the largest k where fib(k+2)<=10 is k=4, since fib(6)=8<=10, but fib(7)=13>10.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nk=4: fib(6)=8 <=10.\n\nIs there a higher k possible?\n\nk=4: requires 8 players. So for n=10, we can have 8 players, and then add two more.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the maximum k? Because those extra two could be part of the subtrees.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum k is the largest k where fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nSo for n=10, fib(6)=8<=10, fib(7)=13>10, so k=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample, where the output is 4 for n=10.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum k such that fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to a certain point (since n can be up to 1018, the fib numbers won't get too big).\n\n2. For each n, find the maximum k where fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is between fib(m) and fib(m+1)?\n\nLike, for example, n=5: fib(5)=5, so k=3 is allowed.\n\nn=6: same.\n\nn=7: still less than fib(7)=13, so k=4.\n\nWait, wait, let's re-express:\n\nfib(1)=1\n\nfib(2)=2\n\nfib(3)=3\n\nfib(4)=5\n\nfib(5)=8\n\nfib(6)=13\n\nSo for n=5, fib(4)=5. So k+2=4 => k=2? No, wait: fib(4)=5, which is the minimal number of players for k=2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier calculation said that for k=2, the minimal n is 3 (fib(4)=3). So perhaps I got the mapping wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n for k is fib(k+1).\n\nWait, let's reevaluate.\n\nWhen k=1: minimal n is 2 (fib(3)=2).\n\nk=2: minimal n is 3 (fib(4)=3).\n\nk=3: minimal n is 5 (fib(5)=5).\n\nk=4: minimal n is 8 (fib(6)=8).\n\nSo the formula is minimal_n = fib(k+2).\n\nThus, for a given n, the maximum k is the largest k where fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence until fib(m) exceeds n.\n\n- For each n, find the maximum m where fib(m) <=n, then k = m-2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=2, fib(3)=2 <=2, so m=3, k=1.\n\nFor n=3, fib(4)=3<=3, m=4, k=2.\n\nFor n=4, fib(5)=5>4. So the largest m where fib(m)<=4 is m=4 (fib(4)=3). So k=4-2=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5, m=5 (fib(5)=5), k=3.\n\nn=6: fib(5)=5<=6, so m=5, k=3.\n\nn=8: fib(6)=8<=8, so m=6, k=4.\n\nn=9: fib(6)=8<=9. Next, fib(7)=13>9. So m=6, k=4.\n\nn=10: same as above, k=4.\n\nn=11: same.\n\nn=12: same.\n\nn=13: fib(7)=13<=13, so m=7, k=5.\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci sequence until it exceeds 1018*2 or something.\n\n2. For each n, find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\n3. Then, the maximum number of games is m-2.\n\nBut wait, let's check for n=1. Wait, n is at least 2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to, say, 100 terms, which should be sufficient for n up to 1018.\n\nThen, for each input n, iterate through the Fibonacci list and find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nOnce found, the answer is m-2.\n\nWait, but let's test for n=2:\n\nfib list: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.\n\nWait, for n=2, the largest m is 2 (fib[2]=2). So m=2, k=0? No, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the mapping is that the minimal number of players for k games is fib(k+2).\n\nWait, for k=1: fib(3)=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for a given n, the maximum k is the maximum k where fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo, to find the maximum k, we can compute for each k, whether fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nWe can loop over possible k's, starting from 0, and find the largest one where fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to say, 40 terms.\n\n- For each n, initialize max_games=0.\n\n- For each possible k starting from 1:\n\n   Check if fib(k+2) <=n.\n\n   If yes, set max_games=k.\n\n   Else, break.\n\n- Return max_games.\n\nWait, but how to precompute the fib numbers?\n\nLet's see:\n\nfib[0] = 1\n\nfib[1] = 2\n\nfib[2] = 3\n\nfib[3] =5\n\nfib[4]=8\n\nfib[5]=13\n\nfib[6]=21\n\netc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the fib array starting from 1.\n\nSo let's create a list fib where fib[i] is the i-th term in the sequence, starting from 1.\n\nfib[1] = 1\n\nfib[2] = 2\n\nfib[3] = 3\n\nfib[4] = 5\n\nfib[5]=8\n\nfib[6]=13\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, the minimal n is 2, which is fib[2]=2.\n\nSo for k=1, fib[k+2] = fib[3]=3. Wait, no.\n\nWait, maybe the fib sequence starts as 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.\n\nSo for k=1, fib(k+2) is fib(3)=3.\n\nWait, but that would mean that for k=1, the minimal n is 3, which contradicts the first sample.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mapping.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the minimal number of players for k games.\n\nEach game the winner plays requires that the opponent has a game count that's within 1.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- To have 1 game: need 2 players.\n\n- To have 2 games: the winner must play two matches. The first opponent has 1 game, which implies they beat another player. So total players: 3 (winner, first opponent, second opponent).\n\n- To have 3 games: each opponent must have 2 or 3 games before their match.\n\nWait, the third game's opponent must have 2 games. So that opponent must have beaten two others. So the third game requires 3 more players (the opponent and their two beaten ones). So total players: 1 (winner) + 2 (first game) + 3 (second game) = 6?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have either the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo for the second game:\n\nThe winner has 1 game. The opponent must have 0 or 1.\n\nIf opponent has 1 game, then that means they have beaten someone else. So for the second game, the opponent brings in one more player.\n\nSo total players for two games: 3.\n\nFor the third game:\n\nThe winner has 2 games. The opponent must have 1 or 2.\n\nIf the opponent has 2 games, then they have beaten two others, requiring 3 players for their subtree. So total players for the third game is 3 (winner's first two games) + 3 (opponent's two games) = 6.\n\nWait, but the minimal n for k=3 is 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n for k is the sum of the first k+1 Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWait, let me calculate for k=1: sum is fib(2)=2.\n\nk=2: sum is fib(3)+fib(2) = 3+2=5.\n\nWait, but earlier for k=2, the minimal n is 3.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the sum of the first k Fibonacci numbers, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the minimal n for k as follows:\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have either the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. So one opponent.\n\nSecond game: opponent has 1 game. Which requires that opponent has beaten another player. So the minimal n is 3.\n\nThird game: opponent has 2 games. Opponent must have beaten two others. So the minimal n is 5.\n\nFourth game: opponent has 3 games. So opponent has beaten three others, requiring 4 more players. So total is 1+ (1 for first) + (2 for second) + (3 for third) + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively.\n\nLet f(k) be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games.\n\nFor k=1: f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner must play two games. The first game is against someone (A). The second game is against someone (B) who has one game. B must have beaten someone (C). So total players: 1 (winner) + 1 (A) + 1 (B) + 1 (C) =4? But earlier sample shows that for n=3, k=2 is possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the minimal n for k is not the sum but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nSo for k=1: fib(3)=2.\n\nk=2: fib(4)=3.\n\nk=3: fib(5)=5.\n\nk=4: fib(6)=8.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nSo for a given n, the maximum k is the largest k where fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo for example:\n\nn=2: fib(3)=2 →k=1.\n\nn=3: fib(4)=3 →k=2.\n\nn=4: fib(4)=3<=4, fib(5)=5>4 →k=2.\n\nn=5: fib(5)=5→k=3.\n\nn=8: fib(6)=8→k=4.\n\nn=10: fib(6)=8<=10, fib(7)=13>10→k=4.\n\nSo the code should compute the maximum k where fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nNow, the plan is to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain point, then for each n, find the largest k where fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo in Python, the code would look like this:\n\n1. Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to say 40 terms (since 1018 is manageable).\n\n2. For each n in the input, iterate through the fib list to find the largest m where fib[m] <=n. Then, k = m-2.\n\nWait, no. Because fib[m] corresponds to k+2. So k = m-2.\n\nSo for example, if m=3, fib[3]=2, then k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Generate a list 'fib' where fib[i] is the i-th Fibonacci number, starting from 1.\n\nBut let's make sure:\n\nfib[0] =1\n\nfib[1]=2\n\nfib[2]=3\n\nfib[3]=5\n\nfib[4]=8\n\nfib[5]=13\n\nand so on.\n\nWait, wait, let's see:\n\nfib[0] = 1 (for k=0, minimal n is 1)\n\nBut in our case, k starts from 1.\n\nSo for k=1: fib[3]=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the index is off by one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the list is generated as:\n\nfib = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...]\n\nso that fib[0] =1, fib[1]=2, fib[2]=3, etc.\n\nThen for k=1, the required n is fib[3]=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the list as follows:\n\nk | required n | fib index\n---|-------|---\n1 | 2 | 3\n2 |3 |4\n3 |5 |5\n4 |8 |6\n...\n\nSo for k, the required n is fib[k+2].\n\nThus, for each k, the required n is fib[k+2].\n\nSo in code, for each n, find the maximum k such that fib[k+2] <=n.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nGenerate fib list, where fib[0]=1, fib[1]=2, fib[2]=3, fib[3]=5, etc.\n\nThen, for each n in the input:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor k in range(1, 100): # arbitrary large number\n\n    if fib[k+2] > n:\n\n        break\n\n    max_games = k\n\nSo, the code will loop through k starting from 1, and for each k, check if fib[k+2] is <=n. If yes, update max_games to k. Else, break.\n\nBut wait, how to generate the fib list.\n\nIn Python:\n\nfib = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...]\n\nWe can generate this using a loop.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nGenerate fib list.\n\nInitialize max_games =0.\n\nLoop k from 1 to some upper limit:\n\n   if fib[k+2] >n: break\n\n   else: max_games =k\n\nOutput max_games.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the upper limit for k? Since for n=1018, the maximum possible k is around 40, since fib grows exponentially.\n\nSo generating up to, say, 50 terms is sufficient.\n\nNow, testing:\n\nSample Input: 2,3,4,10.\n\nSample Output: 1,2,2,4.\n\nTesting for n=2:\n\nfib[k+2] for k=1 is fib[3]=2 <=2 →max_games=1.\n\nk=2: fib[4]=3>2 →break. So output 1.\n\nn=3:\n\nk=1: fib[3]=2<=3 →max_games=1.\n\nk=2: fib[4]=3<=3 →max_games=2.\n\nk=3: fib[5]=5>3 →break. Output 2.\n\nn=4:\n\nk=1: 2<=4 →max=1.\n\nk=2:3<=4 →max=2.\n\nk=3:5>4 →break. Output 2.\n\nn=10:\n\nk=1:2<=10 →max=1.\n\nk=2:3<=10 →max=2.\n\nk=3:5<=10 →max=3.\n\nk=4:8<=10 →max=4.\n\nk=5:13>10 →break. So output 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nk=1:2<=5 →max=1.\n\nk=2:3<=5 →max=2.\n\nk=3:5<=5 →max=3.\n\nk=4:8>5 →break. Output 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nk=1:2<=6 →max=1.\n\nk=2:3 →max=2.\n\nk=3:5 →max=3.\n\nk=4:8>6 →break. So output 3.\n\nn=7:\n\nSame as above.\n\nn=8:\n\nk=1:2 →max=1.\n\nk=2:3 →max=2.\n\nk=3:5 →max=3.\n\nk=4:8 →max=4.\n\nk=5:13>8 →break. Output 4.\n\nn=9: same as 8, since 8<=9<13.\n\nn=13:\n\nk=1:2 →1.\n\nk=2:3 →2.\n\nk=3:5 →3.\n\nk=4:8 →4.\n\nk=5:13 →5.\n\nk=6:21>13 →break. Output 5.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nSo the plan is to generate the fib list, then for each n, find the maximum k where fib[k+2] <=n.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo, first, generate the fib list.\n\nWe can do this with a loop:\n\nfib = [1, 2]\n\nwhile the next number doesn't exceed some limit (like 1e5):\n\n   next = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n   if next exceeds 1e5, break.\n\n   append to fib.\n\nWait, but for our purposes, generating up to fib[40] is enough.\n\nLet me write code to generate the fib list.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for each n, find the maximum k.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe input is a single integer, but the sample shows that it's given as a list of strings. Wait, in the problem statement, the input is a single line with n, but the sample shows ['2','3','4','10'] as input. So perhaps the actual input is a single line with multiple integers, but the code can read the entire line, split into integers.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single integer n.\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps the actual input is a single integer.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018).\n\nAh, so the input is a single integer, not a list.\n\nSo in code, read the integer from stdin.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n1. Read n from stdin.\n\n2. Generate the fib list up to fib[45], which is way beyond 1018.\n\n3. For each k from 1 upwards, check if fib[k+2] <=n.\n\n4. Find the maximum k where this holds.\n\n5. Print k.\n\nSo now, implement this.\n\nTesting with n=2:\n\nfib list after generation: [1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, ... ]\n\nFor k=1: fib[3] =3. 3>2 →no.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for k=1, fib[k+2] is fib[3]=3.\n\nWhich is larger than n=2, so k=1 is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when k=1, fib[3]=2? Or wait, perhaps my fib list is incorrectly indexed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the fib list.\n\nWait, perhaps the fib list should start as [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...], where fib[0] =1, fib[1]=2, fib[2]=3, fib[3]=5, etc.\n\nWait, let's correct the fib list:\n\nfib[0] =1\n\nfib[1]=2\n\nfib[2]=3\n\nfib[3]=5\n\nfib[4]=8\n\nfib[5]=13\n\nSo for k=1, fib[k+2] = fib[3] =5.\n\nWhich is larger than 2.\n\nSo for n=2, the maximum k is 0?\n\nNo, that can't be. Because for n=2, the winner can play 1 game.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial mapping is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps fib is zero-based, and for each k, the required n is fib[k+1].\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nk=1: fib[2] =3.\n\nWhich is larger than n=2.\n\nHmm, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fib list is 1-based, with fib[1]=1, fib[2]=2, fib[3]=3, fib[4]=5, etc.\n\nSo for k=1: fib[k+2] = fib[3]=3.\n\nWhich is larger than n=2.\n\nThis suggests that for n=2, the maximum k is 0, which is impossible.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake in the initial mapping.\n\nPerhaps the minimal n for k games is fib(k+1).\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nk=1: minimal n is 2.\n\nfib(k+1)=fib(2)=2.\n\nYes.\n\nk=2: minimal n is 3.\n\nfib(k+1)=fib(3)=3.\n\nYes.\n\nk=3: minimal n is 5.\n\nfib(4)=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo perhaps the correct mapping is that for k games, the minimal n is fib(k+1).\n\nThus, the condition is fib(k+1) <=n.\n\nSo for n=2, k=1 is allowed since fib(2)=2<=2.\n\nFor n=3, k=2 is allowed since fib(3)=3<=3.\n\nThus, the code should find the maximum k where fib(k+1) <=n.\n\nSo the code should generate a fib list where fib[1]=1, fib[2]=2, fib[3]=3, fib[4]=5, etc.\n\nThus, for each n, the maximum k is the largest integer where fib(k+1) <=n.\n\nSo for each n, find the maximum k such that fib(k+1) <=n.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprecompute fib as [1,2,3,5,8,13,21, ... ].\n\nfor each n:\n\nmax_k =0\n\nfor k in 1 to 45:\n\n   if fib[k+1] >n:\n\n       break\n\n   else:\n\n       max_k =k\n\nprint(max_k)\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nSample n=2:\n\nfib[k+1] for k=1 is fib[2]=2 <=2 →max_k=1.\n\nk=2: fib[3]=3>2 →break. So output 1.\n\nSample n=3:\n\nk=1: fib[2]=2<=3 →max_k=1.\n\nk=2: fib[3]=3<=3 →max_k=2.\n\nk=3: fib[4]=5>3 →break. Output 2.\n\nSample n=4:\n\nk=1:2<=4 →max=1.\n\nk=2:3<=4 →max=2.\n\nk=3:5>4 →break. Output 2.\n\nSample n=5:\n\nk=1:2<=5 →1.\n\nk=2:3<=5 →2.\n\nk=3:5<=5 →3.\n\nk=4:8>5 →break. Output 3.\n\nSample n=10:\n\nk=1:2<=10 →1.\n\nk=2:3<=10 →2.\n\nk=3:5<=10 →3.\n\nk=4:8<=10 →4.\n\nk=5:13>10 →break. Output 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5 →3.\n\nn=6: same as 5.\n\nn=8: k=4 (fib[5]=5<=8, fib[6]=8<=8 →k=4).\n\nn=9: same.\n\nn=13: fib[6]=8<=13, fib[7]=13<=13 →k=5.\n\nn=14: same as 13.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo the code should generate a fib list where fib[1]=1, fib[2]=2, fib[3]=3, fib[4]=5, etc.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nGenerate fib as:\n\nfib = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 1e18:  # some large number\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nThen, for each n:\n\nmax_k =0\n\nfor k in range(1, len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[k+1] >n:\n\n        break\n\n    max_k =k\n\nreturn max_k.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nmax_k =0\n\nfor k in range(1, len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[k+1] > n:\n\n        break\n\n    max_k =k\n\nprint(max_k)\n\nWait, but let's test for n=1: but n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code handles all n>=2.\n\nTesting for n=2:\n\nfib[2]=2, which is <=2 →k=1.\n\nn=3: fib[3]=3 →k=2.\n\nn=4: fib[3]=3<=4 →k=2.\n\nn=5: fib[4]=5 →k=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the fib list is built with fib[0]=1, fib[1]=2, fib[2]=3, fib[3]=5, etc.\n\nSo for k=1, fib[k+1] is fib[2]=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in. The tournament follows a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the Fibonacci number at position `k+1`. Thus, for a given number of players `n`, the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest `k` such that the Fibonacci number at position `k+1` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a large enough value to cover all possible inputs (up to 1018).\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: For each input `n`, find the largest `k` such that the Fibonacci number at position `k+1` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [1, 2]\nwhile True:\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n        break\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nmax_k = 0\nfor k in range(1, len(fib)):\n    if fib[k + 1] > n:\n        break\n    max_k = k\n\nprint(max_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`.\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Sequence**: We generate the Fibonacci sequence starting from `[1, 2]` and continue until the next number exceeds \\(10^{18}\\).\n3. **Finding Maximum Games**: For each `k`, starting from 1, we check if the Fibonacci number at position `k+1` is less than or equal to `n`. If it is, we update the maximum number of games `max_k` to `k`. If not, we break out of the loop.\n4. **Output Result**: Finally, we print the maximum number of games `max_k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of the problem.",
