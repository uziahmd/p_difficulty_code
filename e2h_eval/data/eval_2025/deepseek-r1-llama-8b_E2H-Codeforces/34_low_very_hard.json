And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. \n\nHmm, let me break down what's given. We have n days of sleep data and k consecutive days make up a week. So, the number of weeks we need to consider is n - k + 1. For each week (which is a consecutive k days), we calculate the sum of sleep hours, then find the average over all these weeks.\n\nWait, right. So for example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3. Each week contributes its sum, then divide by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has n and k, second line has the list of a_i.\n2. Compute the sum for each sliding window of size k in the array a.\n3. Sum all those window sums and divide by the number of windows (n-k+1) to get the average.\n4. Output the average with at least 6 decimal digits, ensuring precision.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently compute the sliding window sums? Because if n is up to 2e5, a naive approach might be too slow.\n\nYes, so for efficiency, I should use a method that computes each window sum in O(1) after the initial setup. One way is to precompute the prefix sums and then compute each window sum as prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]. That would be O(n) time.\n\nLet me think about that. The prefix sum array can be built by adding each element cumulatively. Then for each window starting at index i (0-based?), the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. So for i from 0 to n-k inclusive.\n\nWait, let's see: if the array is 0-based, then for the first window (days 1 to k), it's prefix[k] - prefix[0]. Then for the next window, days 2 to k+1, it's prefix[k+1] - prefix[1], etc., up to i = (n -k), which gives prefix[n] - prefix[n -k]. So the total number of windows is n -k +1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array.\n- Iterate through each possible starting index of the window, compute the sum using the prefix array.\n- Sum all these window sums.\n- Divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nThat makes sense. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. The first line is two integers n and k. The second line is n integers.\n\nThen, compute the prefix sum. Initialize prefix[0] = 0. Then prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1], assuming a is 0-based. Or perhaps it's easier to have a list where prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So for 1-based indexing, prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose the array a has indices 0 to n-1. Then the prefix sum array will have prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum of a[0..n-1]. \n\nThen, for a window starting at index s (0-based) and of length k, the sum is prefix[s + k] - prefix[s]. But since the starting index s can go up to (n - k), because s + k must be <= n.\n\nSo for each s in 0 to (n -k), inclusive, compute the window sum.\n\nOnce I have all the window sums, sum them all and divide by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable with O(n) algorithms.\n\nBut wait, what about handling the prefix sum? Let's see:\n\nImplementing the prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0]\ncurrent_sum = 0\nfor num in a:\n    current_sum += num\n    prefix.append(current_sum)\n\nThen, for each s in range(0, n -k +1):\n    window_sum = prefix[s +k] - prefix[s]\n    add to total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code structure will be:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the sum of each window.\n\nDivide by the number of windows.\n\nPrint the result with 10 decimal digits, but according to the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such windows within the given sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, we read the input values which include the number of days (n), the length of each week (k), and the sequence of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Compute Prefix Sums**: We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the cumulative sum of sleep times from the start up to the i-th day. This helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we can compute the sum of each window of size k in constant time. For each starting index of the window, the sum is derived by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end of the window.\n4. **Calculate Average**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the total number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Output the Result**: The result is printed with a precision of at least 6 decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    k = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0.0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for s in range(num_windows):\n        end = s + k\n        window_sum = prefix[end] - prefix[s]\n        total += window_sum\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into manageable parts. The first two values are n and k, followed by the sleep times for each day.\n- **Prefix Sum Array**: This array is constructed to allow quick calculation of the sum of any subarray. Each element at index i in the prefix array represents the sum of the first i elements in the sleep times array.\n- **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible starting index of the window, the sum is calculated using the prefix sums, ensuring efficient computation.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to find the average sleep time per week.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to ensure it meets the required precision of at least 6 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and compute the required average in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
