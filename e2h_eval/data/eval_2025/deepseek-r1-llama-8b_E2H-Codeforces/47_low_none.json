    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add k to both a and b. Wait, let's think about the expressions (a + k) and (b + k). Since they are being added by the same k, their difference remains the same as (b - a), but wait, no, because if a < b, then b +k - (a +k) = b -a. So the difference between them is fixed.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. The difference between a +k and b +k is the same as b - a or a - b, depending on which is larger. So the two numbers are always d apart, where d is the absolute difference between a and b.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 6 and b is 10, then d is 4. Then the numbers we're considering are 6 +k and 10 +k, which differ by 4.\n\nNow, the LCM of two numbers can be minimized when their product is as small as possible, but maybe not directly applicable here. Wait, noâ€”since LCM(x,y) = x*y / GCD(x,y). So for two numbers differing by d, how can we find x and y such that their GCD is as large as possible?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since the two numbers differ by d, let's denote x = a + k, y = b + k. So y = x + d if a < b, else x = y + d.\n\nBut regardless, the difference is fixed as |a - b|. Let's call this d. So for any k, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x = a +k (assuming a <= b, but it doesn't matter because d is the absolute difference).\n\nSo now, the LCM of x and x +d is equal to (x*(x+d)) / GCD(x, x+d). But since x and x+d have a GCD of g, which divides d. Because GCD(x, x + d) = GCD(x, d). Right? Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, let me denote g = GCD(x, d). Then, the LCM becomes x*(x +d)/g. Wait, but since x and x+d are co-prime in some way.\n\nWait, let's see: since x and x +d have GCD g, which must divide d. So, d = g * m, where m is some integer.\n\nThen x can be written as g * t, where t and m are coprime (because x and d share GCD g, so after factoring out g from x and d, the remaining parts are coprime).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding x such that x = a +k, and the LCM of x and x +d is minimized, with d fixed.\n\nSince d is fixed, perhaps the optimal x is a multiple of some divisor of d. Or maybe x should be chosen such that x and x +d have a large GCD, thus reducing the LCM.\n\nBecause LCM(x, x+d) = x*(x+d) / GCD(x, x+d). So to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the GCD.\n\nSo, to maximize GCD(x, x +d), which is the same as GCD(x, d), because GCD(x, x+d) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, the maximum possible GCD is the largest divisor of d, but also such that x is a multiple of that divisor.\n\nSo, the approach is: find the divisors of d, and for each divisor g, compute x = a +k, which must be a multiple of g. Then, the minimal LCM would be achieved when x is the smallest possible multiple of g that is >= a (since k is non-negative, x must be at least a).\n\nWait, not exactly. Because x can be any multiple of g, but choosing the smallest x would make x as small as possible, which could lead to a smaller LCM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k is determined by choosing x such that x is a multiple of the greatest common divisor (g) of d and x.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider all possible divisors of d, and for each possible g (divisor of d), compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and then compute the LCM for each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key observation is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) remains constant as \\( |a - b| \\). Let's denote this difference as \\( d \\). Thus, we need to minimize the LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\), where \\( x = a + k \\).\n\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of two numbers can be expressed as \\( \\text{LCM}(x, x + d) = \\frac{x(x + d)}{\\text{GCD}(x, x + d)} \\). Since \\( \\text{GCD}(x, x + d) = \\text{GCD}(x, d) \\), we aim to maximize this GCD to minimize the LCM.\n\n3. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: We consider all divisors \\( g \\) of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\), we compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to \\( a \\). This gives us potential candidates for \\( x \\) and thus \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Optimal \\( k \\)**: For each candidate \\( x \\), compute the corresponding \\( k \\) as \\( k = x - a \\). Track the \\( k \\) that yields the smallest LCM, choosing the smallest \\( k \\) in case of ties.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Function to compute the best k for given d\n    def find_best_k(d):\n        best_lcm = float('inf')\n        best_k = 0\n        # Find all divisors of d\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n            if d % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(d // i)\n        # Iterate through all possible divisors\n        for g in divisors:\n            # Compute the minimal x which is a multiple of g and >= a\n            remainder = a % g\n            if remainder == 0:\n                x = a\n            else:\n                x = a + (g - remainder)\n            y = x + d\n            current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n            # Calculate k\n            k = x - a\n            if current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k < best_k):\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k\n        return best_k\n    \n    k = find_best_k(d)\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n3. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: Generate all divisors of \\( d \\) to explore potential candidates for maximizing the GCD.\n4. **Evaluate Candidates**: For each divisor, determine the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of the divisor and compute the corresponding \\( k \\).
