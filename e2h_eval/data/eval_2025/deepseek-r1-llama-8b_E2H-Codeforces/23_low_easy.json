In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Japanese mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). \n\nHmm, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' means suit s, number 1. The output should be three integers: for each of the three input tiles, the minimal number of draws needed so that after adding those, the entire collection contains at least one mentsu. Or wait, no—wait, the output is three numbers corresponding to each input line, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, looking back, the sample input is three lines, but the output is three numbers, like ['0', '0', '1'], which seems to correspond to each of the three initial hands. So I think the problem is, for each of the three initial hands, compute how many tiles need to be drawn to get a mentsu in that particular hand, considering all possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem statement is asking, given her current three tiles, what is the minimal number of additional tiles she needs to draw so that across all her tiles (current plus drawn), there exists at least one mentsu. But the output is three numbers, one for each initial tile? No, that can't be right. Looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo for the first case, she already has a shuntsu (1s,2s,3s). So she needs 0 more. The second case is three 9m's, which is a koutsu, so 0 more. The third case is 3p, 9m, 2p. She can add 1p or 4p to complete a shuntsu (like 2p,3p,4p or 1p,2p,3p). So the output is 1 for the third tile.\n\nWait, but that's per initial tile? Or per the entire set? No, that makes no sense. Oh, perhaps the output is for each of the three initial tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles to add to just that single tile to form a mentsu. But that also doesn't fit the sample.\n\nWait, no, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three initial hands. So each initial hand is considered separately. So for each of the three initial hands, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the hand (the three original plus added ones) has at least one mentsu. Because the sample input shows each initial hand is treated individually.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is described is: she has three tiles in her hand. She can draw any number of tiles, including duplicates of existing ones. So the question is, after drawing some tiles, the total set must contain at least one mentsu. So for each possible way she could have tiles, what's the minimal number of tiles she needs to add to reach a mentsu.\n\nBut the output is three numbers, each for the three input cases. So perhaps the output is for each of the three initial tiles, what is the minimal number of tiles needed to add to that specific tile to form a mentsu, considering that she could add to any of the three tiles. Wait, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the output. Looking at the problem statement again: \"Print a single integer—the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\" Wait, no! Wait, the sample output is an array of three integers. So I think the problem is that for each of the three initial hands, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles to add to that hand (so the three-tile hand plus the added ones) to form at least one mentsu. Because the sample input has three initial hands, and the output is three numbers.\n\nSo the task is: for each of the three given hands, determine the minimal number of tiles to draw such that the combined collection (original plus drawn) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nAh, okay. So for each of the three initial hands, we compute the minimal number of tiles needed to be drawn to form a mentsu. Then, the output is these three numbers.\n\nSo the approach is: for each initial hand, generate all possible ways to add tiles (including zero) to form a mentsu, then find the minimal",
