Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on their sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the triangle has sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, it's required that x, y, z form a non-degenerate triangle, which means x + y > z must hold because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here (because C ≤ z ≤ D and C ≥ B), the condition simplifies to x + y > z.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Because x can be up to B, y can be up to C, but z starts at C and goes up to D. So in all cases, z is at least as big as y and x. So for the triangle inequality, the only necessary condition is x + y > z. Because if z is larger than or equal to y, then x + z will definitely be larger than y, and y + z is larger than x. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C, z is between C and D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, especially when B, C, D are large, like up to 5e5, iterating through each possible x, y, z would be too slow. So I need an efficient way to calculate this without brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's fix x and y. Then for each such pair (x, y), I need to find the number of z's that are >= C and <= min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are from max(C, ...) to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nWait, but z can't be less than C. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is the minimum of D and x+y-1. But wait, x + y - 1 could be less than C. In that case, there are no valid z's for that (x, y) pair.\n\nSo the idea is to iterate over x and y, compute the maximum possible z (which is min(x + y - 1, D)), and then see if that z is >= C. If so, the number of z's is max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1). But wait, no: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So if the upper bound is u and lower is l, then it's u >= l ? (u - l + 1) : 0.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the count is max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C.\n\nBut considering that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C, the total number of (x, y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). But when B and C are up to 5e5, this product could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big to handle with a loop. So we can't do this directly.\n\nThis suggests that we need a mathematical approach to calculate the sum efficiently, without iterating through each x and y.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can precompute for each possible y the range of x and then find how many x's for each y contribute to the sum. Or maybe find a way to represent the problem in terms of sums and integrals.\n\nWait, another approach: Since x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and z is in [C, D], and we need x + y > z. For each z, what is the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z?\n\nBut z varies from C to D. So for each z, we can compute how many (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z, and then sum over all z in [C, D].\n\nBut again, z can be up to 5e5, so if we process each z, that's manageable as long as for each z we can compute the count quickly.\n\nWait, but the sum is over z, which may be O(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each z in [C, D], compute the number",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) such that \\( A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D \\) holds. The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, which simplifies to \\( x + y > z \\) given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the ranges for \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), we can derive that \\( z \\) is always the largest side. Thus, the key condition to check is \\( x + y > z \\).\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of \\( z \\)**: For each possible value of \\( z \\) from \\( C \\) to \\( D \\), determine the number of valid pairs \\( (x, y) \\) such that \\( x + y > z \\). This reduces the problem to checking for each \\( z \\) how many pairs \\( (x, y) \\) satisfy the condition.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation for Each \\( z \\)**: For each \\( z \\), the valid \\( x \\) values are in the range \\([A, B]\\) and the valid \\( y \\) values are in the range \\([B, C]\\). We need to count pairs where \\( x + y > z \\). This can be transformed into a mathematical problem where we find the number of valid \\( y \\) values for each \\( x \\) or vice versa.\n\n4. **Mathematical Transformation**: For each \\( z \\), compute the minimum \\( x \\) such that \\( x + B > z \\) and then sum the valid \\( y \\) values for each \\( x \\) in the range. This allows us to efficiently count the valid pairs without iterating through all possible pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n    # Precompute the prefix sums for y's contribution\n    y_min = B\n    y_max = C\n    y_values = list(range(y_min, y_max + 1))\n    \n    # For each z in [C, D], calculate the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z\n    total = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        # We need x + y > z => y > z - x\n        # For each x in [A, B], find the minimal y that satisfies y > z - x\n        # Since y >= B, the condition becomes y > max(z - x, B-1)\n        # So for each x, the required y starts from max(B, z - x + 1)\n        # But y must also be <= C\n        # The lower bound for y is max(B, z - x + 1)\n        # The upper bound is C\n        # So if lower > upper, no contribution.
