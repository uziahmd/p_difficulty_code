He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A starts with a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's added must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C adds the 'c's. Or it could be equal to both.\n\nOur task is to determine for a given string whether it could have been produced through this process.\n\nHmm, so the string must first consist of a bunch of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the structure must be aaaabbbbc ccc... but more precisely, all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. If there are any other characters out of order, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but what about the counts? Let me think.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- After A: all 'a's, count_a = x, where x >= 1.\n- After B: same 'a's, then 'b's. count_b = y, y >=1. So total length is x + y, which is at least 2.\n- Then C appends some 'c's. The count_c must be equal to count_a (x) or count_b (y). Also, since C appends, all 'c's must come after the 'b's. So the structure is a^x b^y c^z, where z = x or z = y or z = min(x,y)? Wait no, because z can be either x or y, whichever. So for example, if x=3 and y=5, z can be 3 or 5.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: when C appends, the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's before C appends. So z must be either x or y. But wait, x and y are the counts before C adds. So when C adds, the new counts become x, y, z, where z = x or y.\n\nSo for the string, the counts of a, b, c must satisfy:\n\ncount_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the order matters. The string must be a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a+ b+ c+.\n\nIf it's not, like if there's a 'c' before a 'b', or 'b' before 'a', or any other letters mixed in, then return NO.\n\n2. Once we confirm the correct order, compute the counts of a, b, c.\n\n3. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n4. Additionally, we need to ensure that the count of a is at least 1, count of b is at least 1, and count of c is at least 1 (since C appends some 'c's).\n\nWait, yes. Because in the process, after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends at least one 'c'? Or can it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\". So zero is possible? No, because the note says that in the end, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b', but after C appends. Wait, no: the initial process is that A gives to B, who appends some 'b's, ensuring that there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then B gives to C, who appends some 'c's, which could be zero? Or is it required to be non-zero?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that C appends some number of 'c's. Hmm, \"some number\" might include zero? Or does \"some\" imply at least one? Because in English, \"some\" often means one or more. So perhaps C must append at least one 'c'.\n\nBut let's read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says: C appends some number of 'c's. It's possible that the number equals both a and b counts.\n\nAh, but in the note, for the third example, the count of 'c' is equal to the count of 'b's. So in that case, perhaps the count can be equal to either.\n\nWait, but in any case, the string must have at least one 'c' because C",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. A starts with a string of 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end.\n3. C appends some 'c's, where the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's before appending.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: Ensure the string is in the form `a^x b^y c^z`, where x, y, z are counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's respectively, and each segment must appear in order without any other characters interrupting.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Check Conditions**: Verify that:\n   - The count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n   - The count of 'a's is at least 1.\n   - The count of 'b's is at least 1.\n   - The count of 'c's is at least 1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string has correct order: all a's first, then b's, then c's\norder = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c == 'a':\n        order.append('a')\n    elif c == 'b':\n        if order[-1] != 'a':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n        order.append('b')\n    elif c == 'c':\n        if order[-1] != 'b':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n        order.append('c')\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Now check counts\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The string must be structured such that all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. If any character appears out of this order, the string is invalid.\n2. **Character Counts**: After confirming the order, we count the occurrences of each character.\n3. **Validation**: We ensure that each segment (a, b, c) has at least one character and that the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structure and the required conditions for the string to be valid according to the problem's constraints.",
