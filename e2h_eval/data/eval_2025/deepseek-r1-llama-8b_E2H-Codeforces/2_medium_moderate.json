Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Wait, no: the problem says both diagonals are the same. So the diagonal and anti-diagonal must consist of the same letter each, but all the other cells must be another single letter.\n\nWait, let me re-read the condition:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nOh right, so the two diagonals must each consist of the same letter, but perhaps different between the two? Or wait, no. Because the first part says both diagonals are the same. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be the same character.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the second test case is 3x3:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is w, s, w? No, wait, no. Wait, for n=3, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So the letters are 'w', 'w', 'w'? Because the first row is 'wsw', so position (0,0) is 'w', (1,1) is 'w' (since the second row is 'sws'), (2,2) is 'w'. So main diagonal is all 'w's.\n\nThe anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Letters are 'w', 'w', 'w'. So both diagonals are same, and all others are 's's. So yes, it's an X.\n\nAnother example: the third test case is 3x3:\n\nx p x\np x p\nx p x\n\nWait, the first row is 'xpx', so (0,0) is 'x', (0,2) is 'x'. Second row 'p x p'—so (1,1) is 'x'. Third row 'x p x'—so (2,0) is 'x', (2,2) is 'x'. So main diagonal is 'x', 'x', 'x'; anti-diagonal is 'x', 'x', 'x'. But the center is also 'x'. So the other cells are 'p's. So the condition is met because the diagonals are the same, and the other cells are all 'p's. So the output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, but the sample output for the third test case is 'NO'. Oh, wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe third input is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'. Wait, the third line is 'xpe', which is three letters. So the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nSo the main diagonal is (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So the main diagonal has x, x, e. That's not the same. So the condition fails. Hence the output is 'NO'.\n\nSo, in the code, I need to:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. For each cell in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, check that all are the same as each other.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that both diagonals consist of the same letter. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must each be the same, but possibly different from each other?\n\nNo, no. The problem says both diagonals have the same letter. So the entire main diagonal and the entire anti-diagonal must each consist of the same letter. So the main diagonal can be any letter, but all of its cells must be the same. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Moreover, both diagonals must be the same letter.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"... on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; ...\"\n\nWait, does this mean that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must each be the same, or that both together are the same? Oh, the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;\"\n\nAh, so both diagonals must consist of the same letter. So, the main diagonal must be all the same character, say 'a', and the anti-diagonal must be all 'a's as well.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the wording says \"on both diagonals... all letters are the same\". So, the letters on both diagonals are same across both. So, all letters on both diagonals are same. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x's and the anti-diagonal is all 'x's, then that's fine. But if the main is all 'x's and the anti is all 'y's, then it's not allowed.\n\nSo, the main diagonal must be all the same character, the anti-diagonal must be all the same character, and those two characters must be the same.\n\nWait, no. Because the condition is that both diagonals have the same letter. So, the main and anti-diagonals must each be entirely the same character, but that same character for both. Or wait, perhaps the main and anti-diagonal must be the same across both.\n\nFor example, in the sample input 2:\n\nThe main diagonal is all 'w's. The anti-diagonal is also all 'w's. So, both are same.\n\nIn sample input 3, the main diagonal has 'x', 'x', 'e'—so not all same. So condition fails.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check that all cells on the main diagonal are the same. Let's call this char 'd'.\n- Check that all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same. Let's call this char 'a'.\n- Check that 'd' equals 'a'.\n- Then, check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and different from 'd'.\n\nWait, no. Because according to the problem statement, all non-diagonal cells must be the same, and different from the diagonal cells.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and the grid.\n\n2. Extract the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\n3. Check that main diagonal is all same character d.\n\n4. Check that anti-diagonal is all same character a.\n\n5. If d != a, then it's invalid.\n\n6. Then, check that all other cells (those not on either diagonal) are same as each other and equal to some other character c, which is different from d.\n\nWait, but d must equal a, right? Because step 5 would have failed if d != a.\n\nSo after ensuring that d == a, we proceed.\n\nThen, all non-diagonal cells must be same and different from d.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nCheck main diagonal all same, get d.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal all same, get a.\n\nIf d != a: return NO.\n\nElse, check that all other cells are same and not equal to d.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else NO.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, for a grid represented as a list of strings, each string is a row.\n\nThe main diagonal is for i in 0 to n-1, grid[i][i].\n\nAnti-diagonal is for i in 0 to n-1, grid[i][n-1 - i].\n\nSo for each of these, collect their characters.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck if all in main_diag are same.\n\nSimilarly for anti_diag.\n\nIf main_diag[0] != main_diag[0], no.\n\nWait, better to loop through each element in the main and anti-diagonal and ensure they're the same as the first element.\n\nAlso, check that the main and anti-diagonal have the same value.\n\nOnce that's done, collect the other cells.\n\nOther cells are all (i,j) where i != j and i + j != n-1.\n\nWait, no: the cells not on either diagonal.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if i == j (main diag) or i + j == n-1 (anti diag), then it's on a diagonal. Else, it's not.\n\nSo, for all such cells, check that their character is same as each other, and different from d.\n\nSo, for each cell not on either diagonal:\n\nCollect their characters into a list.\n\nIf the list is empty: then all cells are on diagonals, so it's possible only if n is 1, but n >=3, so for n=3, the four corners are on diagonals, but the center is not. Wait, for n=3, the center is on both diagonals, actually. Because for i=1, j=1: i == j, and i + j = 2, which for n=3 is 2, so yes, it's on both.\n\nWait, no: for i=1 and j=1 in n=3, i + j = 2, which is equal to n-1 (2). So the center is on both diagonals.\n\nSo for n=3, the center is counted in both diagonals.\n\nSo, for n=3, the number of cells on diagonals is 3 (main) + 3 (anti) - 1 (overlap) = 5 cells. So, 5 cells, and 4 other cells? No, wait, n=3 has 3x3=9 cells. 5 are on diagonals (3+3-1), so 4 are not. But in n=3, the four corners are on diagonals, and the middle is also on both.\n\nWait, for i=0, j=0: on main.\n\ni=0, j=2: on anti.\n\ni=2, j=0: on anti.\n\ni=2, j=2: on main.\n\ni=1, j=1: on both.\n\nSo 5 cells are on diagonals. The remaining 4 cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSo, for each of these four, their letters must be same and different from d.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].\n\nThen, main_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\n\nCheck if all elements in main_diag are same.\n\nSimilarly for anti_diag.\n\nIf main_diag[0] != main_diag[-1], then invalid.\n\nSame for anti_diag.\n\nIf main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0], then invalid.\n\nElse, d = main_diag[0] (since all are same, and equal to anti_diag[0]).\n\nNow, collect all the other cells.\n\nothers = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            continue\n\n        others.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(others) == 0:\n\n    # All cells are on diagonals. So, for this to be valid, all must be same as d, and since there are no others, the condition is satisfied only if the other cells (none) are same. So in this case, it's valid only if all cells are same as d.\n\n    # But wait, in this case, all cells are on diagonals, which for n=1 is true, but n>=3.\n\n    # For n=3, it's not possible for all cells to be on diagonals except the center. So when n=3, the others include 4 cells.\n\n    # So when n=3, others will have 4 cells. So len(others) cannot be zero.\n\n    # So, perhaps only n=1 could have len(others) zero, but the problem states n >=3 and odd.\n\n    # So, perhaps in our case, len(others) can't be zero. So this condition may never be hit. But to be safe, think.\n\nBut wait, for n=5, the diagonals are 5 each, overlapping at the center. So 5 +5 -1=9 cells on diagonals. 25-9=16 cells not on diagonals.\n\nSo, others will have 16 cells.\n\nSo, in code, others will always have some cells except for n=1.\n\nBut for our problem, n is at least 3.\n\nSo, for others:\n\nall same character, and different from d.\n\nSo, if len(others) ==0, then it's automatically valid? But for n=3, others is 4 cells. So, perhaps in code, if others is empty, which can happen when n=1, but n is given as odd and >=3, so no.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nCheck if all elements in others are same as others[0].\n\nAnd others[0] != d.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nAll four non-diagonal cells are same, and different from d.\n\nYes: YES.\n\nCase 2: n=5.\n\nEverything is similar.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, and the main and anti-diagonals are same, but the others are not same.\n\nLike:\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nNo, because the others are x as well. So it's all x. So diagonals are x, and others are x, which is same as d. So condition fails because others must be different.\n\nWait, in this case, the others are x as well. So they are same as d. So the condition requires others to be same and different from d. So this case would output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all on diagonals same, others same and different.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, main diagonal is 'x's, anti-diagonal is 'x's. Others are 'o's.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: main diag is 'x's, anti-diag is 'x's, others are 'x's as well. Then others are same as d, which is not allowed. So output NO.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCompute main_diag and anti_diag.\n\nCheck main_diag all same: if not, NO.\n\nCheck anti_diag all same: if not, NO.\n\nCheck main_diag[0] == anti_diag[0]: else, NO.\n\nElse, d = main_diag[0].\n\nCheck others: all same, and not equal to d.\n\nIf all, output YES else NO.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diag\nif not all(c == main_diag[0] for c in main_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti diag\nif not all(c == anti_diag[0] for c in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nd = main_diag[0]\n\nothers = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            continue\n        others.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not others:\n    # All cells are on diagonals. Since n >=3, this is only possible if n=3 and all cells are on diagonals except none. Which isn't possible. So, others is non-empty.\n    # So this case can't happen. So no need to handle.\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    # Check if all others are same and not d.\n    if all(c == others[0] for c in others):\n        if others[0] != d:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: for n=1, but n is given as >=3.\n\nSo, for others, if any cell is different from others[0], then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the code above should handle that.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhat's the grid?\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0] = x, grid[1][1]=x, grid[2][2]=x, grid[3][3]=x, grid[4][4]=x. So main diag is all x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: grid[0][4]=x, grid[1][3]=o, grid[2][2]=x, grid[3][1]=x, grid[4][0]=x.\n\nWait, so anti-diag is x, o, x, x, x.\n\nSo anti_diag is not all same. So condition fails. Output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diag: grid[0][0]=w, grid[1][1]=w, grid[2][2]=w. So all w.\n\nAnti-diag: grid[0][2]=w, grid[1][1]=w, grid[2][0]=w. All w.\n\nOthers: (0,1)=s, (1,0)=s, (1,2)=s, (2,1)=s. So others are all s, which is different from w.\n\nSo output YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMain diag: grid[0][0]=x, grid[1][1]=x, grid[2][2]=e. So main diag is x, x, e. Not all same. So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all others same as d.\n\nLike:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nMain diag: a, b, a.\n\nWait, no, wait, for i=0, j=0: a.\n\ni=1, j=1: b.\n\ni=2, j=2: a.\n\nSo main diag is a, b, a. Not all same. So condition fails.\n\nAnother test case: main diag and anti-diag same, others same.\n\nn=5:\n\nxxxxx\n\nx o o x x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx o o o o x\n\nx o o o o x\n\nx xxxxx\n\nWait, main diag is all x.\n\nAnti diag: for each i, j =4-i.\n\nAt i=0, j=4: x.\n\ni=1, j=3: x.\n\ni=2, j=2: o.\n\ni=3, j=1: x.\n\ni=4, j=0: x.\n\nSo anti diag has x, x, o, x, x. So not all same. So condition fails.\n\nThus, code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: main and anti diag same, others same and different.\n\nn=5.\n\nmain diag: all x.\n\nanti diag: all x.\n\nothers: all y.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\".

The anti-diagonal consists of elements where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1`.\n3. **Checking Diagonals:** The code checks if all elements in both diagonals are the same. If not, it immediately prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Consistency Check:** It ensures that the characters on both diagonals are the same.\n5. **Checking Other Cells:** The code collects all non-diagonal elements and checks if they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters. If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all required conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter \"X\".",
