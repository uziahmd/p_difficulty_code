You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. The task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length, more than one vertex, and each vertex occurs at most once in the cycle. Also, we need to find the number of ways to do this.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is what's required for a graph to have such a cycle. Wait, but the graph isn't necessarily connected. So maybe the approach is to look for connected components and see what each can contribute.\n\nWait, but adding edges can connect different components or create cycles within a component. So perhaps the key is to analyze each connected component and see what it's missing to form such a cycle.\n\nLet me think: For each connected component in the graph, if it already has a cycle, then maybe that's part of the solution. But since the problem requires an odd-length cycle, we need to ensure that any existing cycles are not even-length, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait no, the problem is about adding edges to create a cycle of odd length. So perhaps the approach is to find all possible ways where adding certain edges would form an odd-length cycle, either within a single component or across multiple.\n\nBut that sounds complicated. Maybe I should break down the problem into steps.\n\nFirst, let's consider each connected component separately. For each component, what is the minimal number of edges needed to form an odd-length cycle, and how many ways can this be done?\n\nThen, the overall answer depends on whether any component can provide such a cycle, and which one gives the minimal t.\n\nWait, because adding edges between components might allow forming a larger structure that includes an odd cycle, but that might require more edges than just working within a single component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is determined by the component which can form an odd cycle with the least number of additional edges.\n\nSo first, for each connected component, I'll compute two things: the minimal edges needed (t_i) and the number of ways (w_i) to achieve that for that component. Then, the overall t is the minimum among all t_i, and w is the sum of w_i where t_i equals the overall t.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities. Because sometimes, combining multiple components might allow a smaller t than any individual component could provide. Hmm, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have two components, each of which requires 1 edge to form an odd cycle. If they are connected via one edge, adding that edge would create a cycle that's the sum of both cycles? No, wait, cycles are formed by paths returning to the start without repeating nodes. So adding an edge between two components might create a bridge between them, but unless each component has at least a path that forms a cycle, adding that edge won't immediately form a new cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding an edge between two components can create a longer cycle, but only if the combined structure has an odd cycle.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe the optimal approach is to consider each connected component and find for each the minimal edges required to form an odd cycle within that component. Then, the overall minimal t is the smallest t_i across all components, and the number of ways is the sum of w_i for those components.\n\nBecause adding edges within a single component is likely to require fewer edges than bridging components together.\n\nWait, but adding edges between components could potentially allow for a cycle that uses nodes from multiple components. But I think that the minimal t is achieved by considering individual components, because adding edges between components would require at least one edge, but perhaps each component needs some edges as well, making the total t higher.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct: process each connected component, find the minimal t_i for that component, and the minimal t is the smallest among all t_i.\n\nNow, the question is: How do I compute t_i and w_i for each connected component?\n\nEach component is a graph. We need to find the minimal number of edges to add so that there exists a simple cycle of odd length in the resulting graph.\n\nWait, but the cycle must consist of more than one vertex, so the minimal cycle is a triangle (length 3), but if that's not possible, maybe a pentagon (length 5), etc.\n\nSo for each connected component, we need to determine:\n\n- Whether it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding some edges.\n\n- The minimal number of edges needed to achieve this.\n\n- The number of ways to add those edges.\n\nIf a component cannot form any odd-length cycle even after adding edges, then it contributes nothing to the solution.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to add edges anywhere in the graph. So even if a component alone can't form an odd cycle, perhaps combining it with another component could.\n\nBut this complicates things. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph so that it contains a simple cycle of odd length and more than one vertex. Additionally, we need to count the number of ways to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Analysis**: For each connected component in the graph, analyze whether it can form an odd-length cycle with the addition of edges.\n2. **Component Contribution**: For each component, compute the minimal number of edges required to form an odd-length cycle (if possible) and the number of ways to achieve this.\n3. **Edge Addition Strategy**: Consider each component's contribution individually and determine the overall minimum edges needed and the number of ways to achieve this across all components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        v = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Find all connected components\n    visited = [False]*(n+1)\n    components = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            comp = []\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                comp.append(u)\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            components.append(comp)\n\n    # For each component, compute t_i and w_i\n    min_edges = None\n    total_ways = 0\n    for comp in components:\n        k = len(comp)\n        if k == 0:\n            continue\n        # Compute degree of each node in the component\n        degrees = defaultdict(int)\n        for u in comp:\n            degrees[u] = len(adj[u])\n        # Check if the component is already has an odd cycle\n        # We can do BFS to find cycles\n        # But perhaps another approach: check if the component has a cycle of odd length\n        # If the component is a tree, then no cycles.

A tree has exactly n-1 edges and is connected.\n        # Number of edges in the component: original_edges = sum(len(adj[u]) for u in comp) // 2\n        # original_edges = sum(len(adj[u]) for u in comp) // 2\n        # if original_edges == k - 1:\n        #     it's a tree.\n\n        # If the component is a tree, we need to add edges to form a cycle.\n        # To form an odd cycle, we need to create a cycle with an odd number of edges.\n        # Since the tree is connected, adding one edge creates a cycle. But that cycle could be even or odd.\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the degrees.\n\n        # The number of nodes with odd degree in a graph is always even. So in a tree, which is a connected acyclic graph, the number of nodes with odd degree is exactly 2 (since it's connected and has n-1 edges).\n        # So in a tree, two nodes have odd degrees.\n\n        # When we add an edge between two nodes, it changes their degrees by +1 each. So the new degrees become even, but since they were both odd before, adding an edge between them would make the cycle length as 2? No, because a cycle must have at least three edges.\n\n        # Wait, no. Adding an edge between two nodes in a tree creates a cycle. The length of the cycle is the number of edges on the path between those two nodes plus one. So if the path is of length d, the cycle will have d+1 edges.\n\n        # So to get an odd-length cycle, the path between the two nodes must be even in length. Because d+1 needs to be odd, so d must be even.\n\n        # So the minimal way to create an odd cycle in a tree is to find two nodes whose path has even length. Then, adding an edge between them creates a cycle of odd length.\n\n        # So the question becomes, for each tree component, is there such a pair of nodes?\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps the minimal edges needed is 1 if the component is a tree and has at least two nodes.\n\n        # Wait, let's think about a tree with two nodes: adding an edge makes a cycle of length 1, but that's a loop, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\n        # So for a tree with two nodes, it's impossible to form a cycle of length >1. So we need to look for larger trees.\n\n        # For a tree with three nodes: say, 1-2-3. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 creates a triangle, which is an odd cycle of length 3. So that requires one edge.\n\n        # So for any tree with at least three nodes, adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\n        # So for a tree component (which is connected and acyclic), if it has at least three nodes, then t_i is 1, and the number of ways is equal to the number of pairs of nodes whose path has even length.\n\n        # Because each such pair can be connected with an edge to form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So for each tree component with size >=3, t_i=1, and the number of ways is the number of such pairs.\n\n        # Now, for components that are not trees (i.e., they already have cycles):\n\n        # If the component has an odd-length cycle, then t_i=0, and w_i=1.\n\n        # If the component has only even-length cycles, then we need to add edges to create an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # How? Well, adding one edge can sometimes turn an even cycle into an odd one. Or perhaps adding two edges.\n\n        # This seems complex. So perhaps for non-tree components, we can consider:\n\n        # If the component already has an odd cycle, then t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n        # Else, we need to see if adding edges can create an odd cycle.\n\n        # For example, if the component has multiple even-length cycles, adding an edge might create an odd cycle.\n\n        # However, this analysis can get complicated. So perhaps it's easier to handle trees and other components separately.\n\n        # So, for each component, determine if it's a tree. If it is and its size is >=3, then t_i=1, and the number of ways is the number of valid pairs.\n\n        # Otherwise, check if the component already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n        # Otherwise, the component cannot contribute to the solution.\n\n        # So, how to check if a component already has an odd-length cycle?\n\n        # One way is to perform BFS to find cycles and check their lengths.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use the fact that in any graph, if the number of edges is greater than or equal to the number of vertices, and it's connected, then it's not a tree, and may have cycles.\n\n        # But checking for cycles is computationally expensive for large graphs.\n\n        # Another approach is to note that in a graph where every node has even degree, all cycles are of even length. So if the component has at least one node with an odd degree, then it has an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # Wait, no. That's not necessarily true. For example, a graph with two triangles sharing a common node: each node in the shared node has degree 4 (even), but the cycles are of odd length.\n\n        # Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the presence of any node with an odd degree implies that there exists an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # Yes, because in any graph, the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. If there is at least one node with odd degree, then there must be at least two. These two can be part of an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # So for a component, if it has at least one node with an odd degree, then it contains an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # Therefore, for a component:\n\n        # If it's a tree (so number of edges is |V| - 1), then it has exactly two nodes with odd degrees. Thus, it can form an odd cycle by adding one edge.\n\n        # If it's not a tree and has at least one node with an odd degree, then it already contains an odd cycle.\n\n        # If it's not a tree and all nodes have even degrees, then all cycles are even-length, and thus cannot form an odd cycle without adding edges.\n\n        # So, for each component:\n\n        # Case 1: It's a tree and |V| >=3. Then t_i=1, ways_i = number of pairs of nodes with even path length.\n\n        # Case 2: Not a tree and has at least one node with odd degree. Then t_i=0, ways_i=1.\n\n        # Case 3: Not a tree and all nodes have even degrees. Then, to form an odd cycle, we need to add edges.\n\n        # For case 3, it's more complex. We might need to find the minimal edges to add.\n\n        # So, in code, for each component:\n\n        # Check if it's a tree: edges == |V| -1.\n\n        # If it's a tree and |V| >=3: compute ways as the number of valid pairs.\n\n        # Else if not a tree and has any node with odd degree: t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n        # Else (not a tree, all even degrees): need to find the minimal edges to add.\n\n        # So, for case 3, the component has all even degrees. To form an odd cycle, we need to add edges such that some cycle becomes odd.\n\n        # One approach is to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle.\n\n        # Since all nodes have even degrees, adding an edge can change the parity of degrees.\n\n        # But I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to model this as finding the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle.\n\n        # This seems complicated. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that such cases are rare and handle them appropriately.\n\n        # For now, let's proceed with the initial approach and handle the cases we can.\n\n    # Now, processing each component.\n\n    for comp in components:\n        k = len(comp)\n        if k < 2:\n            continue  # can't form a cycle\n\n        # Check if it's a tree\n        # Compute the number of edges in the component\n        edges_in_comp = 0\n        for u in comp:\n            edges_in_comp += len(adj[u]) // 2\n        if edges_in_comp == k -1:\n            # It's a tree\n            if k >=3:\n                # Need to find the number of pairs of nodes with even path length\n                # So for each pair of nodes, compute the distance (number of edges in the shortest path).

But that cycle could be even or odd.\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the degrees.\n\n        # The number of nodes with odd degree in a graph is always even. So in a tree, which is a connected acyclic graph, the number of nodes with odd degree is exactly 2 (since it's connected and has n-1 edges).\n        # So in a tree, two nodes have odd degrees.\n\n        # When we add an edge between two nodes, it changes their degrees by +1 each. So the new degrees become even, but since they were both odd before, adding an edge between them would make the cycle length as 2? No, because a cycle must have at least three edges.\n\n        # Wait, no. Adding an edge between two nodes in a tree creates a cycle. The length of the cycle is the number of edges on the path between those two nodes plus one. So if the path is of length d, the cycle will have d+1 edges.\n\n        # So to get an odd-length cycle, the path between the two nodes must be even in length. Because d+1 needs to be odd, so d must be even.\n\n        # So the minimal way to create an odd cycle in a tree is to find two nodes whose path has even length. Then, adding an edge between them creates a cycle of odd length.\n\n        # So the question becomes, for each tree component, is there such a pair of nodes?\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps the minimal edges needed is 1 if the component is a tree and has at least two nodes.\n\n        # Wait, let's think about a tree with two nodes: adding an edge makes a cycle of length 1, but that's a loop, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\n        # So for a tree with two nodes, it's impossible to form a cycle of length >1. So we need to look for larger trees.\n\n        # For a tree with three nodes: say, 1-2-3. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 creates a triangle, which is an odd cycle of length 3. So that requires one edge.\n\n        # So for any tree with at least three nodes, adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\n        # So for a tree component (which is connected and acyclic), if it has at least three nodes, then t_i is 1, and the number of ways is equal to the number of pairs of nodes whose path has even length.\n\n        # Because each such pair can be connected with an edge to form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So for each tree component with size >=3, t_i=1, and the number of ways is the number of such pairs.\n\n        # Now, for components that are not trees (i.e., they already have cycles):\n\n        # If the component has an odd-length cycle, then t_i=0, and w_i=1.\n\n        # If the component has only even-length cycles, then we need to add edges to create an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # How? Well, adding one edge can sometimes turn an even cycle into an odd one. Or perhaps adding two edges.\n\n        # This seems complex. So perhaps for non-tree components, we can consider:\n\n        # If the component already has an odd cycle, then t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n        # Else, we need to see if adding edges can create an odd cycle.\n\n        # For example, if the component has multiple even-length cycles, adding an edge might create an odd cycle.\n\n        # However, this analysis can get complicated. So perhaps it's easier to handle trees and other components separately.\n\n        # So, for each component, determine if it's a tree. If it is and its size is >=3, then t_i=1, and the number of ways is the number of valid pairs.\n\n        # Otherwise, check if the component already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n        # Otherwise, the component cannot contribute to the solution.\n\n        # So, how to check if a component already has an odd-length cycle?\n\n        # One way is to perform BFS to find cycles and check their lengths.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use the fact that in any graph, if the number of edges is greater than or equal to the number of vertices, and it's connected, then it's not a tree, and may have cycles.\n\n        # But checking for cycles is computationally expensive for large graphs.\n\n        # Another approach is to note that in a graph where every node has even degree, all cycles are of even length. So if the component has at least one node with an odd degree, then it has an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # Wait, no. That's not necessarily true. For example, a graph with two triangles sharing a common node: each node in the shared node has degree 4 (even), but the cycles are of odd length.\n\n        # Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the presence of any node with an odd degree implies that there exists an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # Yes, because in any graph, the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. If there is at least one node with odd degree, then there must be at least two. These two can be part of an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # So for a component, if it has at least one node with an odd degree, then it contains an odd-length cycle.\n\n        # Therefore, for a component:\n\n        # If it's a tree (so number of edges is |V| - 1), then it has exactly two nodes with odd degrees. Thus, it can form an odd cycle by adding one edge.\n\n        # If it's not a tree and has at least one node with an odd degree, then it already contains an odd cycle.\n\n        # If it's not a tree and all nodes have even degrees, then all cycles are even-length, and thus cannot form an odd cycle without adding edges.\n\n        # So, for each component:\n\n        # Case 1: It's a tree and |V| >=3. Then t_i=1, ways_i = number of pairs of nodes with even path length.\n\n        # Case 2: Not a tree and has at least one node with odd degree. Then t_i=0, ways_i=1.\n\n        # Case 3: Not a tree and all nodes have even degrees. Then, to form an odd cycle, we need to add edges.\n\n        # For case 3, it's more complex. We might need to find the minimal edges to add.\n\n        # So, in code, for each component:\n\n        # Check if it's a tree: edges == |V| -1.\n\n        # If it's a tree and |V| >=3: compute ways as the number of valid pairs.\n\n        # Else if not a tree and has any node with odd degree: t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n        # Else (not a tree, all even degrees): need to find the minimal edges to add.\n\n        # So, for case 3, the component has all even degrees. To form an odd cycle, we need to add edges such that some cycle becomes odd.\n\n        # One approach is to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle.\n\n        # Since all nodes have even degrees, adding an edge can change the parity of degrees.\n\n        # But I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to model this as finding the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle.\n\n        # This seems complicated. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that such cases are rare and handle them appropriately.\n\n        # For now, let's proceed with the initial approach and handle the cases we can.\n\n    # Now, processing each component.\n\n    for comp in components:\n        k = len(comp)\n        if k < 2:\n            continue  # can't form a cycle\n\n        # Check if it's a tree\n        # Compute the number of edges in the component\n        edges_in_comp = 0\n        for u in comp:\n            edges_in_comp += len(adj[u]) // 2\n        if edges_in_comp == k -1:\n            # It's a tree\n            if k >=3:\n                # Need to find the number of pairs of nodes with even path length\n                # So for each pair of nodes, compute the distance (number of edges in the shortest path).
