    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Gluttony. The task is to construct an array b by permuting the elements of array a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S (with size 1 ≤ k < n), the sum of elements in a at those positions is different from the sum of elements in b at those positions.\n\nHmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, given a and we need to permute it into b. For every possible non-empty subset S of the array (excluding empty and the full set), the sum of a's elements at S should differ from the sum of b's elements at S.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no—no. Because for each subset S, which is any non-empty proper subset (size between 1 and n-1), the sum in a and the sum in b must be different.\n\nSo for example, if S is a single element, like just the first element, then a's sum is a1, and b's sum is whatever is in the first position of b. They must be different.\n\nSimilarly, for any pair of elements, their sum in a must differ from their sum in b. And this goes on for all subsets of size 2,3,...,n-1.\n\nThe goal is to find such a permutation b. If not possible, output -1.\n\nNow, the constraints are n up to 22. So for n=22, the number of subsets is 2^22 - 2, which is about 4 million. That's manageable, but perhaps for certain approaches it might be too slow.\n\nBut wait, what's the approach here? How do we ensure that all subset sums are unique across a and b?\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a problem where for each position in b, we assign a value from a such that when we look at all possible subsets, their sums are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for any two elements, they must appear in different positions in b than they did in a. Or maybe not exactly that, but something similar.\n\nWait, let's think about the implications. Suppose that for two elements x and y, in a, x is at position i and y is at j. In b, x is at position k and y is at l. Then, for the subset {i}, the sum in a is x, and in b it's the element at position k. So x and the element at position k must be different. Similarly, for the subset {j}, a's sum is y, and b's sum is the element at position l, so y and l's element must differ.\n\nWait, but that's just for single-element subsets. What about larger subsets?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the only way for all subset sums to differ is that the permutation b is such that each element is in a unique position relative to its original position in a. Like, for each element, its new position is different from where any other element was in a. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into ensuring that for any two elements x and y, their positions in a are swapped, and so on, in a way that all subset sums are unique. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that if the permutation b is such that the multiset of pairwise differences is unique, or something along those lines. Alternatively, maybe the problem is related to linear algebra and ensuring that the vectors are independent.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is needed. Let's consider small cases.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na = [x, y], and b must be a permutation. Let's say b is [y, x].\n\nThen, the subsets are {0}, {1}.\n\nIn a, the sums are x and y. In b, the sums are y and x. So, for these to be different from a's, y ≠ x (which they are, since all elements are distinct). So, for n=2, any permutation works.\n\nWait, because in a, the single element subsets have sums x and y, and in b, the same elements are just swapped, so their sums will still be x and y, which are the same as before. Wait, that would mean that for n=2, it's impossible to find such a permutation because the subset sums would be the same.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b must be different.\n\nSo for n=2, the subsets are {1} and {2}. For {1}, sum_a is a1, sum_b is b1. We need a1 != b1. Similarly, a2 != b2.\n\nSo, in the case where",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an array `b` by permuting the elements of array `a` such that for every non-empty subset of indices, the sum of elements in `a` is different from the sum of elements in `b`.
