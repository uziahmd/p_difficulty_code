The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about the Number Games in Panel. Each district has a contestant, and the number of fans is 2^i for district i. The president wants to remove k contestants such that all remaining districts form a connected component. He also wants to maximize the total fans left. So, I need to find which k districts to remove.\n\nHmm, the key points are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree because there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining must form a connected subtree.\n3. The goal is to maximize the sum of 2^i for each remaining district.\n\nWait, but how do I choose which districts to remove? Because removing certain ones would split the tree into parts, but we want the largest possible sum.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since 2^i grows exponentially, the higher-numbered districts contribute more to the sum. So, to maximize the sum, we should keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the approach might be to find a subtree where the sum is maximum, and then remove the other nodes.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nI remember that in trees, sometimes it's useful to think in terms of dynamic programming or greedy algorithms based on node values.\n\nWait, another thought: For each node, calculate the size of the subtree if it were the root of a connected component. Or perhaps, for each node, determine the maximum sum when considering all descendants in its subtree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. Because 2^i is much larger for higher i.\n\nWait, let's think of the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input, n=6, k=3.\n\nThe roads are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n1 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3, 4, and 6. 6 is also connected to 5.\n\nIf we remove districts 1,3,4, then the remaining are 2,5,6. Their 2^i is 4, 32, 64, summing to 100.\n\nBut why not keep 5 and 6, and maybe others? Because 1 is connected to 2, so if you include 1, you can't have 2 without including 1. But since 1's value is 2, which is small compared to 2^5 (32) and 2^6 (64), it's better to remove 1 so that 2,5,6 can stay.\n\nSo the idea is to find a set of nodes that forms a connected subtree, with the maximum sum of their 2^i. To achieve this, perhaps we need to find the minimal set of nodes to remove so that the remaining is a connected subtree with maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the problem is to remove exactly k nodes. So perhaps the approach is to find a connected subtree S, and then the sum of S is as large as possible, and then ensure that |S| = n -k. Because n -k is the number of nodes after removing k.\n\nWait no, wait. Because the problem says to remove k contestants. So the number of remaining is n-k. And those remaining must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the strategy is to select a connected subtree T of size m = n -k, such that the sum of 2^i for nodes in T is as large as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree T of size m = n -k, which has the maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nHow do I find such a subtree?\n\nWell, considering that 2^i increases with i, the optimal subtree will consist of some consecutive sequence of high-numbered nodes. Because adding a higher-numbered node contributes more than lower ones.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal T is a path of m nodes, which is a chain, and the nodes in T are as high as possible.\n\nWait, but the tree may not allow that. So perhaps the approach is to find the subtree that consists of the m largest 2^i values, but arranged in a connected way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal T is formed by selecting a certain root, and including all its children in a way that maximizes the sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps a way to model this is to consider each node as a potential root and compute the sum of its subtree, but only keeping the top m nodes in that subtree.\n\nWait, another approach: the sum of 2^i is maximized when the nodes are as high as possible. So, the best way is to have a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, connected in a way that allows them to form a single connected component.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible total number of fans. The number of fans for a district `i` is `2^i`, which grows exponentially with `i`. Therefore, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more to the total number of fans.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree structure, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Sum**: To maximize the sum of fans, we should keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring they form a connected component.\n3. **Subtree Selection**: We need to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes and has a size of `n - k` (where `n` is the total number of districts and `k` is the number of contestants to remove).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    k = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(data[idx])\n        b = int(data[idx+1])\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n        idx += 2\n\n    m = n -
