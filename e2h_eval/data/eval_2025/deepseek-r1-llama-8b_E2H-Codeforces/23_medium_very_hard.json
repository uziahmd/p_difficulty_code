In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Japanese mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). \n\nHmm, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' means suit s, number 1. The output should be three integers: for each of the three input tiles, the minimal number of draws needed so that after adding those, the entire collection contains at least one mentsu. Or wait, no—wait, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three input lines, indicating how many tiles each needs to draw to reach a situation where their combined set (after drawing) includes a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws required for the respective initial tile sets. Or perhaps, the output is three separate cases: what's the minimal draws for the first tile, then for the second, then third. Or maybe not. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the three lines are:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nThe output is ['0', '0', '1'].\n\nSo for the first case, the tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. That's already a shuntsu, so she needs 0 more.\n\nFor the second case, all are 9m. So that's a koutsu, so 0.\n\nFor the third case, she has 3p, 9m, 2p. So current tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. She can add one tile, like 1p or 4p, to form a sequence 1p, 2p, 3p or 2p, 3p,4p. So the third output is 1.\n\nSo each of the three lines is considered as the initial set, and we have to compute for each line what's the minimal draws needed.\n\nSo the task is to process each of the three input lines as separate cases, and for each, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the three initial tile sets (each consisting of three tiles), determine the minimal number of tiles needed to be drawn such that the total set (initial + drawn) has at least one mentsu.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"the number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw\". So she can choose any tiles, including duplicates of existing ones. Because you can draw any tiles you want, including those already in your hand.\n\nSo for each initial set, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the combined set contains at least one mentsu.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each of the three initial sets:\n\n1. Generate all possible subsets that can form a mentsu by adding some tiles.\n2. For each possible way to form a mentsu, determine how many tiles are needed beyond the initial three.\n3. Find the minimal number across all possible mentsus.\n\nWait, but the initial set plus the added tiles must contain at least one mentsu. So for the initial set, when we add tiles, the union must include a mentsu.\n\nSo for each initial set S, the problem is to find the smallest k such that there exists a mentsu M, and S ∪ (added tiles) contains M.\n\nWhat's the minimal k?\n\nSo for each initial set S, which is size 3, we can consider all possible possible ways to form a mentsu (all possible triplets or sequences) and see if S has part of them, then compute how many tiles are missing and add accordingly.\n\nWait, but the mentsu can consist of any three tiles that form a triplet or a sequence. But when considering the initial set plus the added tiles, the mentsu must be entirely present.\n\nSo for example, if the initial set has two tiles of a triplet, then adding one will complete it.\n\nSimilarly for sequences: if the initial set has two consecutive tiles in a suit, adding the third would make a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, if the initial set has all three of a sequence, then no tiles are needed.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each initial set S:\n\n- Check all possible triplets (koutsu) and sequences (shuntsu) that could be formed with the initial set plus some tiles.\n\n- For each possible triplet or sequence, determine how many tiles are missing in S, and thus the number of tiles needed to add to S to get all three.\n\n- The minimal k across all possible such triplets/sequences is the answer for that case.\n\nBut wait, the initial set is three tiles, but when adding tiles, she can add any tiles, not just those in the current set. So for example, if the initial set doesn't have any tiles of a certain type, she can add multiple copies of that type.\n\nSo for each possible triplet or sequence, the minimal number of tiles needed is the number of tiles in the triplet/sequence that are not present in S.\n\nWait, but because she can add any tiles, even new ones. So for example, for a triplet like 1m, 1m, 1m, if S has none of them, she needs to add three 1m tiles.\n\nWait, no. Because S has three tiles, and she can add any number of tiles. So to form a triplet, she needs three identical tiles. If S already has all three, then no addition is needed. Otherwise, she needs to add the missing ones.\n\nWait, no: for a triplet, you need three of the same tile. So S could have zero, one, two, or three of a particular tile.\n\nFor example:\n\nCase 1: S has 0 of a certain tile T. Then to form a triplet, she needs to add three Ts.\n\nCase 2: S has one T. Then she needs to add two more.\n\nCase 3: S has two Ts. She needs to add one.\n\nCase 4: S has three Ts. She doesn't need to add any.\n\nSo for each possible triplet, the number of tiles needed is (3 - count of that tile in S).\n\nSimilarly for a sequence, which requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nFor example, S may have two tiles of a sequence, so adding the third is needed.\n\nSo for each possible triplet or sequence, we calculate how many tiles are needed, and take the minimal over all possibilities.\n\nBut since the initial set is three tiles, but the added tiles can be any, including ones outside the initial set, we need to consider all possible triplets and sequences, and for each, calculate how many tiles are needed beyond the initial set.\n\nWait, but for a triplet, say 1m, 1m, 1m. How many tiles does S have? It depends on whether any of the 1m tiles are present.\n\nIf S has zero, then we need to add three.\n\nIf S has one, add two.\n\nIf S has two, add one.\n\nIf S has three, add zero.\n\nSo for each possible triplet (all 9*3=27 possible triplets), we can calculate the required number of tiles.\n\nSame for sequences: there are 3 suits, each with 7 possible sequences (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9 for each suit). So 3*7=21 possible sequences.\n\nSo for each initial set S, we can:\n\n- For all possible triplets T, compute the required tiles to add to form T.\n\n- For all possible sequences S, compute the required tiles to add to form S.\n\n- Take the minimal value among all these required tiles.\n\nBut wait, the initial set S may already have some tiles of T or S. So for each possible triplet T, how many tiles does S already have?\n\nWait, but each triplet consists of three identical tiles. So for a given triplet T, the count is the number of times T appears in S.\n\nSo for example, if S is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], then for the triplet 1s, the count is 1. So to form the triplet, she needs 2 more.\n\nBut for the triplet 2s, count is 1, needing 2 more.\n\nSo for each triplet, the required tiles are 3 - count in S.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each initial set S:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible triplets (27 in total).\n\n   For each triplet T:\n\n   a. Count how many times T appears in S.\n\n   b. The required tiles to add to form T is max(0, 3 - count).\n\n   c. Keep track of the minimal required across all triplets.\n\n2. Enumerate all possible sequences (21 in total).\n\n   For each sequence S:\n\n   a. For each of the three tiles in the sequence, check how many of them are present in S.\n\n   b. But since the sequence requires three distinct tiles in order, each exactly once, the count for each tile is the number of occurrences in S.\n\n   c. For each tile in the sequence, if it's present in S, the count contributes to whether the sequence can be formed.\n\n   d. Wait, no. Because the sequence is three distinct tiles. So for a sequence like 1m, 2m, 3m, we need to have at least one of each tile in S. Because she can add the missing ones.\n\n   So for each sequence, the required tiles are the number of tiles in the sequence not present in S.\n\n   So for each sequence, the required is the count of tiles in the sequence that S lacks.\n\n   So for each sequence, the required is the sum of (0 if the tile is in S, else 1) for each of the three tiles in the sequence.\n\n   For example, if S has 1m and 2m, but not 3m, then the required is 1.\n\n   So for each sequence, calculate the number of tiles in the sequence not present in S. The minimal required for this sequence is that number.\n\n   Then, the minimal across all sequences is another candidate for the overall minimal.\n\n3. The overall minimal is the minimum between the minimal triplet requirement and the minimal sequence requirement.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each initial set S:\n\n   Compute min_triplets = the minimal required tiles across all triplets.\n\n   Compute min_sequences = the minimal required tiles across all sequences.\n\n   The minimal required is min(min_triplets, min_sequences).\n\nSo for each initial set, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to get at least one mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the initial set S.\n\nEach tile can be represented as a string, e.g., '1m', '2s', etc.\n\nWe can process each initial set as a list of three tiles.\n\nFor each triplet T, which is a single tile (like '1m'), count how many times it appears in S.\n\nWait no. Each triplet is three identical tiles, e.g., '1m' appears three times.\n\nWait, no: a triplet is three of the same tile. So for triplet T, the count is the number of T's in S.\n\nBecause S has three tiles, the count can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo for each possible triplet (each tile), we can compute 3 - count.\n\nFor example, for triplet '1m':\n\ncount_in_S = number of '1m's in S.\n\nrequired = max(0, 3 - count_in_S).\n\nSo for each triplet, compute this required.\n\nThen, among all 27 triplets, find the minimal required.\n\nSimilarly, for each sequence (three tiles in order), compute how many of the three tiles are missing from S.\n\nSo for a sequence like [1m, 2m, 3m], the required is the number of these three tiles that are not present in S.\n\nSo for each of the three tiles in the sequence, check if it's in S. If yes, contribute 0; else, 1.\n\nSum these up for the sequence.\n\nFind the minimal such sum across all 21 sequences.\n\nThen, the minimal required is the minimum between the minimal triplet required and the minimal sequence required.\n\nSo now, the code structure is:\n\nRead the three initial sets.\n\nFor each initial set:\n\n   min_required = infinity\n\n   process all triplets:\n\n      for each possible triplet (tile):\n\n          count = number of times tile appears in S.\n\n          req = max(0, 3 - count)\n\n          if req < min_required:\n\n              min_required = req\n\n   process all sequences:\n\n      for each possible sequence:\n\n          required = 0\n\n          for tile in sequence:\n\n              if tile not in S:\n\n                  required +=1\n\n          if required < min_required:\n\n              min_required = required\n\n   print min_required\n\nWait, but processing all triplets and sequences for each initial set could be time-consuming, but given that the total number is 27 + 21 = 48 per initial set, it's manageable.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\nImplement functions to generate all triplets and sequences.\n\nEach triplet is a single tile, repeated three times. So for each tile, it's a triplet.\n\nEach sequence is a list of three tiles, in order.\n\nWait, no: a triplet is three identical tiles. So for triplet, it's just one unique tile, but requires three copies.\n\nBut when checking for a triplet, it's sufficient to count how many of that tile are present in S.\n\nSo, for each triplet T, which is a single tile, the required is 3 - count.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nHow to generate all triplets:\n\nThere are 9 options for the number (1-9) and 3 suits, so 9*3 = 27 triplets.\n\nEach triplet is a single tile.\n\nSo, for each tile in the 27 possible, compute the required.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nEach sequence is a list of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nFor example, in 'm' suit, the possible sequences are:\n\n1m,2m,3m\n\n2m,3m,4m\n\n...\n\n7m,8m,9m\n\nSimilarly for 'p' and 's'.\n\nSo, 7 sequences per suit, 21 in total.\n\nSo for each of the 21 sequences, we need to check how many tiles are missing from S.\n\nSo the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the initial set S is a list of three tiles, each a string like '1m', '2p', etc.\n\nWe can represent S as a set for quick lookups.\n\nSo for each initial set S:\n\n   s_set = set(S)\n\n   Now, for each triplet T:\n\n       count = s_set.count(T)\n\n       req = max(0, 3 - count)\n\n       track min_triplet_req.\n\n   For each sequence seq:\n\n       req = 0\n\n       for tile in seq:\n\n           if tile not in s_set:\n\n               req +=1\n\n       track min_sequence_req.\n\n   Then, the minimal is the minimum between min_triplet_req and min_sequence_req.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead the three lines, each as a list of three tiles.\n\nFor each line:\n\n   s = list of three strings.\n\n   s_set = set(s)\n\n   min_t = infinity\n\n   for each possible triplet T:\n\n       count = s_set.count(T)\n\n       req = max(0, 3 - count)\n\n       if req < min_t:\n\n           min_t = req\n\n   min_s = infinity\n\n   for each possible sequence seq:\n\n       req = 0\n\n       for tile in seq:\n\n           if tile not in s_set:\n\n               req +=1\n\n       if req < min_s:\n\n           min_s = req\n\n   overall_min = min(min_t, min_s)\n\n   print(overall_min)\n\nWait, but the triplet is any of the 27 possible tiles. So I need to generate all 27 possible triplet candidates.\n\nSimilarly, the sequences are the 21 possible sequences.\n\nSo, how to generate all triplets and sequences.\n\nLet's think about generating all triplets first.\n\nTriplet generation:\n\nSuits are 'm', 'p', 's'.\n\nNumbers are 1-9.\n\nSo for each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for num in 1 to 9:\n\n       tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\nSo for example, '1m', '2m', etc.\n\nThat's 27 tiles.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence generation:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for start in 1 to 7:\n\n       seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n\nSo that's 7 sequences per suit, 21 in total.\n\nSo in code, perhaps precompute all triplets and sequences.\n\nLet me write helper functions to generate these.\n\nWait, but since the code is for each initial set, perhaps it's better to generate the triplets and sequences on the fly for each initial set.\n\nAlternatively, precompute all possible triplets and sequences before processing the initial sets.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps precompute once.\n\nLet me think.\n\nIn Python:\n\ntriplets = []\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1,10):\n        triplets.append(f\"{num}{suit}\")\n\nsequences = []\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 8):\n        seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n        sequences.append(seq)\n\nSo triplets is a list of 27 strings, each representing a triplet.\n\nSequences is a list of 21 lists, each containing three strings representing a sequence.\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for each initial set, we can loop through all triplets and sequences.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprecompute triplets and sequences.\n\nThen, for each of the three initial sets:\n\n   s = list of three strings.\n\n   s_set = set(s)\n\n   min_t = infinity\n\n   for t in triplets:\n\n       count = s_set.count(t)\n\n       req = max(0, 3 - count)\n\n       if req < min_t:\n\n           min_t = req\n\n   min_seq = infinity\n\n   for seq in sequences:\n\n       req = 0\n\n       for tile in seq:\n\n           if tile not in s_set:\n\n               req +=1\n\n       if req < min_seq:\n\n           min_seq = req\n\n   overall_min = min(min_t, min_seq)\n\n   print(overall_min)\n\nWait, but what about when the initial set already contains a mentsu?\n\nLike in the sample input, the first case has 1s, 2s, 3s—so a shuntsu. So for sequences, one of them will have req=0.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nCase where the initial set already forms a triplet or a sequence.\n\nE.g., all three are same tile: triplet requires 0.\n\nAnother case: two tiles of a triplet and one other. Adding one tile of the triplet completes it.\n\nAnother edge case: initial set has two tiles of a sequence, adding the third.\n\nWhat about when the initial set can form both a triplet and a sequence with different required adds? The code will choose the minimal.\n\nAnother edge case: initial set has all three tiles of a triplet, but no sequences. So the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother case: the initial set has tiles that can form a sequence with two tiles missing, but a triplet requires adding four tiles. So the minimal is 2.\n\nWait, no: for a triplet, the required is 3 - count. So if initial set has one tile of a triplet, then required is 2.\n\nBut for a sequence, suppose the initial set has only one of the three tiles in the sequence. Then, required is 2.\n\nBut perhaps another sequence requires adding 1 tile.\n\nSo the code will choose the minimal.\n\nAnother case: initial set has three tiles, but none can form a triplet or sequence. So the minimal is the minimal required across all triplets and sequences.\n\nWait, for example: the initial set is ['1m', '2p', '3s']. So no triplet or sequence is present.\n\nSo for triplets, each triplet requires 3 tiles, since none are in the initial set.\n\nFor sequences, for each sequence, we check how many tiles are missing.\n\nFor example, the sequence 1m,2m,3m: the initial set has 1m, so missing 2m and 3m. So required is 2.\n\nSimilarly, another sequence like 2p,3p,4p: initial set has 2p, missing 3p and 4p: required is 2.\n\nBut perhaps another sequence like 1m,2m,3m requires 2, but maybe another sequence requires less.\n\nWait, no: in this case, the initial set is three distinct tiles, none forming a sequence or triplet.\n\nSo for each triplet, the required is 3.\n\nFor each sequence, the required is 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait, the initial set is three tiles, but to form a sequence, you need three tiles in the same suit, consecutive.\n\nIn this case, none of the three tiles are in the same suit. So for each sequence, all three tiles are missing except for one.\n\nThus, the required is 2.\n\nSo the code correctly finds that adding two tiles would allow a sequence.\n\nBut wait, she can also form a triplet by adding three of the same tile. So the triplet option would require 3 tiles added. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the code would correctly choose 2.\n\nAnother edge case: initial set has two tiles of a triplet and one tile of a sequence.\n\nLike ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor the triplet '1m': count is 2, so required is 1.\n\nFor the sequence 1m,2m,3m: initial set has 1m and 2m, missing 3m: required is 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly finds that.\n\nAnother edge case: initial set has all three tiles of a sequence, but no triplet.\n\nLike '1m', '2m', '3m'. So the required is 0.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nSo now, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the next step is to write the code.\n\nBut wait, the input is read as three lines, each line being three space-separated strings.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # Each line is a list of three tiles\n    initial_sets = [lines[i:i+3] for i in range(0,9,3)]\n    \n    # Precompute triplets and sequences\n    triplets = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            triplets.append(f\"{num}{suit}\")\n    \n    sequences = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n            sequences.append(seq)\n    \n    # Process each initial set\n    for s in initial_sets:\n        s_set = set(s)\n        min_t = float('inf')\n        # Check all triplets\n        for t in triplets:\n            cnt = s_set.count(t)\n            req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n            if req < min_t:\n                min_t = req\n        # Check all sequences\n        min_seq = float('inf')\n        for seq in sequences:\n            req = 0\n            for tile in seq:\n                if tile not in s_set:\n                    req += 1\n            if req < min_seq:\n                min_seq = req\n        # Overall minimal\n        overall_min = min(min_t, min_seq)\n        print(overall_min)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third line is '3p 9m 2p'.\n\nSo s_set is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}.\n\nLooking for triplets:\n\nEach triplet is a single tile, so for '3p', '9m', '2p', each has count 1.\n\nSo for triplet '3p', required is 2.\n\nTriplet '9m': count is 1, required 2.\n\nTriplet '2p': count 1, required 2.\n\nOther triplets: for '1p', count 0 → required 3.\n\nBut wait, for the triplet '2p', count is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet '2p', required is 2.\n\nBut what about other triplets that might have higher counts.\n\nNo, because in this initial set, none of the tiles appear more than once.\n\nSo for all triplets, the required is either 2 or 3.\n\nNow, for sequences:\n\nLooking for any sequence where the initial set has some tiles.\n\nFor example, the sequence '2p', '3p', '4p' → initial set has '2p' and '3p' → missing '4p' → req 1.\n\nSimilarly, the sequence '3p', '4p', '5p' → initial set has '3p' → missing 4p and 5p → req 2.\n\nAnother sequence: '1p', '2p', '3p' → initial set has '2p' → missing 1p and 3p → req 2.\n\nAnother sequence: '9m' is part of a sequence like '7m', '8m', '9m' → initial set has '9m' → missing '7m' and '8m' → req 2.\n\nBut wait, is there a sequence where only one tile is missing?\n\nYes. For example, the sequence '3p', '4p', '5p' → initial set has '3p' → missing '4p' and '5p' → req 2.\n\nWait, no. Maybe another sequence.\n\nWait, the initial set has '2p' and '3p' → which is part of the sequence '2p','3p','4p'. So to form this sequence, we're missing '4p' → req 1.\n\nAh right! So in this case, the required is 1.\n\nSo the code for the third initial set would find that for this sequence, the required is 1. So the min_sequence would be 1. The min_triplet would be 2, so the overall min is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: the second initial set is ['9m', '9m', '9m'].\n\nFor triplet '9m', count is 3 → required 0.\n\nSo min_t is 0.\n\nSo the output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: initial set is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nLooking for sequences:\n\nCheck for sequences that include 1m, 2m, and 4m.\n\nWait, no, because 1m,2m,3m is a sequence, but initial set has 1m and 2m, missing 3m → req 1.\n\nAnother sequence: 2m,3m,4m → initial set has 2m and 4m → missing 3m → req 1.\n\nSo the minimal required for sequences is 1.\n\nFor triplets, each triplet requires 3 (since initial set has no triplet tiles), so min_t is 3.\n\nThus, overall min is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nAnother test case: initial set is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor triplet '1m': count is 2 → required 1.\n\nFor triplet '2m': count is 1 → required 2.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nLooking for sequences that include 1m and 2m.\n\nLike 1m,2m,3m → initial set has 1m and 2m → missing 3m → req 1.\n\nOr 2m,3m,4m → initial set has 2m → missing 3m and 4m → req 2.\n\nSo the minimal for sequences is 1.\n\nThus, the code returns 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Case where the initial set has more than three tiles? No, because the input is always three.\n\n- Case where the same tile appears multiple times in the initial set. Like ['1m', '1m', '1m'] → triplet is already formed, so required is 0.\n\n- Time constraints? Well, for each initial set, 48 iterations (27 triplets + 21 sequences) is negligible.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (triplet or sequence) from her initial set of three tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) consisting of three identical tiles or a shuntsu (sequence) consisting of three consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit.\n2. **Generate Possible Mentsu**: We precompute all possible triplets and sequences. There are 27 possible triplets (one for each combination of suit and number) and 21 possible sequences (7 sequences per suit).\n3. **Check Each Initial Set**: For each initial set of three tiles:\n   - Calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form any triplet.\n   - Calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form any sequence.\n   - The result for each initial set is the minimum value between the two calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines of input\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    initial_sets = [lines[i:i+3] for i in range(0, 9, 3)]\n    \n    # Precompute all possible triplets and sequences\n    triplets = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            triplets.append(f\"{num}{suit}\")\n    \n    sequences = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n            sequences.append(seq)\n    \n    # Process each initial set\n    for s in initial_sets:\n        s_set = set(s)\n        min_t = float('inf')\n        # Check all triplets\n        for t in triplets:\n            cnt = s_set.count(t)\n            req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n            if req < min_t:\n                min_t = req\n        # Check all sequences\n        min_seq = float('inf')\n        for seq in sequences:\n            req = 0\n            for tile in seq:\n                if tile not in s_set:\n                    req += 1\n            if req < min_seq:\n                min_seq = req\n        # Determine the minimal required tiles\n        overall_min = min(min_t, min_seq)\n        print(overall_min)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines, each containing three tiles.\n2. **Precompute Mentsu**: We generate all possible triplets and sequences before processing each initial set to avoid redundant computations.\n3. **Processing Each Initial Set**:\n   - Convert the initial set into a set for quick lookups.\n   - For each triplet, count how many times it appears in the initial set and compute the required tiles to complete the triplet.\n   - For each sequence, check how many tiles are missing and compute the required tiles to complete the sequence.\n   - The minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence is determined and printed for each initial set.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu and ensures the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases.",
