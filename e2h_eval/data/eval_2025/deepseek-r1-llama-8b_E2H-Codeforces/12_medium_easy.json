The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be in ai by the time she completes all tasks before i. Wait, no—the description says she needs to be in ai for the i-th task and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Wait, the way the problem is phrased: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh wait, maybe that means that for each task i, she must have already completed all j < i tasks. So the i-th task must be done after all the previous ones. \n\nSo the tasks are processed in order 1, 2, ..., m. But each task i requires being at a_i at some point. So the path she takes must include all these a_i's in order, but she can visit them in any order as long as each a_i is visited after the previous ones. No, wait—since the tasks are sequential, she must process them in order 1 to m. So for the first task, she's at a_1; for the second, she must get to a_2 after a_1 is done; etc. So the order of visiting the a_i's is fixed as per their indices.\n\nWait, no. Because the tasks are given as a list, and each task is the i-th one. So she has to process task 1, then 2, then up to m. So for each i from 1 to m, she must be at a_i at some point after completing all tasks before i. But since the tasks are sequential, perhaps the order of visiting the a_i's is 1, then 2, etc., but not necessarily in the same order as the ring. \n\nBut how does this translate into movement along the ring?\n\nLet me think about the example given:\n\nFirst example input:\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nThe output is 6.\n\nExplanation: the sequence is 1 →2→3→4→1→2→3.\n\nSo let's see why:\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst task: she must be at 3. How?\n\nShe goes from 1 to 2 (1 move), then to 3 (another move). So that's two moves for the first task.\n\nWait, but the explanation shows more steps. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps each task is considered as needing to be completed in the order given. So for each i from 1 to m, she must reach a_i, and then proceed to the next task.\n\nSo for the first example:\n\nTask 1: a_1=3. She starts at 1.\n\nShe needs to reach 3. The shortest path is clockwise: 1→2→3 (2 steps). So after task 1, she's at 3.\n\nThen, task 2: a_2=2. She needs to reach 2 after task 1. So from 3, the next step would be 4, then 1, then 2. That's 3 steps. So total so far is 2 + 3 =5 steps.\n\nThen task 3: a_3=3. She is already there, so no steps needed.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+0=5? But the sample says 6. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the movement isn't just to reach each a_i, but she has to plan the entire path, covering all the a_i's in order, possibly passing through other nodes as well, but the minimal total steps is what's required.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is determined by considering that each a_i must be visited in the order of their positions on the ring.\n\nAnother approach: the minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, considering the ring's circular nature.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because each a_i must be reached after the previous one, so the path is a sequence of a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, but considering the circular arrangement.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's (in the order they appear), where each distance is computed as the minimal steps moving clockwise (or the other way if shorter, but since traffic is one-way clockwise, she can't go counter-clockwise).\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is a one-way clockwise road. So she can't move counter-clockwise. So the distance from i to j is (j -i) mod n, because moving clockwise, the number of steps is j -i if j >i, else (n -i +j) steps.\n\nWait, for example, n=4:\n\nFrom 3 to 2: moving clockwise, you can't go directly to 2. You have to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Alternatively, the distance is (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. So yes, the distance is (j -i) mod n, but since she can only move clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair (a_i, a_{i+1}), the distance is (a_{i+1} - a_i) mod n.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\nCompute the sum of (2-3) mod4 + (3-2) mod4 + (3-3) mod4.\n\nWait, but that would be ( (2-3)= -1 mod4 is 3) + (3-2=1) + 0 = 4. But the sample output is 6. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the starting point. Because she starts at 1, not a_0 or something.\n\nWait, in the first sample:\n\nShe starts at 1, then goes to 3 (distance 2), then to 2 (distance 3), then to 3 (distance 1). Total 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nWait, so the movement is:\n\n1 →3 (distance 2), then 3→2 (distance 3), then 2→3 (distance 1). So total 6.\n\nBut according to the a array, the consecutive pairs are (3,2) and (2,3). So their distances are 3 and 1, summing to 4, plus the initial movement from 1 to 3 (distance 2) gives 6.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the distance from 1 to a_1, then add the sum of distances between a_i and a_{i+1} for i from 1 to m-1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Start at 1.\n\n- For each task in order, go from current position to a_i, adding the distance.\n\n- The total is the sum of all these individual distances.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the a array in the order of their task indices.\n\n2. Compute the initial distance from 1 to a[0].\n\n3. Then, for each i from 1 to m-1, compute the distance from a[i-1] to a[i], and add to the total.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the sum of the distances between 1 and a_1, then a_1 and a_2, and so on until a_{m-1} and a_m}.\n\nSo the key is to arrange the a_i's in the order of their task indices and compute the sum of the distances.\n\nSo, for the first sample:\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\nCompute:\n\ndistance from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2.\n\nThen distance from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4=3.\n\nThen distance from 2 to 3: (3-2)=1.\n\nSum: 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput is 4 3, and a is [2,3,3].\n\nSo:\n\ndistance from 1 to 2: (2-1)=1.\n\ndistance from 2 to 3:1.\n\ndistance from 3 to3:0.\n\nTotal:1+1+0=2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nCompute the sum of the distances as per the above method.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list a as integers.\n\n- Compute the sum:\n\n   total = 0\n\n   current = 1\n\n   for each ai in a:\n\n      d = (ai - current) % n\n\n      total +=d\n\n      current = ai\n\n- print total.\n\nWait, but wait: the a list is in the order of the tasks, which are to be processed in order 1 to m. So the first element is a_1, then a_2, etc.\n\nWait, but the code treats the a list as a_1, a_2, a_3, etc. So yes, it's correct.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai=3: d=2, total=2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nSecond ai=2: d=(2-3) mod4=3. total=5.\n\nThird ai=3: d=0, total remains 5.\n\nWait, but the sample expects 6. So this suggests that the code is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, in the first sample, the a list is [3,2,3]. So the code processes it as:\n\n1→3: distance 2.\n\n3→2: distance 3.\n\n2→3: distance 1.\n\nTotal 2+3+1=6. But according to the code above, the sum is 2+3+0=5. That's not matching.\n\nAh, I see. Because the third ai is 3, which is same as the previous current. So the code adds 0, but in reality, she has to move from 2 to 3, which is 1 step.\n\nWait, so the code is incorrect. Because in the a list, each ai is the target for that task. So for each task, she must go from the previous position to the current ai. So the code correctly computes the sum of all these movements.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the a list is [3,2,3]. So the steps are:\n\n1→3: 2.\n\n3→2:3.\n\n2→3:1.\n\nSo total is 6.\n\nBut according to the code, for the third ai=3, it's adding 0, which is incorrect.\n\nAh! Oh right, I see. Because the code is treating the a list as a list of points to visit in order, but in the first sample, the a list is [3,2,3], meaning:\n\nTask 1: move to 3.\n\nTask 2: move to 2.\n\nTask 3: move to 3.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nstart at 1.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n   move from current to ai, add the distance.\n\nSo the code would compute 2 (1→3) +3 (3→2) +1 (2→3) =6, which is correct.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier code, it's adding (ai - current) modn each time.\n\nIn the third iteration, current is 2, ai is 3. 3-2=1, mod4 is 1, so added 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the code earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n\ncurrent starts as 1.\n\nLoop over each ai in a:\n\n   compute d = (ai - current) modn.\n\n   add d to total.\n\n   set current to ai.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nai=3: d=2, current=3.\n\nSecond: ai=2: (2-3) mod4=3, current=2.\n\nThird: ai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1, current=3.\n\nTotal: 2+3+1=6.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the second sample:\n\na = [2,3,3].\n\nFirst iteration: ai=2: d=1, current=2.\n\nSecond: ai=3: (3-2)=1, current=3.\n\nThird: ai=3: 0, total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, starting from 1.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nIf m is 0, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   total = 0\n\n   current = 1\n\n   for each ai in a:\n\n       d = (ai - current) % n\n\n       total +=d\n\n       current = ai\n\n   print(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, negative modulo can be tricky. For example, (2-3) is -1, mod4 is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: m=1, a_1=1.\n\nShe is already there. So total is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: m=1, a_1=2, n=2.\n\nShe starts at 1. To reach 2, she needs 1 step. So total is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=5, m=4, a=[5,4,3,2].\n\nEach step:\n\n1 →5: (5-1) mod5=4 steps.\n\n5→4: (4-5) mod5=4 steps (since 4-5 is -1 mod5 is 4).\n\n4→3: (3-4)= -1 mod5=4.\n\n3→2: (2-3)= -1 mod5=4.\n\nTotal steps:4+4+4+4=16.\n\nSo the code should return 16.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, m=2, a=[3,1].\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst step: 1→3: 2 steps.\n\nSecond step: 3→1: (1-3) mod3 = (-2 mod3)=1 step.\n\nTotal steps:3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nTherefore, the Python code should be straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete each subsequent task in order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit several houses in a specific order to complete her tasks. The houses are arranged in a ring, meaning she can only move clockwise from one house to the next.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal path involves moving from the starting point (house 1) to the first task location, then to the next task location, and so on. Each move between consecutive task locations is calculated as the minimal steps required in a clockwise direction.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start at house 1.\n   - For each task location, calculate the distance from the current house to the task location using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent = 1\n\nfor ai in a:\n    d = (ai - current) % n\n    total += d\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of task locations.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, compute the distance from the current house to the task location using modulo arithmetic. This handles the wrap-around nature of the ring correctly.\n- **Update Total Time**: Add the computed distance to the total time and update the current house to the task location.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimum time by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular arrangement of houses.",
