    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it appears more than once, and keep track of the maximum length where this happens.\n\nFirst, I think about how to approach this. One way is to generate all possible substrings of the string, then for each possible length, starting from the largest possible, check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we start checking from the largest possible lengths, the first time we find a substring that meets the condition, that's our answer. It's efficient because we don't need to check smaller lengths once we find the maximum.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all substrings of length L in the string.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appear more than once (can be overlapping).\n4. If such a substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nHow do I implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For each substring of length L, I can store them in a set. As I generate each substring, I add it to the set. If I encounter a duplicate (i.e., a substring that's already in the set), then that's the maximum possible L.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n   - Create a set to track substrings of length L.\n   - For each i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n       - Extract substring s[i:i+L]\n       - If it's already in the set, return L.\n       - Else, add it to the set.\n   - If after checking all i, no duplicates are found, move to L-1.\n\nThis should work. Since the maximum string length is 100, even the worst case (checking L=99, then 98, etc.) is manageable.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1: 'abcd'\n\nFor L=4: only one substring, so nothing. Move to L=3: same, each substring is unique. L=2: same. L=1: all are unique. So the output is 0? Wait, but wait—no. Wait, what's the expected output in the sample? Oh, looking back:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd', output is 0. Because no substring of length >=1 occurs more than once. Because all are unique.\n\nWait, but wait. Substrings can be overlapping. But in 'abcd', every substring of length 1 is unique. So yes, output is 0.\n\nAnother example: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck L=5: only one substring. Then L=4: two substrings 'abab' and 'baba'—are they same? No. Then L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When processing the third one, 'aba' is already in the set, so return 3.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 'zzz'.\n\nFor L=3: only one substring. L=2: substrings are 'zz' and 'zz'. So when i=0, add 'zz' to the set. Then i=1, extract 'zz' again. It's already present, so return 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the samples.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is a single string. Read it from stdin.\n\nThen, loop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\nFor each L, create a set. Then iterate through all possible starting indices (i) from 0 to len(s)-L inclusive.\n\nFor each i, get the substring s[i:i+L]. If it's in the set, return L as the answer.\n\nIf none found after all i, proceed to L-1.\n\nBut wait, for L=0? No, because the string is non-empty, but the loop starts from len(s), which is at least 1, and goes down to 1.\n\nWait, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in the case of the empty string, but the problem says it's non-empty. So no problem.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nTest case 1: 'abcd'\n\nLoop L=4: substrings 'abcd' added. No duplicates. Then L=3: 'abc', 'bcd'—both unique. L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—all unique. L=1: 'a','b','c','d'—all unique. So after loop, print 0.\n\nTest case 2: 'ababa'\n\nL=5: 'ababa' added. No duplicates. L=4: 'abab' and 'baba'—no. L=3: i=0: 'aba' added. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: 'aba'—already present. So return 3.\n\nTest case 3: 'zzz'\n\nL=3: 'zzz' added. No. L=2: i=0: 'zz' added. i=1: 'zz' is in seen. So return 2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the entire string is made of the same character, e.g., 'aaaaa'. Then the maximum substring is 4, since 'aaaa' appears at positions 0 and 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nL=5: only one. L=4: substrings 'aaaa' at i=0 and i=1. So when i=1, substr 'aaaa' is in seen? Let's see: for L=4, the substrings are s[0:4] = 'aaaa', s[1:5] = 'aaaa'. So when i=0, substr is added. Then i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is in seen. So returns 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: string of length 1. Like 'a'. Then the output is 0, since no substring of length >=1 occurs twice.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab'.\n\nWe can see that substrings like 'aba' appear multiple times.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, for L=3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' added.\n\ni=2: 'aba' again? So when i=2, substr is 'aba' which is in seen, so returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible length down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of the string and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. **Track Seen Substrings**: Use a set to keep track of substrings we have seen so far.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: For each generated substring, check if it has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, return the current length as the result.\n5. **Proceed to Smaller Lengths**: If no duplicates are found for the current length, move on to the next smaller length.\n\nThis method ensures that we find the longest substring efficiently by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and ensuring we start from the longest possible substrings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor length in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+length]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(length)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1.\n- **Set for Tracking Substrings**: For each length, we initialize an empty set to keep track of substrings we have encountered.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each starting index, generate the substring of the current length and check if it exists in the set.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, print the current length and exit. If no duplicates are found after checking all substrings of the current length, continue to the next smaller length.\n- **Output Result**: If no valid substring is found for any length, print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and iterating from the longest possible substrings down to the shortest, ensuring optimal performance.",
