Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then, he gets n queries, each of which is a substitution: replace all occurrences of a digit di with a string ti. The order of the queries matters because each subsequent query operates on the result of the previous ones.\n\nMy goal is to process all these queries in order and then compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the substitutions efficiently? Because if I process each substitution naively by replacing each occurrence, it could be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long and there are up to 105 queries. But maybe for the constraints given, a straightforward approach would work.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Read n queries.\n3. For each query, perform the substitution on the current s.\n4. After all substitutions, compute the numeric value of s, ignoring leading zeros (but wait, no, according to the note, leading zeros should not be removed; the sample shows that the third case has '000' which becomes '777' but the output is 777, implying that leading zeros are kept as part of the number, but when computing the numeric value, they are treated as part of the number. Or wait, the note says to ignore leading zeroes when representing the number. Oh, right: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\".\n\nWait, no, the note says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeros; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo after processing all substitutions, we need to interpret the resulting string as a number, stripping any leading zeros. But if the entire string is empty, then the number is zero.\n\nSo for example, if after substitution the string is \"0000\", the numeric value is 0.\n\nBut during the substitution process, the string can have leading zeros. So we can't strip them until the very end.\n\nHmm, okay, so the plan is:\n\n- Process each substitution in order.\n- For each substitution, replace every occurrence of di with ti. Since the substitution is done for all occurrences at once, perhaps using a regular expression substitution would be efficient.\n- After all substitutions, compute the number:\n   - If the string is empty, output 0.\n   - Else, strip leading zeros. If the string becomes empty, output 0. Otherwise, treat the remaining digits as the number and compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the substitution order correctly. Each substitution affects the string, so the next substitution operates on the new string.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input:\n\nQueries are:\n2 → 0\n0 → 7\n\nSo first, replace 2 with 0. Then, replace 0 with 7. So the original string is \"222\". After first substitution, it becomes \"000\". Then the second substitution replaces each 0 with 7, so it becomes \"777\".\n\nWhich is correct as per the sample output.\n\nSo the substitution is done in the order of the queries.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the string transformations correctly.\n\nBut for the initial string and each substitution, processing each character and replacing as needed is manageable.\n\nBut since the substitutions can be overlapping (for example, a substitution may introduce a digit that is replaced again), we need to make sure that each substitution is applied to the current state of the string.\n\nWait, but each substitution is applied in the order given. So for each query, we perform the replacement on the current string and then proceed.\n\nSo, for each query, we process the substitution step.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\ns = initial string.\n\nfor each query in queries:\n    di, ti = parse the query into digit and replacement string.\n    s = replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n\nYes.\n\nBut how to replace all occurrences of di in s with ti?\n\nIn Python, the string replace method can be used, but it replaces all instances at once. So for a query like '2->00', s.replace('2','00') would do that.\n\nBut wait, what if di is replaced multiple times in a single substitution? Like, suppose a substitution introduces another instance of di. For example, if the substitution is '1→11', and the string is '11', then replacing '1' with '11' will result in '1111', which could then be replaced again if another substitution is processed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, each substitution is a separate step. So each substitution is processed in order, and each one replaces all occurrences of di in the current string with",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each substitution query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with another string, which can be empty. The result is then interpreted as a number, ignoring leading zeros.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Start by reading the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries:** For each query, replace all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string with the given replacement string.\n3. **Compute Result:** After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute its value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Strip leading zeros\n    stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:  # all were zeros\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Each Query:** For each query, split it into the digit to replace (`di`) and its replacement string (`ti`). Use Python's `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of `di` in `s` with `ti`.\n3. **Handling the Result:** After processing all queries, check if the resulting string `s` is empty. If it is, output 0. Otherwise, strip any leading zeros from `s` to form a valid number. If the stripped string is empty (indicating all characters were zeros), output 0. Otherwise, convert the stripped string to an integer, compute its modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\), and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each substitution query and ensures that the resulting number is computed correctly, even when leading zeros are present.",
