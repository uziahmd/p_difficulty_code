For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to understand what a beautiful multiset is. So, a beautiful multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. For each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And we need to find the number of ways to choose all c_s such that the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem says \"for every binary string s of length from 1 to n\". Oh, wait no—the beautiful multiset is of length exactly n, but the condition applies to all s of lengths 1..n as prefixes. So for each s, count how many strings in the multiset have s as a prefix and ensure that this count is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe task is to compute the number of ways to choose the c_s's so that the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, first, I think I need to model this as a combinatorial problem where for each possible choice of c_s's, the maximum possible size is f. But since f can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The beautiful multiset can be represented by the counts of each possible string of length exactly n. Wait, no, because the multiset is of length n, but the condition is about all possible prefixes of any length. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the concept of trie or prefix trees. Because for each string in the multiset, adding it affects all its prefixes.\n\nEach string t of length n contributes to the counts of all s that are its prefixes. For example, if t is '1010', then s can be '1', '10', '101', '1010'. Each of these s will have their count incremented by the number of times t is added.\n\nSo, for the entire multiset, the count for s is the sum of the counts of all t in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nSo, the beautiful multiset constraints can be thought of as:\n\nFor each s in the set of all possible strings of lengths 1..n, sum_{t in multiset, s is prefix of t} (count[t]) ≤ c_s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So t is of length n, and s can be any string of shorter length. So for each t, it contributes +count[t] to all s that are prefixes of t.\n\nSo, for each s, the total count across all t where s is a prefix of t is at most c_s.\n\nOur goal is to choose c_s values such that the maximum possible size of the multiset (sum over all t of count[t]) is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the c_s's determine the constraints on the possible counts. So for a given set of c_s's, the maximum possible size is the maximum sum of count[t], subject to for each s, sum_{t: s is prefix of t} count[t] ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a linear programming problem, but with integer variables and constraints.\n\nBut n is up to 15, which suggests that the solution may involve some bitmasking or inclusion-exclusion principles.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of inclusion. The maximum possible size is the sum of count[t], which is constrained by the c_s's.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as a product of choices for each level of the trie. Because each string of length m contributes to the constraints of all its prefixes of lengths 1 to m.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering each possible prefix s of varying lengths and determining how the c_s's contribute to the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be viewed as each c_s representing a capacity, and the maximum possible is determined by the sum of certain capacities.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem as a tree, where each node represents a prefix s, and the edges represent adding a bit (0 or 1) to form longer prefixes.\n\nIn this case, for each node s, the count of t's that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of its children. So the constraint is that for each node s, the sum of counts of its children must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible size is the sum of the counts of all leaves in this tree (since each t is a leaf of the trie). But since the trie is built for all possible binary strings, the leaves are the strings of length n.\n\nWait, maybe",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset is defined as a set where for each string \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by considering the constraints imposed by each \\( c_s \\) and how they contribute to the maximum size of the multiset. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Modeling the Problem**: Each string \\( t \\) of length \\( n \\) contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. Thus, the problem can be visualized using a trie where each node represents a prefix, and edges represent extensions by bits.\n\n2. **Constraints and Capacities**: For each node (prefix), the sum of the counts of its children (strings that extend this prefix) must not exceed \\( c_s \\). The goal is to maximize the total count of leaves (strings of length \\( n \\)) while respecting these constraints.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming on Tries**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations of \\( c_s \\) values that allow the maximum multiset size to be exactly \\( f \\). This involves considering the contribution of each prefix and ensuring the constraints are met.\n\n4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We use this principle to count the valid configurations by considering the inclusion and exclusion of constraints, ensuring we only count those configurations that meet the exact maximum size requirement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 2 up to 15\n    pow2 = [1 << i for i in range(n+1)]\n    max_pow = 1 << n\n    inv_pow2 = [pow(2, n - i, MOD) for i in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # DP state: dp[mask][i] = number of ways to assign c's for the first i nodes, given mask\n    # mask represents which prefixes have been processed\n    # Each step processes a new bit level\n    # We'll process from the root down to the leaves\n    # The order is from the root (length 1) to the leaves (length n)\n    \n    # Initialize the DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case: no nodes processed\n    \n    # For each possible mask, iterate through possible current node\n    for mask in range(max_pow):\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            if dp[mask][i] == 0:\n                continue\n            # Determine the next possible node to process\n            # Find the rightmost 0 bit in mask\n            rightmost_zero = n - 1\n            for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                if not (mask & (1 << j)):\n                    rightmost_zero = j\n                    break\n            else:\n                rightmost_zero = -1  # No more nodes\n            \n            if rightmost_zero == -1:\n                # All nodes processed\n                if i == n:\n                    dp[mask][i] = dp[mask][i]\n                continue\n            \n            # Consider adding a 0 or 1 at the rightmost_zero position\n            for b in [0, 1]:\n                new_mask = mask | (1 << rightmost_zero)\n                new_i = i + 1\n                # The new node is the child of the rightmost_zero node\n                # The new node has depth i+1, so it's a prefix of length i+1\n                # The parent node is the rightmost_zero-th node\n                parent = new_mask ^ (1 << rightmost_zero)\n                # The current node is the new_mask ^ (1 << rightmost_zero)\n                \n                # The number of ways to assign c's for the new node\n                # The maximum allowed is min(k, f - ... )\n                # Wait, no.
