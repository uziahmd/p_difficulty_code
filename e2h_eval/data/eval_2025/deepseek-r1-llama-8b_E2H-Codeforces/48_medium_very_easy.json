He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break down the problem. The input gives me two integers a and b on the first line. Then, the next line is a number in base a, which could be up to 103 digits long. My task is to convert this number into base b. But if b is 'R', then I need to represent the number as a Roman numeral instead of a decimal number.\n\nFirst, I'll need functions to handle the conversion between different numeral systems. Let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: a, b, and the number in base a.\n2. Determine whether the output should be in base b or Roman numerals.\n3. Convert the given number from base a to a decimal (integer) value.\n4. If the output is in base b, then convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n5. If the output is Roman numerals, then convert the decimal to Roman using the rules provided.\n\nWait, but wait—when the second part is 'R', what does that mean for b? Oh right, in the input, the second part is either an integer or 'R'. So, when the second part is 'R', the target base is considered to be the Roman numeral system. So, for example, if the input is '2 R', then b is R, meaning we need to output the number in Roman numerals, not in base 2.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Parse the second number in the input line. If it's 'R', then we use Roman numerals for the output. Otherwise, b is the base given, and we output in that base.\n\nBut wait, the second part of the input can be 'R' only once. Because in the input description, it says \"the second part is either an integer b or some really odd sign which looks like R\". So, each input line has a, b, then a number in base a.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is a and b. The second line is c in base a. So, the second line's c is a number in base a, which may contain letters. But in the output, I have to write c in base b, but if b is R, then write it in Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is 'R', then the output is a Roman numeral. Else, output in base b.\n\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a.\n\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n\n4. Then, depending on whether b is 'R' or not, convert the decimal number to either base b or Roman numerals.\n\nNow, let's think about how to perform each step.\n\nFirst, converting a string in base a to a decimal integer. Since a can be up to 25, the digits can include letters A-Z for values 10 and above. So, for example, in base 16, 'A' represents 10.\n\nSo, the function to convert from a string in base a to a decimal integer needs to handle each character, mapping it to its corresponding value, then compute the sum as per base a.\n\nBut wait, in the input, c is given as a string in base a. So, for example, if a is 10, '123' is 123 in decimal. If a is 16, '1A' is 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nSo, to implement this, I'll need a helper function that takes a string and a base, and returns the integer value.\n\nSimilarly, when converting back to base b, which is either a base or Roman numerals, I need to handle both cases.\n\nLet's start by writing the function to convert a base a string to a decimal integer.\n\nFunction: str_to_decimal(s, base)\n\nFor each character in s:\n   if it's a digit, get its value as int.\n   else, it's a letter. For uppercase letters, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc., case-insensitive?\nWait, in the problem statement, it says that in bases greater than 10, A is used for 10, B for 11, etc. So, the letters are uppercase.\n\nSo, for each character, we can check if it's a digit. If not, assume it's a letter, and compute its value as 10 plus the ordinal position minus 'A'. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc.\n\nBut wait, what about lowercase letters? The problem statement says that in the input, the number is in base a. So, perhaps the input will only have uppercase letters. Or maybe the code should treat both cases. Probably, the input will be correct, so the code can assume uppercase letters.\n\nSo, for each character in the string s:\n   if c is between '0'-'9', then val = int(c)\n   else, val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nThen, the total is computed as sum(val * (base^power)), where power starts from 0 for the leftmost digit.\n\nWait, no. The leftmost digit is the highest power. For example, '123' in base 10 is 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0.\n\nSo, the function can loop through each character, and for each, multiply the current total by the base and add the value.\n\nYes, that's more efficient.\n\nSo, the function:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val = int(c) if c.isdigit() else (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? The problem statement says that the number can have leading zeros but the output must omit them. So, for the conversion, leading zeros don't affect the integer value, but when outputting, they are omitted.\n\nNext, when the output is in base b, which is not 'R', I need to convert the decimal integer to a string in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nFunction: decimal_to_base(n, base):\n   if n == 0: return '0'\n   res = []\n   while n > 0:\n       rem = n % base\n       if rem < 10:\n           res.append(str(rem))\n       else:\n           res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n       n = n // base\n   return ''.join(reversed(res))\n\nWait, but wait: for bases higher than 10, letters are used for 10 and beyond. So, for rem >=10, we use 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the output must not have leading zeros. So, for example, if the input is '0' in base a, and b is 2, the output is '0'?\n\nNo, wait, the problem says that the input is a non-negative integer, but in any case except when it's a Roman numeral, it won't be zero. So, for the base b output, if the input is zero, the output is zero. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nSo, in the function, if the result is all zeros, return '0'.\n\nNow, the tricky part is converting a decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules. They are usually additive, but subtractive notation is used for certain values (IV=4, IX=9, XL=40, etc.).\n\nThe standard approach is to create a list of tuples that maps each value to its corresponding Roman numeral representation. The list includes the subtractive cases.\n\nThe list would look like:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for a given number, we iterate through this list, subtracting the largest possible value each time and appending the corresponding symbols.\n\nSo, function: decimal_to_roman(n):\n\nres = []\nfor value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n    while n >= value:\n        res.append(symbol)\n        n -= value\nreturn ''.join(res)\n\nBut wait, the order of the list is important. The larger values come first to ensure that subtractive cases are handled properly.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Read a, b from the first line. Also, read the second line, which is c in base a.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of lines, but in the sample input, it's shown as ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...]. So, the first line is a and b, and the second line is c in base a.\n\nSo, in code, read the first line as a split into two parts. The second line is the number in base a.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\na, b = line1.split()\na = int(a)\nb = int(b) if b != 'R' else None  # Wait, no, because in the input, b can be 'R'? Or wait, the problem says that the second part is either an integer or R. So, for example, in the input, the second part could be 'R'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is two integers, a and b. Or is it? Looking back:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nWait, no. The first line is two integers a and b, but b can be 'R'? Or is it that the second part is either an integer or 'R', but the first line is a and b, which are both integers. No, wait, the problem statement says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the first line is two integers a and b, but in the input, if the second part is 'R', then we treat b as the Roman numeral system. Or perhaps the first line's b can be 'R'?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\" So, the first line is a and b, but in the input, b can be 'R' indicating that the target is Roman numerals.\n\nSo, for example, the first line could be '10 R', which would mean a=10, b is Roman.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which suggests that a and b are integers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nAh, so the first line is a and b, which are integers. But in the input, b can be represented as 'R', but the first line is two integers. Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Maybe the first line is two strings, a and b, where b can be 'R' or an integer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\"\n\nWait, perhaps that was a mistake in the translation. Because in the sample input, the first line is ['10 2\\n1', ...], which suggests that the first line is a and b, which are integers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement actually allows b to be 'R' in the first line, but that's not possible because the first line is two integers. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\" So, in the first line, a is an integer, and b is either an integer or 'R'.\n\nSo, for example, the first line could be '10 R', meaning a=10, b=Rome.\n\nSo, the code needs to read the first line, split into two parts, a is int, and b is either int or 'R'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nparts = line1.split()\na = int(parts[0])\nif len(parts) == 1:\n    b = 'R'  # but according to problem statement, first line is two integers.\nWait, no, the problem statement says that the first line contains two integers, but only b can be R. So, perhaps in the input, the first line is two tokens, where the second token is either an integer or 'R'.\n\nWait, for example, the sample input shows:\n\n['10 2\\n1', ...] which suggests that the first line is two integers, a=10, b=2.\n\nAnother sample line is '2 2\\n1111001' which is a=2, b=2.\n\nBut perhaps the first line can also have b='R'?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\"\n\nSo, the first line is two integers a and b, but b can be R. Wait, but R is not an integer. Hmm, perhaps the first line is a followed by b, which can be R or an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is a and b, where b can be 'R' or a number. So, in code, we can read the first line, split into two parts, a is int, and b is either 'R' or an integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nif b_str == 'R':\n    is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b_str)\n    is_roman = False\n\nWait, but in the first line, if b is 'R', then the output is in Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's in base b.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead a and b (with b being 'R' or a number).\n\nRead the number c in base a.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert the decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n\nOutput the result without leading zeros.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nWhat if the input c is zero? According to the problem statement, the number won't be zero unless it's in Roman numerals. So, for base b, if c is zero, output '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base b, what if the number is zero? Output '0'.\n\nAlso, when converting to Roman numerals, the maximum number is 300010, which fits within the standard Roman numerals (since M is 1000, and 300010 is 300 thousand and ten, which can be written as CCCXXX...).\n\nWait, but 300010 is 300,010, which is 300 thousand and ten.\n\nIn Roman numerals, that would be written as CCCCLXVI, perhaps.\n\nWait, but the maximum number that can be represented with the given rules is 3999, but in the problem statement, the number is up to 101510, which is 101,510. So, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the functions.\n\nImplementing str_to_decimal:\n\nWe'll process each character in the string, compute its value, and accumulate.\n\nFor example, '1' in base 10 is 1.\n\nFor 'A' in base 11: 10.\n\nFor 'Z' in base 36: 35.\n\nWait, but in our problem, a and b are up to 25, so letters go up to 'Y' for 24, but perhaps the function handles up to 25.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, a and b are up to 25. So, the maximum digit value is 25.\n\nBut in the helper function, for a character c, if it's a digit, it's fine. Otherwise, it's treated as a letter, with 'A' being 10, 'B' 11, ..., 'Z' 35, but since our base is up to 25, letters beyond 'P' (which is 16) would be invalid. But the input is guaranteed to be valid, so the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nSo, the helper function can proceed as described.\n\nNow, testing the functions:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample Input:\n\n10 2\n1\n\nSample Output: 1.\n\nBecause 1 in base 10 is 1, converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n16 R\n5\n\nSo, a=16, b=R.\n\nc is '5' in base 16.\n\nConvert '5' to decimal: 5.\n\nThen, output in Roman numerals: 'V'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n5 R\n4\n\nc is '4' in base 5: 4 in decimal.\n\nOutput as Roman: 'IV'.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n1111001\n\nc is '1111001' in base 2: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 +32+16+8 +0 +0 +1 = 121.\n\nSo, output in base 2 is '1111001' as well.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n12 13\nA\n\nc is 'A' in base 12: 10.\n\nConvert to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so 'A' again.\n\nWait, but 10 in base 13 is 'A', so the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, sample outputs match.\n\nSo, the functions seem to work.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nThe code outline is:\n\nRead a and b from the first line.\n\nRead c from the second line.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', convert decimal to Roman.\n\nElse, convert decimal to base b.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, handling the case when b is 'R':\n\nWe need to generate the Roman numerals correctly.\n\nImplementing the helper function:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nTesting this function:\n\ndecimal_to_roman(5) → 'V'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(4) → 'IV'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(9) → 'IX'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(10) → 'X'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(30) → 'XXX'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(40) → 'XL'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(49) → 'XLIX'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(50) → 'L'\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the first line, split into a and b_str.\n\nIf b_str is 'R', then output is Roman.\n\nElse, b is integer, output is base b.\n\nSo, code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nis_roman = (b_str == 'R')\n\nc = input().strip()\n\n# Function to convert c from base a to decimal\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for c_char in s:\n        if c_char.isdigit():\n            val = int(c_char)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndecimal = str_to_decimal(c, a)\n\nif is_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal))\nelse:\n    def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n        if n == 0:\n            return '0'\n        res = []\n        while n > 0:\n            rem = n % base\n            if rem < 10:\n                res.append(str(rem))\n            else:\n                res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n            n = n // base\n        return ''.join(reversed(res))\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b_str)))\n\nWait, but wait: what if the decimal is zero? For example, if the input c is '0' in base a, which is allowed only when the output is in Roman numerals. But according to the problem statement, the number is non-zero unless it's in Roman numerals.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nSo, when the output is in base b, the number is non-zero, so decimal_to_base can safely assume that n>0.\n\nBut to be safe, the function handles n=0 by returning '0'.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nTesting all sample inputs:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst line: a=10, b=2 (not R).\n\nSecond line: c='1' in base 10 → 1.\n\nConvert to base 2: '1' → output '1'.\n\nSecond line of input: '16 R\\n5' → a=16, b=R.\n\nc is '5' in base 16 → 5 in decimal → 'V'.\n\nThird line: '5 R\\n4' → a=5, b=R.\n\nc='4' in base 5 → 4 in decimal → 'IV'.\n\nFourth line: '2 2\\n1111001' → a=2, b=2.\n\nc is '1111001' in base 2 → 1*64 + 1*32 + 1*16 + 1*8 + 0 + 0 +1 = 64+32=96+16=112+8=120+1=121.\n\nConvert 121 to base 2: 1111001 → output '1111001'.\n\nFifth line: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13.\n\nc='A' in base 12 → 10 in decimal.\n\nConvert to base 13: 10 → 'A'.\n\nSo, all sample outputs match.\n\nAnother test case: c is '0' in base a=10, and b=2.\n\nThe code converts 0 to base 2, which is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input c is non-zero unless it's in Roman numerals, so this case may not occur.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=10.\n\nc is '6' in base 7 → 6 in decimal → '6' in base 10.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=15.\n\nc is 'A' in base 7: 10.\n\nDecimal is 10.\n\nConvert to base 15: 10 is 'A' in base 15.\n\nSo, output 'A'.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=3.\n\nc is '222' → 2*3^2 + 2*3 +2 = 18 +6 +2=26.\n\nConvert to base 3: 222 → which is 26 in base 3.\n\nBut wait, 3^3=27>26, so 26/3=8 rem 2 → 26//3=8 rem 2 → 8//3=2 rem 2 → 2//3=0 rem 2 → digits 2,2,2 → '222'.\n\nSo, code should output '222'.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, but wait, the problem states that a and b are >=2.\n\nWait, problem statement says 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25. So, a and b are at least 2.\n\nSo, no issues with base 1.\n\nNow, the code seems solid.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code reads the first line, splits into a and b. Then reads the second line as c.\n\nConverts c from base a to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', output the Roman numeral.\n\nElse, output the number in base b.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut wait, the initial code had functions inside the code. So, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input lines.\n\nHandle the conversion.\n\nBut the code is as follows:\n\nRead line1 and line2.\n\nImplement the helper functions.\n\nBut perhaps the functions can be defined outside.\n\nAlternatively, code can be written inline.\n\nSo, here's the full code:\n\nRead the first line as a and b.\n\nRead the second line as c.\n\nConvert c to decimal.\n\nDepending on b, decide to output Roman or base b.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nis_roman = (b_str == 'R')\n\nc = input().strip()\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            val = int(char)\n        else:\n            val = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndecimal = str_to_decimal(c, a)\n\nif is_roman:\n    def decimal_to_roman(n):\n        val = [\n            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for (i, r) in val:\n            while n >= i:\n                res.append(r)\n                n -= i\n        return ''.join(res)\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal))\nelse:\n    def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n        if n == 0:\n            return '0'\n        res = []\n        while n > 0:\n            rem = n % base\n            if rem < 10:\n                res.append(str(rem))\n            else:\n                res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n            n = n // base\n        return ''.join(reversed(res))\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b_str)))\n\nWait, but the functions are defined inside the code, which is okay.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n1\n\nSample Output: 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n5\n\nSample Output: V.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n4\n\nSample Output: IV.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n1111001\n\nSample Output: 1111001.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\nA\n\nSample Output: A.\n\nAll pass.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, c='22' → 2*3 +2=8.\n\nIf b=10, output is 8.\n\nIf b=16, output is 8.\n\nIf b is 'R', output is VIII.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, c='55' → 5*6 +5 = 35.\n\nIf b=10, output is 35.\n\nIf b=6, output is 55.\n\nIf b=16, output is 23.\n\nIf b is 'R', output is XXXV.\n\nSo, code should handle these.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard integer base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves reading the input values, converting the number to a decimal (integer) format, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals based on the specified output requirements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line contains two integers `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating that the output should be in Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal:** Convert the given number from base `a` to a decimal (integer) value.\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals:** If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to its Roman numeral representation using standard Roman numeral rules.\n4. **Conversion to Base `b`:** If the target base `b` is an integer, convert the decimal number to this base, ensuring the result has no leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nline1 = input().strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nis_roman = (b_str == 'R')\n\nc = input().strip()\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            val = int(char)\n        else:\n            val = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndecimal = str_to_decimal(c, a)\n\nif is_roman:\n    def decimal_to_roman(n):\n        val = [\n            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for (i, r) in val:\n            while n >= i:\n                res.append(r)\n                n -= i\n        return ''.join(res)\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal))\nelse:\n    def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n        if n == 0:\n            return '0'\n        res = []\n        while n > 0:\n            rem = n % base\n            if rem < 10:\n                res.append(str(rem))\n            else:\n                res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n            n = n // base\n        return ''.join(reversed(res))\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b_str)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into the base values `a` and `b`, and the number string `c`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal:** The function `str_to_decimal` converts the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character, mapping digits and letters to their respective values, and accumulating the total.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral string by iterating through predefined values and their corresponding Roman symbols, subtracting the largest possible values first.\n4. **Base Conversion:** The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified base `b`, ensuring the result is a string without leading zeros. Each digit is determined by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and handling remainders appropriately.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both the conversion from a custom base to decimal and the subsequent conversion to either a standard base or Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
