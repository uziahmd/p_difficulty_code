For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (a set of three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The definition of major and minor chords is based on the distances between the notes in a certain order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. These are arranged cyclically, meaning after H comes C again. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So, each step from one note to the next adds a semitone.\n\nA major triad has three notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3. So overall, X to Z is 7 semitones. A minor triad has X-Y as 3 semitones and Y-Z as 4, making X-Z 7 as well.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is an unordered set, so we can arrange the three notes in any order to see if they fit either pattern.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible permutation of the three notes, compute all possible adjacent distances and check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nWait, but since the triad is unordered, perhaps it's better to generate all possible orderings of the three notes and for each, calculate the distances.\n\nLet me think about how to model the notes. Each note can be represented by its position in the list. For example:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo each note has an index from 0 to 11. Then, the distance between two notes x and y is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but considering that the distance is always measured forward, meaning from lower to higher. So for example, from E to C, the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8 semitones? Or wait, no. Wait, according to the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones moving upwards from X to Y. So if X is C (index 0) and Y is E (index 4), the distance is 4 semitones. If X is E and Y is C, then the distance is (0 -4) mod 12? Wait, no— because moving from E to C, you go through F, F#, G, etc., so that's 8 semitones.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Y should be taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost one\". So regardless of the order of X and Y, the distance is the minimal path. But wait, no. Because, for example, the problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones, and between E and C is 8. So it's not the minimal distance; it's the distance in the direction from lower to higher in the scale.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost. So if X is E and Y is C, the distance is the same as moving from E up to C, which is 8 semitones. So the distance is computed as (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12, but only if Y is after X in the order. Wait, no. Because if X is C (0) and Y is H (11), then the distance is 11 semitones. If X is H and Y is C, the distance is 1 semitone (since from H to C is just one step).\n\nWait, no. Because the problem states that after H comes C again. So the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. So in terms of positions, H is 11, C is 0. So the distance is (0 - 11) mod 12 → which is 1. Because moving forward from H (11) to C (0) is one semitone.\n\nSo the correct way to calculate the distance from X to Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12. Because if Y is after X in the list, then it's Y_pos - X_pos. If Y is before X, then it wraps around, so (Y_pos - X_pos + 12) mod 12.\n\nSo for example:\nX = C (0), Y = E (4) → 4.\nX = E (4), Y = C (0): (0-4) mod12 → (-4 mod12) is 8.\n\nYes, that makes sense with the problem statement.\n\nSo for any pair of notes, their distance is (y -x) mod 12, where x and y are their positions in the order list.\n\nNow, given three notes, say A, B, C, I need to consider all possible orderings of these three notes as X, Y, Z. For each ordering, I'll compute the distances between X and Y, and Y and Z, and see if they match the major or minor criteria.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input as a list of three notes.\n2. Create a mapping from note names to their positions in the order.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes (since it's unordered, all possible orders are possible).\n4. For each permutation, compute the distances between the first and second, and between the second and third.\n5. Check if any permutation satisfies the major condition: (distance X-Y =4 and Y-Z=3) OR minor condition: (distance X-Y=3 and Y-Z=4).\n6. If any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'.\n7. Else, if any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'.\n8. Else, return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so there's no case where a chord is both major and minor. So, for each permutation, we can check for major first, then minor, and once a condition is met, we can stop checking further permutations.\n\nAlso, considering that there are 3! = 6 permutations for each trio of distinct notes, but perhaps some may have the same order. But no, all six are unique.\n\nWait, but what if two notes are the same? Oh, but the problem says that the triads consist of exactly three notes. Wait, looking back: the problem says \"a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes.\" But for triads, it's exactly three. However, the problem doesn't specify that the three notes are distinct. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly three notes\" for a triad. So, perhaps the same note can appear multiple times? Or are all three distinct?\n\nLooking at the examples: In the first example, 'C E G' is a major triad. All notes are distinct. Second example, 'C# B F' becomes 'B C# F' which is minor. Again, all distinct.\n\nSo, perhaps in the problem, the three notes are all distinct. So, the code can assume that all three are different.\n\nSo, for the code, the steps are:\n\n- Read the three notes as a list, split into individual strings.\n- Create a dictionary to map each note name to its index.\n- Generate all possible permutations of the three notes. For each permutation (order) (x, y, z):\n   - Compute d1 = (y_pos - x_pos) mod12\n   - Compute d2 = (z_pos - y_pos) mod12\n   - Check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n   - Else, check if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n   - If either condition is met, return accordingly.\n- After checking all permutations, if none meet major or minor, return 'strange'.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the chord is an unordered set. So, any arrangement of the three notes can be considered. So, in the code, for each permutation of the three, we can check.\n\nSo, in Python, I can use itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All three notes are the same. Well, the problem says that a triad must consist of exactly three notes, but if they are all the same, like C C C, then any permutation will have x=y=z. So, the distances between x and y is zero, and between y and z is zero. So neither major nor minor. So output is 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord. So, perhaps in the problem, the three notes are all distinct, but the code should handle any case.\n\nAnother edge case: The three notes form a major triad, but also another arrangement forms a minor. But according to the problem statement, this won't happen. So, the code can safely return the first condition met.\n\nNow, implementing this in code.\n\nFirst, create the notes_order list.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, create a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, read the input as a list, split into three elements.\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for all permutations of the three notes:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    # Compute distances\n    d_xy = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d_yz = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nIf after all permutations are checked and none satisfy, print 'strange'.\n\nWait, but what about the order of checking? Since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, once a condition is found, we can exit early.\n\nSo, the code would look something like this.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. So, the code reads them correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nWait, but the code expects the input as a single line. Wait, no, the input is a single line with three space-separated tokens, each being a note.\n\nWait, in the sample input, it's written as:\n\nInput:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a representation. The actual input is a single line, like 'C E G C# B F A B H' ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the input is three space-separated notes. So, for example, the first example's input is three separate triads, but that's probably a typo. No, the problem says the input is three notes, each of which is a string, but I think each note is a single token.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\"\n\nSo, for example, the input line would be \"C E G\".\n\nWait, no, looking at the sample input given:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error, because each note is a single word. So the actual input is three notes, each being a single string, separated by spaces. Like 'C E G' is a single input line, consisting of three notes: 'C', 'E', 'G'.\n\nWait, no, because in the sample input, the first element is 'C E G', which is three notes, but that's not how the problem describes it. So perhaps the problem's sample input is misleading, but the actual input is three space-separated note names, each being a single token, like 'C', 'E', 'G' as three separate entries.\n\nSo, the code should read a single line, split into three parts, each part being a note.\n\nThus, the code would read:\n\nline = input().strip()\nnotes = line.split()\n\nWhich would give a list of three strings.\n\nIn the sample input, the first test case is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], which probably isn't the case. It's more likely that each note is a single word, and the sample input is a typo.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is a list of three triads, each consisting of three notes. That would make sense. So, the first input is a list of three triads, each of which has three notes.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says the input is three notes. So the sample input in the problem is probably incorrect in representation.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Chord\n\nVasya studies music... \n\nInput:\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nWait, this suggests that each input is a list of three triads, each containing three notes. So, perhaps the actual input is three triads, each with three notes, and the program needs to process each one.\n\nWait, but the problem says the input is three notes, not three triads. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps each note is a string that can include spaces, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is actually a list of three triads, each with three notes, but the problem statement says the input is three notes. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\" So each note is a single token, separated by spaces. So, the input is three note names, each being a single word.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is three notes: 'C E G' is the first note? No, that can't be right because each note is a single token.\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is a typo, and the correct input is three separate note names, each being a single token. So for the first sample, the input is 'C E G', which is three tokens: 'C', 'E', 'G'. Similarly, the second input is 'C# B F', which is three tokens: 'C#', 'B', 'F'. The third input is 'A B H', which is three tokens: 'A', 'B', 'H'.\n\nSo, the code should read a single line, split into three note names.\n\nIn that case, the sample input would be:\n\nInput:\nC E G\nC# B F\nA B H\n\nBut that would require each note to be on a separate line, which is not the case. So perhaps the sample input is presented incorrectly, and in reality, each input is a single line with three note names, each being a single token.\n\nSo, the code will process each of the three notes, generate all permutations, and determine whether any permutation forms a major or minor chord.\n\nSo, with that in mind, the code structure is as follows.\n\nImplementing the code:\n\nImport necessary modules, like itertools.permutations.\n\nRead the three notes from input.\n\nCreate the note_to_index mapping.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation, compute the distances.\n\nCheck for major or minor condition.\n\nOnce found, output the result.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, testing some cases.\n\nTest Case 1: 'C E G'\n\nNotes: C (0), E (4), G (7)\n\nPermutations:\n\nC, E, G:\n\nd1 = (4-0) mod12 =4.\n\nd2=(7-4)=3 mod12=3. So major.\n\nSo output is 'major'.\n\nTest Case 2: 'C# B F'\n\nNotes: C# (1), B (10), F (5).\n\nPermutation: B, C#, F.\n\nCompute d_xy: C# - B is (1 -10) mod12 → (1-10 = -9 mod12 is 3).\n\nd_yz: F - C# →5-1=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo d_xy=3, d_yz=4 → minor.\n\nThus, output 'minor'.\n\nThird test case: 'A B H'\n\nNotes: A(9), B(10), H(11).\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nOne possible permutation: A, B, H.\n\nd_xy: (10-9)=1 mod12=1.\n\nd_yz: (11-10)=1 mod12=1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\nd_xy: (11-9)=2.\n\nd_yz: (10-11) mod12 → (10-11+12) =11 → no, wait, (10 -11) is -1 mod12 is 11. So d_yz is 11, which is not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nd_xy: (9-10) mod12 →-1 mod12=11.\n\nd_yz: (11-9)=2.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nd_xy: (11-10)=1.\n\nd_yz: (9-11) mod12 → (9-11+12)=10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\nd_xy: (9-11) mod12 →-2 →10.\n\nd_yz: (10-9)=1.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A.\n\nd_xy: (10-11) mod12 →-1 →11.\n\nd_yz: (9-10) mod12 →-1 →11.\n\nNope.\n\nSo, none of the permutations satisfy major or minor. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the sample outputs make sense.\n\nAnother test case: all same note, e.g., 'C C C'.\n\nEach permutation will have d_xy=0, d_yz=0. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: notes are C, D#, G.\n\nC is 0, D# is 3, G is 6.\n\nPermutation: C, D#, G.\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz=3. Not major or minor.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, G, C.\n\nd_xy: G (6) - D# (3) =3.\n\nd_yz: C (0) - G (6) mod12=6.\n\nSo d_xy=3, d_yz=6. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C, D#.\n\nd_xy: (0-6) mod12=6.\n\nd_yz: (3-0)=3.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother permutation: G, D#, C.\n\nd_xy: D# (3) - G (6) mod12 → (3-6) mod12=9.\n\nd_yz: C (0) - D# (3) mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, so this triad is 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: C, D, G.\n\nC is 0, D is 2, G is7.\n\nPermutation: C, D, G.\n\nd_xy=2, d_yz=5. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C, G, D.\n\nd_xy: G(7) - C(0) mod12=7.\n\nd_yz: D(2) - G(7) mod12= (2-7) mod12= ( -5 mod12 )=7. So d_xy=7, d_yz=7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother permutation: D, C, G.\n\nd_xy: C(0)-D(2) mod12=10.\n\nd_yz: G(7) - C(0) mod12=7.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother permutation: D, G, C.\n\nd_xy: G(7) - D(2) mod12=5.\n\nd_yz: C(0) - G(7) mod12=5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C, D.\n\nd_xy: C(0) - G(7) mod12=5.\n\nd_yz: D(2) - C(0) mod12=2.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: G, D, C.\n\nd_xy: D(2) - G(7) mod12= (2-7) mod12=7.\n\nd_yz: C(0) - D(2) mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, so this triad is 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G.\n\nAs earlier, it's a major triad.\n\nAnother test case: C#, E, G.\n\nC# is 1, E is4, G is7.\n\nPermutation: C#, E, G.\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz=3. Not major.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C#, G.\n\nd_xy: (1-4) mod12=11.\n\nd_yz: (7-1)=6.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: E, G, C#.\n\nd_xy: (7-4)=3.\n\nd_yz: (1-7) mod12= 1-7= -6 mod12=6.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C#, E.\n\nd_xy: (1-7) mod12=6.\n\nd_yz: (4-1)=3.\n\nSo d_xy=6, d_yz=3. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: G, E, C#.\n\nd_xy: (4-7) mod12= 9.\n\nd_yz: (1-4) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a triad is minor if the notes are in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct as designed.\n\nSo, the code will process all possible permutations and find if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nWe need to import itertools.permutations.\n\nRead the input as a list of three note names.\n\nThen, for each permutation, compute the distances.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_line = input().strip()\ninput_notes = input_line.split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d_xy = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d_yz = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes, each of which is a single token. So, for the sample input, the code will process each permutation correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, but the code reads input_notes as a list of three tokens, each being a note. So, in the sample input, the first input is a single line with three note names, each being a single token. But the way the sample input is presented is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a list of three triads, each with three notes. So, the actual input is three lines, each with three notes. But the problem says the input is a single line, so perhaps the sample input is incorrectly presented.\n\nBut regardless, the code is correct as written.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, the code is reading a single line, which is split into three tokens. So, for example, if the input is \"C E G\", the code reads input_notes as ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nAnother thing: in the problem statement, the sample input is presented as a list of three triads, each with three notes. But the actual input is a single line with three note names, each being a single token.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about if the same note appears more than once? Like 'C C E'.\n\nIn this case, the code will process all permutations, but for each permutation, the distances may not meet major or minor.\n\nFor example, C, C, E: in any permutation, the distance between C and C is zero, so d_xy is zero, and d_yz could be 4 (if E is third). So, in the permutation C, C, E: d_xy=0, d_yz=4. Not matching major or minor.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, C: d_xy=4, d_yz= (C - E) mod12= (0 -4) mod12=8. So d_xy=4, d_yz=8. Not matching.\n\nSo, the code will return 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the problem uses H instead of B in some contexts. Wait, no. Looking back: the problem defines the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the last note, followed by C again.\n\nSo, the code correctly includes H as the 11th index.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The problem is based on the distances between the notes in a cyclic musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: A major triad is defined by two specific distances between consecutive notes when ordered correctly: 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones. A minor triad has the distances reversed: 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n2. **Cyclic Nature of Notes**: The musical notes are cyclic, meaning after 'H' comes 'C' again. This cyclicity affects how we calculate the distance between notes.\n3. **Permutations of Notes**: Since the order of the notes can vary, we need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation fits the major or minor triad criteria.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_line = input().strip()\ninput_notes = input_line.split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d_xy = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d_yz = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to its index in the cyclic order of the scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: We generate all permutations of the three notes to consider every possible ordering.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature.\n5. **Check Conditions**: If any permutation matches the major or minor triad conditions, print the result and exit. If no permutation matches, print \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the type of triad or determine that it is neither, efficiently handling all edge cases due to the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
