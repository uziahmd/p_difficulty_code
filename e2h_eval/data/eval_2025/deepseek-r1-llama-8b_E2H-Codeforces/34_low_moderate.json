And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. \n\nHmm, let me break down what's given. We have n days of sleep data and k consecutive days make up a week. So, the number of weeks we need to consider is n - k + 1. For each week (which is a consecutive k days), we calculate the sum of sleep hours, then find the average over all these weeks.\n\nWait, right. So for example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 weeks: days 1-2 and 2-3. Each week contributes its sum, then divide by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has n and k, second line has the list of a_i.\n2. Compute the sum for each sliding window of size k in the array a.\n3. Sum all those window sums and divide by the number of windows (n-k+1) to get the average.\n4. Output the average with at least 6 decimal digits, ensuring precision.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently compute the sliding window sums without doing it in O(nk) time, which could be slow for n up to 2e5?\n\nOh right, because if I naively compute each window by summing k elements each time, that would be O(n*k) which for 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. The solution is to compute the prefix sum array. That way, each window's sum can be computed in O(1) time after preprocessing.\n\nLet me think about the prefix sum approach. The prefix sum array S where S[0] = 0, S[1] = a_1, S[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. Then the sum from i to j (inclusive) is S[j] - S[i-1].\n\nFor the sliding window starting at position i (0-based?), no, maybe 1-based. Wait, let's clarify indices.\n\nAssuming the array is 0-based. Then the sum from index l to r (inclusive) is S[r+1] - S[l], assuming S is 0-based with S[0]=0.\n\nWait, no. Let me define S as an array where S[i] is the sum of the first i elements. So S[0] = 0, S[1] = a[0], S[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Then the sum from a[p] to a[q] (inclusive) is S[q+1] - S[p].\n\nSo for each window starting at index p (0-based) and covering k elements (p, p+1, ..., p+k-1), the sum is S[p + k] - S[p].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo first, compute the prefix sum array S. Then for each window from 0 to n-k, compute S[p +k] - S[p], sum all these, and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nThat's efficient because computing the prefix sum is O(n), and then iterating through all windows is O(n), so overall O(n) time.\n\nGreat, so the plan is:\n\n- Read n, k.\n- Read the array a.\n- Compute the prefix sum S.\n- Compute the total sum of all window sums:\n   - For each window start p (from 0 to n -k):\n      - sum += S[p +k] - S[p]\n- Average is total_sum / (n -k +1)\n- Print the average with 10 decimal digits or more, ensuring that the output meets the required precision.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output the average with at least six decimal places, but perhaps more digits to ensure that when rounded, it's correct. So we need to format the output accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is two integers, n and k. The second line is n integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read using input().split(). But for larger inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the given constraints (n up to 2e5), it's manageable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nImport necessary modules: sys and perhaps math for any calculations.\n\nRead n, k: n, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nRead a: a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute the prefix sum S. Initialize S as [0]*(n+1). Then for i in range(n), S[i+1] = S[i] + a[i].\n\nThen, compute the total",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a sequence of days. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such windows within the given sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, we read the input values which include the number of days (n), the number of days in a week (k), and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Compute Prefix Sums**: We use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum array helps us compute the sum of elements between any two indices in constant time.\n3. **Calculate Window Sums**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each window of size k. This allows us to efficiently determine the sum of each consecutive k-day period.\n4. **Sum All Window Sums**: Sum all the computed window sums and then divide by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Output the Result**: Format the result to ensure it has at least 6 decimal places, considering the required precision.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for p in range(num_windows):\n        end = p + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[p]\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input Efficiently**: The input is read all at once using `sys.stdin.read()` for efficiency, especially given the potentially large input size.\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built in linear time, allowing us to compute any subarray sum in constant time.\n- **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, each window's sum is computed in constant time, leading to an overall linear time complexity for this step.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average, which is then formatted to meet the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",
