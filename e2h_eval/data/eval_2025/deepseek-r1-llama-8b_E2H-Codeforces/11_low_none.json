A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, a lime slice, and salt. They have certain resources: a number of bottles, limes cut into slices, and salt.\n\nHmm, let me break down the input variables:\n\nn: number of friends\nk: number of bottles\nl: milliliters per bottle\nc: number of limes\nd: slices per lime\np: grams of salt\n\nEach toast per friend needs:\nnl milliliters of drink\na slice (so each toast for all friends uses one slice)\nnp grams of salt\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the way the problem is described: each friend needs nl ml, a slice, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends need together: n * nl ml of drink, n slices (since each of the n friends takes one), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the total drink available is k * l. The total slices available are c * d. The total salt is p.\n\nWe need to find out how many toasts each friend can make, ensuring that all of them can do the same number. So the maximum number of toasts T must satisfy:\n\nT <= (total_drink) / (n * nl)\nT <= (total_slices) / n\nT <= (total_salt) / (n * np)\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values, floor divided by 1, but since T has to be integer, right?\n\nWait, because each toast consumes these resources once. So for T toasts, you need:\n\nDrink: T * n * nl <= k*l → T <= (k*l)/(n*nl)\nSlices: T * n <= c*d → T <= (c*d)/n\nSalt: T * n * np <= p → T <= p/(n*np)\n\nSo the maximum T is the minimum of those three.\n\nBut wait, we have to take the floor, because T has to be an integer. So compute each of the three possible T values, then take the minimum, and that's our answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total drink available: k * l.\n2. Divide that by (n * nl). That gives the maximum possible T from drink.\n3. Calculate the total slices: c * d.\n4. Divide that by n. That gives the maximum T from slices.\n5. Calculate the total salt: p.\n6. Divide that by (n * np). That gives the maximum T from salt.\n7. Take the minimum of these three Ts, and that's the answer.\n\nWait, but all of these divisions must be integer divisions because you can't have a fraction of a toast. So we should use integer division, flooring the result.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 20.\n\nn * nl = 3*3=9. 20 /9 is 2.222... → T from drink is 2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Divided by n=3: 26.666, so T is 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, n*np=3*1=3. 100/3=33.333 → T is 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink is 1000. n*nl=5*4=20. 1000/20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → 19 slices. Divided by 5: 3.8 → 3.\n\nSalt: p=90, n*np=5*3=15. 90/15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) is 3. So output is 3.\n\nThird sample:10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, drink=10^4? Wait, no: k=1000, l=1000 → 1e6? Or wait, 1000 *1000 is 1,000,000.\n\nn * nl is 10 *50=500. 1e6 /500 is 2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → 575. Divided by 10 is 57.5 → 57.\n\nSalt: p=1, n*np=10*1=10. 1/10 is 0.1 → 0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Limits**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the total availability and the requirements per toast.\n3. **Find the Bottleneck**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is found by taking the minimum of the three computed values from the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input as a single line and split into integers\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the total resources\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\n# Compute the maximum possible toasts for each resource\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoasts_slices = total_slices // n\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\n# The answer is the minimum of the three possible toast counts\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_slices, toasts_salt)\n\n# Output the result as a string\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers which are read and split into respective variables.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**: \n   - `total_drink` is the product of the number of bottles `k` and the milliliters per bottle `l`.\n   - `total_slices` is the product of the number of limes `c` and the slices per lime `d`.\n   - `total_salt` is simply the given amount `p`.\n3. **Max Toasts per Resource**: \n   - `toasts_drink` is the total drink divided by the amount needed per toast per friend (`n * nl`).\n   - `toasts_slices` is the total slices divided by the number of friends `n`.\n   - `toasts_salt` is the total salt divided by the amount needed per toast per friend (`n * np`).\n4. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The minimum value among `toasts_drink`, `toasts_slices`, and `toasts_salt` determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends have the same number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum number of toasts by considering each resource constraint and finding the bottleneck, ensuring an optimal solution.",
