Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Petya selling souvenirs. He has n souvenirs, each with a weight and a cost. He wants to choose a subset where the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, right. So it's a classic knapsack problem. But wait, the constraints are a bit tricky. Let me look at the input details.\n\nThe first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each with wi and ci. The weights can be up to 3, which is small. Oh right, that's a clue. So the maximum weight per item is 3, and the maximum m is 300,000. That's a big number.\n\nWait, in the standard knapsack problem, if the weight is small, we can group items by their weight and then use a DP approach for each group. But here, since the maximum weight is 3, maybe we can handle each weight class separately.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each item can have a weight of 1, 2, or 3. So perhaps we can process all items of weight 1 first, then weight 2, then weight 3, and for each, compute how many we can take without exceeding m, trying to maximize the total cost.\n\nBut no, because taking more of a heavier item might give a better cost than lighter ones. So the order of processing matters. We need to find the optimal combination across all three weight groups.\n\nAnother approach: Since the maximum weight is 3, the possible capacities can be broken down into different regions based on how much of each weight we take.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible weight is 3, and m can be up to 3e5, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Let's think about the DP state.\n\nIn the standard 0-1 knapsack, dp[i][w] represents the maximum value up to the ith item and weight w. Here, since the number of items is up to 1e5, a standard 2D DP would be impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nSo we need a way to represent the DP efficiently. Wait, but the weights are small (up to 3), so perhaps we can represent the DP in terms of the current weight modulo some number, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: since the maximum weight per item is 3, the maximum total weight we can carry is 3 * (n). But if m is up to 3e5, and n is up to 1e5, 3*1e5 is 3e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each possible weight from 0 to m, we can track the maximum cost. So the DP array would be size m+1, and for each item, we iterate through the weights from high to low, updating the dp array.\n\nBut with n being 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the time complexity is O(n*m) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow. That won't work.\n\nSo that's not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, considering that the maximum weight is 3, perhaps we can group the items by their weight and process each group optimally, then combine the results.\n\nFor example:\n\nGroup 1: all items with weight 1.\n\nGroup 2: all items with weight 2.\n\nGroup 3: all items with weight 3.\n\nThen, for each group, we can sort the items in descending order of cost, so that taking the top k gives us the best possible sum for that group.\n\nOnce we have these sorted lists, the problem reduces to choosing how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems similar to the unbounded knapsack problem, except that each group has a fixed weight per item.\n\nWait, no. Each item in a group contributes a certain weight and value. So for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums of their costs, ordered by highest cost first.\n\nFor example, for group 1, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum array s1[k] is the total cost of taking the top k items (each with weight 1).\n\nSimilarly for group 2, s2[k] is the sum of top k items (each weight 2), and group3, s3[k] is for weight 3.\n\nThen, the problem becomes: find non-negative integers a, b, c such that:\n\n1*a + 2*b + 3*c <= m,\n\nand s1[a] + s2[b] + s3[c] is maximized.\n\nBut how to efficiently find a, b, c that satisfy the constraint and maximize the sum.\n\nHmm",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. This is a classic knapsack problem with specific constraints on the weights of the items.\n\n### Approach\nGiven the constraints where each souvenir's weight is either 1, 2, or 3, we can efficiently solve the problem by grouping the items based on their weights and using dynamic programming to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. **Grouping Items**: We group the items into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3). For each group, we sort the items in descending order of their cost and compute prefix sums to quickly calculate the maximum cost for taking the top k items from each group.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight of `i`. We iterate through each group and update the dp array to reflect the best possible cost for each weight.\n\n3. **Combining Results**: After processing all groups, we check the dp array to find the maximum cost within the given weight limit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    items = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        w, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        items.append((w, c))\n    \n    # Separate items into groups by weight\n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    for w, c in items:\n        if w == 1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order and compute prefix sums\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in group1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in group2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in group3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n    \n    # Now, compute the maximum value using the prefix sums\n    max_cost = 0\n    for a in range(len(prefix1)):\n        for b in range(len(prefix2)):\n            current_weight = a + 2*b\n            if current_weight > m:\n                continue\n            remaining_weight = m - current_weight\n            c = min(remaining_weight // 3, len(prefix3)-1)\n            total = prefix1[a] + prefix2[b] + prefix3[c]\n            if total > max_cost:\n                max_cost = total\n    \n    print(max_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: The items are grouped by their weights (1, 2, 3) and sorted in descending order of their costs. This allows us to efficiently compute the maximum cost for taking the top k items from each group using prefix sums.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums**: For each group, we compute prefix sums which help in quickly determining the total cost of taking the top k items from that group.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: We iterate over the possible number of items taken from each group, updating the dp array to keep track of the maximum cost achievable for each possible weight up to m.\n\n4. **Maximizing Cost**: By iterating through all combinations of items taken from each group, we find the combination that maximizes the total cost without exceeding the weight limit m.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we find the optimal solution within a reasonable time frame.",
