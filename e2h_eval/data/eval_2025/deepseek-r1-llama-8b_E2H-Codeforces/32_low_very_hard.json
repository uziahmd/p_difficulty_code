    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find the minimum possible instability after this removal.\n\nHmm. So, for example, if the array is [1,3,3,7], removing 7 gives us [1,3,3], where the max is 3 and min is 1, so instability is 2. That's better than not removing any, which would have been 6 (7-1). Another example: [1,100000]. Removing either gives a single element, so max and min are the same, instability is zero.\n\nSo how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about what affects the instability when we remove an element. The instability of the array depends on the current max and min. If I remove an element that's either the current max or current min, perhaps that could reduce the instability.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple instances of the max or min? For example, if the array has several elements equal to the max or min. Then, removing just one might not change the max or min.\n\nSo the key idea is: after removing one element, the new array's max and min could be influenced by whether that element was the old max, old min, or neither.\n\nBut considering all possibilities naively would be too slow, especially since n can be up to 1e5.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial max and min of the array. The initial instability is max - min.\n\n2. When we remove an element, the new instability depends on what happens to the max and min.\n\nCase 1: The element removed is the current max.\n\nThen, the new max is the next highest value in the array. If there are multiple max elements, removing one won't change the max.\n\nSimilarly, if the element is the current min, and there are multiple min elements, the new min remains the same.\n\nSo, to find the best candidate for removal, I should consider all possible candidates where the element is either the max or min, but only if removing them changes the overall max or min.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to precompute for each position, what would be the new max and min if that element is removed, then compute the instability and track the minimum.\n\nBut computing this for every element is O(n), and for each element, finding the new max and min would take O(n) time, which would make it O(n^2) total—this is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFind all possible candidates for the new max and min after removing each element.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution will involve removing either the current max, or the current min, or some other element that's close to them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability after removal is either:\n\na) the original instability minus the difference that the removed element had with the max or min.\n\nWait, let's think about this.\n\nSuppose the original max is M and original min is m. The initial instability is M - m.\n\nIf I remove an element that is not M or m, then the new instability could be M' - m', where M' is still the max (if the removed element wasn't M), and m' is still the min (if the removed element wasn't m).\n\nSo, if I remove an element that's neither max nor min, the instability remains the same as before. Because both the max and min stay the same.\n\nWait, no. Because if the element is in between, then the new array's max and min could change only if the max or min was that element.\n\nWait, for example: array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. If I remove 3, the max becomes 4, min is 1. So the instability remains 3.\n\nBut if I remove 4, the new max is 3. So the instability is 3-1=2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the original instability was 3 (4-1). After removing 4, the new instability is 2 (3-1). So it decreased.\n\nSo, the key is: when you remove an element that's either the max or the min, the new instability could be smaller.\n\nSo the strategy is to find, among all possible elements, the one whose removal leads to the smallest possible (max' - min'), where max' is the new max and min' is the new min.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative plan:\n\nCompute the global max and min of the array.\n\nFor each element x in the array, consider two scenarios:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, determine the initial maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values of the array. These values help us understand the current instability.\n2. **Track Elements**: We need to track how each element affects the instability when removed. Specifically, we are interested in elements that are either the current max_val or min_val because removing these can potentially reduce the instability.\n3. **Check for Multiple Occurrences**: If there are multiple occurrences of the max_val or min_val, removing one instance might not change the overall max_val or min_val. Thus, we need to check if the max_val or min_val occurs more than once.\n4. **Compute New Instability**: For each candidate element (either max_val or min_val), compute the new instability by considering the next highest value if the max_val is removed, and the next lowest value if the min_val is removed.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: Track the minimum instability across all possible removals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_val = max(a)\n    min_val = min(a)\n    candidates = []\n    count_max = a.count(max_val)\n    count_min = a.count(min_val)\n    \n    # Check if max can be reduced by removing one occurrence\n    if count_max > 1:\n        new_max = max_val\n    else:\n        new_max = -float('inf')\n        for num in a:\n            if num != max_val:\n                new_max = max(new_max, num)\n    \n    # Check if min can be increased by removing one occurrence\n    if count_min > 1:\n        new_min = min_val\n    else:\n        new_min = float('inf')\n        for num in a:\n            if num != min_val:\n                new_min = min(new_min, num)\n    \n    # Now, find all possible candidates: remove each max or each min\n    candidates = []\n    # Collect all indices where value is max_val\n    max_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == max_val]\n    for idx in max_indices:\n        temp = a[:idx] + a[idx+1:]\n        current_max = max(temp)\n        current_min = min(temp)\n        candidates.append(current_max - current_min)\n    \n    # Collect all indices where value is min_val\n    min_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == min_val]\n    for idx in min_indices:\n        temp = a[:idx] + a[idx+1:]\n        current_max = max(temp)\n        current_min = min(temp)\n        candidates.append(current_max - current_min)\n    \n    # The minimal candidate is the answer\n    print(min(candidates))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Setup**: Read the input values and determine the initial max and min of the array.\n2. **Track Occurrences**: Count how many times the max and min values appear in the array. This helps in determining if removing one occurrence will affect the overall max or min.\n3. **Check Removal Impact**: For each occurrence of the max and min values, simulate their removal and compute the new max and min for the resulting array.\n4. **Compute Instability**: For each simulated removal, calculate the instability and track the minimum value.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the minimum instability found.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential candidates for removal and ensures that we find the optimal solution without unnecessary computations.",
