    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is called Array Stabilization. We are given an array of integers. The instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array. Our task is to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting instability is minimized. We need to find this minimum possible instability.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element we can remove, we calculate the instability of the remaining array and then choose the smallest among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, so a brute-force approach where we try removing each element and compute the max and min each time would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. That's not going to work for large n.\n\nSo I need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think: The initial instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove an element, the new instability could be either:\n\n- The same as before, if the removed element wasn't either the current max or min.\nOr,\n- It could be lower if the removed element was the max or min, because after removal, the new max is less than the old max, or the new min is higher than the old min.\n\nWait, but how do I find the best element to remove? Maybe I should consider all possible candidates that are either the current max or min, since removing any other element won't affect the instability.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because sometimes, even if an element isn't the current max or min, removing it might allow the next max or min to be closer, thereby reducing the instability.\n\nBut considering all possibilities isn't feasible due to time constraints.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. The minimal possible instability after removing one element will be determined by the second smallest maximum and second smallest minimum.\n\nWait, here's an idea: The minimal instability after removal would be either (max - second_max) or (second_min - min), whichever is smaller. Or maybe it's the minimal of all possible cases where we remove the max or min.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove the max, the new max is the second max. Similarly, when you remove the min, the new min is the second min. But what about when you remove some element that's neither the current max nor min? Then the new max and min remain the same, so the instability remains as the original max - min.\n\nSo, in that case, the only way to reduce the instability is to remove either the max or the min, because otherwise, the instability doesn't change. Therefore, the minimal instability after removal must be either the original instability minus (max - second_max) or (second_min - min), whichever is applicable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's see. Suppose the array has elements like [1,3,7]. The initial instability is 6. If I remove 7, the new instability is 3-1=2. If I remove 1, the new instability is 7-3=4. If I remove 3, the instability remains 6. So the minimal is 2.\n\nIn this case, the minimal comes from removing the max.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100000]. Removing either gives 0, which is better than the original 99999.\n\nAnother test case: [1,3,3,7]. Original instability is 6. Remove 7, get 3-1=2. Which is the minimal.\n\nSo the key insight here is that the minimal instability after removal is either:\n\n- (max - second_max)\nOR\n- (second_min - min)\nOR\nthe original instability minus something else, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal is the minimal between (max - second_max) and (second_min - min), whichever is smaller. Because if you remove the max, the new instability is max - second_max. If you remove the min, the new is second_min - min. So the minimal would be the smaller of these two.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple elements equal to max or min?\n\nFor example, array [5,5,5,5]. If I remove one, the array remains with all 5s. So the instability is 0. So in this case, removing any element gives the same result.\n\nAnother example: [2, 2, 3]. Max is 3, min is 2. If we remove 3, the new array is [2,2], so instability 0. If we remove 2, the array is [2,3], instability 1. So in this case, removing the max gives a better result.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the current max and min of the array.\n2. Find the second max and second min.\n3. Compute the potential instability if we remove the max: it's (second_max - min).\n4. Compute the potential instability if we remove the min: it's (max - second_min).\n5. Also, the original instability is (max - min). So the minimal instability is the minimum between the original, the first option, and the second option.\n\nWait, no. Because if you remove an element that's neither max nor min, the instability remains the same as the original. So among all possible removals, the minimal instability is the minimal between the options when removing the max and when removing the min, and the original instability is only better if either of those options is smaller than the original.\n\nWait, no. Because the original instability is (max - min). If I remove an element that's not max or min, the new instability is still (max - min), because the max and min haven't changed. So the minimal possible instability after removal is the minimum of (max - second_max) and (second_min - min), but also, we can have the original instability if neither of those options is better. Wait, no. Because removing an element that's not max or min doesn't help; the instability remains the same.\n\nSo the minimal possible instability after removal is the minimum between:\n\na) (max - second_max)\nb) (second_min - min)\nc) the original (max - min) is only relevant if neither a nor b is smaller than it.\n\nWait, no. Because when you can remove an element that is not max or min, the instability remains the same as the original. So the minimal instability is the minimum between the original and the options a and b.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove an element that's not max or min, the instability remains as the original. So the minimal possible instability after all possible removals is the minimum between the original instability, a, and b.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the original instability is 6. The options a and b are 2 and 4 respectively. So the minimal is 2, which is less than the original. So in that case, the minimal is achieved by removing the max.\n\nIn the second example, the original is 99999. Options a is (100000 - 100000 = 0?), wait no. Let me see: the array is [1, 100000]. Max is 100000, min is 1. Second max is 1, second min is 100000.\n\nWait, no. For the array [1, 100000], when we remove the max (100000), the new array is [1], so the instability is 0. Similarly, removing the min (1) leaves [100000], instability 0.\n\nSo, in this case, the options a and b are both 0. So the minimal is 0.\n\nWait, but what about the original array [5,5,5,5]. The original instability is 0. So if we remove any element, the new array is [5,5,5], which has instability 0. So the minimal is 0.\n\nHmm, so the algorithm should be:\n\n- Find the current max and min of the array.\n\n- Find the second max and second min.\n\n- Compute the candidate instabilities when removing the max: (current max - second max).\n\n- Compute the candidate when removing the min: (current min - second min).\n\n- Then, the minimal instability is the minimum between these two candidates and the original (max - min).\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove the max, the new max is the second max. The min remains the same. So the new instability is (second_max - min). Similarly, removing the min, the new min is the second min, and the max remains the same. So the new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nBut if you remove an element that's not the max or min, the new array's max and min remain the same. So the instability is the same as the original.\n\nThus, the possible instabilities after removal are:\n\n- (second_max - min) if you remove the max.\n\n- (max - second_min) if you remove the min.\n\n- (original) if you remove any other element.\n\nSo the minimal is the minimum among these three.\n\nWait, but wait. What if there are multiple maxima or minima? Like, suppose the array has several elements equal to the max.\n\nIn that case, the second max could be same as the first max. For example, array [7,7,3]. The max is 7, and second max is 7. So when you remove one of the max elements, the new max is still 7, and min is 3. So the instability remains 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the min, if multiple min elements exist, the second min is same as the first.\n\nSo, how do we handle that?\n\nI think the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global maximum (max_a) and the count of how many times it appears in the array.\n\n2. Similarly, find the global minimum (min_a) and its count.\n\n3. Then, find the second maximum (second_max) and the second minimum (second_min).\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to sort the array, and then find the first and second max and min.\n\nWait, but for large n (1e5), sorting is manageable.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's better to find the max and min in O(n) time, and then find the second max and second min in O(n) time as well.\n\nBecause if we sort the array, finding the second max is easy, but for 1e5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- The max is the last element.\n\n- The second max is the element before last, unless the last element occurs multiple times.\n\nWait, no. For example, in [3,3,7], the sorted array is [3,3,7]. The max is 7, second max is 3.\n\nWait, but in [7,7,7], the second max is 7.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- The second_max is the largest element less than max_a.\n\nIf all elements are the same, then second_max is same as max_a.\n\nSimilarly for the second min.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. max_a = a[-1], min_a = a[0].\n\n3. To find second_max, find the largest element that is less than max_a.\n\n   - Iterate from the end until a[i] < max_a. The last such a[i] is the second_max.\n\n   - If all elements are max_a, then second_max is max_a.\n\n4. Similarly, to find second_min, find the smallest element greater than min_a.\n\n   - Iterate from the beginning until a[i] > min_a. The first such a[i] is the second_min.\n\n   - If all elements are min_a, then second_min is min_a.\n\nWait, but wait. In the case where all elements are the same, the second_max is same as max_a. So, when we remove one element, the instability remains zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can proceed as follows.\n\nSort the array.\n\nmax_a = a[-1]\n\nmin_a = a[0]\n\ncount_max = number of elements equal to max_a.\n\ncount_min = number of elements equal to min_a.\n\nNow, for the second_max:\n\nif count_max >= 2:\n\n   second_max = max_a\n\nelse:\n\n   iterate from end-1 to find the first element less than max_a.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps it's easier to loop through the array once to find these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the sorted array, the second_max is the last element that is less than the max.\n\nSo, for the sorted array, we can loop from the end and find the first element that is less than max_a.\n\nIf none found, then second_max is max_a.\n\nSimilarly for second_min: loop from the start to find the first element larger than min_a.\n\nIf none found, second_min is min_a.\n\nOnce we have these, compute the possible instabilities:\n\ncandidate1 = second_max - min_a --> this is the case when we remove the max.\n\ncandidate2 = max_a - second_min --> case when we remove the min.\n\ncandidate3 = max_a - min_a --> when we remove any other element.\n\nThe minimal instability is the minimum of candidate1, candidate2, candidate3.\n\nWait, but candidate3 is the same as the original instability. So yes.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you remove a non-max and non-min element, the new instability is the same as the original. So among all possible removals, the minimal is the minimum of (candidate1, candidate2, and the original).\n\nSo, the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2, original).\n\nWait, but let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 1,3,3,7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\nmax_a=7, min_a=1.\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 3, so 3-1=2.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is 3, so 7-3=4.\n\ncandidate3: 7-1=6.\n\nmin(2,4,6) is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput: 1, 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]\n\nmax_a=100000, min_a=1.\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 1, so 1-1=0.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is 100000, so 100000 - 100000=0.\n\ncandidate3: 100000-1=99999.\n\nSo min is 0 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5]. Sorted [5,5,5,5].\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 5. 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is 5. 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate3: 5-5=0.\n\nso min is 0.\n\nAnother test case: [2,2,3]. Sorted [2,2,3].\n\nmax_a=3, min_a=2.\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 2 → 2-2=0.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is 2 → 3-2=1.\n\ncandidate3: 3-2=1.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [4,5,6,7]. Sorted.\n\nmax_a=7, min_a=4.\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 6 → 6-4=2.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is5 →7-5=2.\n\ncandidate3:7-4=3.\n\nmin is 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nSo in this case, removing either 7 or 4 would give the same result.\n\nSo, according to this logic, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the plan for the code:\n\nRead n, then the array.\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute max_a = a[-1], min_a = a[0].\n\nCompute candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nTo compute candidate1:\n\nif all elements are max_a, then candidate1 is 0.\n\nElse, find the largest element less than max_a.\n\nSimilarly, for candidate2:\n\nif all elements are min_a, then candidate2 is 0.\n\nElse, find the smallest element larger than min_a.\n\nThen, compute the minimal between candidate1, candidate2, and (max_a - min_a).\n\nWait, no. Because candidate1 is the case when we remove the max, which may not be present in the array. Wait, no, because the array contains at least one max and one min.\n\nWait, but in the array, at least one occurrence of max and min exists.\n\nSo, for candidate1:\n\nif the array has only one occurrence of max_a, then removing it would make the new max the second_max.\n\nElse, the new max is still max_a.\n\nSo, in code, we can check if the last element is unique.\n\nWait, perhaps in code, it's better to find the second_max as follows.\n\nIn the sorted array:\n\nstart from the end, and move backward until you find an element less than max_a.\n\nIf you find any, that's the second_max.\n\nOtherwise, second_max is max_a.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(array)\n\nmax_a = sorted_a[-1]\n\nmin_a = sorted_a[0]\n\n# Find second_max\n\nsecond_max = max_a\n\ni = len(sorted_a) - 1\n\nwhile i >=0 and sorted_a[i] == max_a:\n\n    i -=1\n\nif i >=0:\n\n    second_max = sorted_a[i]\n\nelse:\n\n    # all elements are max_a, so second_max is max_a\n\n    pass\n\nWait, but in the case where all elements are max_a, then second_max is same as max_a.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nWait, but for candidate1, when you remove the max, the new max is second_max.\n\nSo, if all elements are max_a, then after removing one, the new max is still max_a.\n\nSo the candidate1 is (max_a - min_a) if all are same.\n\nWait, but in that case, candidate1 is same as the original.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute candidate1:\n\nif second_max is less than max_a:\n\n    candidate1 = second_max - min_a\n\nelse:\n\n    candidate1 = max_a - min_a\n\nWait, but that's not accurate.\n\nNo, because if all elements are max_a, then second_max is max_a.\n\nSo, when you remove one, the new max is still max_a.\n\nSo, the new instability is (max_a - min_a), which is same as the original.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif second_max < max_a:\n\n    candidate1 = second_max - min_a\n\nelse:\n\n    candidate1 = (max_a - min_a)\n\nSimilarly for candidate2.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to compute the second_max correctly, regardless of whether it's less than or equal to max_a.\n\nSo, after finding the second_max, compute candidate1 as (second_max - min_a).\n\nSimilarly, candidate2 is (max_a - second_min).\n\nThen, compute the minimal between candidate1, candidate2, and (max_a - min_a).\n\nBecause, when you remove a non-max and non-min element, the instability remains the same.\n\nSo, the minimal is the minimal of candidate1, candidate2, and original.\n\nWait, but in some cases, candidate1 or candidate2 could be higher than the original, but removing a non-related element leaves the instability as original.\n\nSo, the minimal is the minimum between the three.\n\nSo, in code:\n\noriginal = max_a - min_a\n\ncandidate1 = second_max - min_a\n\ncandidate2 = max_a - second_min\n\nresult = min(original, candidate1, candidate2)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for the second_max, if all elements are same, then second_max is same as max_a.\n\nSo, in that case, candidate1 is (max_a - min_a), same as original.\n\nSo, in code, the process is:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_a = sorted_a[-1]\n\nmin_a = sorted_a[0]\n\n# Find second_max:\n\ni = len(sorted_a)-1\n\nwhile i >=0 and sorted_a[i] == max_a:\n\n    i -=1\n\nif i >=0:\n\n    second_max = sorted_a[i]\n\nelse:\n\n    second_max = max_a\n\n# Similarly for second_min:\n\nj = 0\n\nwhile j < len(sorted_a) and sorted_a[j] == min_a:\n\n    j +=1\n\nif j < len(sorted_a):\n\n    second_min = sorted_a[j]\n\nelse:\n\n    second_min = min_a\n\ncandidate1 = second_max - min_a\n\ncandidate2 = max_a - second_min\n\noriginal = max_a - min_a\n\nresult = min(original, candidate1, candidate2)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where all elements are same, both candidate1 and candidate2 will be same as original, so the result is original, which is zero.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\nsorted_a = [1,3,3,7]\n\nmax_a=7, min_a=1.\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\ncandidate1= 3-1=2.\n\nsecond_min is 3.\n\ncandidate2=7-3=4.\n\noriginal=6.\n\nmin(6,2,4)=2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSecond example:\n\nsorted_a = [1, 100000]\n\nmax_a=100000, min_a=1.\n\nsecond_max is 1.\n\ncandidate1=1-1=0.\n\nsecond_min is 100000.\n\ncandidate2=100000-100000=0.\n\noriginal=99999.\n\nmin(99999,0,0)=0.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5]\n\nsorted_a = [5,5,5,5].\n\nmax_a=5, min_a=5.\n\nsecond_max is 5.\n\ncandidate1=5-5=0.\n\nsecond_min is5.\n\ncandidate2=5-5=0.\n\noriginal=0.\n\nmin(0,0,0)=0.\n\nAnother test case: [2,2,3]\n\nsorted_a = [2,2,3].\n\nmax_a=3, min_a=2.\n\nsecond_max is 2.\n\ncandidate1=2-2=0.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\ncandidate2=3-2=1.\n\noriginal=3-2=1.\n\nmin(1,0,1)=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [4,5,6,7].\n\nsorted_a = [4,5,6,7].\n\nmax_a=7, min_a=4.\n\nsecond_max is 6.\n\ncandidate1=6-4=2.\n\nsecond_min is5.\n\ncandidate2=7-5=2.\n\noriginal=7-4=3.\n\nmin(3,2,2)=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where n=2: [x, y], x <= y.\n\nAfter removing one, the array has one element. So the instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 2, 3,4,5]. After removing 5, the instability is 4-1=3. After removing 1, instability is 5-2=3. But the original is 4. So the minimal is 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code's candidates would be:\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 4. 4-1=3.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is2. 5-2=3.\n\noriginal is 4.\n\nso min is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]. After removing 5, the max is4, min is1. Instability 3.\n\nAfter removing 1, the min is 2, max is5. Instability 3.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nThe code would compute:\n\ncandidate1: second_max is4. 4-1=3.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is2. 5-2=3.\n\noriginal is4.\n\nso min is3.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSo, I think this approach is solid.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for handling the second_max and second_min, perhaps it's better to loop through the array.\n\nWait, but the sorted array is already in order, so the code above should work.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the array is size 2. For example, [5,5]. After removing one, the array is [5], so instability is 0.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\ncandidate1: second_max is5. 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate2: second_min is5. 5-5=0.\n\noriginal is0.\n\nso the min is0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Sorted.\n\nmax is14, min is5.\n\ncandidate1:13-5=8.\n\ncandidate2:14-6=8.\n\noriginal is9.\n\nso min is8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nRead n, then the list.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as a string, e.g., '4\\n1 3 3 7'.\n\nSo, in Python, read the input lines.\n\nn = int(input().strip())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nthen, proceed.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the user wrote:\n\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\nWhich is perhaps a representation of the input, but in reality, the code should read two lines: first line is n, second line is the array.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nProceed.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na_sorted = sorted(a)\nmax_a = a_sorted[-1]\nmin_a = a_sorted[0]\n\n# Find second_max\ni = len(a_sorted) - 1\nwhile i >= 0 and a_sorted[i] == max_a:\n    i -= 1\nif i >= 0:\n    second_max = a_sorted[i]\nelse:\n    second_max = max_a\n\n# Find second_min\nj = 0\nwhile j < len(a_sorted) and a_sorted[j] == min_a:\n    j += 1\nif j < len(a_sorted):\n    second_min = a_sorted[j]\nelse:\n    second_min = min_a\n\ncandidate1 = second_max - min_a\ncandidate2 = max_a - second_min\noriginal = max_a - min_a\n\nresult = min(original, candidate1, candidate2)\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where the array has only two elements, say [1, 2], sorted as [1,2].\n\nmax_a is 2, min_a is1.\n\nsecond_max is1.\n\ncandidate1:1-1=0.\n\nsecond_min is2.\n\ncandidate2:2-2=0.\n\noriginal is1.\n\nso min is0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes, because after removing one element, the array has one element, so the instability is 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5,5]. All same.\n\ncandidate1:5-5=0.\n\ncandidate2:5-5=0.\n\noriginal:0.\n\nso min is0.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3,4,5,5].\n\nmax is5, min is1.\n\nsecond_max is5.\n\ncandidate1:5-1=4.\n\ncandidate2:5-2=3.\n\noriginal is4.\n\nso min is3.\n\nWhich is correct because if you remove a 5, the new array has max 5, min 1. So instability 4.\n\nWait, no, wait. If I remove a 5, the new array is [1,2,3,4,5]. Max is5, min is1. So instability is4.\n\nBut according to the code, candidate1 is5-1=4, candidate2 is5-2=3.\n\nWait, why is candidate2 3?\n\nAh, because the second_min is2.\n\nSo, if I remove the min (1), then the new min is2.\n\nSo, the new instability is5-2=3.\n\nSo, the minimal is3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly finds that.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps efficiently find the maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum values.\n2. **Identify Key Values**: Determine the maximum (max_a) and minimum (min_a) values of the sorted array.\n3. **Find Second Max and Min**: Identify the second largest value (second_max) and the second smallest value (second_min) by iterating through the sorted array.\n4. **Calculate Candidates**: Compute three potential instabilities:\n   - The original instability (max_a - min_a).\n   - Instability if the max element is removed (second_max - min_a).\n   - Instability if the min element is removed (max_a - second_min).\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The result is the minimum value among the three calculated instabilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na_sorted = sorted(a)\nmax_a = a_sorted[-1]\nmin_a = a_sorted[0]\n\n# Find second_max\ni = len(a_sorted) - 1\nwhile i >= 0 and a_sorted[i] == max_a:\n    i -= 1\nif i >= 0:\n    second_max = a_sorted[i]\nelse:\n    second_max = max_a\n\n# Find second_min\nj = 0\nwhile j < len(a_sorted) and a_sorted[j] == min_a:\n    j += 1\nif j < len(a_sorted):\n    second_min = a_sorted[j]\nelse:\n    second_min = min_a\n\ncandidate1 = second_max - min_a\ncandidate2 = max_a - second_min\noriginal = max_a - min_a\n\nresult = min(original, candidate1, candidate2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the maximum and minimum values and their subsequent values.\n2. **Finding Second Max and Min**: By iterating from the end and start of the sorted array, respectively, we efficiently find the second highest and lowest values.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: We compute the potential instabilities for removing either the max or min element and compare them with the original instability to determine the minimum possible instability after removal.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the problem within the constraints, providing an optimal solution.",
