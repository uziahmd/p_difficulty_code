Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) in Crazy Town. The town has n infinite line roads, and these roads divide the plane into blocks. My home and university are each in a block, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from my home's block to the university's block. Each step allows moving between two adjacent blocks that share a border with a non-zero length.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, the key is probably to determine which side of each road each point lies on. Because each road divides the plane into two parts, so each road can act as a kind of boundary between blocks.\n\nWait, right. For each road, if I compute the sign of the expression a*x + b*y + c for a point, it tells me which side of the road the point is on. So for each road, home and university will be on either side or the same side.\n\nIf two points are on the same side of a road, then that road doesn't separate them. So the number of roads that separate the two points is important.\n\nBecause each such separating road contributes to the minimal steps needed. Because each step can cross one road, so the minimal steps required would be equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nOh right! So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines (roads) where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each road, compute the value (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c).\n2. If these two values have opposite signs, count that road.\n3. The total count is the answer.\n\nBecause each such road requires crossing, and each step can only cross one road. So the minimal steps are exactly the number of such roads.\n\nThat makes sense because each road that separates the two points must be crossed, and each crossing can be done in one step. So the order doesn't matter; just count how many roads are separating them.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\n- Read home and university coordinates.\n- Read n, then for each of the n lines, read a, b, c.\n- For each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (s1 * s2 < 0), increment the count.\n- Finally, output the count as the answer.\n\nWait, but what if s1 or s2 is zero? Oh, the problem statement says neither home nor university lie on any road. So s1 and s2 cannot be zero for any road. So no division by zero or edge cases there.\n\nSo now, let's think about the example.\n\nIn the sample input, home is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are two roads.\n\nFirst road: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. Home is at y=1 (positive), university at y=-1 (negative). So they are on opposite sides. So count increases by 1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y -3=0 → x=3. Home is at x=1 (less than 3, so 1*1 + 0*1 -3 = -2 <0). Wait, wait, let me re-calculate:\n\nFor the second line: a=1, b=0, c=-3. So s1 = 1*1 + 0*1 -3 = -2. s2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) -3 = -4. Both negative, same sign. So no contribution.\n\nWait wait, but in the sample output, both answers are 2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\nWait looking back, the first sample input is:\n\nHome: 1 1\n\nUniversity: -1 -1\n\nn=2.\n\nRoads are:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → x=0?\n\nWait wait, no, the equation is aix + biy + ci =0. So for the first road, 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0. So home is on one side, university is 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1<0. So they are on opposite sides. So that's 1.\n\nThe second road: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. Home is at x=1 (so positive), university is at x=-1 (negative). So s1=1*1+0*1+0=1>0, s2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1<0. So again",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between two adjacent blocks that share a border with a non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road (line) divides the plane into two halves. By determining which half of each road your home and university lie on, we can count how many roads separate them. Each such separating road will require one step to cross, as you can only move between blocks sharing a border in one step.\n\n1. **Compute Sign Values**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the sign of the expression \\(ax_1 + by_1 + c\\) for your home coordinates \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and the sign of \\(ax_2 + by_2 + c\\) for your university coordinates \\((x_2, y_2)\\).\n2. **Count Separating Roads**: If the signs of these expressions are opposite, it means your home and university are on opposite sides of that road, and thus, you need to cross this road.\n3. **Result**: The total number of such roads where the signs differ gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n\n    x1 = int(input[idx])\n    y1 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n\n    x2 = int(input[idx])\n    y2 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the home and university coordinates, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Sign Calculation**: For each road, the signs of the expressions evaluated at the home and university coordinates are computed.\n- **Opposite Signs Check**: If the signs are opposite, it indicates that the road separates the home and university, thus incrementing the step count.\n- **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimum steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric property of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution.",
