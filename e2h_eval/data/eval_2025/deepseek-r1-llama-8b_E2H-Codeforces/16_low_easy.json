Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about navigating through regions (blocks) formed by roads in Crazy Town. The roads are infinite lines, and they divide the plane into blocks. My home and university are each in a block, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from my home's block to the university's block. Each step allows moving between two adjacent blocks that share a border with a non-zero length.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, thinking about it, each road can act as a boundary that separates regions. So, for each road, the home and university might be on opposite sides or the same side. If they're on opposite sides, then crossing that road would change their relative positions.\n\nWait, maybe the key here is to find how many roads separate the home and university. Because each such road would require a step to cross. Because when you cross a road, you move from one block to another. But wait, if two roads intersect, does that affect the count?\n\nLet me think differently. Each road is a line. For each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides. The number of roads where they are on different sides will give the minimal number of steps needed. Because each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n\nBecause each time you cross a road, you switch blocks. So if there are k roads that separate home and university, then the minimal steps are k.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each road (line), check if home and university lie on opposite sides.\n2. Count the total number of such roads.\n3. That count is the answer.\n\nBut wait, why is that correct? Because each such road contributes to the separation. So, the minimal path must cross each of these roads exactly once. Because without crossing them, you can't get from one side to the other.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the problem reduces to counting how many lines separate the two points.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n- For each of the n roads (each represented by a, b, c), compute whether (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are on opposite sides of the line ax + by + c = 0.\n- For each such road, if the product of the two evaluations (a*x + b*y + c for each point) is negative, then they are on opposite sides.\n- Sum all such cases. That sum is the minimal steps required.\n\nSo, the code should implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the computation. For each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 * s2 < 0, then count +=1.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- The home and university are already in the same block: then the count is zero, output 0.\n- All lines don't separate them: same as above.\n- Multiple lines separating them: count each.\n- Lines that are coinciding: but the input says no two roads are the same, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nAnother thing to note is that neither home nor university is on any road. So s1 and s2 are never zero. So, the condition is safe.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n.\n\nFor each of the next n lines:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\n   Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n   If s1*s2 <0 → increment count.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nWait, but what about the case where multiple roads cross each other? Like, suppose a road A separates home and uni, and road B also does. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you have to cross both roads.\n\nYes, because each road is a barrier that needs to be crossed.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 → line y = 0?\nWait, wait. Wait, the line is aix + biy + ci =0. So for 0 1 0: the equation is 0*x +1*y +0=0 → y=0.\n\nHome is (1,1): substituting into y=0: 1>0 → positive.\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1): substituting into y=0: -1<0 → negative.\n\nSo s1=1, s2=-1 → product is negative → count increases by 1.\n\nNext line",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between two adjacent blocks that share a border with a non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road (line) can act as a boundary separating regions. If your home and university are on opposite sides of a road, you must cross that road exactly once to move between their respective blocks. Thus, the problem reduces to counting how many such roads separate the home from the university.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Check Separation**: For each road, determine if the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the line equation at both points. If the product of these evaluations is negative, they are on opposite sides.\n3. **Count Crossings**: Sum the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Lines**: For each road, defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we compute the value of the equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Counting Steps**: Each road that separates the home from the university is counted once. The total count of such roads gives the minimum steps needed to move from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their ability to separate points in space.",
