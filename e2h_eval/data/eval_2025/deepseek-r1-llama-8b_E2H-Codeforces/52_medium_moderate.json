Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But he's smart because he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. The question is, how many hours can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, right. So initially, he has 'a' candles. They each burn for an hour, so that's 'a' hours. Then, he collects all the burnt ones. For every 'b' burnt candles, he can make a new one. So the process is: collect the burnt candles, exchange them for new ones, burn those, collect again, and repeat until he doesn't have enough to make a new one.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think through an example. Like the sample input where a is 4 and b is 2.\n\nFirst, he burns 4 candles, getting 4 hours. Now he has 4 burnt candles. He can exchange 4/2=2 new candles. He burns them, adding 2 more hours (total 6). Now he has 2 burnt candles again. Exchange them for 1 new candle (since 2 >= 2), burn it for 1 hour (total 7). Now he has 1 burnt candle, which is less than 2, so he can't make any more. So total is 7.\n\nSo the approach is: sum the initial a, then add the number of new candles made from the leftovers, then repeat this process until there aren't enough leftovers to make a new candle.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize total_hours = a\n2. leftover = a\n3. While leftover >= b:\n   a. new_candles = leftover // b\n   b. total_hours += new_candles\n   c. leftover = (leftover % b) + new_candles\n4. Return total_hours\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each time we get some new candles, which are burned, adding to the total, and also creating new leftovers.\n\nSo let's think about another example. Say a=6, b=3. Initial burn gives 6 hours, 6 burnt. 6//3=2 new candles. Burn them, 2 more hours (total 8). Now, 2 burnt. Not enough for 3, so done. So output is 8.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Initial 5, then 5/5=1, which adds 1, making 6. Then 1 left, can't make more. So total is 6.\n\nWait, no: after initial 5, leftover is 5. Make 1 new, burn it, now have 1 burnt. So yes.\n\nWhat about a=10, b=4. Initial 10, then 10//4=2, leftover is 2 (10%4=2) plus 2 new? No, wait. Wait, when you make 2 new candles, they burn, adding 2 hours, and leave 2 burnt. So the next step: 2+2=4, which is equal to b=4. So new_candles is 1. That adds 1 hour, total is 10+2+1=13. Now leftover is 1 (from the 4//4=1, which leaves 0, plus the 1 from previous step).\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nInitial a=10, total=10, leftover=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nleftover >= b (10 >=4): yes.\n\nnew_candles = 10//4=2. total becomes 12. leftover is 10%4=2 + 2 (from new candles) =4.\n\nNext iteration: 4 >=4: yes.\n\nnew_candles=1. total 13. leftover=0 +1=1.\n\nNow 1 <4, loop ends. So total is 13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, in code, how to implement this.\n\nWe need to read two integers a and b from input.\n\nCompute the total as per the steps above.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a, rem = a.\n\nwhile rem >= b:\n    new = rem // b\n    total += new\n    rem = (rem % b) + new\n\nThen print(total).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting this logic with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, rem=4.\n\nLoop: rem >=2.\n\nnew=2, total=6. rem=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop: rem>=2.\n\nnew=1, total=7. rem=0 +1=1. Loop exits. Correct.\n\nSample 2: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, rem=6.\n\nnew=2, total=8. rem=0+2=2. Loop ends. Correct.\n\nAnother test: a=5, b=5.\n\ntotal=5, rem=5.\n\nnew=1, total=6. rem=0 +1=1. Loop ends.\n\nAnother test: a=10, b=4.\n\nAs before, total is 13.\n\nAnother edge case: a=0. But according to constraints, a is at least 1.\n\nWait, what if b is 1? Then, after each step, rem will always be >=1, so the loop runs forever. Oh, but in the problem statement, b is between 2 and 1000, so we don't need to handle b=1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases within the constraints.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can reuse burnt candles to make new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for one hour, so the initial number of hours is `a`.\n2. **Recycling Burnt Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the burnt ones. For every `b` burnt candles, Vasily can create a new candle. This process continues until he doesn't have enough burnt candles left to make a new one.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Keep track of the total hours and the remaining burnt candles after each recycling step. Each time a new candle is made, add its burn time to the total hours and update the count of remaining burnt candles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nrem = a\n\nwhile rem >= b:\n    new = rem // b\n    total += new\n    rem = (rem % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the initial number of candles and the number of burnt candles needed to make a new one, respectively.\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Recycling Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are enough burnt candles (`rem`) to make a new one (`b`). In each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made, add their burn time to the total, and update the remaining burnt candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop exits when there are not enough burnt candles to make a new one, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively recycling burnt candles, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
