    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add k to both a and b. Wait, let's think about the expressions (a + k) and (b + k). Since they are being added by the same k, their difference remains the same as (b - a), but wait, no, because if a < b, then b +k - (a +k) = b -a. So the difference between them is fixed.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. The difference between a +k and b +k is the same as the original difference between a and b. Because (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the two numbers are always d apart, where d is |a - b|. Or wait, actually, if a > b, then the difference would be negative, but since we take absolute value, it's the same as |a - b|.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that y = x + d, and we want to minimize the LCM of x and y, where x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nWait, but since d is fixed, maybe I should compute d first. Let me set d = |a - b|. Because if a and b are equal, then any k will result in the same pair, so the LCM is just a +k. So in that case, the minimal LCM is achieved when a +k is as small as possible, which is when k=0. So output 0.\n\nBut when a != b, then d is not zero. So for the general case, we can assume that d is positive.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: find x and y such that y = x + d, and x and y are positive integers, and we want to minimize LCM(x, y). Among all possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy this, find the one with the smallest LCM, and then find the corresponding k.\n\nWait, but x and y must also be greater than zero. But since a and b are at least 1, adding k (non-negative) ensures that x and y are positive.\n\nSo how do I find x and y such that y = x + d, and LCM(x, y) is minimized?\n\nLet's think about the LCM of two numbers. The LCM of x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x, y). So to minimize this, perhaps we can maximize the GCD of x and y.\n\nBecause LCM(x,y) is minimized when the product is minimized or when the GCD is maximized. Since y = x + d, the product is x*(x+d) which depends on x, and the GCD depends on the factors of d and x.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal x is such that x and d have a large GCD. Because then, the GCD of x and y would also be large.\n\nSo let's denote g as the greatest common divisor of d and x. Then, x = g * m, and d = g * n, where m and n are coprime. Then, y = x + d = g*(m +n).\n\nThen, the GCD of x and y is g, since m and n are coprime. So the LCM is (x * y)/g = (g*m * g*(m +n)) / g = g^2 * m(m+n). \n\nWait, so the LCM is g squared multiplied by m times (m + n). Hmm.\n\nSince n is d/g, and m is x/g, which is x/(d's factor). So perhaps to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize g, because that would make the overall LCM smaller.\n\nSo the strategy is to find the maximum possible g, which divides both d and x, and then find the minimal possible LCM given that g.\n\nWait, but how? Because for each possible divisor g of d, we can try to find the minimal x that is a multiple of g, such that y = x + d is also a multiple of g. But since y = x +d, and d is a multiple of g, y will automatically be a multiple of g.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to iterate over all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, compute the minimal x such that x is a multiple of g and x >= something. Then compute the LCM for each case and choose the minimal one.\n\nWait, but how do I find the minimal x for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key observation is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) remains constant as \\( |a - b| \\). Let this difference be \\( d \\). Thus, we need to find two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that \\( y = x + d \\) and their LCM is minimized.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation Insight**: The LCM of two numbers can be expressed using their greatest common divisor (GCD). For \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( y = x + d \\), the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) will be a divisor of \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize the LCM, maximize the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This leads us to consider all divisors of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the minimal \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and then determine the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), calculate the minimal \\( x \\) and check if it results in a smaller LCM compared to previous candidates. Keep track of the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves this minimal LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    # Find all possible divisors of d\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # We want x = m * g, and since y = x + d, which is m*g + d\n        # But d is divisible by g, so let's write d = g * n\n        n = d // g\n        # To have x and y share the GCD g, x must be a multiple of g\n        # The minimal x is g, but we need to ensure that x + d is also a multiple of g\n        # Since d is a multiple of g, x can be any multiple of g\n        # Now, what is the minimal x such that x >= max(g, something?)\n        # Wait, no, x can be any multiple of g, but to minimize LCM, we might need to choose x as small as possible.\n        # So let's try x = g\n        x = g\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = g\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        current_k = x - a\n        if current_k < 0:\n            continue\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n    \n    # Also, check the case where k=0, which may not be covered in the loop above\n    if d != 0:\n        x = a\n        y = b\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        current_k = 0\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n3. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: Identify all divisors of \\( d \\) to consider potential values for the GCD.\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( x \\) and check the corresponding \\( k \\) to find the optimal solution.\n5. **Check Base Case**: Ensure the case where \\( k = 0 \\) is considered to handle cases where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential values of \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring an optimal solution is found.",
