    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We need to add k golden rings. Each ring is like a border around a rectangle that's getting smaller each time.\n\nHmm, let me think about how each ring is formed. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells in from there, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick. So for each i-th ring (starting from 1), it forms a border around a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, why 4? Because for each side, we subtract 2*(i-1) cells, right? Because each ring reduces both width and height by 2*(i-1) on each side.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. For each ring, the next inner rectangle is 2 cells smaller on each side. So for each ring, the width becomes w - 2*(i-1)*2, but wait, perhaps it's better to model it as for each ring, the new width is w minus 4*(i-1), because each side (left and right) loses 2*(i-1) cells. Similarly for height.\n\nSo for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). But this is only if such a rectangle exists. If not, we can't form that ring.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible rings. So we don't have to worry about invalid k values.\n\nNow, the question is, for each ring, how many cells are added? Each ring is a border, which is the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nSo for a rectangle of a x b cells, the number of cells in the border is 2*(a + b - 2). Because it's the top and bottom rows, each with b cells, and the left and right columns, each with (a-2) cells (since the corners are already counted in the top and bottom).\n\nSo for each ring, starting from i=1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle at that step and sum them all.\n\nLet's take the example given:\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\nThe rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So two rings.\n\nFirst ring: 7x9 → 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14=28.\nSecond ring: subtract 4*(2-1) = 4, so 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is clear: for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)) rectangle, and sum all perimeters.\n\nSo now, the steps to implement this:\n\n1. Read the input line as integers w, h, k.\n\n2. Initialize a total count to 0.\n\n3. Loop for i in 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   d. Add this to total.\n\n4. Output the total as an integer.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h becomes less than or equal to 2? Because then, the rectangle would have 2x something, but the perimeter calculation might be incorrect.\n\nWait, for example, if current_w is 3, current_h is 3, then the perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. But if current_w is 2, then the rectangle is 2x something. Wait, but according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that each ring is valid, so perhaps we don't have to handle cases where current_w or current_h drop below 3.\n\nBecause the initial w and h are >=3. For each i up to k, after subtracting 4*(i-1), as long as i is within the allowed k, current_w and current_h must be >=3.\n\nWait, let's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of golden rings. Each ring is formed by bordering the edges of increasingly smaller rectangles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle that reduces in size by 2 cells on each side for each subsequent ring. The i-th ring forms a border around a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each rectangle, the perimeter (number of cells) can be calculated using the formula 2 * (width + height - 2). This accounts for the top, bottom, left, and right borders.\n3. **Summing Up**: Sum the perimeters of all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the dimensions of the current rectangle.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula.\n4. **Accumulate Total**: Sum the perimeters of all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
