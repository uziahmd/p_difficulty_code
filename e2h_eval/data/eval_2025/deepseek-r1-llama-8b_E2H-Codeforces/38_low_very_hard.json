    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\nLet me first understand what a p-reachable directed graph is. So, a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v, u and v are reachable from each other. So, these pairs form an undirected edge between u and v in the underlying undirected graph. But since it's a directed graph, for each such pair, there must be two edges: one from u to v and one from v to u. Wait, no—wait, the definition says that (u, v) is a pair where u and v are reachable in both directions? Or wait, no. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that (u, v) is an ordered pair in the directed graph if u≠v, there exists a path from u to v, and there's no path from v to u. Oh right! So, (u, v) is unidirectional. So, for each such pair, it's a directed edge u→v, but no edge v→u.\n\nBut for a p-reachable graph, we're counting the number of such pairs where u < v. So, each such pair contributes 1 to p.\n\nWait, no. The problem defines a p-reachable graph as having exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and u and v are reachable from each other. So, that implies that for each such pair, u can reach v and v can reach u, meaning that their underlying undirected graph forms an edge. So, in terms of the directed graph, each such pair adds two edges: u→v and v→u.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the count of p? Because for each undirected edge, it contributes to the count of p by 1, because u < v. So, if there are k such undirected edges, the p would be equal to k. So, the p is the number of edges in the underlying undirected graph.\n\nWait, no. Because each undirected edge (u, v) where u < v counts as 1 towards p. So, yes, p is the number of edges in the underlying undirected graph.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a directed graph whose underlying undirected graph has exactly p edges, and which is constructed in such a way that each edge is present as both u→v and v→u. But wait, no. Because the underlying undirected graph can have multiple edges, but in our case, since we're considering reachability, perhaps the graph is strongly connected on those pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the underlying undirected graph is such that for each edge (u, v), u can reach v and v can reach u. So, the underlying graph is a collection of connected components where each component is a clique, perhaps? Or maybe not necessarily a clique, but each pair of nodes in the same component can reach each other.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal structure is a collection of trees. No, because trees don't have cycles, so you can't have all nodes reachable from each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal structure is a collection of cliques, but that might not always be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the problem as the underlying undirected graph being a certain structure.\n\nWait, the p is the number of edges in the underlying undirected graph. Because each edge (u, v) where u < v is counted once in p.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to creating a directed graph whose underlying undirected graph has p edges, and the rest of the edges (if any) are directed in such a way that they don't create any new unidirectional pairs beyond what's necessary.\n\nWait, no. Because the directed graph could have more edges than the underlying undirected graph, but for the p-reachability, it's the underlying undirected graph that matters.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Each undirected edge in the underlying graph contributes exactly 1 to p, regardless of the direction of the edges in the directed graph. So, the problem requires that the directed graph's underlying undirected graph has exactly p edges.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: find the smallest n such that the number of edges in the undirected graph is p. Then, construct a directed graph on n nodes where the underlying undirected graph has p edges, and find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such directed graphs that achieve this.\n\nWait, no. Because the underlying undirected graph may have p edges, but the directed graph may have more edges. However, the p is determined by the undirected edges. So, to get a p-reachable graph, the undirected part must have",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and both u and v can reach each other. This implies that the underlying undirected graph must have exactly `p` edges.\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The minimum number of nodes required is determined by constructing the smallest possible undirected graph with `p` edges. This is achieved using a structure known as a \"star\" graph, which consists of one central node connected to all other nodes. For `p` edges, this requires `p + 1` nodes.\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we should avoid having any bidirectional edges in the directed graph. This means that for every edge (u, v) in the underlying undirected graph, we direct it as u → v and ensure there's no path from v back to u. Thus, each edge contributes one unidirectional pair.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\np = int(input())\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    n = p + 1\n    max_uni = p\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Minimum Nodes Calculation**: The minimum number of nodes required to form a p-reachable graph is `p + 1`. This is because each edge in the undirected graph corresponds to an additional node beyond the first one.\n- **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: By ensuring that each edge in the underlying undirected graph is directed in only one way, we maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. Each of the `p` edges contributes exactly one unidirectional pair, leading to a total of `p` unidirectional pairs.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required values using simple arithmetic and logical reasoning, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `p`.",
