The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a certain way.\n\nHmm, the condition for unlocking is that a_i + b_j is odd. So, that means one of them must be even and the other odd. Because an even plus odd is odd, right?\n\nSo, how can we model this? I think we need to find pairs where a_i is even and b_j is odd, or a_i is odd and b_j is even. But each key can be used only once, and each chest as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is to maximize the number of chests opened. So, perhaps the approach is to count how many even and odd a's there are, and similarly for the b's, then find the maximum possible matching between them based on parity.\n\nLet me think: For each chest, if it's even (a_i even), we need an odd key. If it's odd, we need an even key.\n\nSo, let's separate the a's into two groups: even_a and odd_a counts. Similarly, separate the b's into even_b and odd_b counts.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum of:\n\n- the number of even_a chests multiplied by the number of odd_b keys, but considering that each key can be used once. So, actually, the minimum between the number of even_a and the number of odd_b. Because each even_a needs an odd_b, but we can't use more than the available keys.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can unlock at most one chest. So, for example, if I have 3 even_a chests and 5 odd_b keys, I can open 3 chests using those. But if I have 5 even_a and 2 odd_b, then I can open 2 chests.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd_a chests, they need even_b keys. So, the total is the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) and min(odd_a, even_b). But wait, that's not correct because we have to choose which chests to use. So maybe the optimal way is to take the maximum possible from either option.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when you have both options, it's possible that taking from both could give a higher total.\n\nFor example, suppose even_a = 3, odd_a = 2, odd_b=4, even_b=4.\n\nThen, even_a can take min(3,4)=3, and odd_a can take min(2,4)=2. Total 5.\n\nBut what if another scenario: even_a=2, odd_a=3, odd_b=3, even_b=3.\n\nThen, even_a uses min(2,3)=2, odd_a uses min(3,3)=3. Total 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even_a uses 2, and then odd_a uses 3, which is possible.\n\nYes, because the even_b can cover both the even_a and the odd_a.\n\nWait, no. Because the even_b is used for the odd_a chests. So, the even_b is used up by the odd_a chests, and the odd_b is used up by the even_a.\n\nSo, the total is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b). But wait, because the even_b is being used for the odd_a chests, but the even_a and odd_b may not interfere with each other.\n\nWait, no, because each key is used for exactly one chest. So, the total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the number of even_a that can be matched with odd_b, plus the number of odd_a that can be matched with even_b.\n\nBut we can't have overlapping usage of keys. Because the keys are a limited resource.\n\nWait, no. Because each key is used once. So, for the even_a chests, each requires an odd_b key. So, the number of even_a chests that can be opened is the minimum of even_a and the number of odd_b keys.\n\nOnce those are used, the remaining even_b keys (if any) can be used for the odd_a chests.\n\nWait, but the even_b keys are used for the odd_a chests. So, the number of odd_a chests that can be opened is the minimum of odd_a and the number of even_b keys.\n\nSo, the total is (min(even_a, odd_b)) + (min(odd_a, even_b - (even_a - min(even_a, odd_b))) ? Wait, no, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Count the number of even_a (Ea) and odd_a (Oa).\n\n2. Count",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. The key insight is that each chest can be opened using a key if their numbers have opposite parity (one even, one odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even and odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys have even and odd numbers.\n2. **Match Even and Odd**: Use even-numbered keys to open odd-numbered chests and odd-numbered keys to open even-numbered chests. The goal is to maximize the number of such matches.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Matches**: Compute the maximum possible matches by considering the minimum of the counts of available keys and chests for each parity combination.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible chests that can be opened\nmax_chests = 0\n# Use as many even_a with odd_b as possible\nuse_even_a = min(even_a, odd_b)\nmax_chests += use_even_a\n# Now, use even_b for odd_a\nuse_odd_a = min(odd_a, even_b - (even_a - use_even_a))\nmax_chests += use_odd_a\n\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Counting Parities**: We first count how many chests have even and odd numbers. This helps us determine which keys can potentially unlock them.\n2. **Matching Strategy**: By using even-numbered keys to unlock odd-numbered chests and odd-numbered keys to unlock even-numbered chests, we can maximize the number of chests opened.\n3. **Efficient Matching**: We calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering the minimum of available keys and chests for each parity combination, ensuring we use each key and chest at most once.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests Neko can open by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring an optimal solution within the problem constraints.",
