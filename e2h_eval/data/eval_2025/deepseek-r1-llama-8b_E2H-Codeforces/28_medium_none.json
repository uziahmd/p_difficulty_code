String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where Vasily the Bear wants to count beautiful strings. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is a binary string consisting of exactly n zeros and m ones. But wait, that's just the initial condition. The real twist is the modification operations. Oh right, and the goal is to find how many such beautiful strings can be transformed into a string that ends with character g (either 0 or 1) after some number of modifications.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: we can obtain g from s with some modifications. So s must be modifiable to have its last character as g, but through a series of operations. And each operation allows us to replace the last two characters with one character. Hmm, how does this affect the overall string?\n\nLet me think about what each modification does. For example, if the last two are \"00\", they become \"0\". If they're \"11\", they become \"1\". If it's \"01\" or \"10\", they become \"0\"? Or wait, no, the problem says: if replacing two zeros, it becomes one zero. Otherwise, it becomes zero. Wait, the description says: \"this character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So for any other pair, including 01 or 10, you replace them with a single 0.\n\nSo each operation reduces the length by 1, because two characters are replaced by one. So each modification reduces the length by one. But the string can't be modified if its length is less than two.\n\nNow, the question is: given that the original string has exactly n zeros and m ones, what is the number of such strings that can be modified into a string which ends with g. Or more precisely, after some modifications, the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nWait, but the process of modifying affects the entire string. So perhaps the key is to model how the modifications affect the possible end states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible endings based on the initial counts of zeros and ones. Because each modification can change the ending in specific ways.\n\nWait, let's consider that the initial string has a certain number of zeros and ones. Each modification reduces the total length by one, because two characters are replaced by one. So the number of modifications possible is k = (original_length - target_length). But the target_length must be at least 1, since you can't modify a string of length less than two.\n\nWait, but the target string could be any length less than the initial, as long as after k modifications, the resulting string ends with g.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the parity and the total number of zeros and ones.\n\nWait, let's think about the final state. After some number of modifications, the string ends with g. So the last character is either 0 or 1, depending on g.\n\nBut each modification changes the last two characters into one. So the process of modifying can only reduce the string, but the way it affects the counts of zeros and ones is non-trivial.\n\nLet me try to model the possible transformations.\n\nEach modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with one. So for example, if the last two are \"00\", they become \"0\". If they're \"01\", they become \"0\". If they're \"10\", same as \"01\".\n\nSo each modification effectively reduces the number of ones by one if the last two were both ones. Otherwise, the number of zeros may decrease, but I'm not sure. Wait, no: when you replace two zeros with a zero, the count remains the same. When you replace two ones with a one, the count also remains the same. But if you replace a zero and a one with a zero, then the number of ones decreases by one.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nCase 1: Last two are '00' → replaced by '0'. So the number of zeros remains the same (2 →1), and ones stay the same.\nCase 2: Last two are '01' → replaced by '0'. So zeros remain same (1→1), but ones decrease by one (1→0).\nSimilarly, '10' → replaced by '0', same as above.\nCase 3: Last two are '11' → replaced by '1'. So ones decrease by one (2→1), zeros same.\n\nSo each modification can affect the count of zeros and ones:\n\n- If the last two are both 1s: ones decrease by 1.\n- Else, ones can decrease by 1 (if there was a 0 and a 1 in the last two) or remain the same (if the last two were both 0s).\n\nWait, but in the case where the last two are both 0s, the count of zeros decreases by one (since two become one). So the total number of zeros is reduced by one.\n\nIn all other cases, if the last two are not both 1s, the number of ones is reduced by one.\n\nSo the key is that each modification can either decrease the number of zeros by one (if the last two were 0s) or decrease the number of ones by one (in all other cases).\n\nBut how does this affect the possibility of reaching a string ending with g?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as follows: the final string must end with g, which can be 0 or 1. So, regardless of the number of modifications, the last character must be g.\n\nBut to reach this state, the sequence of modifications must allow the last character to be g.\n\nWait, but each modification reduces the length by 1. So the initial length is L = n + m. The final length is L - k, where k is the number of modifications.\n\nWait, but the final length must be at least 1, since you can't perform a modification on a string of length less than 2.\n\nSo for the final string to end with g, the last character is determined by whether the sum of modifications leaves an odd or even number of steps, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of times the last two characters were not both 1s will determine whether the final character is 0 or 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem in terms of the possible transitions.\n\nLet me consider that each modification can be represented as changing the last two bits into one bit according to the rules. So the last bit after each modification depends on the previous two bits.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead, I can model the problem based on the counts of 0s and 1s and the possible ways to reach the desired end.\n\nWait, another approach: think about the final string. It must consist of some number of 0s and 1s, and the last character is g.\n\nBut how do the initial counts of 0s and 1s relate to the final counts?\n\nWait, each modification can either decrease the number of 0s by 1 (if the last two were 00) or decrease the number of 1s by 1 (if the last two were 01, 10, or 11 except when they were 00).\n\nSo, for example, if the initial string has Z zeros and O ones, and we perform k modifications, the final Z' and O' can vary based on the choices made during each modification.\n\nBut the final string must have last character g. So perhaps we can model the possible Z' and O' that can result in a string ending with g, given the initial Z and O.\n\nWait, but the final string's length is L - k, where L is n + m.\n\nAnd the final string's last character is g.\n\nSo, the final string must have a certain number of 0s and 1s, and end with g.\n\nBut the question is, given the initial n and m, how many initial beautiful strings can be modified into a string that ends with g.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Determine for each possible k (number of modifications), whether it's possible to reach a string ending with g.\n\n2. For each possible k, calculate the number of initial strings that can be transformed into a string ending with g after exactly k modifications.\n\nThen, sum over all valid k.\n\nBut the number of possible k could be up to (n + m) - 1, which is manageable since n and m are up to 105 each.\n\nWait, but n + m can be up to 210, so k can be up to 209.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible k (from 0 to L-1, where L = n + m), compute whether it's possible to have a string after k modifications that ends with g, and compute the number of initial strings that can reach such a state.\n\nBut how to compute for each k the number of initial strings that can reach a string ending with g after exactly k modifications.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the possible transitions.\n\nLet me think about the state as (a, b, last_char), where a is the current number of 0s, b the number of 1s, and last_char is the last character of the current string.\n\nWait, but for each step, the last two characters determine what happens next.\n\nBut keeping track of the last character might not be enough, because the second last character could influence the next step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the state as (a, b, last_char, second_last_char), but that could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the parity of the number of modifications that change the last character.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the final character. Since each modification replaces two characters with one, the final character's value depends on the initial string's structure.\n\nWait, for example, if the initial string has an even length, then perhaps it's possible to reach a certain parity of the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see whether the initial counts of 0s and 1s satisfy certain conditions relative to the desired g.\n\nLet me think about the case where the final character is g.\n\nSuppose the final string ends with 0. Then, in the last step of the modification process, the last two characters were replaced by 0.\n\nSo, before that modification, the last two characters could have been:\n\n- 00 → replaced by 0. So the count of 0s decreased by 1 (since two 0s became one).\n- 01 or 10 → replaced by 0. So the count of 1s decreased by 1 (since one 1 turned into 0).\n- 11 → replaced by 1, which would not result in the final character being 0. So in that case, the last step couldn't have resulted in 0.\n\nSo for the final character to be 0, the last step must have been a replacement where the last two were not both 1s.\n\nWait, but the step before that could have been anything.\n\nThis seems like it's getting complicated. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAnother idea: the number of 0s and 1s in the final string must satisfy certain constraints based on the initial counts and the number of modifications.\n\nEach modification can either decrease the 0s by 1 (if last two were 00) or decrease the 1s by 1 (if last two were 01, 10, or 11 except when both were 00).\n\nWait, no: when the last two are 00, you replace them with 0. So the number of 0s goes from z to z-1, and 1s remain the same.\n\nWhen the last two are 01, 10, or 11 (but not 00), you replace them with 0. So the number of 1s decreases by 1, and 0s remain the same.\n\nWait, let's formalize:\n\nEach modification reduces the length by 1.\n\nIf the last two were 00:\n- 0s decrease by 1.\n- 1s remain the same.\n\nElse (last two are 01, 10, 11):\n- 1s decrease by 1.\n- 0s remain the same.\n\nSo, for each modification, the count of 0s and 1s can change in these specific ways.\n\nBut how does this affect the final state?\n\nWe need the final string to have a last character of g.\n\nLet me think about the final state. Suppose after k modifications, the string has l = L -k characters. The last character is g.\n\nWhat constraints must the initial n and m satisfy for this to be possible?\n\nWell, let's denote:\n\nAfter k modifications:\n\n- The number of 0s is a.\n- The number of 1s is b.\n- The last character is g.\n\nAnd a + b = l = n + m -k.\n\nSo, the final counts must satisfy:\n\na + b = n + m -k.\n\nAlso, the last character is g. So, the final string has either a 0 or 1 in the last position.\n\nHow can the modifications lead to this?\n\nLet me consider the case when g=0. So the final string ends with 0.\n\nFor this to happen, the last modification must have taken two characters that are not both 1s. Because in the last step, the two characters were replaced by 0.\n\nSo, in the step before the last, the last two characters were either 00, 01, 10, but not 11.\n\nWait, but the step before the last could have any configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the possible changes in the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 0s and 1s after k modifications.\n\nEach modification can either decrease the number of 0s by 1 or the number of 1s by 1.\n\nSo, the initial number of 0s is n, 1s is m.\n\nAfter k modifications, the 0s can be a = n - x, and 1s can be b = m - y, where x + y = k.\n\nBecause each modification contributes either x steps where 0s are decreased by 1, and y steps where 1s are decreased by 1, and x + y = k.\n\nWait, no. Because each modification contributes exactly one step towards x or y, but the order matters because the choice affects future steps.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of counting, the order doesn't matter, and we can model the possible a and b based on x and y.\n\nWait, but in reality, the path matters. For example, if you have a certain number of 0s and 1s, the order in which you modify can affect whether you can reach certain states.\n\nHmm, but perhaps for this problem, the key is to find for each possible k, whether it's possible to reach a state where a and b satisfy a + b = l = n + m -k, and the last character is g.\n\nSo, for each k, we can compute:\n\nl = n + m -k.\n\nWe need a + b = l, where a = n - x, b = m - y, x + y = k.\n\nAdditionally, the last character is g.\n\nSo, for the last character to be 0, the final state must have either a >=1, and the last modification didn't take two 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, the last character is determined by the parity of the number of times 1s were decreased.\n\nWait, maybe not. Another approach is to model the possible a and b after k modifications, and then see whether the final string can end with g.\n\nLet me consider that the final string has a certain a and b, and ends with g.\n\nSo, the sum a + b = l = n + m -k.\n\nAlso, the last character is g, which is 0 or 1.\n\nSo, if the last character is 0, then a must be at least 1.\n\nIf it's 1, then b must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but that's only part of the story. Because the way the modifications were done could affect whether it's possible to end with g.\n\nAnother thought: the final string's last character is determined by the last modification step.\n\nIn the last step, the two last characters were replaced by g.\n\nSo, in that step, the two last characters could have been:\n\nCase 1: 00 → replaced by 0 (so g=0). So the number of 0s decreased by 1.\n\nCase 2: 01, 10, or 11 → replaced by 0, so g=0. But wait, 11 would be replaced by 1, which wouldn't result in g=0.\n\nWait, no. The last modification step must result in the last character being g.\n\nSo, if the last step results in g=0, then the two characters before the last step must have been either 00, 01, or 10. Because if they were 11, the replacement would be 1, which doesn't match g=0.\n\nSo, in the last step, the two characters were not both 1s.\n\nThus, the number of 1s before the last step was b' = (m - y) - (if the last step was a 1s case, then 1, else 0).\n\nWait, this seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps the key is to model the possible a and b after k modifications, and for each, check whether it's possible to end with g.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe the last step can only contribute to certain possibilities.\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nThe final string must have a last character g, and a certain a and b.\n\nThe sum a + b = n + m - k.\n\nWe need to find for each k, whether there exists a and b such that:\n\na = n - x\n\nb = m - y\n\nx + y = k\n\nand either:\n\n- if g is 0: the last step must have taken two 0s (so x increases by 1, y doesn't), or two that are not both 1s (like 01, 10, etc.)\n\nWait, no. Because in the last step, the two characters are replaced by g.\n\nSo, in the last step:\n\nIf g is 0, then the two characters before the last step must have been either 00, 01, or 10.\n\nWhich means that in the last step, the 1s count could have decreased by 1 (if the two were 01 or 10) or 0 (if they were 00).\n\nBut this complicates things because the last step depends on the previous state.\n\nHmm, perhaps this suggests that the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where the state includes the current counts of 0s and 1s, and the current last character.\n\nBut given that n and m can be up to 105 each, and k up to 210, the state space is manageable.\n\nWait, let's consider the state as (a, b, last_char). a is the number of 0s, b is the number of 1s, and last_char is either 0 or 1.\n\nEach modification step reduces a or b by 1, depending on the last two characters.\n\nBut the last two characters are not tracked, only the last character.\n\nWait, but the next step's decision depends on the last two characters, which include the previous last character and the new character added. Hmm, perhaps that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state needs to include the second last character as well, but that would make the state size too big.\n\nWait, but maybe for the purpose of counting, the state can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered by looking at the parity of the number of modifications that affect the 1s count.\n\nWait, here's another idea: the final string's last character is g. So the last step must have ended with g.\n\nSo, the last step could have been:\n\n- Replacing 00 with 0 (so g=0)\n- Replacing 01 or 10 with 0 (so g=0)\n- Replacing 11 with 1 (so g=1)\n\nSo, for the last step to end with g=0, the two last characters before the step must have been either 00, 01, or 10.\n\nFor g=1, the two last characters before the step must have been 11.\n\nSo, the last step's effect on a and b depends on the state before that step.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps it's easier to consider that for the final string to end with g, the number of 1s after k modifications must be such that the last step could have produced g.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the final state after k modifications:\n\n- a = n - x\n- b = m - y\n- x + y = k\n- a + b = l = n + m -k.\n\nWe need the last character to be g.\n\nSo, the last step must have replaced two characters with g.\n\nCase 1: g=0.\n\nIn this case, the last step could have been:\n\na) Replaced 00 → so a decreases by 1 (x increases by 1), and b remains same.\n\nOR\n\nb) Replaced 01, 10, or 11 (but 11 would not result in 0, so this is not allowed). Wait no: in the last step, if the two were 01 or 10, they are replaced by 0, so g=0. But if the two were 11, they are replaced by 1, which would not match g=0.\n\nSo, for the last step to result in g=0, the two last characters before the step must have been either 00, 01, or 10.\n\nSo, in that case, the count of 1s would have decreased by 1 (if it was 01 or 10) or remained the same (if it was 00).\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you replace 00 with 0, the count of 0s decreases by 1 (from 2 to 1). So for that case, x increases by 1, y doesn't change.\n\nWhen you replace 01 or 10 with 0, the count of 1s decreases by 1 (because you had one 1 and one 0, replaced by 0, so 1s go from 1 to 0). So y increases by 1.\n\nSo, in the last step, for g=0, the two possibilities are:\n\n1. The last two were 00: x +=1, y remains same.\n\n2. The last two were 01 or 10: y +=1, x remains same.\n\nSo, in the final state, the number of 0s is a = n - x, and 1s is b = m - y.\n\nBut in the last step, if it was case 1, then y remains same, but x increases by 1.\n\nIf it was case 2, then x remains same, y increases by 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in case 1, the last two were 00, so x increases by 1, but in case 2, the last two were 01 or 10, so y increases by 1.\n\nSo, in the final state, for g=0:\n\nEither:\n\n- x = x_prev + 1, and y = y_prev.\n\nOR\n\n- y = y_prev + 1, and x = x_prev.\n\nSo, the final a and b are:\n\na = n - x_prev - 1 (case 1)\n\nOR\n\na = n - x_prev (case 2)\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nBut this seems tricky because x and y are variables, and the last step's choice depends on the previous state.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the possible transitions for each possible k, and for each state (a, b, last_char), track the number of ways to reach that state.\n\nSo, the DP state can be (current_length, a, b, last_char), but that might be too large. Alternatively, since the modifications are applied step by step, perhaps the state can be (a, b, last_char), and we track the number of ways to reach that state after k steps.\n\nWait, but each step reduces the length by 1, so the current_length is fixed as L - k.\n\nSo, for each possible k (from 0 to L-1), we can model the possible a, b, last_char, and the number of ways to reach that state after k steps.\n\nBut since L can be up to 210, and a and b can be up to 105 each, the state space for each k is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Initialize a DP table for each k, tracking the state (a, b, last_char) and the number of ways to reach that state.\n\n2. For each k from 0 to L-1:\n\n   a. For each possible state (a_prev, b_prev, c_prev) in the previous step (k-1):\n\n      i. Consider all possible ways to modify the string, which affects a, b, and the last_char.\n\n      ii. For each possible modification, compute the new a_new, b_new, and last_char_new, and update the DP for step k accordingly.\n\n3. After processing all k up to L-1, sum over all states where the last_char is g, and a + b = l = L -k.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is the original string. So, for k=0, the state is (n, m, last_char_initial), where last_char_initial is the last character of the original string.\n\nWait, but the original string can be any beautiful string, which has exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the last character can be 0 or 1, depending on the string.\n\nSo, for the initial state (k=0), the state is (n, m, last_char), where last_char can be 0 or 1, but the count of 0s and 1s is fixed as n and m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each beautiful string, the last character can vary. So, for each beautiful string, the initial state's last_char is either 0 or 1, depending on the string.\n\nSo, the initial state is the set of all possible beautiful strings, each contributing to the DP for k=0.\n\nBut how do we represent this? Because for the initial state, the count is the number of beautiful strings that have a particular (a, b, last_char).\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is (n, m, c), where c is either 0 or 1, and the count is the number of beautiful strings that end with c.\n\nSo, for the initial step, the DP for k=0 is:\n\ndp[0][a][b][c] = number of beautiful strings that have a=n, b=m, and last_char=c.\n\nThen, for each subsequent k, we build upon this.\n\nBut how to compute the initial counts?\n\nBecause the number of beautiful strings is C(n + m, n) if the last character is fixed, but the last character can vary.\n\nWait, no. The number of beautiful strings is (n + m choose n), but for each string, the last character can be 0 or 1, depending on the arrangement.\n\nSo, for the initial state, the number of strings that end with 0 is equal to the number of binary strings of length n+m, with exactly n 0s and m 1s, ending with 0.\n\nWhich is equal to (n + m - 1 choose n-1). Because the first n+m-1 positions must have n-1 0s and m 1s, and the last position is 0.\n\nSimilarly, the number of strings ending with 1 is (n + m -1 choose n), which is the same as (n + m -1 choose m-1).\n\nSo, for the initial state (k=0):\n\n- dp[0][n][m][0] = C(n + m -1, n-1) mod MOD.\n- dp[0][n][m][1] = C(n + m -1, m-1) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but this is only the case if the string is of length exactly n + m. So yes, for the initial state, the last character can be 0 or 1, and the number of such strings is as computed.\n\nSo, now, for each k from 1 to L-1:\n\nFor each state (a_prev, b_prev, c_prev) in dp[k-1], we can consider the possible modifications.\n\nEach modification can be of two types:\n\nType A: Replace two 0s with 0. So, a_prev must be >= 2.\n\nIn this case, a_new = a_prev - 1, b_new = b_prev.\n\nThe last two characters before the modification were 00, so the new last character is 0.\n\nSo, this transition is possible only if a_prev >= 2.\n\nType B: Replace any other two characters (not both 0s) with 0. So, the last two could be 01, 10, or 11 (but 11 would be replaced by 1, which is not 0).\n\nWait, no. Type B is when the last two are not both 0s. So, for Type B:\n\nIf the last two were 01 or 10 → replaced by 0, so g=0.\n\nIf the last two were 11 → replaced by 1, so g=1.\n\nSo, for Type B, when the last two are 01 or 10, the new last character is 0, and 1s decrease by 1.\n\nWhen the last two are 11, the new last character is 1, and 1s decrease by 1.\n\nSo, for each state (a_prev, b_prev, c_prev):\n\nWe need to determine what possible modifications can be made, leading to new states.\n\nBut wait, the modification is applied to the last two characters, which depend on the current last character and the next character.\n\nBut since we don't track the second last character, it's impossible to know what the last two are.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because the state only tracks the last character, but the modification depends on the previous state's last two characters.\n\nSo, our current approach is insufficient because it doesn't capture the necessary information.\n\nHmm, perhaps the state needs to include the second last character as well.\n\nSo, the state should be (a, b, c, d), where c is the last character, and d is the second last character.\n\nBut then, the state space grows significantly, which may be manageable since a and b are up to 105 each, and c and d can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo, for each state (a, b, c, d), where c is the last character and d is the second last, we can model the possible transitions.\n\nBut this could be feasible.\n\nSo, the state is (a, b, c, d), representing a current string with a 0s, b 1s, last character c, and second last character d.\n\nThen, for each state, the possible modifications are:\n\nCase 1: The last two are 00 → replace with 0.\n\nThis is possible only if d=0 and c=0.\n\nIn this case, a decreases by 1, and the new last character is 0.\n\nThe new state becomes (a-1, b, 0, ?) Well, after replacement, the new last character is 0, but the second last is whatever comes before.\n\nWait, no. Because when you replace the last two 00 with 0, the new last character is 0, and the second last is whatever the previous third last character was.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that after the replacement, the new string's last character is 0, and the second last is the third last character of the previous string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not easy to model. Alternatively, perhaps the state needs to track the last two characters.\n\nYes, because the next modification depends on them.\n\nSo, the state is (a, b, c, d), where c is the last character, d is the second last.\n\nThus, for each modification, we can determine the new last two characters based on the previous state.\n\nSo, for each state (a_prev, b_prev, c_prev, d_prev), we can consider all possible modifications.\n\nWait, but the initial state for k=0 is all the beautiful strings, each with their own last two characters.\n\nBut that's impractical, because the number of beautiful strings is huge.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial state can be built based on the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state (k=0) is such that for each possible (a_prev, b_prev) = (n, m), and for each possible pair (d, c), which represents the last two characters.\n\nBut the counts of d and c must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, for a beautiful string, the last two characters can be any combination of 0s and 1s, as long as the total counts are correct.\n\nSo, the initial state for k=0 is (n, m, c, d), where c is the last character, d is the second last.\n\nThe number of such states is (n + m -1 choose n-1) * 2, but not exactly.\n\nWait, no. The number of beautiful strings that end with a particular pair (d, c) is equal to the number of such strings that have exactly n 0s and m 1s, and end with the substring dc.\n\nBut calculating that for all possible (d, c) pairs is not trivial.\n\nThis seems like a major hurdle. Because the state space becomes too large.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me consider that each modification can only affect the counts of 0s and 1s in specific ways, and that the final state's a and b must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFor the final state to end with g, the last modification must have been such that the last two characters were replaced with g.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find, for each possible k, the possible a and b that can be achieved after k steps, and then check whether it's possible to have a last step that produces g.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using the following observations:\n\n1. The number of 0s and 1s after k modifications is a = n - x, b = m - y, where x + y = k.\n\n2. The final string must end with g, which implies that either:\n\n   a) The last step replaced two 0s with 0 (so g=0), which requires that a_prev >= 2, and the last two were 00.\n\n   OR\n\n   b) The last step replaced two that are not 00 with 0 (so g=0), which requires that the last two were 01, 10, or 11 but not 00.\n\nWait, no. For case b, if the last two were 11, the replacement would produce 1, which doesn't match g=0.\n\nSo, for the last step to produce g=0, the last two must have been either 00, 01, or 10.\n\nIn any case, the final a and b must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: since each modification can be seen as reducing either a or b by 1, perhaps the final a and b must satisfy a = n - x, b = m - y, x + y = k.\n\nAnd, for the final character to be g, either:\n\n- If g=0, then either x increased by 1 (from a modification that took two 0s), or y increased by 1 (from a modification that took a 0 and 1).\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character's state depends on the parity of the number of modifications that affect the 1s count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem by considering that for each possible k, the number of 1s after k modifications must be congruent to something modulo 2.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet me try to think of some examples.\n\nTake the sample input 1:\n\nn=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nEach of these can be modified once (since L=2).\n\nModification for \"01\" → replace last two (0 and 1) → becomes 0. So after one modification, the string is \"0\", which ends with 0.\n\nSimilarly for \"10\" → replaced by 0, ends with 0.\n\nSo both contribute to the count.\n\nThus, the output is 2.\n\nAnother sample: n=2, m=2, g=0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are all four possible with 2 0s and 2 1s. But after two modifications, each can be transformed into a string ending with 0.\n\nWait, the sample output is 4.\n\nSo, the count is 4.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=1, g=1.\n\nNo way to reach a string ending with 1, because the last modification must have replaced two characters to get 1. But let's see:\n\nInitial string is either \"01\" or \"10\".\n\nModifying \"01\" → replace 0 and 1 → becomes 0. So ends with 0.\n\nModifying \"10\" → becomes 0.\n\nSo, the final string can't end with 1. So the output is 0.\n\nSo, the output depends on whether it's possible to have a final character g after some modifications.\n\nThus, the problem can be approached by considering for each possible k, whether there exists a way to reach a state where the last character is g, and then sum the number of such possibilities.\n\nBut how to model this without tracking the exact sequence.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that for the final string to end with g, the number of modifications that decrease the 1s count must have a certain parity.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time to think about the parity of the number of times the 1s count was decreased.\n\nEach modification can either decrease 0s by 1 (type A) or 1s by 1 (type",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character 'g' after a series of modifications. Each modification reduces the length of the string by one and replaces two characters with a single character based on specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. We can perform modifications where each operation replaces two last characters with another character, reducing the string's length by one each time. The goal is to determine how many such strings can be modified to end with 'g'.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach to track the number of ways to reach each state after `k` modifications. Each state is represented by the current counts of zeros and ones, and the last two characters of the string.\n\n3. **State Representation**: The state is represented as `(a, b, c, d)` where `a` is the count of zeros, `b` is the count of ones, `c` is the last character, and `d` is the second last character.\n\n4. **Transitions**: For each state, we consider all possible modifications:\n   - Replacing two zeros with zero (if possible).\n   - Replacing any other pair with zero or one based on the last two characters.\n\n5. **Initialization**: The initial state is set up based on the counts of zeros and ones and the possible endings of the initial string.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take results modulo `1000000007`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, m, g = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    L = n + m\n    if L == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute combinations\n    max_k = L - 1\n    from math import comb\n    C = [comb(i, j) % MOD for i in range(max_k+2) for j in range(max_k+2)]\n    \n    dp = [{} for _ in range(L)]\n    for c in ['0', '1']:\n        for d in ['0', '1']:\n            key = (n, m, c, d)\n            if key not in dp[0]:\n                dp[0][key] = 0\n            ways = comb(n + m - 1, n - 1) % MOD if c == '0' else comb(n + m - 1, m - 1) % MOD\n            dp[0][(n, m, c, d)] = ways\n    \n    for k in range(1, L):\n        for state in dp[k-1]:\n            a_prev, b_prev, c_prev, d_prev = state\n            current_ways = dp[k-1][state]\n            \n            if a_prev >= 2:\n                new_a = a_prev - 1\n                new_b = b_prev\n                new_c = '0'\n                key = (new_a, new_b, new_c, d_prev)\n                if key not in dp[k]:\n                    dp[k][key] = 0\n                dp[k][key] = (dp[k][key] + current_ways) % MOD\n            \n            if (d_prev, c_prev) != ('0', '0'):\n                new_a = a_prev\n                new_b = b_prev - 1\n                new_c = '0'\n                if new_b >= 0:\n                    key = (new_a, new_b, new_c, d_prev)\n                    if key not in dp[k]:\n                        dp[k][key] = 0\n                    dp[k][key] = (dp[k][key] + current_ways) % MOD\n            \n            if (d_prev, c_prev) == ('1', '1'):\n                new_a = a_prev\n                new_b = b_prev - 1\n                new_c = '1'\n                if new_b >= 0:\n                    key = (new_a, new_b, new_c, d_prev)\n                    if key not in dp[k]:\n                        dp[k][key] = 0\n                    dp[k][key] = (dp[k][key] + current_ways) % MOD\n            \n            if (d_prev, c_prev) != ('1', '1'):\n                new_a = a_prev\n                new_b = b_prev - 1\n                new_c = '1'\n                if new_b >= 0:\n                    key = (new_a, new_b, new_c, d_prev)\n                    if key not in dp[k]:\n                        dp[k][key] = 0\n                    dp[k][key] = (dp[k][key] + current_ways) % MOD\n    \n    total = 0\n    target_length = L - (max_k)\n    for state in dp[max_k]:\n        a, b, c, d = state\n        if c == str(g):\n            if a + b == target_length:\n                total = (total + dp[max_k][state]) % MOD\n    print(total % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to transform the string step-by-step, considering each possible modification and its effect on the string's count of zeros and ones.
