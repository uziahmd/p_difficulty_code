The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ring of houses. The houses are arranged in a ring, numbered 1 through n clockwise. Traffic is one-way and also clockwise. So, moving from house i can only go to i+1 (mod n, but since it's a ring, it wraps around after n). \n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be in ai by the time she completes all tasks before i. Wait, no—the description says she needs to be in ai for the i-th task and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Oh right, because the tasks are given in order, so for the first task (i=1), she must be at a1 when she does it. Then, for the second task (i=2), she must be at a2 and also have completed the first task already. So, she has to process them in order, but she can do them in any order as long as each ai is processed before the next ones, and each step is done in the correct sequence.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So, perhaps the i-th task must be done in the house ai, and all prior tasks (1 to i-1) must have been completed before that. So, the processing order must be such that for each task j, she must reach a_j before starting any task with higher index j' > j.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the way the problem is phrased, for each task i, she needs to be in ai to complete it, and also all previous tasks (i.e., those with j < i) must have been completed. So, the order in which she processes the tasks affects how much time she takes. But the problem says she can arrange the order of completing the tasks, but each task has a required position ai. So the optimal strategy is to find the order of processing the tasks that minimizes the total time, considering that each task i must be processed at house ai, and all previous tasks must be processed before it.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding an order of the tasks such that for each task i, all tasks j with j < i are processed before it, and the total movement time between the positions is minimized.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1, and each movement takes 1 unit of time. So, the movement is along the ring, which is a circular arrangement. The distance between two houses depends on the direction. Since the ring is one-way clockwise, you can't move counter-clockwise. So, the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n if y >=x, else (y + n -x).\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is arranged such that you can only move clockwise. So, the number of steps to get from x to y is (y - x) if y >= x, else (y + n - x). For example, if n=4, then from 3 to 1 is 2 steps (3→4→1), because you can't go the other way.\n\nBut wait, the ring is a loop. So the distance from x to y is the minimal steps needed in the clockwise direction. So, for x and y, if y >=x, it's y-x steps. If y <x, it's (n -x + y) steps. Or, more generally, (y -x) % n, but since we're moving clockwise, it's the same as the positive difference.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the tasks in an order such that each task is processed at its required house, and all previous tasks are done before. The initial position is 1.\n\nThe goal is to compute the minimal total time taken to process all tasks in some order that satisfies the constraints.\n\nWait, but the order is important. Each task can be processed at any point as long as all earlier tasks are done before it. So, the order is a permutation where the first task is any of the m tasks, but all the tasks before it in the original list must come before it in the processing order.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says: \"the i-th task must be processed in house ai and all tasks with j <i must have been completed before processing the i-th task.\"\n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\nSo, for the i-th task in the original list, she must be at ai when she completes it, and she must have already completed all tasks j where j < i.\n\nSo, the order in which she processes the tasks must satisfy that for each task i, all tasks j < i are processed before i. But she can choose any order of processing the tasks as long as for each task i, all j < i are done before i.\n\nSo, the order of processing is a permutation where for any i < j, task j can be processed before or after task i, but if i comes after j in the processing order, then j must be processed before i, which may require that j is in the 'earlier' tasks.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the tasks are labeled 1 to m, but their required positions are a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. For each task i, she must be at a_i when she completes it, and she must have completed all tasks j where j < i before. So, the processing order must be such that for any j < i, task j is processed before task i.\n\nTherefore, the processing order must be a topological sort where the dependencies are j < i implies j is processed before i.\n\nSo, the order is a permutation where for each i, all j < i are before i. Which means that the processing order is exactly the order of the tasks from 1 to m. Because if you process task 1, then 2, then 3, etc., each task j is processed before j+1, which satisfies the condition that all j < i are done before i.\n\nWait, wait. No. Because the problem says that in order to complete the i-th task, she must be in ai and all tasks with numbers less than i must have been completed. So, the i-th task is task number i in the input list. So, for each i in 1..m, when she processes the i-th task, she must have already processed tasks 1, 2, ..., i-1.\n\nThus, the processing order must process the tasks in the order of their indices: 1,2,3,...,m.\n\nBecause if she processes task 3 before task 2, then when she does task 3, she hasn't processed task 2 yet, which is required.\n\nSo, the order of processing is fixed as 1,2,3,...,m.\n\nAh! That makes things simpler. So the problem reduces to computing the minimal time to process the tasks in the order 1,2,3,...,m, with each task i being processed at ai, and the initial position is 1.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the minimal time to perform this sequence.\n\nThe movement is from the current position to the next task's position, and each step takes 1 unit of time. So, the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions in the processing order.\n\nWait, but the processing order is fixed as the original order. So, the first task is 1, then 2, etc.\n\nSo, the positions are:\n\nstart at 1,\n\nthen go to a1 (but wait, no—task 1 is the first task. Or wait, the first task is task 1, which must be processed at a1. So the initial position is 1, then she moves to a1, which is the first step.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial position is 1. She can start processing the first task (task 1) immediately if she is at a1.\n\nWait, no. Because she starts at 1, but task 1 requires her to be at a1. So, she must move from 1 to a1, then process task 1. Then, for task 2, she must be at a2, so she must move from a1 to a2, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because for task 1, she must be at a1 when she completes it. So, she starts at 1, then moves to a1, which takes (a1 -1) units of time if a1 >1, or (a1 +n -1) if a1 <1? Wait, no, because the ring is circular, and movement is only clockwise.\n\nWait, the movement from x to y is the minimal steps in the clockwise direction. So, for x=1, y=a1, the steps are (a1 -1) if a1 >=1, else (a1 +n -1). But since a1 is given as 1<=a1<=n, that's just (a1 -1) steps.\n\nSo, for task 1, she moves from 1 to a1, which takes (a1 -1) steps. Then, for task 2, she moves from a1 to a2, taking |a2 - a1| steps if it's in a way that's allowed. Wait, no. Because movement is only clockwise, the distance from a1 to a2 is (a2 -a1) if a2 >=a1, else (n - (a1 - a2)).\n\nWait, more accurately, the distance is (a2 - a1) mod n, but since it's clockwise, it's the same as (a2 -a1) if a2 >=a1, else (n - a1 + a2).\n\nSo, the movement steps from a1 to a2 is (a2 - a1) mod n. But since a2 can be less than a1, let's compute it as (a2 - a1 + n) % n.\n\nWait, yes, because (a2 - a1) can be negative, adding n ensures it's positive.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions in the processing order, including the movement from the initial position (1) to a1, then a1 to a2, a2 to a3, etc., up to a_{m-1} to a_m.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the tasks in the order 1,2,3,...,m.\n\n- Compute the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair, including the initial move from 1 to a1.\n\nWait, no. Because the processing order is 1,2,3,...,m, so the positions are 1 → a1 → a2 → a3 → ... → am.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So, the first movement is 1 → a1. Then, the next is a1 → a2, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the first task is task 1, which is processed at a1. So, she starts at 1, then moves to a1, and then processes the task.\n\nThen, for task 2, she must be at a2. So, she moves from a1 to a2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the total time is:\n\ndistance(1, a1) + distance(a1, a2) + distance(a2, a3) + ... + distance(a_{m-1}, a_m).\n\nWhere distance(x,y) is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y +n -x).\n\nAlternatively, distance(x,y) = (y -x +n) % n.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute the sum of these distances.\n\nWait, but let me see the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing order is 1, 2, 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the m is 3, so the processing order is task 1, then 2, then 3.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nMove to a1=3: distance is 3-1=2 steps.\n\nProcess task 1.\n\nThen, move from 3 to a2=2: but wait, a2 is 2. So, the movement is 3→4→2. Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, from 3 to 2 would require going through 4. So the distance is 2 -3 +4 = 3 steps.\n\nWait, 3 to 4 is 1 step, 4 to 2 is another. So, 2 steps? Wait, 3 →4 is 1, 4→2 is 2 steps? Because 4 is followed by 1, then 2.\n\nWait, no. Because from 4, moving clockwise, the next is 1, then 2. So, from 4 to 2 is 2 steps (4→1, 1→2).\n\nSo, 3→4→1→2 is 3 steps.\n\nSo, the movement from 3 to 2 is 3 steps.\n\nThen, process task 2.\n\nThen, move from 2 to a3=3. Distance is 3-2=1 step.\n\nSo, total movement steps: 2 (from 1→3) + 3 (3→2) +1 (2→3) = 6 steps. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\nProcessing order is task1, task2, task3.\n\na1=2, a2=3, a3=3.\n\nSequence:\n\nStart at 1 → move to 2: 1 step.\n\nProcess task1.\n\nMove from 2→3: 1 step.\n\nProcess task2.\n\nMove from 3→3: 0 steps.\n\nProcess task3.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+0=2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the solution is to compute the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair in the order 1,2,3,...,m, including the initial step from 1 to a1.\n\nSo, the steps to implement are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the array a of length m.\n\n3. Compute the sum:\n\n   - Start at current = 1.\n\n   - For each i from 0 to m-1:\n\n      - next = a[i]\n\n      - compute the distance between current and next.\n\n      - add to sum.\n\n      - set current to next.\n\n4. Output the sum.\n\nSo, the code in Python would look like:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum:\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    distance = (num - current) % n  # because moving clockwise.\n\n    total += distance\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, wait. Because for the initial step, current is 1, and the first num is a1.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1:\n\na is [3,2,3].\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nnum=3:\n\ndistance =3-1=2. sum is 2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nnum=2: distance is (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4= 3. sum is 5.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nnum=3: distance is (3-2)=1. sum is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, a is [2,3,3].\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nnum=2: distance 1. sum=1.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nnum=3: distance 1. sum=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nnum=3: distance 0. sum remains 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's test another case.\n\nCase where n=5, m=2, a = [5,5].\n\nProcessing order is task1:5, then task2:5.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nMovement to 5: 5-1=4 steps.\n\nThen, movement to 5: 0 steps.\n\nTotal is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, a=[5,4,3,2,1].\n\nWait, m=5, a is [5,4,3,2,1]. So processing order is 5,4,3,2,1.\n\nWait, no. Because the processing order is 1,2,3,4,5 (assuming m=5). Wait no, the processing order is the tasks in the order 1,2,3,4,5. So, for m=5, the tasks are 1,2,3,4,5. So, the a array is [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] = [5,4,3,2,1].\n\nSo, the movement steps:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask1: move to 5: 5-1=4 steps.\n\nTask2: move to 4. From 5, moving to 4 is 5 →1 →2 →3 →4? No, wait, 5 is followed by 1, so 5→1 is 1 step, then 1→2 is 1, 2→3 is 1, 3→4 is 1. So, total 4 steps.\n\nSum so far: 4+4=8.\n\nTask3: move to 3. From 4, moving to 3 is 4→5→1→2→3? No, wait, 4→5 is 1 step, 5→1 is 1, 1→2 is 1, 2→3 is 1. So 4 steps.\n\nSum now 12.\n\nTask4: move to 2. From 3, to 2 is 3→4→5→1→2. 4 steps.\n\nSum 16.\n\nTask5: move to 1. From 2, to 1 is 2→3→4→5→1. 4 steps.\n\nSum 20.\n\nSo, the total is 4+4+4+4+4=20.\n\nBut according to the code, current starts at 1, then for each a[i], compute (a[i]-current) mod n.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor a = [5,4,3,2,1]:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nfirst num=5: distance (5-1) mod5=4. sum=4.\n\ncurrent=5.\n\nnext num=4: (4-5) mod5= -1 mod5=4. sum=8.\n\ncurrent=4.\n\nnext num=3: (3-4) mod5= -1 mod5=4. sum=12.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nnext num=2: (2-3) mod5= -1 mod5=4. sum=16.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nnext num=1: (1-2) mod5= -1 mod5=4. sum=20.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a = [2,2].\n\nProcessing order is 1→2, then 2→2.\n\nDistance from 1→2: 1.\n\nThen 2→2:0.\n\nSum 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=2, a = [3,1].\n\nProcessing order:\n\n1→3: distance 2.\n\n3→1: distance (1-3) mod3 = (-2 mod3)=1.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nWhich makes sense: 1→3 is 2 steps, then 3→1 is 1 step (3→1 is directly next, as n=3 is a ring).\n\nWait, no. 3 is followed by 1 in n=3. So, from 3 to 1 is one step.\n\nSo, the code correctly adds 2+1=3.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, the plan is to read the list a, then compute the sum as per the code above.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute the sum as follows:\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    distance = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += distance\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, wait. Because in the problem statement, the initial position is 1, and the first movement is to a1. So, for the first iteration, current is 1, and num is a[0], which is a1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m, the second is the list of a1 to am.\n\nSo, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut sometimes, if the input is provided as separate lines, but in the problem statement, the second line is the list.\n\nIn the sample inputs, the first line is '4 3', and the second is '3 2 3'.\n\nSo, the code reads correctly.\n\nTesting the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\na = [3,2,3].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nsum += (3-1)%4=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nsum += (2-3)%4= ( -1 )%4=3. sum=5.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nsum += (3-2)%4=1. sum=6.\n\nPrint 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\na= [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nsum += 1.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nsum +=1.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nsum +=0.\n\nsum=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in a specific house, and all previous tasks must be completed before the current task.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Movement**: The ring of houses is circular, meaning the movement from one house to another is always clockwise. The distance between two houses `x` and `y` can be calculated as `(y - x) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n2. **Task Order**: Xenia must complete her tasks in the order they are given. For each task `i`, she must be at house `a_i` after completing all tasks with numbers less than `i`.\n3. **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house 1. She must move to the required house for each task sequentially, starting from house 1 to `a_1`, then from `a_1` to `a_2`, and so on.\n4. **Summing Distances**: Calculate the total time by summing the distances between consecutive positions, including the initial move from house 1 to `a_1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        distance = (num - current) % n\n        total += distance\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by a list of `m` integers representing the target houses for each task.\n- **Calculating Distances**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring.\n- **Summing Up**: Accumulate the total time taken to move from the initial position to each target house in sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging the properties of circular movement and modular arithmetic, ensuring that all constraints are met and the solution is optimal.",
