Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do. The output should be the vertices v1, v2, v3 in order.\n\nHmm. So, the polygon is regular, which means all sides and angles are equal. That should help in figuring out the possible angles between vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angle at v2 is formed. It says v1 and v3 are on its sides. So, for example, if v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1 and v3 could be vertex 3, making the angle at 2. Or maybe v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, but wait no—because the polygon is convex, each side is a straight line. So for each v2, the sides are the edges connected to it. Like, for v2, the two adjacent vertices form the sides. So the points on the sides would be other vertices along those edges.\n\nWait, but the polygon is regular, so each edge is of equal length, and the internal angles are all equal. For an n-gon, each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees.\n\nBut how does that help me find the possible angles formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me think about the possible angles that can be formed when selecting three vertices in the polygon.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/n degrees. So, the angle between two vertices that are k steps apart is k*(360/n) degrees. But how does that relate to the angle formed at v2 by v1 and v3?\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Since it's regular, all vertices lie on a circle. Then, the angles formed by three points on the circumference can be determined using circle geometry.\n\nThe angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Because, according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nSo, if I have three points A, B, C on the circle, the angle at B is half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nIn our case, since the polygon is regular, the positions are equally spaced around the circle. So, the arc between two vertices is a multiple of 360/n degrees.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet of vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2.\n\nWait, let's clarify: the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc that it intercepts. So, for angle at v2, the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't include v2. So, the measure of that arc is (number of edges between v1 and v3) * (360/n) degrees.\n\nThen, the angle at v2 is half of that. So, angle = (k * 360/n) / 2, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2.\n\nWait, or is it the other way around? Because the angle at v2 is formed by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite to the angle. So, if v1 and v3 are on either side of v2, then the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that connects v1 and v3 but doesn't pass through v2.\n\nBut in the polygon, each step is 360/n degrees. So, the possible arcs between v1 and v3 can vary based on their positions.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon in the direction that doesn't include v2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the minimal steps. For any triplet, the angle at v2 is determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose the polygon has vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, ..., n arranged in a circle.\n\nFor a given v2, say vertex i, what are the possible (v1, v3) pairs that form the angle at i?\n\nEach side of i is connected to i-1 and i+1 (mod n). So, any other vertex j is either on the same side as i-1 or i+1, or across.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for a given v2, the possible angles can be determined by how far apart v1 and v3 are around the polygon.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each possible pair of vertices (v1, v3), determine the angle at their common neighbor v2, which is the vertex between them in the polygon.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities because v2 can be any of the other vertices.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nLet me think in terms of steps between vertices. For a regular polygon, the distance between two vertices can be measured in terms of the minimal number of edges between them. So, for any two vertices u and v, the minimal distance is min(k, n -k), where k is the number of steps moving clockwise.\n\nSo, for the angle at v2, the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nLet me consider that for each v2, the polygon is split into two arcs: one going clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The angle at v2 will depend on the positions of v1 and v3.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal way to compute the possible angles is to consider all possible triplets and compute the angle for each, then find the one closest to 'a'.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 105, the total number of triplets is C(105,3) which is about 105*104*103/(6) ≈ 176,000. Which is manageable computationally.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3), ensuring they are distinct.\n\n2. For each triplet, compute the angle at v2.\n\n3. Track the triplet(s) with the minimal absolute difference between the computed angle and 'a'.\n\n4. Among all such triplets, choose any (for example, the first found) and output it.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so the number of triplets is 105 * 104 * 103 / 6 ≈ 176,100, which is manageable for a Python solution.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n- Generate all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3), all distinct.\n\n- For each triplet, compute the angle at v2.\n\n- Find the triplet with the minimal |computed_angle - a|.\n\n- If multiple, pick any.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the angle for each triplet efficiently.\n\nHow to compute the angle at v2 for triplet (v1, v2, v3)?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2.\n\nSo, for v2, the two arcs between v1 and v3 are:\n\n- The arc that goes through the polygon in the direction away from v2.\n\n- The arc that goes through the polygon towards v2.\n\nWe need the arc that doesn't contain v2, because the inscribed angle is half of that.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of an inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nSo, in this case, the angle at v2 is formed by the points v1, v2, v3. The intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that does NOT contain v2.\n\nSo, the measure of the angle is (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 not containing v2.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, the arc_length is k * (360/n) degrees, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc.\n\nBut wait, the arc could be more than half the circle, but in that case, the smaller arc is considered. Wait no, because the inscribed angle depends on the intercepted arc, which is the one that's not containing the point. So, for example, if v1 and v3 are separated by more than half the circle, the angle would be larger.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the minimal arc between v1 and v3. No, because the angle depends on the arc not containing v2. So, if v2 is between v1 and v3, then the intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSay n=4 (square). The vertices are 1,2,3,4 arranged clockwise.\n\nSuppose v2 is 2. Let's consider v1=1 and v3=3. Then, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees (since 1-2-3 is a right angle in a square). The intercepted arc is from 1 to 3 via 4, which is 270 degrees (but wait, 1 to 3 via the other way is 90 degrees, but that's the minor arc. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain v2. So, if v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 3: the arc from 1 to 3 that doesn't contain 2 is the arc going through 4, which is 270 degrees. So, the angle at 2 is 270/2 = 135 degrees. But in reality, in a square, the angle at 2 between 1 and 3 is 90 degrees. Hmm, this suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. So, perhaps the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to v2, meaning the arc that doesn't include v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in some cases, the angle is formed by two chords that intersect at v2. The intercepted arc is the one that lies opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that doesn't contain the angle.\n\nIn the square example, v1=1, v2=2, v3=3: the angle at 2 is formed by the chords 2-1 and 2-3. These chords are adjacent sides of the square, forming a 90-degree angle. The intercepted arc is the one opposite to this angle, which is from 1 to 3 via the other path (through 4). But wait, that's a 270-degree arc. So the angle would be 135 degrees, which contradicts the actual square's internal angle.\n\nHmm, something is wrong here. Maybe I'm miscalculating the intercepted arc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. In a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. But when you connect 2 to 1 and 2 to 3, that's the internal angle of the square. The inscribed angle theorem applies to circles, but in a square, the points are on a circle. So, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees, which is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n\nWait, the arc opposite to the angle is the arc from 1 to 3 that is not containing 2. But in a square, that's the 180-degree arc (the diameter). So 180/2 = 90 degrees. Oh, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the intercepted arc is the one that is directly opposite to the angle. So, for any triplet, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2 and is the minimal path between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, no. Because for some triplets, the intercepted arc could be the major arc. But in the square example, the intercepted arc is 180 degrees, which is the minor arc.\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the minimal arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle, regardless of whether it's minor or major. So, in the square, the angle is 90 degrees, which is half of 180. So, the intercepted arc is 180 degrees.\n\nSo, for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. The angle is half the measure of that arc.\n\nSo, the measure of the angle is (k * 360 / n) / 2, where k is the number of edges along that arc.\n\nWait, but how to compute k for a given triplet?\n\nEach edge is 360/n degrees. So, the arc is k * (360/n) degrees.\n\nSo, the angle is (k * (360/n)) / 2 = (k * 180) / n.\n\nWait, that's a crucial formula.\n\nSo, for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 is (k * 180) / n, where k is the number of edges along the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2.\n\nWait, but in the square example, when v1=1, v2=2, v3=3, the arc from 1 to 3 not containing 2 is 180 degrees. So, k=2, because 180 is 2*(360/4)= 2*90=180. So angle is (2*90)/2 = 90 degrees. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=4, a=45. So, what's the best triplet? For v2=2, the possible angles are 90 and 135 (when v1=1 and v3=3, or v1=3 and v3=1, respectively).\n\nWait, no. Because for v2=2, the possible k values are 1 and 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the minimal and maximal steps between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, for a given v2, the polygon is split into two arcs. One is the clockwise arc from v1 to v3, the other is counter-clockwise. The angle at v2 is determined by the size of the arc that does not include v2.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 can be in either direction.\n\nSo, for each triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute the minimal number of edges between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let that number be k. Then the angle is (k * 360 / n) / 2 = (k * 180) /n degrees.\n\nWait, but how to compute k?\n\nAlternatively, for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2.\n\nSo, the number of edges along that arc is the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2. But perhaps it's easier to compute the number of steps between v1 and v3, and then determine whether the arc includes v2 or not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the polygon as a circular list. For any triplet, the arc from v1 to v3 can be in two directions. We need to find which direction does not include v2.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular and convex, the arc that doesn't include v2 is the one that is longer only when v2 is between v1 and v3 in the other direction.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake n=5, a regular pentagon. Suppose v2 is vertex 2. Now, v1 is 1 and v3 is 3. The arc from 1 to 3 that doesn't include 2 is the one going through 5, which is two steps (from 1 to 5 is one step, 5 to 3 is another step). So k=2, angle is (2 * 72)/2= 72 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, the arc from 1 to 4 not containing 2 is the one going through 3 (steps 1→2→3→4, but that includes v2=2. So no, wait, the arc that doesn't include 2 is the other way: 1→5→4. So steps from 1 to 5 is one step, 5 to 4 is another. So k=2 again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to compute k is the number of edges in the arc that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2.\n\nSo, how to compute k for a given triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\nCompute the distance between v1 and v3 in both directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise). The distance is the minimal number of steps, but in this case, we need to find the maximum distance because the arc that doesn't include v2 is the one that is the longer path.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), the arc that doesn't include v2 is the longer path if v2 is between v1 and v3 in the shorter path. Otherwise, it's the shorter path.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: the arc that doesn't include v2 must be the one that doesn't have v2 in between v1 and v3. So, if v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3, then the arc that doesn't include v2 is the longer path. Otherwise, it's the shorter path.\n\nSo, for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), the number of steps k is the maximum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise distances between v1 and v3, minus 1?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think in terms of code.\n\nFor any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the minimal steps between v1 and v3 is min_clock = min( (v3 - v1) % n, (v1 - v3) % n ). The maximal steps is max_clock = n - min_clock.\n\nIf v2 is on the minimal path from v1 to v3, then the arc that doesn't include v2 is the maximal path. Otherwise, it's the minimal path.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nn=4, v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. Minimal steps from 1 to 3 is 2 (1→2→3). Maximal steps is 2. Wait, no, wait n=4, 1 to 3 clockwise is 2 steps, counter-clockwise is also 2 steps. So minimal and maximal are same.\n\nSo, in this case, the arc that doesn't include v2 is the same as the minimal steps.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that the angle is 90 degrees, which is (2 * 90)/2 = 90. So yes.\n\nAnother example: n=5, v1=1, v2=2, v3=4.\n\nMinimal steps between 1 and 4 is 3 (1→2→3→4), counter-clockwise is 2 (1→5→4). So minimal is 2. Now, is v2 on the minimal path? Yes, because 2 is between 1 and 4 in the minimal path. So the arc that doesn't include v2 is the maximal path, which is 3 steps (from 1 to 4 via 5, 1→5→4). So k=3. Angle is (3 * 72)/2 = 108 degrees.\n\nSo, in code, for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), we can compute:\n\nd1 = (v3 - v1) % n\nd2 = (v1 - v3) % n\nmin_steps = min(d1, d2)\nmax_steps = max(d1, d2)\n\nif v2 is between v1 and v3 in the minimal path, then the arc that doesn't include v2 is the maximal_steps, else it's min_steps.\n\nWait, but how do we check if v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3?\n\nAn alternative approach: arrange the three points in a circular manner. Let's fix v2. Then, arrange v1 and v3 in order around the circle.\n\nIf v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, then the minimal path between v1 and v3 passes through v2. So, the arc that doesn't include v2 is the longer path.\n\nBut if v1 and v3 are on the same side of v2, then the minimal path between them doesn't include v2, so the arc that doesn't include v2 is the minimal path.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the correct condition.\n\nSo, for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute the minimal steps between v1 and v3. Then, if v2 is on the minimal path, then the arc that doesn't include v2 is the maximal_steps. Else, it's min_steps.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute d_min = min( (v3 - v1) % n, (v1 - v3) % n )\n\nif v2 is between v1 and v3 in the minimal path, then the arc is the maximal steps.\n\nElse, the arc is the minimal steps.\n\nBut how to determine if v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3?\n\nWell, in a circular arrangement, the minimal path is the one that takes the fewest steps. So, v2 is on the minimal path if and only if v1 < v2 < v3 (in a linear arrangement), or similar when considering modulo n.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute the positions in a sorted manner.\n\nAssuming the polygon is arranged in a circle, for a given v2, the minimal path between v1 and v3 can be checked by seeing if v2 is between them in the circular order.\n\nSo, for example, if v1 is at position x, v2 is at y, and v3 is at z, then in a circular list, if y is between x and z in one direction, then the minimal path is that direction. Otherwise, the minimal path is the other direction.\n\nSo, in code, to determine if v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3:\n\nif ( (v2 is between v1 and v3 in the clockwise direction) ) or ( (v2 is between v1 and v3 in the counter-clockwise direction) ), then it's on the minimal path.\n\nWait, perhaps a function can be written to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, in the minimal path between v1 and v3, v2 is included if the following is true:\n\n(v1 <= v2 <= v3) or (v1 >= v2 >= v3) when arranged in a linear fashion, but since it's circular, this isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the minimal path between v1 and v3 is the one with the least number of steps. So, if v2 is on that path, then the arc that doesn't include v2 is the maximal path.\n\nBut to compute whether v2 is on the minimal path, perhaps we can compute the distance from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 and see if their sum is equal to the minimal distance between v1 and v3.\n\nBecause, if v2 is on the minimal path between v1 and v3, then the distance from v1 to v2 plus v2 to v3 equals the minimal distance between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nd_v1_v2 = (v2 - v1) % n\nd_v2_v3 = (v3 - v2) % n\n\nif (d_v1_v2 + d_v2_v3) == d_min:\n    # then v2 is on the minimal path\n    k = max_steps\nelse:\n    # v2 is not on the minimal path; the minimal path is the other way\n    k = d_min\n\nWait, but wait. The minimal path between v1 and v3 is d_min steps. If v2 is on that path, then the sum of d_v1_v2 and d_v2_v3 is exactly d_min. Otherwise, it's less than d_min.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\nif (d_v1_v2 + d_v2_v3) <= d_min:\n    # v2 is on the minimal path\n    # but wait, no. Because if v2 is on the minimal path, the sum is equal to d_min.\n    # So, the condition should be whether the sum is equal to d_min.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif ( (v2 - v1) % n + (v3 - v2) % n ) == d_min:\n    # v2 is on the minimal path\n    k = max_steps\nelse:\n    k = d_min\n\nBut wait, in the example where n=5, v1=1, v2=2, v3=4:\n\nd_min is 2 (since 1→5→4 is 2 steps).\n\nd_v1_v2 is (2-1) mod 5 = 1.\n\nd_v2_v3 is (4-2) mod 5 = 2.\n\nsum is 3, which is greater than d_min (2). So condition is false, so k is set to d_min=2.\n\nBut in that case, the angle is (2*72)/2 = 72 degrees.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation suggested that the angle was 108 degrees. So this indicates a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier example.\n\nWait, for n=5, v1=1, v2=2, v3=4.\n\nWhat is the intercepted arc that doesn't include v2?\n\nThe minimal path from 1 to 4 is 1→5→4 (steps 2). The maximal path is 1→2→3→4 (steps 3).\n\nIs v2 (2) on the minimal path? Yes, because 1→5→4 is the minimal path, which doesn't include 2. So, the minimal path is 1→5→4. So, the intercepted arc that doesn't include v2 is the maximal path, which is 3 steps. So, k=3.\n\nThus, the angle is (3 * 72)/2 = 108 degrees.\n\nBut according to the code condition above, (d_v1_v2 + d_v2_v3) is 1+2=3, which is greater than d_min=2. So condition is false, so k is set to d_min=2. But that gives us the wrong result.\n\nHmm, so the condition is not correctly capturing whether v2 is on the minimal path.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the longer of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3. Because, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2.\n\nSo, for any triplet, the intercepted arc is the longer path between v1 and v3, unless the longer path is the same as the minimal path, which would be the case when the polygon is even and v1 and v3 are diametrically opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the longer of the two possible paths between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn the square example:\n\nv1=1, v2=2, v3=3.\n\nThe two paths from 1 to 3 are 2 steps (1→2→3) and 2 steps (1→4→3). So, same length.\n\nThe intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2, which is the path via 4, which is 2 steps. So, k=2.\n\nAngle is (2*90)/2 =90 degrees.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the earlier n=5 example:\n\nv1=1, v2=2, v3=4.\n\nThe two paths from 1 to4 are 2 steps (1→5→4) and 3 steps (1→2→3→4). So, the longer path is 3 steps. So, intercepted arc is 3 steps.\n\nSo, k=3. Angle is 108.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6, v1=1, v2=2, v3=4.\n\nPaths from 1 to4 are 3 steps (1→2→3→4) and 3 steps (1→6→5→4). So, same length.\n\nIntercepted arc is the path that doesn't include v2, which is 3 steps (1→6→5→4). So, k=3.\n\nAngle is (3 * 60)/2=90 degrees.\n\nWait, but what if v2 is 3?\n\nThen, v1=1, v2=3, v3=4.\n\nThe two paths from 1 to4 are 3 steps (1→2→3→4) and 3 steps (1→6→5→4). So, intercepted arc is 3 steps.\n\nAngle is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps the intercepted arc is always the longer path between v1 and v3, unless the two paths are equal.\n\nWait, but in the case where the two paths are equal, like in square, it's still the longer path.\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the longer path between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, in code, for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the longer of the two possible paths from v1 to v3.\n\nSo, regardless of where v2 is, the intercepted arc is the longer path.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because sometimes the longer path may include v2.\n\nWait, no. Because the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2.\n\nAh, right. So, the intercepted arc is the longer path between v1 and v3, but only if that path doesn't include v2. Otherwise, the intercepted arc is the shorter path.\n\nWait, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the longer path between v1 and v3 if that path doesn't include v2. Otherwise, it's the shorter path.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the longer path between v1 and v3 only if v2 is not on the longer path.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to realize that for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the longer path between v1 and v3, provided that this longer path does not include v2. Otherwise, the intercepted arc is the shorter path.\n\nSo, for each triplet, compute both possible paths from v1 to v3.\n\nIf the longer path does not include v2, then that is the intercepted arc.\n\nOtherwise, the shorter path is the intercepted arc.\n\nSo, how to determine whether the longer path includes v2.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute the intercepted arc is:\n\nCompute the two possible paths from v1 to v3:\n\npath1: clockwise, length d1 steps.\n\npath2: counter-clockwise, length d2 steps.\n\nwhere d1 + d2 = n.\n\nIf the longer path (max(d1, d2)) does not include v2, then that is the intercepted arc.\n\nOtherwise, the shorter path is the intercepted arc.\n\nBut how to determine if the longer path includes v2.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given triplet (v1, v2, v3), the longer path between v1 and v3 includes v2 if and only if v2 is on the path from v1 to v3 in that direction.\n\nSo, for path1 (clockwise), whether v2 is on the path from v1 to v3.\n\nSimilarly for path2.\n\nSo, for path1 (d1 steps), the path is v1, v1+1, ..., v1 + d1-1 mod n.\n\nSo, if v2 is in this sequence, then path1 includes v2.\n\nSame for path2.\n\nSo, for the triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute:\n\nd1 = (v3 - v1) % n\n\npath1 includes v2 if (v2 is in the path from v1 to v3 in the clockwise direction).\n\nSimilarly, d2 = (v1 - v3) % n.\n\npath2 includes v2 if (v2 is in the path from v1 to v3 in the counter-clockwise direction).\n\nWait, perhaps for path1, the condition is:\n\nif v1 <= v2 <= v3 when considering the polygon as a circular arrangement.\n\nBut that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, for path1, which is the clockwise path from v1 to v3, the condition is:\n\n(v2 - v1) % n <= d1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for path1 (d1 steps), v2 is on path1 if (v2 is in the set {v1, v1+1, ..., v3} in the circular arrangement).\n\nWhich can be checked by:\n\nif (v2 > v1 and v2 <= v3) or (v2 < v1 and v2 >= v3), when considering the circular nature.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think numerically.\n\nSuppose n=5.\n\nv1=1, v3=4.\n\npath1 is 1→2→3→4 (d1=3 steps).\n\npath2 is 1→5→4 (d2=2 steps).\n\nFor v2=2, is 2 on path1? Yes.\n\nFor v2=5, is 5 on path1? No.\n\nFor v2=3, is 3 on path1? Yes.\n\nSo, for the triplet (1,2,4), the longer path (path1, d1=3) includes v2=2. So, the intercepted arc is the shorter path (d2=2 steps). So, k=2.\n\nBut earlier calculation suggested that for this triplet, the angle is 108 degrees, which is (3 * 72)/2.\n\nWait, now I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the longer path if it doesn't include v2, else the shorter path.\n\nSo, for triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\ncompute d1 and d2 as before.\n\nif the longer path (max(d1, d2)) does not include v2, then intercepted arc is longer path.\n\nelse, intercepted arc is shorter path.\n\nSo, for the triplet (1,2,4) in n=5:\n\nlonger path is 3 steps (path1). Does it include v2=2? Yes. So, intercepted arc is the shorter path (2 steps). So, k=2. So, angle is (2 * 72)/2=72 degrees.\n\nBut earlier calculation said the angle was 108 degrees. So, conflicting results.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the example.\n\nLet me re-calculate for triplet (1,2,4) in n=5.\n\nv1=1, v2=2, v3=4.\n\nWhat is the angle at v2=2?\n\nThe inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc.\n\nThe intercepted arc is the arc between 1 and 4 that does not include 2.\n\nSo, the arc from 1 to 4 not including 2 is the one that goes through 5, which is 2 steps (1→5→4). So, the intercepted arc is 2 steps. So, k=2. So angle is (2*72)/2=72 degrees.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought the angle was 108, I must have been wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous analysis.\n\nSo, in that case, the code condition is:\n\nintercepted_arc_steps = min(d1, d2) if v2 is on the longer path, else max(d1, d2).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to always compute the intercepted arc as the longer path if it doesn't include v2, else the shorter path.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the longer of the two possible paths, unless the longer path includes v2, in which case the intercepted arc is the shorter path.\n\nSo, for each triplet, compute:\n\nd1 = (v3 - v1) % n\n\nd2 = (v1 - v3) % n\n\nif d1 > d2:\n\n    path1 = d1\n\n    path2 = d2\n\nelse:\n\n    path1 = d2\n\n    path2 = d1\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the longer of the two possible paths between v1 and v3, but only if that longer path doesn't include v2. Otherwise, it's the shorter path.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nd1 = (v3 - v1) % n\n\nd2 = (v1 - v3) % n\n\nif d1 > d2:\n\n    long_path = d1\n\n    short_path = d2\n\nelse:\n\n    long_path = d2\n\n    short_path = d1\n\n# Now, check if v2 is on the long_path.\n\nif v2 is on the long_path:\n\n    intercepted_arc = short_path\n\nelse:\n\n    intercepted_arc = long_path\n\nSo,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the angles formed by triplets of vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires identifying three vertices v1, v2, v3 in a regular polygon such that the angle at v2 is closest to 'a'. The angle at v2 is determined by the arc opposite to it on the circumscribed circle of the polygon.\n2. **Geometric Insight**: In a regular polygon, each vertex lies on a circle. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. The intercepted arc is the one that does not include v2.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3) ensuring they are distinct.\n   - For each triplet, compute the minimal and maximal steps between v1 and v3.\n   - Determine if the maximal step path includes v2. If it does, the intercepted arc is the minimal step path; otherwise, it is the maximal step path.\n   - Calculate the angle using the intercepted arc and track the triplet with the smallest absolute difference from 'a'.\n4. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (n up to 105), iterating over all possible triplets is feasible as the number of triplets is manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_triplet = []\n    \n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        for v1 in range(1, n+1):\n            if v1 == v2:\n                continue\n            for v3 in range(1, n+1):\n                if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1:\n                    continue\n                # Compute the distances\n                d1 = (v3 - v1) % n\n                d2 = (v1 - v3) % n\n                if d1 > d2:\n                    long_path = d1\n                    short_path = d2\n                else:\n                    long_path = d2\n                    short_path = d1\n                \n                # Check if v2 is on the long path\n                if (v2 - v1) % n <= long_path and (v3 - v2) % n <= long_path:\n                    # v2 is on the long path\n                    intercepted_arc = short_path\n                else:\n                    intercepted_arc = long_path\n                \n                # Calculate the angle\n                angle = (intercepted_arc * 180.0) / n\n                diff = abs(angle - a)\n                \n                if diff < min_diff:\n                    min_diff = diff\n                    best_triplet = [v1, v2, v3]\n                elif diff == min_diff:\n                    # Choose the first encountered\n                    if best_triplet == []:\n                        best_triplet = [v1, v2, v3]\n    \n    # Ensure the triplet is in the correct order\n    best_triplet.sort()\n    print(f\"{best_triplet[0]} {best_triplet[1]} {best_triplet[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code iterates through all possible triplets of vertices (v1, v2, v3) in the regular polygon. For each triplet, it calculates the minimal and maximal paths between v1 and v3. It then determines the intercepted arc based on whether v2 lies on the maximal path. The angle at v2 is computed and compared to 'a' to find the closest match. The triplet with the smallest difference is selected and printed in the required format.
