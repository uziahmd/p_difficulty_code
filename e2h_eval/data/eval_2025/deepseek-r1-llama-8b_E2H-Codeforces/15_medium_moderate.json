They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The way the games are structured is important. In each phase, the teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc., and the winners proceed to the next phase. \n\nThe key part is that the string s represents the outcome of each phase. For each character in s:\n- If s_i is '0', then in that phase, each match is won by the lower-skilled team.\n- If s_i is '1', each match is won by the higher-skilled team.\n\nWe need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p of skills where team x can win the entire tournament.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about determining which positions x could be the overall winner, considering the specific rules of each phase based on the string s.\n\nFirst, let's think about what determines whether a team can win. Each phase imposes certain constraints on the possible winners. For example, if in phase i, the matches are determined by lower skill (s_i=0), then the winners of each match must be the lower-skilled teams among their pair. This affects the structure of possible winners in the next phases.\n\nWait, but the initial pairing is fixed: the first phase pairs 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. So the initial matchups are determined by the team indices. But since the permutation p can arrange the skills in any order, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the required properties for each position in the permutation.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this recursively. Let's think about how each phase affects the possible winners.\n\nEach phase corresponds to a certain level of the tournament. For example, phase 1 is the first round with 2^{n-1} games, phase 2 has 2^{n-2} games, and so on until phase n has 1 game.\n\nFor each phase i, the number of games is 2^{n-i}. The way the matches are set up is that in phase i, the winners from phase i-1 are grouped into pairs, and each pair plays.\n\nWait no, perhaps not exactly. Because after phase 1, 2^{n-1} teams remain. Then phase 2 groups them into 2^{n-2} games, which is 2^{n-1}/2 games. So each phase i has 2^{n-i} games, each reducing the number of teams by half.\n\nSo for each phase, the teams are divided into groups of size 2^{i}, and each group forms a match. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nNo, wait: the initial phase (phase 1) has 2^{n} teams. They are split into 2^{n-1} games, each with two teams. The winners go to phase 2.\n\nPhase 2 has 2^{n-1} teams, which are split into 2^{n-2} games. Each game is between two teams from phase 1's winners. And so on.\n\nSo phase i has 2^{n - i} games, and each game in phase i is between two teams that were winners of sub-games in phase i-1.\n\nBut the way they're paired depends on the previous phase's winners. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure can be represented as a binary tree. Each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match that determines the champion.\n\nSo for n=3, the tournament structure would have 7 matches (since 2^3 -1=7). The first phase has 4 matches (round 1), then 2 matches in round 2, then 1 match in round 3.\n\nEach match in a phase is determined by the outcomes of the previous phase's matches.\n\nWait, but the way the teams are paired in each phase is crucial. For example, in phase 1, the teams are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8. Then, the winners of these four matches form the next phase's participants. These four are then paired as (winner1 vs winner2), (winner3 vs winner4), etc. So the structure is a binary tree where each internal node represents a match, and its children are the matches that fed into it.\n\nSo for each phase, the structure is determined by the grouping of the winners from the previous phase into consecutive pairs.\n\nThis suggests that the initial pairing is fixed, but the way the winners are arranged in each phase can vary based on the outcomes of the previous matches.\n\nBut the problem gives us the string s, which tells us for each phase i whether the winners are the lower-skilled or higher-skilled teams in each match of that phase.\n\nSo, for each phase i, depending on s[i], the selection of the winners is either the lower or higher skilled of each pair in that phase.\n\nTherefore, for each phase, the way the winners are chosen depends on s[i].\n\nNow, the question is, given the string s, which determines for each phase whether each match's winner is the lower or higher skilled, can a particular team x become the overall champion?\n\nI think the approach is to model the constraints imposed by each phase on the relative strengths of the teams.\n\nWait, but the permutation p can be arbitrary, except that each team's skill is unique. So, perhaps the problem reduces to determining, for each x, whether there exists a permutation p where x can reach the top by satisfying all the phase constraints.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me consider that each phase imposes certain conditions on the possible maximum or minimum in certain subsets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using a binary decision tree, tracking for each possible subset of teams what constraints are needed for a particular team to be the overall winner.\n\nBut for n=18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable, but perhaps not directly applicable.\n\nWait, another idea: since the tournament structure is a binary elimination tree, each match in each phase corresponds to a certain subset of the initial teams. The path from a leaf (initial team) to the root (champion) defines the progression through the tournament.\n\nFor a team x to win, it must win all its matches in every phase. Each match depends on the current phase's rule (s[i]) and the pairing in that phase.\n\nWait, but the pairings in each phase depend on the outcomes of the previous phase's matches. So the structure of the tournament's matches isn't fixed; it depends on which teams win in each phase.\n\nThis makes it challenging because the pairings in later phases are determined by the winners of earlier phases, which in turn depend on the permutation p.\n\nHmm. So perhaps for each team x, we can model the constraints that x must satisfy to reach the final, considering the rules of each phase it must pass through.\n\nAlternatively, think of it in terms of layers. Each phase i corresponds to a certain level in the tournament tree. For a team to survive each layer, it must meet the conditions imposed by that phase's rules.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the problem as a series of constraints on the permutation p.\n\nEach phase i will impose certain constraints on the relative ordering of the teams that end up in that phase's matches.\n\nFor example, phase 1: each match is either low-skill wins or high-skill wins.\n\nIf s[0] is '0', then each pair in phase 1 must have the lower-skilled team win. So in each pair (a, b), a < b must be the winner.\n\nThus, for phase 1, the winners are the lower-skilled in each pair.\n\nSimilarly, if s[0] is '1', each pair's winner is the higher-skilled.\n\nThen, for phase 2, the winners from phase 1 are grouped into pairs again, and the same applies based on s[1].\n\nWait, but the groupings into pairs for phase 2 depend on the order of the winners from phase 1.\n\nWait, perhaps this can be modeled as a binary heap-like structure, where each phase's pairings are determined by the previous phase's winners' order.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the possible ranges of team numbers that can reach each phase's winners, considering the phase's rules.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, we can compute the set of possible teams that can be in the winners of that phase, given the rules of the previous phases.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think recursively. For the first phase, phase 0 (assuming 0-based), the rules are s[0]. The teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2^k-1, 2^k), where k = 2^(n-1) / 2. Wait, no, 2^n teams are split into 2^{n-1} matches, each consisting of two consecutive teams.\n\nWait, for phase i (starting from 0), the number of games is 2^{n - i - 1}.\n\nWait, no, wait. For example, n=3:\n\nPhase 0: 3 games? No, wait n=3, 2^3=8 teams. Phase 0 is the first phase, with 4 games (since 8/2=4). Then phase 1 has 2 games, phase 2 has 1 game.\n\nSo for phase i, the number of games is 2^{n - i -1}.\n\nSo for i-th phase (starting from 0), the number of games is 2^{n - i -1}, and the number of teams remaining is 2^{n - i}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the phases starting from 0 to n-1, where phase 0 is the first phase.\n\nIn any case, the main point is that each phase's winners are determined by the rules s[i], and the way they are paired depends on the previous phase's winners.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the winners from phase i-1 are grouped into consecutive pairs, and each pair plays. The way they are grouped depends on the previous phase's winners' order.\n\nBut since the permutation p can arrange the skills in any way, perhaps the key is to model the necessary conditions for a team x to be the maximum in certain subtrees.\n\nWait, maybe for each phase i, the set of possible winners can be represented as a certain range or condition on the permutation p.\n\nAnother angle: for a team x to be the champion, it must win all the matches it plays in each phase. Each match depends on the phase's rule and the pair it's in.\n\nBut the pairings in each phase are determined by the previous phase's winners. So the path a team takes through the tournament is determined by the outcomes of the previous matches.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe instead of thinking about the exact pairings, we can model for each phase i, the constraints on the relative ordering of the teams that end up in the same sub-tree as x.\n\nWait, perhaps each phase i imposes that within a certain subset of the teams, a particular ordering must hold based on s[i].\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the winners are selected in a way that depends on s[i], and the selection affects the possible maximums in the next phase.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each phase i, the teams that make it to the next phase are either the lower-skilled or higher-skilled in each of their matches in phase i, depending on s[i]. Therefore, for each phase i, the set of possible winners is constrained by the s[i] value.\n\nMoreover, the way the winners are grouped into pairs in phase i+1 depends on the order of the winners from phase i.\n\nWait, maybe for each phase, we can model the possible groupings of the winners and the constraints they impose.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to model the problem as building a binary tree where each non-leaf node represents a match in some phase, and the leaves are the initial teams. Then, for each match, depending on s[i], the winner must be either the higher or lower-skilled team in that pair.\n\nBut the issue is that the structure of the tournament tree is determined by the initial pairings and the outcomes of each match.\n\nWait, but the initial pairings are fixed. Like, in phase 0, the initial matches are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, etc. The winners of these proceed to phase 1, which are then paired as (winner1 of 1v2) vs (winner2 of 3v4), (winner3 of 5v6) vs (winner4 of 7v8), etc.\n\nSo the structure of the tournament is a fixed binary tree, with the initial leaves being the teams 1..2^n, and each internal node representing a match in some phase.\n\nTherefore, the tournament can be represented as a fixed binary tree, where each node's children are the two matches that feed into it.\n\nSo, for n=3, the tree would have 7 nodes. The leaves are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The root is the final match.\n\nEach internal node has two children, which are the matches that produced the two teams playing in that match.\n\nSo, for phase i, the matches are the ones at depth i in the tournament tree.\n\nEach match is associated with a phase and a rule (s[j], where j is the phase index).\n\nWait, for each match, the phase it belongs to is determined by its depth in the tournament tree. Because phase 0 is the first phase (leaves are phase 0?), or maybe phase 0 is the deepest.\n\nWait, perhaps the phase index is the depth of the tournament tree. Or perhaps it's the reverse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps phase 0 is the first phase, which is the initial matches (phase 0 has 2^{n-1} matches), and each subsequent phase increases the depth.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the tournament tree with each match in a certain phase, and for each match, determine whether it requires the winner to be the higher or lower skilled based on s.\n\nWait, but how do we map the string s to the phases and the corresponding matches?\n\nEach character in s corresponds to a phase. The first phase (phase 0) has 2^{n-1} matches, then phase 1 has 2^{n-2} matches, etc., until phase n-1 has 1 match.\n\nEach match in phase i is part of a larger structure where the winners of phase i's matches go into phase i+1's matches.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the matches are in groups of 2^{i} teams, which are split into 2^{i-1} matches, each of which is a pair of consecutive winners from phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the matches are formed by grouping the winners from phase i-1 into consecutive pairs, and each pair plays in phase i.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Start with 2^n teams.\n\n- Phase 0: split into 2^{n-1} matches, each being a pair of consecutive teams. Winners are determined by s[0].\n\n- Phase 1: take the 2^{n-1} winners and split into 2^{n-2} matches, each consisting of two consecutive winners from phase 0. Again, winners are determined by s[1].\n\n- Continue until phase n-1, which has only one match.\n\nEach phase i is determined by s[i], and each match in phase i contributes to the next phase.\n\nSo, for each match in phase i, the two teams in that match are consecutive in the list of phase i-1's winners.\n\nTherefore, the tournament tree can be viewed as a binary tree where each internal node corresponds to a match, and the leaves are the initial teams.\n\nEach match in the tree is associated with a phase, and the rule for that phase (s[i]) determines whether the winner is the higher or lower skilled.\n\nSo, for a team x to be the champion, it must win all the matches along the path from the leaf x to the root of the tree.\n\nEach match along this path is determined by the phase it's in, which in turn determines whether x must be the higher or lower skilled than its opponent in that match.\n\nWait, yes! That's a crucial insight. For each match that x participates in, we can determine whether x must be higher or lower than its opponent. Because the phase determines the rule.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the match that x is involved in at phase i must satisfy the condition based on s[i].\n\nTherefore, to model this, we can represent the tournament as a binary tree, and for each match (node) in the tree, we can note whether it's a '0' or '1' phase. Then, for a team x, we can trace the path from x's leaf to the root, collecting the required conditions on the other teams in each match.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because for each match in the path, the other team is determined by the structure of the tournament tree.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree, noting for each match (node) which phase it belongs to and whether it's a '0' or '1' phase.\n\n2. For each team x, traverse the path from x to the root. For each match in this path, determine whether x must be greater or less than the opponent in that match, based on the phase's rule.\n\n3. Collect all such constraints. Then, check if there's a permutation p that satisfies all these constraints, with x as the champion.\n\nBut how do we represent the constraints for x?\n\nEach constraint is that in a certain match, x must be > or < than another team y.\n\nThese constraints form a directed graph where edges represent \"must be less than\" or \"must be greater than\". For x to be a valid champion, this graph must be consistent, i.e., there must be no cycles, and all constraints must be compatible.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all possibilities because the permutation p can arrange the teams in any way, as long as all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking whether for each x, the constraints derived from the tournament structure and the string s are satisfiable.\n\nBut how to represent and check this?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each x, we can model the required constraints as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is a team, and edges represent the required ordering (x must be > or < than another team y). Then, for each x, we need to see if such a DAG is possible, meaning that the constraints can be satisfied without contradictions.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently for all x?\n\nAnother idea: for each x, the constraints can be represented as a series of inequalities. For example, in a match where x is the winner and the phase is '1', x must be greater than the other team in that match. Similarly, if the phase is '0' and x is the winner, x must be less than the other team.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, all the constraints from all the matches along its path must be satisfied.\n\nBut the other teams in those matches are determined by the structure of the tournament tree.\n\nWait, for example, in the first phase, x is paired with another team y. Suppose s[0] is '1'; then x must be greater than y. Then, in the next phase, x is paired with another team z, who is the winner of a different initial pair. The phase's rule s[1] determines whether x must be greater or less than z.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, the permutation p must arrange the teams such that all these conditions are met.\n\nBut how to model this for all x?\n\nPerhaps, for each x, we can collect all the required inequalities that x must satisfy with other teams, based on the phases and the structure of the tournament tree.\n\nOnce we have these inequalities, the question becomes: is there a permutation p where x is the maximum, and all the inequalities are satisfied.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. The permutation p can have any arrangement, but the constraints must be satisfied.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, the constraints can be seen as a partial order, and we need to check if this partial order is compatible with x being the maximum in the permutation.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints form a DAG, and for x to be the maximum, it must be that all the constraints are satisfied, and x is above all other nodes in the DAG.\n\nWait, but the DAG may include other nodes beyond the ones on x's path. Because in each match, the other team is part of the constraints.\n\nWait, no, because for each match that x participates in, the other team is determined by the structure of the tournament tree. So, the constraints only involve x and the other teams in x's matches.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because x's opponents in each match are determined by the tournament structure. So, the constraints are only between x and those opponents.\n\nTherefore, for x to be a possible winner, the constraints must be such that x can be placed above all the opponents in their respective matches, according to the phase rules.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, we can collect all the other teams that x must be greater than or less than, based on the phases and the structure.\n\nThen, the question is whether x can be the maximum in the permutation, with all these constraints.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as a binary decision tree, where each phase imposes a certain condition on the winner of that match.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient approach is to model for each x, the set of required inequalities, and then check if it's possible to arrange the permutation p such that all inequalities are satisfied, and x is the maximum.\n\nWait, but for large n, this could be computationally intensive.\n\nBut n is up to 18, which implies 2^18 = 262144 teams. For each x, we need to collect O(n) constraints, so for 262k x 18 = around 4.7 million operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to represent the constraints?\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can collect a set of other teams that x must be either higher or lower than, based on the phase rules in their matches.\n\nOnce we have these constraints, we can model them as a graph where edges represent 'must be higher than' or 'must be lower than' relationships. Then, we can check if this graph is a DAG and whether x can be the maximum.\n\nBut wait, even if the graph is a DAG, there's no guarantee that x can be the maximum. For example, if x must be lower than some team y, but y must be lower than x, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, but if the constraints form a DAG, and x is the maximum, then all other constraints must be compatible.\n\nSo, the steps for each x are:\n\n1. Traverse the path from x to the root of the tournament tree.\n\n2. For each match in this path, note the phase rule (s[i]) and the other team involved in the match.\n\n3. For each such match, add a constraint that x must be either greater than or less than the other team, based on the phase rule.\n\n4. After collecting all constraints, check whether it's possible to arrange the permutation such that x is the maximum and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the tournament tree structure. For each team x, the path from x to the root is a sequence of matches, each in a certain phase. Each match has a rule (s[i]) that determines whether x must be higher or lower than the other team in that match.\n\nSo, for each x, we can perform a BFS or DFS to collect all the required constraints.\n\nBut building the tournament tree is essential.\n\nSo, the first step is to build the tournament tree.\n\nBuilding the tournament tree:\n\nEach internal node represents a match. The leaves are the teams 1..2^n.\n\nEach match has two children, which are the two matches that precede it.\n\nWait, no. Each internal node has two children, which are the matches that played before this one. So, the structure is a binary tree where each node is a match, and each node has two children (the two matches that produced the two teams playing in this match).\n\nSo, for example, in phase 0, the matches are leaves, and each has two children in phase 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the root is the final match, which is in phase n-1.\n\nSo, to build the tournament tree:\n\n- The initial matches (phase 0) are leaves, each consisting of two consecutive teams.\n\n- Each match in phase i has two children: the two matches in phase i-1 that produced the teams in this match.\n\nBut how to build this structure for a given n?\n\nLet me think about how to construct the tree.\n\nFor example, n=3:\n\nTeams: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nPhase 0: 4 matches:\n\n- Match 1: 1v2 → winner goes to phase 1, match A.\n\n- Match 2: 3v4 → winner goes to phase 1, match B.\n\n- Match 3: 5v6 → winner goes to phase 1, match C.\n\n- Match 4: 7v8 → winner goes to phase 1, match D.\n\nPhase 1: 2 matches:\n\n- Match A: winner of 1v2 vs winner of 3v4 → winner goes to phase 2, match E.\n\n- Match C: winner of 5v6 vs winner of 7v8 → winner goes to phase 2, match F.\n\nPhase 2: 1 match:\n\n- Match E vs F → winner is champion.\n\nSo, the tournament tree has 7 nodes: 4 leaves (phase 0), 4 internal nodes (phase 1), and 1 root (phase 2).\n\nEach match in phase i has two children in phase i-1.\n\nSo, for a general n, the tournament tree can be built recursively.\n\nBut how to generate this structure programmatically.\n\nHmm. One way is to represent each match as a node, with left and right children indicating the two matches that produced the participants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a binary heap-like representation, where each node has a left and right child.\n\nBut the challenge is to build this tree for any given n.\n\nWait, perhaps a recursive function can be used. For a given level i (starting from 0), the number of matches is 2^{n-i-1}.\n\nBut for n=18, this would require 2^18 levels, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a list to represent the matches, and for each match in a phase, determine the two matches in the previous phase that it comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match in phase i, the two matches in phase i-1 are the previous matches that resulted in the two teams playing in this match.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the matches as being grouped into blocks. For phase i, the matches are formed by taking the winners of phase i-1 in groups of two consecutive matches, and forming a new match between them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the matches as a list, where each match is identified by an index. Then, for phase i, the matches are formed by combining pairs of the previous phase's matches.\n\nWait, but for n=3, phase 0 has 4 matches (indices 0-3), phase 1 has 2 matches (indices 4-5), and phase 2 has 1 match (index 6).\n\nSo, for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n - i - 1}.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the matches can be generated by taking the winners from phase i-1, which are 2^{n - i} teams, and grouping them into 2^{n - i -1} matches, each consisting of two consecutive winners.\n\nThus, for phase i, the k-th match (0-based) is formed by the winners from phase i-1's matches 2k and 2k+1.\n\nSo, for example, in phase i=1, the first match is formed by the winners of phase 0's matches 0 and 1. The second match is formed by the winners of phase 0's matches 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For phase i=0, the matches are leaves: each consists of two consecutive teams.\n\n- For phase i>0, each match is formed by taking two consecutive matches from phase i-1, and the winner of each is the participant in this match.\n\nThus, to build the tournament tree, we can represent each match as a node, with two children indicating the two matches that contribute to it.\n\nWait, but for our purposes, perhaps it's sufficient to model for each match, the two matches that contributed to it in the previous phase.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to build a data structure that, for each match, knows which two matches in the previous phase it came from.\n\nBut for n=18, this could result in 2^18 * 2^18 = 2^36 nodes, which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of building the entire tournament tree, which is impossible for n=18, perhaps we can model the constraints for each x without explicitly building the tree.\n\nEach x is in a certain position in the initial pairing. The path from x to the root is determined by the tournament structure.\n\nWait, but for n=18, each x can have a path of up to 18 phases, leading to log2(2^18) = 18 phases. So, for each x, the path is O(18) steps.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, we can simulate the path from x to the root, collecting the necessary constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach is to realize that for each x, the constraints are determined by the initial matches it participates in, and the phase rules.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the constraints are based on the initial phase 0 match, then phase 1, etc.\n\nWait, but the initial phase 0 is just x's own initial match. Then, the next phase depends on the winner of that match, which is x, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, the path can be simulated by following the tournament structure, determining for each phase what the other team is, and thus what the constraint is.\n\nBut how to model the other team in each phase's match.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can represent the path through the tournament as a linked list, where each node is the other team in the match for that phase.\n\nBut again, for n=18, this could be manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each team x, the list of constraints it must satisfy in each phase along its path to the root.\n\n2. For each x, collect all the constraints (y > x or y < x) for each y encountered in the path.\n\n3. Check if these constraints can be satisfied in a permutation, with x being the maximum.\n\nBut how to precompute the list of constraints for each x.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can simulate the path from x to the root, gathering the required constraints.\n\nTo do this, for each x, we can keep track of the current match's other participant and the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but the other participant depends on the structure of the tournament tree, which we don't have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, the path is determined by the initial matches, and each phase's match is determined by the previous phase's match.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is similar to a binary trie, where each step in the phase corresponds to a bit choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the path for each x by simulating the process of winning each match, choosing the necessary constraints based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, let's think about how a team progresses through the tournament.\n\nEach time a team wins a match, it proceeds to the next phase, where it is paired with another team that also won a match in the previous phase.\n\nThe way the pairings are done is by grouping the previous phase's winners into consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, for phase i, the matches are formed by taking the winners of phase i-1's matches in consecutive pairs.\n\nThus, for x, the first match is phase 0, which is against the next team (like 2, if x is 1). Then, if x wins, in phase 1, it is paired against the winner of match 2 (teams 3 and 4). Then, if x wins again, in phase 2, it is paired against the winner of match 4 (teams 5 and 6), and so on.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nYes. Because in phase 0, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8, etc.\n\nSo, if x is 1, it's in the first match. If it wins, in phase 1, it's paired with the winner of match 2 (3v4), which is the next available match.\n\nSo, the other participant in each phase's match is determined by the order of the previous phase's matches.\n\nThus, for each x, the path through the phases can be determined by considering the order of the matches.\n\nBut how to model this for any x.\n\nAnother Idea: For each x, the path through the phases can be determined by a series of binary choices. Each choice corresponds to the other team in the current phase's match.\n\nBut again, for n=18, this could be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, we can simulate the path through the phases, collecting the necessary constraints.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\nFor each x, simulate the path from x to the root of the tournament tree. For each phase i, determine which other team y is playing against x in that phase's match. Then, based on s[i], add a constraint that x must be > y or < y.\n\nHow to find y for each phase i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the other team y is determined by the way the matches are paired in the previous phase.\n\nBut without knowing the structure of the tournament tree, it's unclear how to find y.\n\nWait, perhaps for phase 0, the other team is x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\nWait, for x in 1..2^n:\n\nIn phase 0, x is paired with x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\nWait, for x=1: paired with 2.\n\nx=2: paired with 1.\n\nx=3: paired with 4.\n\nx=4: paired with 3.\n\nx=5: paired with 6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for phase i, the other team y is determined by the way the previous phase's matches are grouped.\n\nWait, but for phase i, the matches are formed by grouping the previous phase's winners into consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, for example, in phase 1, the matches are formed by the winners of phase 0's matches 0 and 1, 2 and 3, etc.\n\nThus, for x, after winning phase 0, it proceeds to phase 1, where it is paired with the winner of phase 0's match 1.\n\nWait, no. Because phase 0 has 2^{n-1} matches, which are 0 to 2^{n-1}-1.\n\nPhase 1 is formed by grouping phase 0's matches into consecutive pairs. So, for phase 1, the first match is phase 0's match 0 and 1, the second is 2 and 3, etc.\n\nSo, for x in phase 0's match 0 (if it wins), in phase 1, it is paired with the winner of phase 0's match 1.\n\nThus, to find y for phase i, we can model it as follows.\n\nLet me define for each phase i, the two matches in phase i-1 that produce the two participants.\n\nBut without knowing the structure of the tournament tree, this is difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the structure of the tournament tree is determined by the initial pairings, perhaps for each phase i, the other team y can be determined by looking at the previous phase's match.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the path through the phases can be represented as a list of other teams that x must face.\n\nBut how to compute this list.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the other teams in each phase can be determined by the initial structure.\n\nLet me think for x=1.\n\nPhase 0: plays 2.\n\nIf x wins, phase 1: plays the winner of phase 0 match 1 (3v4).\n\nIf x wins again, phase 2: plays the winner of phase 1's second match (which is the winner of phase 0's match 2 and 3, i.e., 3v4's winner and 5v6's winner).\n\nWait, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative Idea: Realize that for each x, the other teams in each phase are determined by the way the previous phase's matches are grouped. So, for each x, the other team in phase i is the winner of the match that is the next sibling in the phase i-1's match group.\n\nBut without knowing the structure, this is hard.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the key is that for each x, the other teams in each phase can be determined by the initial pairings, but I'm not seeing how.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the other team y can be determined by the initial index.\n\nLet's model the initial match index of x as m_0. Then, in phase 1, the other team is m_0 + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think for n=3.\n\nx=1: initial match is 0 (1v2).\n\nIn phase 1, the next match is match 1 (3v4). So, if x wins phase 0, it faces the winner of match 1.\n\nIn phase 2, the next match is match 2 (5v6) winner. Wait, no. For phase 1, the winners are matched as 0 and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which teams can win the tournament given the rules for each phase. The tournament is structured in a knockout style where each match eliminates one team until only one champion remains. The outcome of each phase is determined by a string `s`, where each character indicates whether the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins each match in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament can be represented as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams, and each internal node represents a match between the winners of two sub-matches from the previous phase.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule specified by the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins each match in that phase; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Path Constraints**: For each team, simulate the path from their leaf node to the root of the tournament tree. Collect constraints based on the phase rules, indicating whether the team must be higher or lower skilled than the opponent in each match along their path.\n4. **Check Feasibility**: For each team, check if the collected constraints can be satisfied in a permutation of skills, ensuring the team can be the maximum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    size = 1 << n\n    tree = [[] for _ in range( (1 << (n+1)) )]  # Using 1-based indexing\n    \n    # Build the tournament tree\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_phase = i\n        next_phase = i + 1\n        num_matches_prev = 1 << (n - i - 1)\n        num_matches_current = 1 << (n - i - 2) if i < n-1 else 1\n        for j in range(num_matches_current):\n            left_match = 2 * j\n            right_match = 2 * j + 1\n            tree[next_phase].append( (left_match, right_match) )\n    \n    # Precompute for each x, the list of (y, relation) where relation is 0 (x > y) or 1 (x < y)\n    constraints = [ [] for _ in range(size + 1) ]  # 1-based\n    \n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        current_match = 0\n        current_phase = 0\n        while True:\n            if current_phase >= n:\n                break\n            # Determine the other match in the current phase\n            if current_phase == 0:\n                # Phase 0: matches are consecutive pairs\n                other_match = current_match + 1\n            else:\n                # For phase i, the current_match's parent is determined by grouping the previous matches\n                # This part is more complex, but for our problem, we can model it as the next match in the group\n                # However, without building the full tree, it's tricky.
