    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing certain swap operations. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. So, for example, you can swap '01' to get '10', but you can't swap '02' or '20'.\n\nHmm, right. So what does that mean for the arrangement of the characters? Well, let's think about the ordering possibilities.\n\nWait, in terms of lex order, '0' is smaller than '1', which is smaller than '2'. So to get the smallest possible string, we want as many '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nBut the constraints on swapping limit how we can rearrange the string. So, the key is figuring out how the allowed swaps affect the relative positions of each character.\n\nLet me break down the allowed swaps:\n\n- '0' can be swapped with '1' if they're adjacent.\n- '1' can be swapped with '2' if they're adjacent.\n\nSo, any '0' can be moved past '1's by a series of adjacent swaps. Similarly, any '1' can be moved past '2's, but '0's can't move past '2's directly. Wait, no—wait: because a '0' can't be swapped with a '2' since that's not allowed. So, the only way a '0' can move past a '2' is if there's a '1' in between them, allowing the '0' to swap with the '1's to get around.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because suppose we have '0 2 1'. Can the '0' move to the right past the '2'? No, because the '0' and '2' are not adjacent. But perhaps via other swaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '0's can only be reordered among themselves and '1's can only be reordered among themselves, but '0's can't cross '2's unless there's a path through '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the allowed swaps mean that within the entire string, '0's can be arranged in any order relative to each other, but cannot pass through '2's. Similarly, '1's can arrange among themselves and also can pass through '0's, but can't go past '2's unless they're part of the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is that '0's can only be swapped with '1's, and '1's can be swapped with '2's. So, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, except when they can be separated by '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed. Because without a '1' between them, you can't swap them. So, for example, if a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, and there are no '1's between them, then the '0' cannot move past the '2'. But if there are '1's between them, perhaps the '0' can move left or right by swapping with '1's, thereby possibly passing the '2's.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nLet me think about the allowed swaps as defining some equivalence classes or ordering constraints.\n\nFor any two '0's, they can be swapped past each other using a series of '0'-'1' swaps. Similarly, any two '1's can be swapped past each other directly. For '1's and '2's, same thing. But '0's and '2's can't be swapped directly, so their relative order depends on whether there's a '1' between them that allows them to move around.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows: the '0's can be reordered among themselves, and the '1's can be reordered among themselves, and the '2's can be reordered among themselves. But also, '0's can't appear after '2's unless they were originally in that position and there's no way to move around the '2's.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Because the '0's can move through '1's, but '1's can move through '2's. So, a '0' can potentially end up before a '2' if there's a '1' in between, because the '1's can move around the '2's, allowing the '0's to come before.\n\nWait, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's can be modified as long as there's a '1' somewhere in between. But if a '0' is before a '2' and there's no '1' in between",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each character type ('0', '1', '2') can be reordered among themselves, but with constraints:\n1. '0's can only be swapped with '1's.\n2. '1's can only be swapped with '2's.\n\nThis means:\n- '0's can be reordered relative to each other and can move past '1's.\n- '1's can be reordered relative to each other and can move past '2's.\n- '2's can be reordered relative to each other but cannot move past '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nGiven these constraints, the strategy is to group similar characters together as much as possible while respecting their relative order based on the allowed swaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_ternary_string(s):\n    # Count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    count = [0, 0, 0]\n    for c in s:\n        count[int(c)] += 1\n    \n    res = []\n    i = j = k = 0\n    while i < count[0] and j < count[1] and k < count[2]:\n        if count[0] < count[1]:\n            res.append('0')\n            i += 1\n        elif count[1] < count[2]:\n            res.append('1')\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            res.append('2')\n            k += 1\n    \n    # Handle remaining 0s\n    while i < count[0]:\n        res.append('0')\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Handle remaining 1s\n    while j < count[1]:\n        res.append('1')\n        j += 1\n    \n    # Handle remaining 2s\n    while k < count[2]:\n        res.append('2')\n        k += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(res)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(minimal_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Count Characters**: First, we count the occurrences of '0', '1', and '2' in the input string.\n2. **Construct Result String**: We then construct the result string by appending the smallest possible character at each step, considering the counts of each character type:\n   - Append '0' as long as there are more '0's than '1's and '2's.\n   - If '0's are exhausted, append '1' as long as there are more '1's than '2's.\n   - If both '0's and '1's are exhausted, append '2's.\n3. **Handle Remaining Characters**: After exhausting the initial counts, append the remaining characters of '0's, '1's, and '2's in their respective order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we create the lexicographically smallest string by leveraging the allowed swaps effectively.",
