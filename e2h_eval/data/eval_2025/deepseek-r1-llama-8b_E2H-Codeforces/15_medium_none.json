They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the tournament is a knockout style with 2^n teams. Each game eliminates one team, and the process continues until one champion remains. The way the games are structured is important. The string s represents the results of each phase. For each character in s, it tells us whether in that phase, the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWait, let me rephrase: s_i is 0 or 1. If s_i is 0, in the i-th phase, each match has the lower-skilled team win. So, for example, in the first phase (i=0?), the matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc. If s[0] is 0, then in each match, the team with lower p wins. So the winner is the smaller number. But wait, no—p is a permutation, so the numbers 1 to 2^n are assigned to the teams. So if s_i is 0, the lower-skilled (lower p) team wins, which would be the team with a lower number if the permutation is such that p[i] is ordered. Wait, no, because p is a permutation, so the actual skill levels can be in any order. Hmm, but perhaps the way the tournament progresses depends on the permutation.\n\nBut the problem is, given the string s, we need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nSo the task is to find all possible x where x can be the champion under some permutation p that satisfies the game conditions specified by s.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? It seems like a binary tournament tree, where each node represents a group of teams, and each match determines a winner based on the current phase's rule (s_i).\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. The tournament is organized in phases. The first phase has 2^(n-1) games, each pairing consecutive teams as per their initial positions. Then the winners of those games form the next round, and so on until the final phase (the nth phase) where only two teams compete, and the winner is the champion.\n\nEach phase corresponds to a certain level of the tournament tree. For phase i (starting from 0 or 1?), the number of games is 2^(n - i - 1). For example, if n=3, there are 3 phases:\n\n- Phase 0: 4 games (since 2^3-1 =7 games total)\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the total number of games is 2^n -1. For n=3, that's 7 games. So the phases are as follows:\n\n- Phase 1: 4 games (because 2^(3) -1 is 7, and the number of games per phase decreases as we go deeper)\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the phases starting from 0. Let me see:\n\nPhase 0 has 2^(n-1) games. Then phase 1 has 2^(n-2) games, and so on, until phase n-1 has 1 game.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\nPhase 0: 4 games → 2^(3-1) =4 → correct.\nPhase 1: 2 games → 2^(3-2)=2.\nPhase 2: 1 game → 2^(3-3)=1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nEach phase i corresponds to the ith step. For each phase i, the games are determined based on the current grouping of teams.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the number of games is 2^{(n - i -1)}.\n\nNow, for each phase i, the outcome depends on s[i]. So s has length n, and each character corresponds to a phase.\n\nThe problem is to find all x such that x can be the champion under some permutation p that satisfies the game outcomes as per s.\n\nHow to model this? It seems like a dynamic programming approach might work, tracking possible sets of teams that could reach each stage.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 18, which means 2^18 = 262,144 possible values for x. So for each x, we need to determine if it's possible for it to win the tournament under some permutation p.\n\nHmm, but considering all possible permutations is computationally impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a subset of teams that could potentially meet in the next round. For each round, depending on the phase's rule (s[i]), the subsets are merged according to the rule.\n\nWait, maybe that's the key. Let's think recursively. For each phase, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winners proceed. So the structure is similar to a binary heap.\n\nFor phase i, the teams are arranged in groups of size 2^{i+1}, and each group is split into two halves, each of which becomes a subtree for the next phase.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the possible winners at each phase. For each phase, we can represent the possible winners as a set, and then for the next phase, these winners are paired in a certain way, and the rule s[i] determines how the winners are combined.\n\nSo, let's model this as follows:\n\nWe'll process each phase from 0 to n-1.\n\nAt each phase, the current set of possible winners is a collection of 2^k teams, where k is the number of rounds remaining. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, in phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i}.\n\nWait, no: after phase 0, the number of teams is 2^{n-1}.\n\nAfter phase 1, it's 2^{n-2}.\n\nAnd so on until phase n-1, where it's 1.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n-i}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent for each phase i, the possible teams that can be the winner at that phase.\n\nWait, but the structure of the tournament is such that each team must win all its matches up to the final. So, for x to be the champion, it must be able to win in every phase.\n\nSo perhaps we can model, for each phase, the constraints on the permutation p that x must satisfy.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible x, can we assign the permutation p such that x can reach the top by winning each required match.\n\nBut since the permutation p is a bijection, each team's position affects which other teams it can face.\n\nWait, but the structure of the tournament dictates the order in which teams face each other. So for x to be the champion, it must be possible to arrange the permutation so that in every phase, x either defeats the necessary opponents as per the rules.\n\nSo perhaps for each phase i, we can determine the group of teams that x needs to be part of, and then see how the rules affect who can be the winner.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each non-leaf node is a game, and its children are the two matches that feed into it.\n\nSo, the root is the final game, whose children are the two semi-finals. Each of those has their own children, etc., down to the leaves, which are the initial matches.\n\nIn each game, the winner is determined based on the phase's rule. So for the root game (phase n-1), the rule is s[n-1]. For its children (phase n-2), the rule is s[n-2], and so on.\n\nWait, but how does the phase correspond to the depth of the tree?\n\nFor example, in a tournament with n=3, the tree has 3 levels:\n\nLevel 2: 4 games (phase 0)\nLevel 1: 2 games (phase 1)\nLevel 0: 1 game (phase 2)\n\nWait, perhaps the phase i corresponds to the level (depth) in the tournament tree. So for phase i, the rule is s[i], and the level is i.\n\nSo, for the root (champion), it's determined by the rule at level i = n-1.\n\nSo, for a given x, we need to determine whether it can be the root of this tree, under some permutation p.\n\nSo, the idea is to model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node (game), decide whether x can win that game, given the rule for that node's level and the structure of the tree.\n\nBut the structure of the tree is determined by the tournament's pairing method. So, the left and right subtrees of each node are determined by the initial pairing of the teams.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial arrangement is that in the first phase (phase 0), the teams are paired as 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, etc. Then, the winners of these form the next phase, which are paired again as 1v2 (winners of first pair), 3v4 (winners of second pair), etc. So the structure is fixed based on the initial order of the teams.\n\nThus, the tournament is a fixed binary tree structure, but the permutation p assigns the skills to the teams, determining which team ends up in which subtree.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n, so the initial order of the teams is fixed as per the permutation. Or wait, no: the permutation determines the skill levels, but the initial pairings are based on the team indices.\n\nWait, no. The initial pairings are always done in the order of the teams as per their numbering. So, the first phase consists of 1v2, 3v4, etc., regardless of their skill levels. The permutation p determines the skills, but the initial structure of the tournament (how teams are paired) is fixed.\n\nSo, the tournament is a fixed binary tree structure, and the permutation p assigns the skill levels to the nodes.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, the team corresponding to x must be able to win all the necessary matches in the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nBut the exact path depends on the permutation p. So, the problem reduces to finding all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the root, and in each of the matches along the path from x to the root, x wins according to the rules of the phase.\n\nWait, but the path isn't fixed because the structure is determined by the initial pairings. So, for example, in the first phase, x could be in any pair, depending on p.\n\nHmm, perhaps another way to model this is to consider that for each x, it can be placed anywhere in the tournament tree, and the way the tree is built must allow x to reach the root through the required match outcomes.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Maybe we can model the possible winners for each phase and propagate constraints based on the rules.\n\nLet me think about the process for each phase.\n\nIn phase i, the teams are grouped into 2^{n-i} / 2 = 2^{n-i-1} games. Each game's outcome depends on s[i].\n\nFor each phase i, the possible winners are constrained based on the previous phase's winners and the current rules.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, we can represent the possible winners as a set, and for each phase, we merge the possible winners based on the current rule.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each phase i, the teams are partitioned into groups of size 2^i, and each group is further divided into two halves. The winners from each half then meet in the next phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each phase, the possible subsets of teams that can reach the next phase, given the rule for that phase.\n\nSo, for phase i, the teams are in groups of 2^{i+1} teams, each of which is split into two groups of 2^i teams. These two groups play in the current phase, and their winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the teams are arranged in a certain way, and each pair in the current phase plays, with the winner moving on.\n\nHmm, but how to model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the structure of the tournament can be represented as a binary tree. Each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial matches. The internal nodes are the subsequent matches.\n\nEach non-leaf node has two children, which are the two matches that determine the winner for that node's game.\n\nSo, for each non-leaf node, the two children's winners play in this node's game.\n\nThe phase corresponds to the level of the node in the tree.\n\nSo, the root is the final game, which is phase n-1.\n\nEach child of the root is a game in phase n-2.\n\nAnd so on, down to the leaves, which are in phase 0.\n\nSo, for each node in the tree, the phase is determined by its level.\n\nThus, for a node at level l, the phase is n-1 - l.\n\nWait, for example, the root is at level 0, so phase is n-1.\n\nIts children are at level 1, phase n-2.\n\nLeaves are at level n-1, phase 0.\n\nSo, for each node, the phase is n-1 - l, where l is the level.\n\nNow, the rule for a node's game is determined by s[n-1 - l].\n\nSo, for the root, l=0, phase is n-1, rule s[n-1].\n\nFor a node at level 1, phase is n-2, rule s[n-2].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for each node in the tournament tree, the outcome of its game (who wins) is determined by the rule s[phase], where phase = n-1 - l.\n\nIf s[phase] is 0, the winner is the team with lower skill. If it's 1, the higher skill.\n\nSo, the goal is to assign the permutation p such that the team x can reach the root, winning all the necessary games along the path.\n\nBut since the permutation p defines the skills, the initial arrangement of the teams in the tournament tree will affect the path that x takes.\n\nWait, but the initial arrangement is fixed as per the team indices. So, the way the tournament tree is built is fixed, regardless of p.\n\nWait, no. Because the permutation p assigns the skills to the teams, but the initial pairings are based on the team indices. So, for example, team 1 is paired against team 2 in phase 0, regardless of their skills.\n\nBut the permutation p determines the skill levels, which affects which team wins each match.\n\nSo, the tournament's structure is fixed, but the skills determine which teams can proceed through each phase.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be possible to assign the skills in such a way that x can win all the required matches in the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each node in the tournament tree, we can model the constraints on the skills of the two teams that play in that node's game.\n\nFor example, if s[phase] is 1, then the higher-skilled team must win that game. So, the winner is the team with a higher p value.\n\nBut the winner must be x in the case where x is the champion.\n\nSo, for each node on the path from x's leaf to the root, we can model the constraints that x must be the winner, which depends on the rule of that node's phase.\n\nWait, but x's path depends on the permutation p. Because the way the teams are arranged in the tree depends on the initial pairings, which are based on their indices.\n\nWait, but the initial arrangement is fixed. For example, in phase 0, team 1 plays team 2, team 3 plays team 4, etc. So the structure of the tournament tree is fixed, regardless of p.\n\nSo, the path that x would take depends on the structure of the tree and the way the skills are arranged.\n\nBut in reality, the path is determined by the permutation p. Because the skills determine which teams win, which can cause the structure to change.\n\nWait, no. Because the tournament's pairings are fixed based on the team indices. So, the initial pairings are always 1v2, 3v4, etc., regardless of their skills. So, the structure of the tournament is a fixed binary tree, and the permutation p determines which teams are stronger, thus determining who wins each game.\n\nSo, the path that a particular team x takes to the root depends on the skills assigned by p, and the fixed tournament structure.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be possible to assign the permutation p such that x can reach the root, winning all necessary games, considering the rules for each phase.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to determining for each x whether there exists a permutation p where x can win all the games on the path from x's leaf to the root, given the fixed tournament structure.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree and, for each node, determine the possible winners based on the rules and the constraints imposed by the parent nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps a dynamic programming approach where for each node, we track the possible winners based on the current phase's rule.\n\nSo, for each node, the two children are the two matches that determine the winner for this node's game.\n\nEach child's possible winner must be such that when they meet in the parent node's game, the winner is consistent with the rule.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i, the rule is s[i], and the winner is determined by comparing the p values of the two children.\n\nSo, for each node, the winner must be the one that would have won according to the rule.\n\nWait, but the children's winners are determined by their own constraints.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winner is the result of the two children's winners being compared according to the rule.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute the possible winners based on the children's possible winners.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nWe can represent each node as a function that returns the possible winners for that node, given the current state of the children.\n\nFor a leaf node (which is a game in phase 0), the possible winners are just the single team that plays in that game. But wait, in phase 0, the teams are in pairs, and the winner proceeds. So for a leaf node, the winner is the team that comes out of that game.\n\nWait, perhaps the leaf nodes are the initial games. So, for each leaf node, the possible winner is either of the two teams in the game, depending on the rule for that phase.\n\nWait, no. Because the phase of the leaf node is phase 0, which is handled by s[0].\n\nSo, for each leaf node (a game in phase 0), the two teams in that game are known (based on their initial pairing in phase 0). The winner is determined by s[0]: if s[0] is 0, the lower-skilled team wins; else, the higher-skilled.\n\nThus, for each leaf node, the possible winner is either team A or team B, depending on the rule.\n\nWait, but for a given permutation p, each leaf node's winner is fixed. So, perhaps for the initial phase, the possible winners for each leaf are determined by the rule.\n\nThen, for the next phase (phase 1), each node is a game that combines two winners from phase 0.\n\nEach such node's winner is determined by the rule s[1], based on the two winners from phase 0.\n\nAnd so on, up to the root node.\n\nSo, the idea is to build this tree, and for each node, determine the possible winners based on the rules and the possible winners of the children.\n\nThis sounds like a recursive approach.\n\nSo, let's model this as a binary tree where each node has two children. The root is the final game. Each node's possible winners are determined by the children's possible winners and the rule for that node's phase.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the set of possible teams that can emerge as the winner of that node's game, given the possible winners of the children.\n\nWait, but for the root node, the possible winner is x if x can be the overall champion under some permutation p.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree structure, knowing that each node has two children, which are the two games that feed into it.\n\n2. For each node, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, compute the possible winners based on the children's possible winners and the rule for that node's phase.\n\n3. For the root node, collect all the possible winners and output them.\n\nBut how to represent the possible winners for each node?\n\nEach node's possible winners can be a set of integers (team IDs). For each node, the possible winners are the union of all possible combinations of the children's winners that satisfy the rule for that node's phase.\n\nFor example, for a node with phase i (s[i] is 0 or 1):\n\n- If s[i] is 0, the winner is the minimum of the two children's winners. So, for this node, the possible winners are all min(a, b) where a is a possible winner of the left child and b is a possible winner of the right child.\n\n- If s[i] is 1, the winner is the maximum of the two children's winners. So, possible winners are max(a, b) for all a and b in the left and right child's possible winners.\n\nSo, for each node, we can compute the possible winners as follows:\n\n- If the node is a leaf (phase 0), then the possible winners are determined by the initial game in phase 0. For example, if the game is between team A and team B, and s[0] is 0, then the possible winner is min(p[A], p[B]). But since p is a permutation, min(p[A], p[B]) can be either A or B. Wait, no: if s[0] is 0, then the winner is the one with lower p. So, if p[A] < p[B], A wins, else B.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, the outcome can vary based on p. So, for a leaf node, the possible winners depend on the permutation.\n\nWait, but in our case, we're trying to find if x can be the overall winner under some permutation p. So, for each node, we need to model the possible winners given the constraints of the permutation.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to represent for each node, the constraints on the permutation that would allow x to be the winner of that node.\n\nWait, but that might not be feasible due to the high dimensionality of the problem.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the tournament structure is fixed, the path that x must take is determined by the tournament tree. So, for x to be the champion, it must be able to win all the matches along the path from x's leaf to the root.\n\nThus, for each x, we can determine whether there exists a permutation p where x wins all required matches.\n\nSo, for each x, we can check if there's a way to assign the permutation p such that in every match along x's path, x wins according to the rule of that match's phase.\n\nWait, but how do we determine x's path? Because the permutation p determines the skill levels, which in turn determines the winners of each match, which can change the structure of the tournament.\n\nNo, wait. The tournament's structure (pairings) is fixed. The permutation p determines the skill levels, so for each match, the winner is determined by s[i] and the p values of the two teams in that match.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along the path from x's initial position to the root, given the fixed structure of the tournament.\n\nBut the initial position of x is determined by the permutation p. So, for example, x can be placed in any of the 2^n leaves of the tournament tree, depending on p.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the initial pairings are fixed based on the team indices. So, the structure of the tournament tree is fixed, but the permutation p assigns the skills, thus changing which team is placed where.\n\nWait, no. The tournament's initial pairings are based on the team indices, regardless of their skills. So, team 1 is always paired with team 2 in phase 0, team 3 with team 4, etc.\n\nThe permutation p assigns the skill levels to the teams, but the initial structure of the tournament (how they are paired) is fixed.\n\nSo, the tournament tree is fixed, but the skills determine which teams proceed through the rounds.\n\nThus, the path that x takes to become champion is determined by the structure of the tournament tree and the permutation p.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, there must exist a permutation p such that:\n\n- x wins all the matches in the path from x's leaf to the root.\n\nBut x's leaf depends on where x is placed in the initial structure.\n\nWait, but the initial structure is fixed. So, for example, in phase 0, team 1 is paired with 2, 3 with 4, etc. So, the leaves of the tournament tree are determined by the initial pairings.\n\nThus, x can be in any leaf of the tournament tree, depending on p. Because p determines which team is which, but the initial pairings are based on the team indices.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial pairings are based on the team indices. So, for example, team 1 is always paired with team 2, regardless of their skill levels.\n\nSo, the structure of the tournament tree is fixed, but the permutation p determines the skills of each team, which determines which teams win each match.\n\nThus, the path that x takes is determined by where x is placed in the tournament tree.\n\nWait, but how is x placed in the tournament tree? Because x is a team, and the initial pairings are based on the team indices. So, for example, x could be team 5, which is paired with team 6 in phase 0.\n\nSo, the structure of the tournament is fixed, but the permutation p determines which teams are strong enough to win.\n\nSo, the key is that for x to be the champion, there must exist a permutation p where x can reach the root of the tournament tree, winning all the required matches.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to model for each node in the tournament tree, the possible winner, considering the rule of that node's phase and the possible winners of the children.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node has two children. For each node, we compute the possible winners based on the children's possible winners and the rule for that node's phase.\n\nStarting from the leaves (phase 0), each leaf node's possible winners are determined by the initial pairing and the rule s[0].\n\nThen, for each parent node (higher phase), we combine the children's possible winners according to the rule s[i] for that phase.\n\nFinally, the root node's possible winners are the candidates for the champion.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree structure, with each node knowing its two children.\n\n2. For each leaf node (phase 0), compute the possible winners based on the initial pairing and s[0].\n\n3. For each non-leaf node, compute the possible winners based on the children's possible winners and the rule for that node's phase.\n\n4. The root node's possible winners are the answer.\n\nBut wait, the leaves are the initial games, which are the matches in phase 0. So, for each leaf node, the possible winners are the two teams that played in that match, and the rule s[0] determines which of them can be the winner.\n\nSo, for example, a leaf node in phase 0 (s[0] is '0') has possible winners as the team with the lower p value.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, the lower p could be either of the two teams in the match. So, for a leaf node, the possible winners are the two teams, but only one can actually win based on the rule.\n\nWait, no. Because the rule determines which of the two teams wins. For example, if the rule is 0, then the lower-skilled (lower p) team wins. So, for a given permutation p, the winner is determined. But for our problem, we need to find if there exists a permutation p where x is the overall winner, which includes x being the winner of all the matches along its path.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node, we need to track the possible winners under any permutation p that allows x to reach that node.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can represent the possible winners as a set of team IDs, considering that for the node's phase, the rule determines how the children's winners are combined.\n\nWait, here's a concrete example:\n\nSuppose we have a node in phase i (s[i] is 0 or 1). This node's game is between the winners of its two children.\n\nThe possible winners for this node are determined by the rule:\n\n- If s[i] is 0: the winner is the one with the lower p value between the two children's winners.\n\n- If s[i] is 1: the winner is the one with the higher p value.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the result of applying the rule to all possible pairs of winners from the children.\n\nBut how do we model this, considering that the permutation p is variable?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each node, we can track the possible minimum or maximum values, depending on the rule.\n\nWait, for example, if s[i] is 0, the winner is the minimum of the two children's winners. So, for a node with s[i]=0, the possible winners are the min of any possible pair of winners from the children.\n\nSimilarly, if s[i]=1, the possible winners are the max of any pair.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the set of all possible min or max values based on the children's possible winners.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's think recursively:\n\n- For a leaf node (phase 0), the possible winners are the two teams in the match. But under s[0], only one of them can be the winner.\n\nWait, no. Because the rule is applied, so for a leaf node, the possible winner is determined by the rule. For example, if s[0]=0, then the winner is the team with the lower p value. So, for a leaf node, the possible winner is either the team with lower p (if s[0]=0) or the higher p (if s[0]=1).\n\nBut in this case, the possible winners are the two teams, but the rule determines which one can be the winner.\n\nWait, but for the permutation p, the outcome is fixed. So, for a leaf node, the winner is fixed once p is known.\n\nBut since we're looking for any permutation p that allows x to be the champion, perhaps for each node, we can track the possible winners based on the current phase's rule.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each node, compute the possible winners as follows:\n\n   a. If the node is a leaf (phase 0), then the possible winners are the two teams in the game. But the rule s[0] determines which one is the winner. So, for a leaf node, the possible winner is either the team with lower p (if s[0] is 0) or higher p (if s[0] is 1). So, the possible winner is one of the two teams.\n\n   b. For non-leaf nodes, the possible winners are determined by combining the possible winners of the left and right children. For each possible winner a in the left child, and each possible winner b in the right child, compute c = a if s[i] is 1 else b (assuming the rule is max or min). Then, c is a possible winner for the current node.\n\nBut wait, this is not quite right. Because for a non-leaf node, the two children's possible winners are the possible winners of their respective sub-trees. So, for the current node, the possible winners are the min or max of any pair of winners from the children.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i with rule s[i], the possible winners are the set { min(a, b) | a ∈ L, b ∈ R }, where L is the possible winners of the left child, R is the possible winners of the right child, if s[i] is 0. Or { max(a, b) | a ∈ L, b ∈ R }, if s[i] is 1.\n\nThus, for each node, the possible winners are determined by the children's possible winners and the rule.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree structure.\n\n2. For each leaf node, compute its possible winners as follows:\n\n   a. If s[0] is 0, the possible winner is min of the two teams in the match.\n\n   b. If s[0] is 1, the possible winner is max of the two teams in the match.\n\nWait, no. Because for a leaf node, the two teams are known, say A and B. The possible winner is either A or B, depending on the rule. So, for a leaf node, the possible winner is a singleton set containing either A or B, based on the rule.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given permutation p, the outcome is fixed. So, for a leaf node, if s[0] is 0, then the winner is the one with lower p. So, the possible winner is either A or B, depending on p. But since p is a permutation, the outcome can vary, meaning that for any permutation, the winner could be either A or B.\n\nWait, no. Because in the leaf node, the two teams are A and B. For any permutation p, one of them will have a higher p than the other. So, the winner is determined by p.\n\nThus, for a leaf node, the possible winner is either A or B, depending on p. So, the possible winners for a leaf node are both A and B.\n\nWait, but no: for a given permutation p, the outcome is fixed. So, for each leaf node, the possible winners under any permutation p is either A or B. So, in the context of our problem, when considering all possible permutations, the possible winners for a leaf node are both A and B.\n\nThus, for a leaf node in phase 0, the possible winners are {A, B}.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if s[0] is 0, the winner is the one with lower p, which could be either A or B. Similarly for s[0] is 1.\n\nSo, regardless of s[0], the possible winners for a leaf node are both A and B.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for a given permutation p, only one of them will win. So, for the purpose of our problem, we need to determine if x can be the winner of the entire tournament under some permutation p. So, for each node, we need to track the possible winners under some permutation p.\n\nThus, for a leaf node, the possible winners are {A, B}, since for some permutation p, A can win, and for another permutation, B can win.\n\nSo, the initial step is to process all the leaf nodes and compute their possible winners as {A, B}.\n\nThen, for each non-leaf node, we process the possible winners based on the children's possible winners and the rule s[i].\n\nSo, for a node in phase i with rule s[i]:\n\n- If s[i] is 0, the winner is the min of the two children's winners. So, the possible winners for this node are the min of any combination of a from left and b from right.\n\n- If s[i] is 1, the winner is the max of a and b, so the possible winners are the max of any a and b.\n\nBut wait, this is for any permutation p. So, for each node, the possible winners are all possible min(a, b) or max(a, b), where a is a winner of the left child and b is a winner of the right child.\n\nBut this leads to an exponential number of possibilities, which is not feasible for n up to 18.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a way to represent the possible winners more efficiently.\n\nWait, but for each node, the possible winners can be represented as a set of team IDs. But for large n, this could be computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but n is up to 18, and 2^18 is 262,144. So, for each node, the possible winners can be stored as a set of integers, but the number of nodes is O(2^n), which is 2^18=262,144. So, for each node, storing a set of possible winners could be manageable.\n\nBut even then, for each node, combining the children's sets could be O(k^2) operations, where k is the size of the children's sets. For n=18, this could be 2^18 * (2^17)^2 = 2^18 * 2^34 = way too big.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps, instead of tracking all possible winners, we can track for each node the possible minimum and maximum values, or some other aggregate that captures the necessary information without tracking every possible winner.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about what's needed for a node to have x as a possible winner.\n\nFor a node, x can be a possible winner if there exists a way to choose winners in the children such that x is the winner of this node's game, according to the rule.\n\nSo, for a node with rule s[i], x can be a possible winner if:\n\n- If s[i] is 0: x is the min of the two children's winners. So, one child must have a winner less than x, and the other can be anything, as long as x is the min.\n\nWait, no. Because x must be the min",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers for a given tournament setup. The tournament is structured as a knockout style with 2^n teams, and each phase of the tournament has a specific rule that determines the winner of each match.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves modeling the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a match. Each node has two children representing the matches that feed into it. The root of the tree is the final match, and the leaves are the initial matches in the first phase.\n\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases, with each phase having a specific rule (either the lower-skilled team wins or the higher-skilled team wins). The number of games in each phase decreases as we move up the tree.\n2. **Binary Tree Representation**: Each match is represented as a node in a binary tree. The leaves of the tree are the initial matches in the first phase, and the internal nodes represent subsequent matches.\n3. **Possible Winners Calculation**: For each node, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, we calculate the possible winners based on the rules of the current phase. If a node's rule is 0, the winner is the team with the lower skill; if the rule is 1, the winner is the team with the higher skill.\n4. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a dynamic programming approach to compute the possible winners for each node. For each node, we consider all possible pairs of winners from its children and apply the current phase's rule to determine the possible winners for the current node.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n\n    # Build the tournament tree structure\n    # The tree is represented as a list of lists, where each node has left and right children\n    # Nodes are numbered from 0 to total_nodes - 1, where total_nodes = 2^(n) - 1\n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    total_games = total_teams - 1\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(total_games)]\n\n    # Determine the structure of the tree\n    # The leaves are the initial matches in phase 0\n    # For i-th leaf, the game is between 2i+1 and 2i+2\n    # Wait, perhaps a better way: the initial matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc.\n    # So, the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, each between consecutive pairs of 2^k teams.\n    # So, the leaves are the initial matches.\n\n    # Let's build the tree by creating a parent array\n    # The root is at position 0\n    # For each node, the left and right children are determined by the initial pairing\n\n    # Create a list of all matches\n    matches = []\n    for i in range(1, total_teams, 2):\n        a = i\n        b = i + 1\n        matches.append((a, b))\n\n    # Assign each match an index\n    match_indices = {}\n    for idx, (a, b) in enumerate(matches):\n        tree[idx] = []\n        tree[idx].append(('left', a))\n        tree[idx].append(('right', b))\n        match_indices[(a, b)] = idx\n\n    # Now, for each non-leaf node, determine its children based on the phase's grouping\n    # The grouping is such that each phase i has 2^(n-i) teams, grouped into pairs\n    # We can model the tree structure by determining the left and right children for each node\n    # This is more complex;
