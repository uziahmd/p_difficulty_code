He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to convert a number from base a to base b, but the catch is that when the second part is 'R', it means that the target base is the Roman numeral system. So, the problem has two main parts: converting numbers to and from Roman numerals, and handling regular base conversions.\n\nLet me first understand the input format. The input is multiple test cases. For each case, the first line has two integers a and b. The second line is a number in base a. The second part can be 'R' which indicates that b is the Roman numeral system. So for each case, I need to process accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the description says: the second part of each door's lock is either an integer b or an R. So, for each door, the second part determines whether the target base is a regular base or Roman numerals. But the input is a single number c in base a, and I have to output it in base b, where b could be a regular base (integer) or Roman (indicated by 'R'). So, for each test case, I have to determine whether to treat b as a regular base or as a Roman numeral system.\n\nSo, for each line after the first line of a and b, the second part is either a string representing a number in base a, or it's 'R'. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nSo, for example, if the first line is '10 2\\n1', then a=10, b=2. The second line is '16 R\\n5'—wait, no, perhaps each test case is a separate block. Wait, the sample input shows multiple lines, each with a and b followed by the c number.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich looks like five test cases. Each test case starts with a line of a and b (with b possibly being R), and then a line with c in base a.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\n- Read a and b.\n- If b is 'R', then we need to convert c from base a to Roman numerals.\n- Else, convert c from base a to base b.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the second part of the door's lock is either a number or R. So in the problem statement, each door's second part is either a number or R, indicating that the target base is a regular base or Roman numerals. But in the input, each test case's a and b are given, and for each, the c is in base a. We need to output c in base b, where b could be R or a number.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nIn the problem, each door has four parts: a, then either b or R, then c, then empty. So for each door, the target base is determined by the second part (b or R).\n\nBut the input is a single number c in base a. So, for each test case, the c is in base a, and we have to output it in base b, where b can be either a regular base (like 2,3,...) or R (Roman numerals).\n\nSo, for each test case, the process is:\n\n- Read a and b (the second part may be R)\n- Read c as a string in base a\n- Convert c from base a to base b, where base b is determined by whether it's R or a number.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each test case:\n   a. Read a and b_str. Check if b_str is 'R'.\n   b. Parse c_str as a base a number.\n   c. If b is R: convert c_num to Roman numerals.\n   d. Else: convert c_num to base b (as a string without leading zeros).\n   e. Output the result.\n\nNow, the main challenge is implementing the conversion functions.\n\nFirst, I need to write a function to convert a number (integer) to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules. Let's think about how they work.\n\nRoman numerals are formed by combining symbols and adding their values. Normally, symbols are added, but in cases like IV (4), IX (9), XL (40), etc., subtraction is used.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of pairs, where each pair consists of a value and its corresponding Roman symbol. These pairs are in descending order of value. Then, for each pair, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the pairs would include:\n\nM 1000\nCM 900\nDCCCLXXXVIII 888 (but wait, perhaps it's better to have individual components).\n\nAlternatively, the standard way is to have a list like:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for a given number, iterate through this list, and for each value, while the current number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nYes, that's a standard method.\n\nSo, the function to convert an integer to Roman numerals would be straightforward.\n\nNext, the function to convert a number from base a to base b (when b is not R) is more involved.\n\nWe need to take a number in base a, which is given as a string, and convert it to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but how? Because c is given as a string in base a. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the c_str into an integer, treating it as base a.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample input, one of the test cases is:\n\nInput line '2 2\\n1111001'\n\na=2, b=2, so output is 1111001, same as input.\n\nAnother test case is '12 13\\nA' — which is A in base 12. Wait, no. Wait, no, the c is in base a. So, 'A' is in base 12?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is a number in base a. So 'A' in base 12 represents 10 in decimal.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the number c is given in base a, which may contain letters. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-15, represented as 0-9, A-F.\n\nBut the problem says that for other bases, letters are used beyond 10. So, for base 13, 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, etc.\n\nSo, the parsing function needs to correctly interpret each character in the string as a digit in base a.\n\nSo, for example, 'A' in base 12 is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nThus, the first step is to parse c_str as a base a number, converting it to a decimal integer.\n\nThen, if b is not R, we need to convert this decimal integer to base b, represented as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the function to convert from base a to base b involves:\n\n- Parsing c_str as a base a number.\n- Converting that to a decimal integer.\n- Then, converting that integer to base b, using standard base conversion, but ensuring that leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut wait, what about when b is 1? No, because the constraints say that b is between 2 and 25, except when it's R.\n\nWait, the input constraints state that a and b are between 2 and 25, inclusive. Except when b is 'R'.\n\nSo, for b as a number, it's at least 2.\n\nSo, the next problem is writing a function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer.\n\nThis function will need to handle each character in the string, mapping it to its value in base a.\n\nFor example, in base 16, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nBut in lower bases, like base 10, 'A' would not be present.\n\nSo, the function must correctly map each character in c_str to its value in base a.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nEach character can be a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z, uppercase?), depending on the base a.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. It may contain leading zeros.\n\nSo, the function to parse c_str needs to:\n\n- Iterate over each character in c_str.\n- For each character, determine its value in base a.\n   - If the character is a digit, its value is int(c).\n   - If it's a letter, its value is ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut wait, what if a is less than 10? Like a=5. Then letters aren't allowed except for digits. So, if a < 10, any character that's a letter is invalid.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a valid number in base a. So, it's guaranteed that all characters in c_str are valid for base a.\n\nSo, for a=5, the digits can only be 0-4. Any letters would be invalid, but the problem says it's valid, so the input won't have letters for a<10.\n\nTherefore, the parsing function can assume that for a<10, all characters are digits, and for a>=10, letters are allowed.\n\nSo, the parsing function can be written as:\n\ndef str_to_num(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\nBut wait, what about uppercase vs lowercase letters? The problem says that the number uses letters, but the examples show uppercase. So, the function should be case-insensitive.\n\nYes, the code above converts c to uppercase before processing.\n\nOnce the number is parsed as an integer, we need to convert it to base b.\n\nConverting a decimal integer to another base:\n\nThe standard approach is to repeatedly divide by the target base and collect the remainders, but in reverse order.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the output is a string without leading zeros.\n\nSo, here's how to do it:\n\ndef num_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10- base_max, so for base up to 36\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but for bases higher than 10, letters are used for digits 10 and above. So, for rem=10, it's 'A', rem=11 is 'B', etc.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when the base is larger than 36? Well, according to the problem statement, the maximum a and b are 25, so rem can be up to 24, which is covered.\n\nSo, the function works.\n\nPutting it all together, for each test case:\n\nRead a and b_str.\n\nIf b_str is 'R', then:\n\n   parse c_str as a base a number, get c_num.\n\n   convert c_num to Roman numerals, output as a string.\n\nElse:\n\n   parse c_str as base a, get c_num.\n\n   convert c_num to base b as a string, output.\n\nBut wait, the sample input includes:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet me see each case.\n\nCase 1: a=10, b=2.\n\nc is '1' in base 10 → 1 in decimal.\n\nConvert to base 2: 1 → '1'.\n\nCase 2: a=16, b=R.\n\nc is '5' in base 16 → 5 in decimal.\n\nConvert to Roman: V.\n\nCase3: a=5, b=R.\n\nc is '4' in base5 → 4 decimal → IV.\n\nCase4: a=2, b=2.\n\nc is '1111001' → binary number.\n\nConvert to base2: same as input.\n\nCase5: a=12, b=13.\n\nc is 'A' in base12 → 10 in decimal.\n\nConvert to base13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo the output is correct.\n\nAnother example: in the sample, the second test case is a=16, b='R', c='5' → output 'V'.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: c is zero. But the problem says c is non-zero, so no problem.\n\nEdge Case 2: a=10, b=10, c='0' → output '0' (but c is non-zero as per problem statement).\n\nEdge Case3: a=10, b=16, c='Z' → but a=10, so Z is invalid since base10 digits are 0-9 only. So, the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nWait, but the problem says the input c is a non-negative integer in base a, so the input will have valid characters.\n\nSo, our functions can proceed safely.\n\nNow, the next step is to write the Roman numeral conversion function.\n\nImplementing the Roman numeral function:\n\nAs discussed, the function takes an integer and returns the Roman numeral string.\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nTesting this function with 5 → 'V', 4 → 'IV', 3999 → 'MMMCMXCIX', etc.\n\nNow, putting everything together.\n\nThe plan for the code:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read a and b. The second part is b_str, which can be 'R' or a number.\n\nWait, how are a and b read? In the sample input, each test case's first line is something like '10 2\\n1', which suggests that a is the first number, and b is the second, but the second can be 'R'.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is ['10 2\\n1'] which is a=10, b=2.\n\nSo, for each test case, the first line is split into a and b_str. Wait, no: the first line is a string that contains 'a b', with b possibly being 'R'.\n\nSo, the first line is something like '10 2\\n1' → a is 10, b is 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is the a and b for the test case. So, the first line is a string that has a and b separated by space, and possibly b is 'R'.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\n- Read a_str and b_str.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple lines, each representing a test case.\n\nEach test case is:\n\nLine 1: a and b (space-separated), where b can be 'R'.\n\nLine 2: c_str, the number in base a.\n\nSo, the code needs to read each test case as two lines.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, for each test case, process two lines: the first is a and b, the second is c.\n\nBut sometimes, the input might have lines with varying lengths, including empty lines. So, perhaps it's better to read all lines at once and process them in pairs.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, let's assume that the lines are given as per the sample.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        a_b = lines[idx].split()\n        idx += 1\n        c = lines[idx]\n        idx +=1\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b_str = a_b[1]\n        # process a, b_str, c\n        # ...\n        # output the result\n        print(result)\n        \nSo, each test case is processed by taking two lines: the a and b line, then the c line.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nParse a and b_str.\n\nIf b_str is 'R', then:\n\n   c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n\n   roman = int_to_roman(c_num)\n\nElse:\n\n   c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n\n   new_base = int(b_str)\n\n   new_c = num_to_str(c_num, new_base)\n\nThen, output the result.\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the third test case is '5 R\\n4', which is a=5, b=R, c=4 (base5). So, 4 in base5 is 4 in decimal. Converted to Roman is IV.\n\nSo, the code correctly outputs IV.\n\nAnother sample: the fifth test case is a=12, b=13, c='A' in base12. So, 'A' is 10 in decimal. Convert to base13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo, output is 'A'.\n\nNow, the code seems solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling leading zeros in c_str. But the function str_to_num ignores leading zeros, as multiplying by base adds zero.\n\nFor example, '00100' in base10 is 100.\n\nWhen converting to another base, leading zeros are omitted in the output.\n\nSo, in the function num_to_str, the code returns a string without leading zeros.\n\nTesting:\n\nnum_to_str(0, 2) returns '0' → but in the problem statement, c is non-zero.\n\nnum_to_str(1, 2) → '1'.\n\nnum_to_str(10, 2) → '1010'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is '000A' in base12 → 10 decimal. When converted to base13, it's 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the number is zero? Problem statement says c is not zero, so no problem.\n\nAnother issue: when the base is 1, but the problem says b is at least 2, except when it's R.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nImplement helper functions:\n\nstr_to_num: parses a string in a given base into a decimal integer.\n\nnum_to_str: converts a decimal integer into a string in a given base, without leading zeros.\n\nint_to_roman: converts a decimal integer into a Roman numeral string.\n\nNow, write these functions.\n\nImplementing str_to_num:\n\ndef str_to_num(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\nTesting this:\n\ns = 'A' in base 12: 10.\n\ns = '10' in base 10: 10.\n\ns = 'Z' in base 36: 35.\n\nYes.\n\nImplementing num_to_str:\n\ndef num_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # For bases up to 36, rem is 10-35.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nTesting:\n\nn=5, base=2: '101'.\n\nn=10, base=13: 'C'? No, wait, 10 in base13 is 'A'.\n\nWait, 10 divided by 13 is 0, remainder 10 → 'A'.\n\nSo, the function returns 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, int_to_roman function.\n\nImplementing as earlier.\n\nTesting:\n\nnum=5 → 'V'.\n\nnum=4 → 'IV'.\n\nnum=3999 → 'MMMCMXCIX'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\na = int(a_part)\n\nb_str = a_b[1]\n\nif b_str is 'R':\n\n   c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n\n   roman = int_to_roman(c_num)\n\nelse:\n\n   c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n\n   new_base = int(b_str)\n\n   new_c = num_to_str(c_num, new_base)\n\nprint(roman or new_c)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the fourth test case is a=2, b=2, c='1111001' → output is same as input.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nNow, handling the output.\n\nBut the function num_to_str returns a string without leading zeros. So, when converting to a base, the output is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nSo, in the main function:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef str_to_num(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + val\n    return num\n\ndef num_to_str(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    for _ in range(len(input)):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line1 = input[idx].strip()\n        idx +=1\n        if not line1:\n            continue\n        a_b = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b_str = a_b[1]\n        idx +=1\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            c = ''\n        else:\n            c = input[idx].strip()\n        idx +=1\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n            roman = int_to_roman(c_num)\n        else:\n            c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n            new_base = int(b_str)\n            new_c = num_to_str(c_num, new_base)\n        print(roman if b_str == 'R' else new_c)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the lines are given as a list, but in reality, the code reads from stdin. So, perhaps the code should read all lines at once, and process each test case as two consecutive lines.\n\nBut in the code above, for each test case, it reads line1, then line2, then line3, etc. Which may not be correct if the number of lines is odd.\n\nBut the problem says that each test case has two lines: the a and b line, and the c line.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nNumber of lines is 5 (each test case is two lines, so 5*2=10 lines?), but in the sample input provided, it's written as a list of 5 strings, each of which is a line. So, the code expects each test case to consist of two lines, but the initial input is read as a list of lines.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, the input is read as a list of lines, and each test case is two lines: a_b line and c line.\n\nSo, the code should loop over the lines in pairs.\n\nIn the code above, for each test case, it processes two lines: the a_b line, then the c line.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's presented as a list of five test cases, each consisting of two lines. So, the code should process each test case as two lines.\n\nBut in the code as written, the main function is trying to process each test case in a loop, incrementing idx by 2 each time. That may not be correct, because after the first test case, idx is increased by 2, then the next test case is the next two lines, etc.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, idx=0.\n\nRead line1 as a_b line.\n\nIncrement idx to 1.\n\nRead c as line1.\n\nWait, no, in the code above, for each test case, it reads line1, then line2, but idx is incremented by 1 for each line.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor _ in range(len(input)):\n\n   process two lines: a_b and c.\n\nBut the code inside increments idx by 1 for each line.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Let's think.\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\nLine 0: a_b line.\n\nLine 1: c line.\n\nThen, idx starts at 0.\n\nLoop:\n\nProcess line 0: idx becomes 1.\n\nThen, process line 1: idx becomes 2.\n\nThen, for next test case, idx is 2, which is the next a_b line.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, the loop runs for len(input), which is wrong.\n\nBecause each test case is two lines.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should process until idx reaches len(input), stepping by 2.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nidx = 0\n\nwhile idx < len(input):\n\n   process a_b line (input[idx])\n\n   idx +=1\n\n   process c line (input[idx])\n\n   idx +=1\n\nBut in this case, the code assumes that the input has even number of lines.\n\nBut in practice, perhaps the code can just process two lines per test case, until all lines are processed.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        # Read a_b line\n        line_a_b = input[idx].strip()\n        idx +=1\n        if not line_a_b:\n            continue  # skip empty lines\n        a_b = line_a_b.split()\n        a = int(a_b[0])\n        b_str = a_b[1]\n        # Read c line\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            c = ''\n        else:\n            c = input[idx].strip()\n        idx +=1\n        # process\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n            roman = int_to_roman(c_num)\n        else:\n            c_num = str_to_num(c, a)\n            new_base = int(b_str)\n            new_c = num_to_str(c_num, new_base)\n        print(roman if b_str == 'R' else new_c)\n\nThis way, for each test case, it processes two lines: a_b and c.\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nAfter splitting into lines, assuming that the input is read as:\n\nlines = [\n    '10 2\\n1',\n    '16 R\\n5',\n    '5 R\\n4',\n    '2 2\\n1111001',\n    '12 13\\nA'\n]\n\nProcessing:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na_b line: '10 2\\n1' → a=10, b_str='2'\n\nc line: '1' → process as base10 to base2 → '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na_b line: '16 R\\n5' → a=16, b_str='R'\n\nc line: '5' → base16 → 5 → Roman 'V'.\n\nTest case3:\n\na_b line: '5 R\\n4' → a=5, b_str='R'\n\nc line: '4' → base5 → 4 → Roman 'IV'.\n\nTest case4:\n\na_b line: '2 2\\n1111001' → a=2, b=2.\n\nc line: '1111001' → binary → same as input.\n\nTest case5:\n\na_b line: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13.\n\nc line: 'A' → base12 → 10 → base13 is 'A'.\n\nAll outputs match the sample.\n\nNow, testing another case where c is zero.\n\nBut the problem says c is non-zero.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=10, c='0' → but c is zero, which is not allowed.\n\nBut the code will output '0' correctly.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=7, c='123' → 1*49 + 2*7 +3= 49+14+3=66 → same as base7.\n\nnum_to_str(66,7) → 66 /7=9 rem 3 → '9' is 'X' (since 7 is base, 9 is 7+2 → 'X'? Wait, no. Wait, 7 is the base. So, 7 is '7', but in base7, digits are 0-6.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in base7, digits can be 0-6. So, when converting 66 to base7:\n\n66 /7 =9 rem 3 → 9 is beyond 7, so 9/7=1 rem 2 → 1/7=0 rem1.\n\nSo, the digits are 1,2,3 → '123' in base7.\n\nWait, but in the code, when rem is 3, it appends '3', then 2 → '2', then 1 → '1', but the reversed is '123'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, what about when the base is 1? Not applicable as per problem constraints.\n\nAnother test case: a=16, b=16, c='FF' → FF is 255 in base16. Converting to base16 gives 'FF' again.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=2, c= '3' → 3 → '11'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the c_str is '0' but the problem says it's non-zero.\n\nNow, the code seems solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase letters correctly. The code converts c to uppercase, so 'a' is treated as 10 in base11, etc.\n\n- The code doesn't handle leading zeros in the output. For example, when converting 0 to base2, it returns '0', but according to the problem statement, c is non-zero.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`, where `b` can either be a regular base (integer) or the Roman numeral system.
