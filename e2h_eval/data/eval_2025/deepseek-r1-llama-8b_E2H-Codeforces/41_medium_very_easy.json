There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a dynamic programming problem because for each spot, the choice of height depends on the previous choices, especially considering overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, but n and m are up to 50, which isn't too bad. So maybe a DP approach where we track the possible maximums for each interval could work. Alternatively, since the constraints are on intervals, perhaps we can model it by considering the earliest and latest positions where a restriction applies.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, determine the maximum allowed height based on all applicable restrictions. Then, the problem reduces to choosing heights for each spot without exceeding any of these maximums and maximizing the sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, some spots might be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, if a spot is in two overlapping restrictions, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all applicable x_i's for that spot.\n\nSo first, for each spot i, I need to find the minimum x among all restrictions that cover i. Because if a spot is in multiple restrictions, each restricts the maximum height, so the overall maximum height for that spot is the smallest of those x's.\n\nBut wait, what if a spot is not covered by any restriction? Then the maximum height is h.\n\nSo step one: For each spot i, compute the minimum x across all restrictions that include i. If no restrictions apply, then the max is h.\n\nOnce I have the maximum allowed height for each spot, the problem becomes choosing for each spot a height between 0 and its allowed maximum (inclusive), such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because when you choose a height for a spot, it affects other spots as well, but only through the restrictions. Oh, no—no, because each restriction is an upper bound on a range. So for each spot, the maximum possible height is determined by the minimum x in all applicable restrictions.\n\nSo if I precompute for each spot i the maximum allowed height as min(h, min(x_j for j where i is in [l_j, r_j])) ), then I can treat each spot independently, right?\n\nWait, no! Because if I set a height for a spot, say i, it affects all the restrictions that include i. So if a restriction is on a range that includes i, the maximum allowed for that spot is min of all x's for the restrictions covering it. So setting the height correctly for each spot is sufficient because each spot's maximum is already the tightest possible.\n\nWait, maybe yes. Because each spot's maximum is determined by all the restrictions that include it, so for each spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x's of the restrictions that cover it. So the initial step is to compute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height as the minimum of all x's for the restrictions that include i, or h if no restrictions apply.\n\nOnce we have these maximums, each spot's height can be chosen independently because any higher than that would violate a restriction.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each spot i, choosing a height a_i between 0 and s_i (where s_i is the computed maximum for spot i), such that the sum of a_i squared is maximized.\n\nThis is a classic optimization problem. For each a_i, the maximum sum is achieved by choosing a_i as large as possible because the square function is increasing. So for each spot, we should choose the maximum allowed height s_i.\n\nWait, that's right! Because the square function grows as a increases. So the optimal strategy is to set each a_i to its maximum possible value, s_i.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute s_i, which is the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i, or h otherwise.\n\n2. Then, for each spot i, set a_i = s_i.\n\n3. The total profit is the sum of a_i squared.\n\nWait, but what about when a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions? For example, a spot covered by two restrictions: one says max 5, another says max 3. So the maximum allowed is 3, so a_i is 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo let's test this approach against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → covers spot 1, max 1.\n\n2 2 3 → covers spot 2, max 3.\n\n3 3 2 → covers spot 3, max 2.\n\nSo for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: min(1) → 1.\n\nSpot 2: min(3) →3.\n\nSpot 3: min(2) →2.\n\nSum is 1^2 +3^2+2^2=1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → affects spots 2 and 3. Their max is min(8).\n\n3 4 7 → affects spots 3 and 4. Their max is min(7).\n\nSo for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions →10.\n\nSpot 2: min(8) →8.\n\nSpot 3: min(8,7) →7.\n\nSpot4: min(7) →7.\n\nSum is 10^2 +8^2+7^2+7^2=100+64+49+49=262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for the given examples.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read all restrictions.\n\n- For each spot, compute the minimal x_i across all applicable restrictions.\n\n- For each spot, set a_i to that minimal x_i or h if no restrictions.\n\n- Sum squares.\n\nWait, but wait. What about overlapping restrictions that might have tighter constraints? Like, if a spot is covered by two restrictions with x values 3 and 4, then the maximum is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nHow to implement this.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions, read l, r, x.\n\nFor each spot i from 1 to n, compute s_i as the minimum x across all restrictions where l <=i <=r.\n\nIf no such restrictions, s_i is h.\n\nSo, for each i in 1..n, initialize s_i to h. Then for each restriction, for each i in l_i to r_i, set s_i to the min(s_i, x_i).\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have all s_i, the profit is sum of (s_i)^2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize s = [h] * (n+1)  # assuming 1-based indexing.\n\nfor each of m lines:\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if s[i] > x:\n\n            s[i] = x\n\nThen compute sum(s[i]^2 for i in 1..n)\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nWait, but in Python, initializing a list with n+1 elements, indexes 0 to n, where 0 is unused.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → i=1: s[1] becomes 1.\n\n2 2 3 → i=2: s[2] becomes 3.\n\n3 3 2 → i=3: s[3] becomes 2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → i=2:8; i=3:8.\n\n3 4 7 → i=3: min(8,7)=7; i=4:7.\n\nSo s[1]=10, s[2]=8, s[3]=7, s[4]=7.\n\nSum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions, some with lower x.\n\nLike, spot 2 covered by a restriction of x=5 and x=3.\n\nSo s[2] should be 3.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about if a spot is covered by a single restriction. Like, spot 4 has a restriction x=5. Then s[4] is 5.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as described.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ns = [h]*(n+1)  # 1-based index.\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if s[i] > x:\n\n            s[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum( ai**2 for ai in s[1:n+1] )\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the first spot is 10. But in the sample input, the first line is '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7', but wait, the first line of input is '3 3 3' in the first sample. Wait, the way the input is presented in the problem statement is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the Input section:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nSo the input is read as n, h, m, followed by m lines.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the sample given in the problem, the input is written as ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'] — which seems to represent two test cases. Oh, wait, no, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and shows an example with two test cases. But in the problem statement, it's a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says \"your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input...\" So the input is a single test case.\n\nWait, no, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line with n, h, m. Then m lines of restrictions.\n\nIn the example, it's written as two separate inputs, probably representing two different test cases, but that's just for illustration.\n\nSo in code, for the given problem, it's a single test case.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code will read n, h, m, then m restrictions, process them, and output the sum.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, h=0, m=0.\n\nThen s[1] =0, sum is 0.\n\nCase 2: n=2, h=5, m=1.\n\nRestriction: 1 2 3.\n\nSo s[1] =3, s[2]=3.\n\nSum is 3² +3²=18.\n\nAnother case: spot 1 has no restrictions, so s[1]=h. Spot 2 has a restriction x=2, spot 3 has a restriction x=3, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given height restrictions. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and there are specific constraints on the maximum height allowed in certain ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal heights for each spot while respecting the given constraints. Each constraint specifies that the tallest house in a particular range must not exceed a certain height.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum value of all applicable constraints. If a spot is not covered by any constraint, it can have the maximum allowed height, which is the given maximum height `h`.\n3. **Optimal Height Selection**: Once the maximum allowed height for each spot is determined, the optimal strategy is to choose the highest possible height for each spot within its allowed range, as the square function grows with the height, maximizing the profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\ns = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if s[i] > x:\n            s[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum(ai ** 2 for ai in s[1:n+1])\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of constraints `m`. Each constraint specifies a range `[l, r]` and a maximum height `x` for that range.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `s` of size `n+1` (using 1-based indexing) is initialized where each element is set to `h` initially.\n3. **Applying Constraints**: For each constraint, update the maximum allowed height for each spot in the specified range to be the minimum of the current value and the constraint's maximum height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights chosen for each spot.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit by choosing the highest possible allowable heights for each spot.",
