    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Let me break down what's given.\n\nWe have N and K as inputs. We need to find the number of different arrays containing N sets S_1 to S_N. Each set can have zero or more distinct integers from 1 to K. \n\nThe main condition is that there exists a rearrangement of these sets into S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. \n\nWhat's a child here? A set A is a child of B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least 2. If A has {2}, B must have 3, etc. Also, if A is empty, it's trivially a child of any B because there are no elements to check.\n\nThe task is to compute the number of such arrays modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So, how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the sets. Since there's a way to arrange them in a sequence where each is a child of the next, the sets must form a chain where each step satisfies the parent-child condition.\n\nBut since the array can be rearranged, perhaps the order in which they are arranged in the array doesn't matter, but the existence of some permutation that satisfies the chain is required.\n\nWait, but the array itself is a sequence of sets. But the problem says that there exists a way to rearrange the array into a sequence that forms a chain. So the original array can be in any order, but some permutation of it must form a chain.\n\nSo, the key is to count all possible arrays of N sets where there exists a permutation of the array that is a chain under the parent-child relation.\n\nBut how to model this combinatorially?\n\nI think the first step is to figure out what structures the sets must have so that they can be arranged into a chain. Then, we can count the number of such arrays.\n\nLet me consider the properties of the sets in the chain.\n\nEach set in the chain must be a subset of the next one in some way. Wait, not exactly, but for every element x in S_i, S_{i+1} must contain x+1. So, the presence of x in S_i implies that x+1 is present in S_{i+1}.\n\nThis suggests that the sets must form a chain where each set's elements are covered by the next set's elements in a way that x+1 is present whenever x is.\n\nAnother way to look at this: For the entire chain, for each x, the earliest occurrence of x in the sets must be followed by x+1 in the next set. So, the sets must form a kind of \"cover\" where for each x, if it appears in any set in the chain, then x+1 must appear in the next set after it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum element in the entire array of sets determines the order. Because, for instance, if the maximum element is M, then all the sets before the last one must include up to M-1, and the last set must include M.\n\nWait, no. Because the sets don't necessarily have to be in order. The chain could be formed by any permutation, but the sets in the chain must satisfy the parent condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement of the sets in the chain must be such that their elements are a consecutive sequence. Like, each set in the chain must include all the elements up to some point, ensuring that x+1 is present when x is.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sets in the chain form a non-decreasing sequence in terms of their maximum elements. Or maybe their elements are such that each step covers the next integer.\n\nWait, let's think about the sets in the chain. Let's say the sets are S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. For S_1' to be a child of S_2', every x in S_1' must be present in S_2' with x+1. Similarly for each subsequent pair.\n\nThis seems similar to building a chain where each set must have a higher \"level\" than the previous. So, for example, if a set contains x, the next set must contain x+1.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum element in the chain increases by one each step. Wait, not exactly, but for each x in S_i, S_{i+1} must have x+1. So, for each x present in any set before the last, the next set must contain x+1.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum element in the entire array of sets is some M, and each set in the chain must contain all elements from 1 up to some m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged into a chain where each set is a child of the next. The key insight is that the sets must form a sequence where each set's elements are covered by the next set's elements in a way that x+1 is present whenever x is.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find arrays of sets such that there exists a permutation where each set is a child of the next. A set A is a child of B if every element x in A has x+1 in B.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We can model the problem using dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to form a valid chain of length i.\n3. **State Transition**: For each possible maximum element `m`, compute the number of ways to form a valid chain ending with `m`.\n4. **Combining Results**: Sum up the results for all possible maximum elements and use combinatorial counting to account for different ways to include these sets in the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    if N == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[m]: number of chains ending with max element m\n    dp = [0] * (K + 2)  # m can be up to K, so K+1 is enough\n    dp[0] = 1  # empty set\n    \n    for _ in range(N):\n        new_dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n        for m in range(K + 1):\n            if dp[m] == 0:\n                continue\n            # For each possible current max m, we can create new chains\n            # by adding any subset of {1, ..., m} or {m+1}\n            # Wait, no: when adding a new set, it can include any subset,\n            # but the new set can't have elements beyond the previous max unless it's m+1.\n            # Wait, perhaps the new set can include any subset, but to maintain the chain condition.\n            # Alternatively, when adding a new set, it can either:\n            # - not introduce any new elements beyond the current max (so subsets of {1..m})\n            # or\n            # - introduce m+1 as the new max, which requires that the previous set could have included up to m.\n            # So, for each existing chain ending at m, the new set can be any subset of {1..m} union possibly {m+1}.\n            # But if we include m+1, then the new max becomes m+1, and the new set must include m+1.\n            # Wait, more precisely:\n            # The new set can be any subset S such that:\n            # - If S contains an element x, then the next set in the chain must contain x+1.\n            # Since we are adding one set to the chain, the new set S must satisfy that for any x in S, either:\n            # - x is m+1, or x+1 is <= m (since the next set would need to have x+1, which is <= m).\n            # Wait, perhaps the new set can include any subset of {1..m} or {m+1}.\n            # Because if the new set includes m+1, then the next set in the chain would need to include m+2, but since our current chain is only being extended by one step, we don't need to worry about that beyond the next step.\n            # So, for each existing chain ending at m, the new set can be any subset of {1..m} or include m+1.\n            # So, the number of possible subsets for the new set is:\n            # (number of subsets of {1..m}) + (number of subsets of {1..m} âˆª {m+1} that include m+1})\n            # But actually, the new set can be any subset of {1..m}, because including m+1 would require that the next set in the chain includes m+2, but since we're only adding one set, it's allowed as part of the current step.\n            # Wait, no.

So, the new set can indeed be any subset that includes m+1 or not.\n            # So, for each existing chain ending at m, the number of ways to extend it by adding a new set S is 2^{m+1}.\n            # Thus, the new_dp[m'] (where m' is the new maximum after adding S) is updated based on whether S includes m+1 or not.\n            # Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.
