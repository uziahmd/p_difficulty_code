There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house contributes a squared value of its height to the total profit. But there are m restrictions that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm. The input gives n spots, each can have a height between 0 and h. For each spot, if it's set to a, we gain a². The restrictions are that in each range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a problem where for each spot, I need to decide the height, but ensuring all the restrictions are satisfied. But since the constraints are on the maximum in ranges, it's tricky because one spot's height affects multiple ranges.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a graph where each spot's height is a variable, and the constraints are the restrictions. But that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the maximum allowed height for each spot based on all the restrictions that cover it. Because for a spot i, any restriction that includes i (as part of l_j to r_j) would impose a maximum height. So the effective maximum for spot i is the minimum of all x_j where l_j <= i <= r_j.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Because each spot i is covered by some restrictions. For each such restriction, the maximum allowed height for i is at most x_j. So the effective maximum for spot i is the minimum of all x_j across all restrictions that include i, and also the global h.\n\nBut wait, what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, each possibly lowering the maximum. So the maximum allowed for spot i is the minimum of all x_j for j where l_j <=i <=r_j, and also the global h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum possible height is min(h, min of x_j for all j where i is in [l_j, r_j}).\n\nSo first, I can precompute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height a_i as the minimum of x_j for all applicable restrictions, or h if no restrictions apply.\n\nWait, but some spots might not be covered by any restriction. For example, in the second sample, spot 1 has no restrictions, so its max height is h=10.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So step 1: for each spot i from 1 to n, find all the restrictions that include i in their [l, r] range. For each i, collect all x_j from these restrictions, then take the minimum of those x_j and h. That will be the maximum allowed height for spot i.\n\nOnce I have this a_i for each spot, I can then assign heights to each spot, each being as high as possible without exceeding a_i, to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nBecause the sum of squares is maximized when each element is as large as possible given the constraints. Because for a fixed sum, the sum of squares is maximized when the variables are as unequal as possible, but here it's the opposite; for each individual term, higher a_i gives more profit.\n\nSo for each spot, the optimal choice is to set it to a_i, right? Because increasing a_i increases the square.\n\nWait, yes. Because for a given spot, higher a_i (up to its maximum allowed) contributes more to the total. So the maximum profit is achieved by setting each spot to its maximum allowed a_i.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute a_i as the minimum of x_j for all restrictions that include i, and h.\n\n2. Then, for each spot i, set height[i] = a_i.\n\n3. Sum the squares of these heights.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me test against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → affects spot 1: x=1.\n\n2 2 3 → affects spot 2: x=3.\n\n3 3 2 → affects spot 3: x=2.\n\nSo for each spot:\n\nspot 1: min(1,3,2) but only the first restriction applies. So a_1 = 1.\n\nspot 2: only the second restriction, so 3.\n\nspot 3: third restriction, so 2.\n\nSum is 1 +9 +4 =14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 2-3, x=8.\n\nRestriction 2:3-4, x=7.\n\nSo for each spot:\n\nspot 1: no restrictions. a_1 =10.\n\nspot 2: covered by restriction 1. x=8.\n\nspot3: covered by both restrictions. So min(8",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given height restrictions. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and there are specific constraints on the maximum height allowed in certain ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: Each spot on the street can have a house of height between 0 and a given maximum height `h`. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of these heights.\n2. **Identify Restrictions**: For each spot, determine the maximum height allowed by considering all applicable restrictions. Each restriction specifies a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum height `x_i`, meaning the tallest house in that range must not exceed `x_i`.\n3. **Compute Effective Maximum Heights**: For each spot, the effective maximum height is the minimum of all `x_i` values from the restrictions that include this spot, as well as the global maximum height `h`.\n4. **Maximize Profit**: To maximize the profit, each spot should be assigned its computed effective maximum height, as this will yield the highest possible square contribution for that spot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_heights[i] = min_x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += max_heights[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. Each restriction is stored as a tuple.\n2. **Effective Maximum Heights Calculation**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, iterate through all restrictions. If a spot falls within the range of a restriction, update the effective maximum height to be the minimum of the current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: Sum the squares of the effective maximum heights for each spot to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit from the given spots. The solution efficiently computes the required maximum heights and calculates the profit in linear time relative to the number of spots and restrictions.",
