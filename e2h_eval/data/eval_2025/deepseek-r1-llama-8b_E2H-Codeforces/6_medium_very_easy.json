Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers for his vacation. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations sum exactly to x. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nHmm. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nEach voucher has li, ri, costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i != j) that don't overlap. They don't intersect if either ri < lj or rj < li. So they can't be overlapping at all. Their combined duration should be exactly x. And we need the sum of their costs to be as small as possible.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n2. For each of the next n lines, read li, ri, costi.\n3. Find all pairs of vouchers (i, j) where i != j, their durations add up to x, and they don't overlap.\n4. Among all such pairs, find the one with the minimal total cost.\n5. If no such pair exists, output -1. Otherwise, output the minimal cost.\n\nFirst thought: the straightforward approach would be to check all possible pairs of vouchers. But wait, n can be up to 2*10^5. Checking all O(n^2) pairs is way too slow—about 4e10 operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let's think about how to represent the data and find the required pairs efficiently.\n\nWhat defines a valid pair? Two conditions:\n\na) The sum of their durations is x. So, for voucher A with duration d, we need a voucher B with duration x - d.\n\nb) They don't overlap in time. So, for each voucher A, we need to find vouchers B that either end before A starts or start after A ends.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently find such B's?\n\nIdea: group vouchers by their duration. For each voucher A with duration d, look for vouchers with duration x - d. Then, among those, find those that don't overlap with A and have the minimal cost.\n\nBut even then, how to efficiently find the non-overlapping ones?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the vouchers. Each voucher is a time interval [li, ri]. For another voucher to not overlap, its interval must be entirely before or entirely after.\n\nSo for each voucher A (with duration d), we can split the problem into two cases:\n\nCase 1: The second voucher B ends before A starts. So, B's ri <= A's li - 1. The duration of B is x - d. We need to find all B's that satisfy this condition and have minimal cost.\n\nCase 2: The second voucher B starts after A ends. So, B's li >= A's ri + 1. Again, B's duration is x - d, and we need minimal cost.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can compute the required duration for B (x - d_A). Then, for each case, find the minimal cost B that meets the time condition.\n\nThe key is to pre-process the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly query, given a duration and a start or end time, what's the minimal cost voucher available.\n\nHmm, but how?\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible duration, keep track of all vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end times or start times. Then, for a given voucher A, when looking for B's in case 1, we can query all B's with duration x-d_A, and end time <= li_A - 1. Among these, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, find B's with duration x-d_A, and start time >= ri_A + 1. Find the minimal cost.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Also, for each duration, sort the vouchers based on end time and start time.\n\n- For each voucher A:\n   - Compute required duration d = x - (ri_A - li_A + 1).\n   - If d is negative, skip (since durations are positive).\n   - Look for vouchers B with duration d.\n   - For case 1: B must end before A starts. So B's ri <= li_A - 1. So in the list of B's, find those where ri <= li_A -1, and find the one with minimal cost.\n   - For case 2: B must start after A ends. So B's li >= ri_A +1. So in the list of B's, find those where li >= ri_A +1, and find the one with minimal cost.\n   - For both cases, if any B exists, calculate the total cost and track the minimum.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimal cost B in each case? Because for each A, we might have a lot of B's, but we need the one that doesn't overlap and has the minimal cost.\n\nIdea: For each duration, store the B's sorted by their end time. Then, for case 1, we can perform a binary search to find the largest B's end time <= li_A -1, and among those, find the minimal cost.\n\nBut that's tricky because even if B's end time is <= li_A -1, we need to find the one with the smallest cost. So perhaps, for each duration, we can pre-sort the B's by their end time and keep track of the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration, we can have two lists: one sorted by end time, and for each position, store the minimal cost up to that point. Similarly, for the start times, sorted in ascending order, and for each position, the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nWait, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess:\n\n   a. For each voucher, compute its duration (d = ri - li + 1).\n\n   b. Group vouchers by their duration into a dictionary, say duration_map. Each entry is a list of tuples (li, ri, costi).\n\n   c. For each duration in duration_map, process the list of vouchers to create two structures:\n\n      i. Sorted by end time (ri) in ascending order. For this sorted list, create an array min_cost_before that keeps track of the minimal cost up to each index. So min_cost_before[i] is the minimal cost in the first i+1 elements. This way, for a given maximum end time (say, e_max), we can binary search the largest index where ri <= e_max. Then, the minimal cost is min_cost_before[index].\n\n      ii. Sorted by start time (li) in ascending order. Create an array min_cost_after that keeps track of the minimal cost from each index to the end. So min_cost_after[i] is the minimal cost in elements from i to the end. This way, for a given minimum start time (say, s_min), we can binary search the first index where li >= s_min. Then, the minimal cost is min_cost_after[index].\n\n2. For each voucher A:\n\n   a. Compute d = x - (A.duration). If d <0, skip.\n\n   b. Check if d is present in duration_map. If not, skip.\n\n   c. For case 1: B must end before A's start.\n\n      i. The maximum end time allowed is li_A -1.\n\n      ii. Look into the sorted end list for vouchers with duration d. Use binary search to find the largest index where ri <= max_end.\n\n      iii. If found, get the minimal cost from min_cost_before at that index.\n\n      iv. If the minimal cost exists (i.e., there are some B's), add it to the possible candidates.\n\n   d. For case 2: B must start after A's end.\n\n      i. The minimum start time allowed is ri_A + 1.\n\n      ii. Look into the sorted start list for vouchers with duration d. Use binary search to find the first index where li >= min_start.\n\n      iii. If found, get the minimal cost from min_cost_after starting from that index.\n\n      iv. If any such B exists, add to candidates.\n\n   e. If any candidate exists for this A, update the global minimum.\n\n3. After processing all vouchers, if the global minimum is found, output it. Else, output -1.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, let's think about the data structures.\n\nImplementing this requires, for each duration, having two sorted lists (end and start) along with their respective min_cost arrays.\n\nHow to create these structures:\n\nFor each duration d in duration_map:\n\n- For the end-sorted list:\n\n   Sort the vouchers by ri in ascending order.\n\n   Create a prefix min_cost array. min_cost[0] = cost of first voucher. min_cost[i] = min(min_cost[i-1], current cost).\n\n- For the start-sorted list:\n\n   Sort the vouchers by li in ascending order.\n\n   Create a suffix min_cost array. min_cost[n-1] = cost of last voucher. min_cost[i] = min(current cost, min_cost[i+1]).\n\nNow, during processing each A:\n\nFor case 1:\n\nWe have a max_end = A.li -1.\n\nWe need to find all B's in duration d where B.ri <= max_end.\n\nIn the end-sorted list for d, perform a binary search to find the rightmost voucher with ri <= max_end.\n\nIf such a voucher exists, the minimal cost is min_cost_before up to that index.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nWe have a min_start = A.ri +1.\n\nWe need to find all B's in duration d where B.li >= min_start.\n\nIn the start-sorted list for d, perform a binary search to find the leftmost voucher with li >= min_start.\n\nIf such a voucher exists, the minimal cost is min_cost_after from that index onwards.\n\nOnce we have these, for each A, we can compute the minimal possible cost.\n\nBut wait, what about the same voucher being used twice? No, because i and j must be different. But since each A is processed, and for each case, B is another voucher, it's automatically handled.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- Vouchers with zero duration? No, because li <= ri implies ri - li +1 >=1.\n\n- What if x is less than the sum of two minimal durations? Wait, no. Because x is fixed, and for each A, d must be x - A.duration, which must be positive. So if x is less than A.duration, d becomes negative, which is invalid.\n\nAnother thing: vouchers can have the same duration but different times.\n\nAlso, the minimal cost could come from either case 1 or case 2.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3, cost 4\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2, cost5\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2, cost1\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2, cost4\n\nSo x=5.\n\nLooking for two vouchers whose durations sum to 5.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- Voucher1 (duration3) needs another duration2.\n\n- Voucher2 (d2) needs another d3, but none exist.\n\nSo only consider vouchers with d3 and d2.\n\nFor the first voucher (d3):\n\nCase1: B must end before 1-1=0? That's impossible since B's li is at least 1.\n\nSo no case1.\n\nCase2: B must start after 3+1=4.\n\nLooking for B's with d2, and li >=4.\n\nLooking at vouchers:\n\nVoucher3 has li=5, which is >=4. Its cost is 1.\n\nSo total cost is 4 + 1 =5.\n\nWhich is the sample's answer.\n\nAnother pair could be voucher2 and voucher3: voucher2 has d2, voucher3 also d2. Sum is 4, which is less than x=5.\n\nSo they don't contribute.\n\nSo the code correctly finds the minimal cost.\n\nAnother test case: when all vouchers have duration 3 and x=2. Then, no pairs can sum to 2, so output is -1.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nWe'll need to handle large n (up to 2e5), so the solution must be O(n log n) time.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read each voucher, compute duration, and store in a list.\n\n3. Group vouchers by their duration into a dictionary, say duration_map. For each d in duration_map, collect all vouchers.\n\n4. For each duration d in duration_map, process the list:\n\n   a. Sort by ri (for end-sorted list) and create the min_cost_before array.\n\n   b. Sort by li (for start-sorted list) and create the min_cost_after array.\n\n5. Initialize the minimal cost as infinity.\n\n6. Iterate over each voucher A:\n\n   a. Compute d_needed = x - (A.duration).\n\n   b. If d_needed <=0, skip.\n\n   c. If d_needed not in duration_map, skip.\n\n   d. Get the end-sorted list and min_cost_before for d_needed.\n\n   e. For case1: find max_end = A.li -1.\n\n      i. In end-sorted list, find the rightmost index where ri <= max_end.\n\n      ii. If index >=0, get the minimal cost from min_cost_before[index].\n\n      iii. Update the global minimal cost if this cost is lower.\n\n   f. For case2: find min_start = A.ri +1.\n\n      i. In start-sorted list, find the leftmost index where li >= min_start.\n\n      ii. If index < len(list), get the minimal cost from min_cost_after[index].\n\n      iii. Update the global minimal cost if this cost is lower.\n\n7. After all A's are processed, if the minimal cost is still infinity, output -1. Else, output the minimal cost.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search correctly is crucial.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help.\n\nFor case1, for end-sorted list:\n\nWe want the largest ri <= max_end.\n\nbisect_right returns the insertion point, so indices go up to that point -1.\n\nSimilarly, for case2, we want the first li >= min_start.\n\nbisect_left returns the first index where li >= min_start.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor case1:\n\nimport bisect\n\nmax_end = A_li -1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(end_list_ri, max_end) -1\n\nif index >=0:\n\n   current_min = min_cost_before[index]\n\n   if current_min < global_min:\n\n      global_min = current_min\n\nSimilarly, for case2:\n\nmin_start = A_ri +1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(start_list_li, min_start)\n\nif index < len(start_list):\n\n   current_min = min_cost_after[index]\n\n   if current_min < global_min:\n\n      global_min = current_min\n\nWait, but for the start_list, the list is sorted by li in ascending order. So, for a given min_start, we find the first index where li >= min_start. All elements from that index onwards are candidates. The min_cost_after array gives the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures:\n\nEach duration's data will consist of:\n\n- end_sorted: list of (ri, cost)\nWait, no. Wait, the vouchers are stored as tuples (li, ri, costi). So for end_sorted, we can sort them by their ri, and for each, store the cost.\n\nSo, for each duration d:\n\nend_list = sorted list of (ri, cost) in ascending order of ri.\n\nBut wait, actually, when sorting, we just need the ri, but for each, we can keep the cost.\n\nSo, for each voucher in the duration group, we can create a tuple (ri, cost).\n\nThen, sort this list based on ri.\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list, it's sorted by li.\n\nOnce sorted, create the min_cost_before and min_cost_after arrays.\n\nWait, but for the end_list, we have a list of (ri, cost). So when sorted, we can extract the costs in order.\n\nSame for the start_list.\n\nNow, for the end_list, the min_cost_before array is built as follows:\n\nAfter sorting, for each i from 0 to len(end_list)-1:\n\nif i ==0:\n\n   min_cost_before.append(cost)\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_before[i] = min(min_cost_before[i-1], cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list, min_cost_after is built from the end:\n\nstart_list is sorted by li.\n\nstart_list is a list of (li, cost).\n\nWe can reverse it, create a min_cost_after array.\n\nWait, no. Let's think.\n\nstart_list is sorted in ascending order of li.\n\nWe need, for each position i, the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\nSo, for i = len(start_list) -1, min_cost_after[i] = cost.\n\nFor i = len-2, min_cost_after[i] = min(start_list[i].cost, min_cost_after[i+1])\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each d in duration_map:\n\n   # process end_list\n   end_list = sorted(voucher for voucher in duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n   # end_list now contains (ri, cost), sorted by ri\n   min_cost_before = []\n   current_min = float('inf')\n   for voucher in end_list:\n       current_min = min(current_min, voucher[1])\n       min_cost_before.append(current_min)\n   \n   # process start_list\n   start_list = sorted(voucher for voucher in duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n   # start_list contains (li, cost), sorted by li\n   min_cost_after = [float('inf')] * len(start_list)\n   if len(start_list) >0:\n       current_min = float('inf')\n       for i in reversed(range(len(start_list))):\n           current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i][1])\n           min_cost_after[i] = current_min\n\nWait, wait. Wait, for start_list, when sorted by li, the list is in order of increasing li.\n\nSo for min_cost_after, we need for each index i, the minimal cost in start_list[i...end].\n\nSo, we can loop from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the current minimal cost.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for each A, when processing:\n\nCompute d_needed = x - A.duration.\n\nIf d_needed not in duration_map, continue.\n\nElse, get the end_list and min_cost_before for d_needed.\n\nCompute max_end = A.li -1.\n\nFind the rightmost index in end_list where ri <= max_end.\n\nIf index >=0, the minimal cost is min_cost_before[index].\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list, compute min_start = A.ri +1.\n\nFind the leftmost index in start_list where li >= min_start.\n\nIf index < len(start_list), the minimal cost is min_cost_after[index].\n\nSo, for each A, we can compute these two possibilities and update the global_min.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial setup.\n\nWe can create a variable global_min initialized to a very high value, like infinity.\n\nAs we process each A, for each case, we check if the current possible cost is lower than global_min, and update accordingly.\n\nNow, what about when a voucher is in both case1 and case2? Like, for a certain A, it's possible that there are B's in both cases, and we need to take the minimal of both.\n\nYes, the code handles that because for each case, it checks and updates the global_min.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures for the duration_map.\n\nEach voucher is a tuple (li, ri, costi).

So yes.\n\nWait, but for a duration d, if it's in duration_map, it's preprocessed.\n\nNow, testing this logic.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nTest Case 1: n=2, x= sum of durations.\n\nVouchers:\n\nV1: l=1, r=2, cost=5 → duration 2.\n\nV2: l=3, r=4, cost=10 → duration 2.\n\nSum is 4, x=4.\n\nThey don't overlap. So the minimal cost is 15.\n\nBut wait, x=4. So the sum of durations is 4.\n\nBut in the code, for each voucher:\n\nProcessing V1:\n\nd_needed =4-2=2.\n\nCheck if d=2 exists.\n\nCase1: B must end before 1-1=0 → impossible.\n\nCase2: B must start after 2+1=3.\n\nLooking for B's with d=2 and li >=3.\n\nV2 has li=3, so it's included.\n\ncost_b is 10.\n\nTotal cost 5+10=15.\n\nProcessing V2:\n\nd_needed=4-2=2.\n\nCase1: B must end before 3-1=2.\n\nLooking for B's with d=2 and ri <=2.\n\nV1 has ri=2. So cost 5.\n\nTotal 10+5=15.\n\nSo the minimal is 15.\n\nSo the code should correctly find this.\n\nAnother Test Case: x=3, vouchers:\n\nV1: 1-2 (d=2), cost 5.\n\nV2: 3-4 (d=2), cost 10.\n\nSum is 4, not 3. So no solution.\n\nBut if x is 4, then yes.\n\nAnother Edge Case: x is 0. But according to the problem statement, x is >=2, because n>=2, but wait, in the problem statement, n can be 2, x can be as low as 2?\n\nWait, problem says n and x are >=2? Or n can be 2, x can be 1? Let me check the input constraints.\n\nProblem statement says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105.\n\nSo x is at least 2.\n\nSo no need to handle x=0.\n\nAnother case: Vouchers that completely include others.\n\nV1: 1-5 (d=5), cost 100.\n\nV2: 1-3 (d=3), cost 50.\n\nx=8. So sum durations 5+3=8.\n\nBut they are overlapping, so they cannot be chosen. So the code should not select them.\n\nBut suppose there is V3: 4-6 (d=3), cost 20.\n\nThen, V1 and V3: durations 5+3=8.\n\nV1's li is 1, V3's li is4. So V3 starts after V1 ends? V1 ends at 5, V3 starts at4. So they overlap (V3 starts before V1 ends). So cannot choose.\n\nSo the code will not consider them.\n\nThus, the code correctly ignores overlapping vouchers.\n\nNow, considering the code's efficiency.\n\nFor each voucher A, we perform two binary searches, each taking O(log k) time, where k is the number of vouchers with d_needed.\n\nSince n is up to 2e5, and each step is O(log n), the total time is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → d=3.\n\n1 2 5 → d=2.\n\n5 6 1 →d=2.\n\n1 2 4 →d=2.\n\nSo duration_map:\n\n3: [(1,3,4)]\n\n2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\nPreprocessing for d=3:\n\nend_list is sorted by ri:\n\nOnly one voucher: (1,3,4). end_ri_cost is [(3,4)], min_cost_before is [4].\n\nstart_list: [(1,3,4)], sorted by li. min_cost_after is [4].\n\nFor d=2:\n\nend_list: sorted by ri.\n\nVouchers:\n\n(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4).\n\nSorted by ri: [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)].\n\nBecause for (1,2,5) and (1,2,4), ri is same, but cost is higher for first.\n\nWait, no, when sorted by ri, the order is same as the input, but for same ri, the order depends on their original positions. But for min_cost_before, the minimal cost is considered.\n\nWait, in the end_list for d=2, the three vouchers are:\n\nvoucher2: (1,2,5) → (ri=2, cost5)\n\nvoucher3: (5,6,1) → (ri=6, cost1)\n\nvoucher4: (1,2,4) → (ri=2, cost4)\n\nWhen sorted by ri, the order is:\n\nvoucher2 (ri=2), voucher4 (ri=2), voucher3 (ri=6).\n\nSo end_ri_cost is [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)].\n\nThen, min_cost_before is:\n\n5, then min(5,4)=4, then min(4,1)=1.\n\nSo min_cost_before is [5,4,1].\n\nFor the start_list:\n\nsorted by li.\n\nvoucher2 (li=1), voucher4 (li=1), voucher3 (li=5).\n\nso start_list is [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)].\n\nmin_cost_after is computed from the end.\n\nStart from the last element (5,1): cost 1.\n\nThen previous: min(4,1) →1.\n\nThen first: min(5,1) →1.\n\nSo min_cost_after is [1,1,1].\n\nSo for each A:\n\nTake A as the first voucher (1,3,4), d=3.\n\nd_needed=5-3=2.\n\nCheck for case1: B must end before 1-1=0. So no.\n\ncase2: B must start after 3+1=4.\n\nLooking for d=2, start_list.\n\nstart_list is [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)].\n\nli_list is [1,1,5].\n\nWe're looking for li >=4.\n\nbisect_left on li_list for 4: returns index 2.\n\nmin_start_cost[2] is 1.\n\nSo cost_b is 1.\n\nTotal cost is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is the minimal.\n\nAnother A is voucher3: (5,6,1), d=2.\n\nd_needed=5-2=3.\n\nCheck for case1: B must end before5-1=4.\n\nLooking for d=3.\n\nIn duration_map, d=3 exists.\n\nSo for case1:\n\nmax_end=5-1=4.\n\nLooking for B's with d=3, ri <=4.\n\nIn end_list for d=3, which is [(3,4)].\n\nri is 3 <=4.\n\nSo cost_b is4.\n\nTotal cost is1+4=5.\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nSo the code correctly captures both possibilities.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the case where multiple B's exist for case1 or case2, and the minimal cost is correctly found.\n\n- Overflow or incorrect min handling.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nBut considering the sample input, the code should return 5.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, x=3.\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 2 10 →d=2.\n\n2 3 20 →d=2.\n\nsum is4>3.\n\nNo solution.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals a given value \\( x \\) and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each voucher has a start day, end day, and cost. The duration of a voucher is the number of days it spans, calculated as `end - start + 1`. We need to find two vouchers whose durations sum to exactly \\( x \\) and do not overlap in time.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each voucher, we can compute the required duration of the second voucher needed to sum up to \\( x \\). We then check if such a voucher exists that does not overlap with the current voucher and has the minimum cost.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: To efficiently find the required vouchers, we preprocess the vouchers by their duration. For each duration, we maintain two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end day, which helps in finding vouchers ending before a certain day.\n   - Another sorted by the start day, which helps in finding vouchers starting after a certain day.\n   \n4. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, we create two lists:\n   - A list sorted by the end day, along with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - A list sorted by the start day, along with a suffix minimum cost array.\n\n5. **Binary Search**: For each voucher, we use binary search on the preprocessed lists to quickly find the minimal cost voucher that meets the non-overlapping condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        vouchers.append((l, r, c))\n        index += 3\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        d = v[1] - v[0] + 1\n        duration_map[d].append(v)\n    \n    preprocessed = {}\n    for d in duration_map:\n        # Process end_list: sorted by ri, min_cost_before computed\n        end_list = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_ri_cost = [(v[1], v[2]) for v in end_list]\n        end_ri_cost.sort()\n        min_cost_before = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for (ri, cost) in end_ri_cost:\n            current_min = min(current_min, cost)\n            min_cost_before.append(current_min)\n        \n        # Process start_list: sorted by li, min_cost_after computed\n        start_list = sorted(duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_li_cost = [(v[0], v[2]) for v in start_list]\n        start_li_cost.sort()\n        min_cost_after = [float('inf')] * len(start_li_cost)\n        if len(start_li_cost) > 0:\n            current_min = float('inf')\n            for i in reversed(range(len(start_li_cost))):\n                current_min = min(current_min, start_li_cost[i][1])\n                min_cost_after[i] = current_min\n        \n        preprocessed[d] = {\n            'end': end_ri_cost,\n            'min_end_cost': min_cost_before,\n            'start': start_li_cost,\n            'min_start_cost': min_cost_after\n        }\n    \n    global_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for A in vouchers:\n        li, ri, cost_a = A\n        d_a = ri - li + 1\n        d_needed = x - d_a\n        if d_needed <= 0:\n            continue\n        if d_needed not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        \n        # Case 1: B ends before A starts\n        max_end = li - 1\n        if max_end >= 0:\n            end_data = preprocessed[d_needed]\n            end_ri_cost = end_data['end']\n            min_end_cost = end_data['min_end_cost']\n            ri_list = [x[0] for x in end_ri_cost]\n            idx = bisect.bisect_right(ri_list, max_end) - 1\n            if idx >= 0:\n                total_cost = cost_a + min_end_cost[idx]\n                if total_cost < global_min:\n                    global_min = total_cost\n        \n        # Case 2: B starts after A ends\n        min_start = ri + 1\n        start_data = preprocessed[d_needed]\n        start_li_cost = start_data['start']\n        min_start_cost = start_data['min_start_cost']\n        li_list = [x[0] for x in start_li_cost]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(li_list, min_start)\n        if idx < len(li_list):\n            total_cost = cost_a + min_start_cost[idx]\n            if total_cost < global_min:\n                global_min = total_cost\n    \n    if global_min != float('inf'):\n        print(global_min)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Duration Grouping**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by end day and start day, and minimum cost arrays are precomputed for efficient lookups.\n4. **Finding Pairs**: For each voucher, the required duration for a complementary voucher is computed.
