Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer between -x and x, inclusive. He found some of them, and he wants the sum of all found cards plus the ones he needs to find to be zero. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me n (number of found cards) and x (the maximum absolute value). Then there's a list of n integers, each between -x and x.\n\nI need to compute how many more cards he needs to find so that the total sum is zero. And the goal is to find the minimal number possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because each new card can contribute any integer from -x to x. But since we're trying to minimize the number, we want each new card to contribute as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\nLet me think: the initial sum is S = sum of the found cards. The target is 0, so the required sum from the additional cards is -S.\n\nEach additional card can add a value between -x and x. To reach the required sum with as few cards as possible, we should maximize each card's contribution. That means using the largest possible values in absolute terms.\n\nSo, for example, if the required sum is 5 and x is 3, then the minimal number of cards would be 2: one +3 and another +2.\n\nBut wait, the required sum could be negative. For instance, if the sum is -7 and x is 3, the minimal number is 3: -3, -3, -1.\n\nWait no, maybe not. Let's see: 3*(-3) is -9, which is less than -7. So perhaps it's better to take -3, -3, and +1: sum is -7. So yeah, that's 3 cards.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. The required sum from the additional cards is T = -S.\n3. We need to find the minimal k such that T can be expressed as a sum of k terms, each in [-x, x], and each term can be any integer within that range.\n\nHow do we find the minimal k?\n\nWell, the maximum possible contribution per card is x (if T is positive) or -x (if T is negative). So, the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor example, T=7, x=3: 7/3 is ~2.333, so ceiling is 3. But 3*3 is 9, which is more than 7. Wait, but we can use 3,3,1 to get 7. So 3 cards.\n\nAnother example: T=6, x=3: exactly 2 cards.\n\nWait, T=5, x=3: 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceiling is 2. 3+2=5, so yes.\n\nWhat about T=4, x=3: 4/3 is ~1.333, so ceiling is 2. 3+1=4, so yes.\n\nNow, what if T is negative? Like T=-7, x=3: same logic, absolute value is 7, so 3 cards.\n\nSo yes, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but wait: what if T is zero? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to make the sum equal to zero. If the initial sum is already zero, then no cards are needed.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the given cards.\n2. T = -S. So the sum of the additional cards must be T.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k as the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T = -2.\n\n|T| is 2. x is 2. 2/2=1, so minimal k is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. So T is 4.\n\nx is 3. |T|=4. 4/3 is 1.333, ceiling is 2. So 2 cards are needed. Each can contribute 3, but 3+1 is 4. Or 2+2. Either way, 2 cards.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if S is 0? Then T is 0, so no cards needed.\n\nAnother test case: S=5, x=3. T=-5. So |T|=5. 5/3 is ~1.666, so k=2. Because 3+2=5? No, wait, wait: T is -5. So each card can contribute at most -3 each. So two cards would give -3 *2 = -6 < -5. So that's too low. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, when T is positive, the cards can contribute up to x each. When T is negative, they can contribute down to -x each.\n\nWait, no, T is the sum needed. So if T is positive, each card contributes a positive number, up to x. If T is negative, each card contributes a negative number, down to -x.\n\nSo in the case where T is positive, each card adds up to x, so the minimal k is ceil(T/x).\n\nWhen T is negative, each card can subtract up to x, so the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the earlier example where T is 5, x is 3: 5/3 is ~1.666, so k=2. Because 3+2=5.\n\nIf T is -5 and x is 3: each card can contribute -3 each. So two cards would give -6, which is less than -5. So that's not enough. So we need three cards: -3, -3, -(-1) ??? Wait, no: T is -5, so the sum of the added cards must be -5. So each card can contribute as little as -3 each. So three cards: -3, -3, -(-1)? Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the added cards is T.\n\nSo for T=-5:\n\nWe need three cards: -3, -3, -(-1) is not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the sum of three cards needs to be -5. So each card can be as low as -3. So let's see:\n\nOption 1: -3, -3, -(-1) → sum is -3-3+1= -5. Yes, that's correct. So that's 3 cards.\n\nAlternatively, using two cards: can we do it? Let's see: the maximum sum in two cards is 2*3=6. So to reach -5, we can have 3 and 2, but that's positive. Wait no. Wait, if T is -5, the sum of the two cards must be -5. Each card can be at least -3. So the sum can be as low as -6. So for two cards, the sum can be -5.\n\nWait, wait: 3 is the maximum x. So each card can be at most 3 in absolute value.\n\nSo for T=-5, x=3: can two cards achieve it?\n\nLet's think: each card can contribute -3 or higher. So first card is -3, second card is -2. Sum is -5. So yes, two cards.\n\nAh, right. So why didn't I think of that earlier. So in that case, the minimal k is 2.\n\nSo my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to my initial approach, |T| is 5, x is 3, 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceil is 2. Which is correct.\n\nWait, in this case, two cards are sufficient. So initial approach works.\n\nWait, but why? Because 5 is larger than 3, so 2 cards are needed.\n\nWait, but what about T=4, x=3.\n\n4 is larger than 3, so 2 cards. One 3 and one 1: sum is 4.\n\nAnother example: T=6, x=3: 2 cards, each 3.\n\nSo my initial approach holds.\n\nWait, but in the previous scenario where T=-5 and x=3, the sum can be achieved with two cards: -3 and -2.\n\nSo the initial approach works because |T|=5, x=3, 5/3 is ~1.666, ceil is 2.\n\nSo why did I think earlier that three cards were needed? Because I thought that each card could contribute a maximum of -3, but you can also have higher contributions.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of the absolute value of T divided by x.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute S = sum of the found cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute abs(T) divided by x, and take the ceiling of that.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T ==0: print 0.\n\nElse: compute k = (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, let me test this with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nList is [-1,1,2]. Sum S=2. T=-2. abs(T)=2. 2/2=1. So k=1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3.\n\nList is [-2,-2]. Sum S=-4. T=4. abs(T)=4. 4/3 is 1.333. ceil is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: T=5, x=3. 5/3=1.666, ceil is 2.\n\nAnother case: T=6, x=3: 6/3=2, so 2.\n\nAnother case: T=7, x=3: 7/3 is 2.333, so 3.\n\nWait, but 3*3=9>7. So can we make 7 with 3 cards?\n\nYes: 3,3,1.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nAnother test case: T= -5, x=3. As above, 5/3=1.666, ceil is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems solid.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nT = -S.\n\nIf T is zero: print 0.\n\nElse: compute k = (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint k.\n\nBut wait, what if T is not zero, but after adding the required cards, the sum is zero?\n\nYes, that's exactly what we're ensuring.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, x=1.\n\nFound card is 0. So S=0. T=0. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, x=1. Found card is 1. S=1. T=-1. So k=1.\n\nBecause 1 is within x.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, x=1, found card is -1. S=-1. T=1. So k=1.\n\nAnother edge case: S=3, x=1. T=-3. So k=3.\n\nBecause each card can only contribute -1, so 3 cards.\n\nAnother case: S=4, x=3. T=-4. So 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. So two cards: -3 and -1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nAnother edge case: what if T is zero but the initial sum is zero. So no cards needed.\n\nAnother case: S=0. T=0. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: S=0, but x is something else. But the sum is zero regardless of x.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nSo, now, writing the code.\n\nWe'll read the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum.\n\nCompute T.\n\nHandle zero case.\n\nElse, compute k.\n\nPrint k.\n\nIn code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting it against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 2\\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is 2, t is -2. abs is 2. 2//2=1. So output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 2 3\\n-2 -2.\n\nsum is -4, t is4. 4//3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. So output 2.\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=1, card is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother: n=1, x=1, card is 1. Output 1.\n\nAnother: n=2, x=3, cards are [3,3]. sum is 6. t is -6. 6//3=2. So output 2.\n\nAnother: n=2, x=3, cards are [3,3]. t is -6. So k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=3, cards are [3,0]. sum is3. t is -3. 3//3=1. So output 1.\n\nYes, because you can add a -3.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards. This is because we want the total sum (found cards + additional cards) to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, and we can directly output zero.\n4. **Compute Minimum Additional Cards**: If the target sum is not zero, calculate the minimum number of additional cards required. Each additional card can contribute a value between -x and x (inclusive). The minimal number of cards is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by x and taking the ceiling of this division. This ensures that each card contributes as much as possible towards balancing the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` of the cards. It then reads the integers on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n- **Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n- **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the output is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n- **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is non-zero, the minimum number of additional cards is calculated using integer arithmetic to ensure we take the ceiling of the division of the target sum's absolute value by `x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
