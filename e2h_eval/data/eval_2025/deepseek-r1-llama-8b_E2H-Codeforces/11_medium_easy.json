A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make, given the constraints on the available resources.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. All positive integers, not exceeding 1000.\n\nWait, what do these variables represent?\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters. So total drink is k * l ml.\nc: number of limes cut into d slices each. So total lime slices are c * d.\np: grams of salt available.\nnl: milliliters of drink each friend needs per toast.\nnp: grams of salt each friend needs per toast.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- For each friend: one slice of lime.\n- Each friend: nl ml of drink.\n- Each friend: np grams of salt.\n\nSo for all friends making t toasts, the total required is:\n- Drink: n * t * nl ml.\n- Lime slices: n * t * 1 (since each toast per friend needs one slice). Because there are c*d total slices.\n- Salt: n * t * np grams. Because each toast per friend uses np grams.\n\nWe need to find the maximum t such that all three resources are sufficient.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l.\n2. total_lime_slices = c * d.\n3. total_salt = p.\n\nThen compute:\n\nmax_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\nmax_toasts_by_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThe maximum possible toasts t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, because for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed are n * t. So yes, max_toasts_by_lime is (c*d) // (n).\n\nSimilarly, drink required is n * t * nl, so t can't exceed (total_drink) / (n * nl). And salt is n * t * np, so t can't exceed p/(n * np).\n\nSo the overall t is the minimum of these three calculated values.\n\nOnce we have t, that's the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input line as a list of integers.\n- Compute the three constraints.\n- Find the minimum of those three, then output it.\n\nLet me think about the sample input to test.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n=3, nl=3 → 20/(3*3)=20/9=2.222, so floor is 2.\ntotal_lime_slices=10*8=80. 80/3=26.666, floor 26.\nsalt: 100/(3*1)=33.333, floor 33.\nSo the min of 2,26,33 is 2. Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink=100*10=1000. n=5, nl=4 → 1000/(5*4)=50.\nLime: 1*19=19 slices. 19/5=3.8 → 3.\nSalt:90/(5*3)=6.\nMin is 3.\n\nThird sample:\n\nInput:10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\ntotal_drink=1000*1000=1e6. n=10, nl=50 → 1e6/(10*50)=20.\nLime:25*23=575 slices. 575/10=57.5 →57.\nSalt:1/(10*1)=0.1 →0.\nSo the min is 0.\n\nYes, which matches the output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead the input as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(t)\n\nWait, but wait: what if any of the denominators are zero? But the problem states that all inputs are positive integers, so n, nl, np are at least 1. So division by zero isn't a problem.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where all resources are just enough.\n\nE.g., n=1, k=1, l=5, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=5, np=1.\n\nTotal_drink=5. n=1, nl=5 → 5/(1*5)=1.\nLime:1*1=1/1=1.\nSalt:1/(1*1)=1.\nt=1.\n\nAnother case where one resource limits.\n\nE.g., n=2, k=4, l=2 → total_drink=8. nl=3 → 8/(2*3)=1.333 →1.\nc=5, d=2 →10 slices. 10//2=5.\np=2, np=1 →2/(2*1)=1.\nt=1.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nSo, the Python code would be straightforward.\n\nRead the eight integers.\n\nCompute the three constraints.\n\nTake the min and print.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into integers.\n\nCalculate each constraint.\n\nFind the minimum.\n\nPrint as string.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the outputs are strings. Oh, no, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the outputs are strings like '2', '3', '0'.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"Print a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\"\n\nSo the output is an integer, but in the samples, they are printed as strings. But in Python, when you print an integer, it's converted to a string automatically.\n\nSo the code as written will output the correct integer, which will be correctly printed as a string.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think that's all. So the code reads the input, computes the three constraints, takes the min, and prints it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Input Variables**: We are given the number of friends (n), the number of bottles of drink (k), the volume of drink per bottle (l), the number of limes (c), the number of slices per lime (d), the total weight of salt (p), the volume of drink needed per toast per friend (nl), and the weight of salt needed per toast per friend (np).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: The total volume of drink available is `k * l`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - **Salt**: The total weight of salt available is `p`.\n\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink is `(total_drink) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices Limit**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on lime slices is `(total_lime_slices) // n`.\n   - **Salt Limit**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Compute the Result**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three computed limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line of integers and split into individual variables.\n- **Calculating Total Resources**: We compute the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n- **Determining Limits**: For each resource, we calculate how many toasts can be made based on that resource alone.\n- **Finding the Result**: The result is the smallest value among the three calculated limits, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and using integer division to handle resource constraints.",
