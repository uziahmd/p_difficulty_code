Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. Hmm. So, when he lights a candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. But he can take 'b' of these burnt candles and make a new one. The question is to find out how many total hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nWait, so the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle gives one hour. Then, after burning them, he can collect the stubs (burnt out candles). For every 'b' stubs, he gets one more candle which can be burned again.\n\nSo, the process is: burn all a candles, then use the resulting stubs to create new ones as long as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nLet's take the example given. Input is 4 2.\n\nHe burns 4 candles, getting 4 stubs. Then, he can make 4/2=2 new candles. Burn those, adding 2 stubs, now he has 4-2 (from previous) + 2 = 4 stubs again. Wait, no: wait, after burning the 2 new candles, he adds 2 stubs. So from 4, he makes 2, which are burned, giving another 2 stubs. Now he has 4 - 2 (used) + 2 (new stubs) = 4 stubs again? No, wait: let's see step by step.\n\nWait, initial a=4, b=2.\n\nBurn all 4: time increases by 4. Stubs:4.\n\nNow, 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. Time +=2 → total 6. Stubs used: 2*1=2 (since each new candle is burned once). So stubs after making and burning: 4 - 2 (from making) + 2 (from burning) → 4. So he can do this again.\n\nWait, but 4 /2 is 2 again. So burn 2, add 2 stubs. Total time becomes 6+2=8? But the sample says 7. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the sample says input 4 2 gives output 7.\n\nHmm, let's re-examine the note.\n\nIn the first sample, four candles are burned (4 hours). Then, the four stubs are made into two new candles. When burned, they give two more hours. So now, after that, he has two stubs left. Because 2 burned candles produce 2 stubs. So total stubs after second burn: 2.\n\nWait, no: initial a=4. After burning, he has 4 stubs. He uses 4 /2=2 new candles. So he burns those 2, which takes 2 more hours. Now, the stubs from those 2 are 2. So total time is 4+2=6. But according to the sample, it's 7. Wait, perhaps there's another step.\n\nAh, right! Because after burning the two new candles, he has two stubs, which is less than b=2. So he can't make any more. So total is 6. But sample says 7. So I must have misunderstood the process.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-read the note:\n\n\"For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\"\n\nWait, so the steps are:\n\n1. Burn 4 candles → 4 hours. Stubs:4.\n2. Make 2 new candles from 4 stubs → 2 hours. Stubs: 0 (because 4 were used to make 2, and then 2 are burned, leaving 0? Or wait, maybe the stubs are kept as leftovers.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nEach time he collects stubs, he can exchange them for new candles. Each new candle requires 'b' stubs, and when burned, produces one stub.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- total_hours = a\n- stubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles  # because each new candle, when burned, adds one stub.\n\nSo let's apply this to the example where a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial: total=4, stubs=4.\n\nFirst iteration: stubs >=2.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 6. stub",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a stub. Vasily can convert these stubs into new candles, which can be burned again as long as he has enough stubs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. For each new candle made from `b` stubs, add the corresponding hours and update the number of stubs accordingly.\n3. **Recycling Process**: Continue recycling stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to form another candle. Each time new candles are formed, they contribute to the total hours and generate more stubs when burned.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently calculates the total hours by iterating through the stub conversion process until no more candles can be formed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n2. **Stub Recycling**: Using a loop, we check if the collected stubs can be converted into new candles. If so, calculate how many new candles can be made (`new = stubs // b`), add these to the total hours, and update the stub count to reflect the leftover stubs after conversion plus the stubs from burning the new candles.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when there are not enough stubs to form another candle. The total hours accumulated by this point is the maximum time Vasily can keep his room illuminated.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use every possible stub to maximize the illumination time, making it both efficient and easy to understand.",
