    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible substring, I need to check if it appears more than once, and keep track of the maximum length where this happens.\n\nFirst, I think about how to approach this. One way is to generate all possible substrings of the string, then for each possible length, starting from the largest possible, check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we start checking from the largest possible lengths, the first time we find a substring that meets the condition, that's our answer. It's efficient because we don't need to check smaller lengths once we find the maximum.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears at least twice in the string.\n4. If such a substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nThe string can be up to 100 characters long. So the maximum possible substring length is 99 (since a substring needs to appear at least twice, but wait, no, the substring can be of length 1 and appear twice, but maybe longer ones are better).\n\nWait, for example, the string 'aaaaa' has a substring 'aaa' that appears multiple times. So, the maximum possible substring length is len(s) - 1? Or perhaps len(s) // 2? Hmm, not sure. But to cover all possibilities, I should check from the largest possible L down to 1.\n\nSo for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, because for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N-1. Because if the entire string was repeated, but that's only possible if N >= 2*L? Wait, no. Wait, no, for example, 'ababa' is length 5. The substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping. So L can be 3, which is (5-1)/2 + 1? Not sure. But the point is, the maximum L can be up to len(s)-1, because even a single character repeated would have L=1, but maybe longer substrings exist.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s) - 1 down to 1:\n   For each possible starting index i, extract substring s[i:i+L]\n   Store these substrings in a set or a dictionary\n   Then, for each new substring, check if it's already in the set. If yes, return L as the maximum.\n   Otherwise, add it to the set.\nIf no such L is found after checking all, then the answer is 0? Wait, but the problem says the string is non-empty, but what if all characters are unique? Like 'abcd'? Then the maximum substring is 0, since no substring appears twice.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → output is 0. Because no substring repeats.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → output is 3. Because 'aba' appears twice.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → output is 2. Because 'zz' appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2), and also 'z' appears three times, but the maximum is 2.\n\nSo, the code needs to find the maximum L where such a substring exists, and return 0 if no such substring exists.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, 'zzz' gives 2. So for L=2, the substring 'zz' appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So in the code, when L=2 is processed, we find a duplicate, so we return 2.\n\nSo in the code, for each L from the maximum possible down to 1, check if any substring of length L appears at least twice. Once we find such an L, return it immediately.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all Ls, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's outline the code:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substring = s[i:i+L]\n        if substring in seen:\n            # Found a duplicate, return L\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substring)\n    # After checking all i, if no duplicates for this L, continue.\n\nAfter all Ls, print 0.\n\nWait, but wait: the loop for L starts from len(s)-1 down to 1. But for example, if the string is 'aaaaa', len(s) is 5. So L starts at 4.\n\nFor L=4, the possible substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So when i=0, substring is 'aaaa', add to seen. Then i=1, substring is 'aaaa' which is in seen → return 4.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for L=4, i ranges from 0 to 5-4=1 (so i=0 and 1). For i=0, substring is s[0:4], which is 'aaaa'. Then i=1, substring is s[1:5], which is also 'aaaa'. So when i=1, it's in seen, so return 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'zzz' → len=3.\n\nLoop L from 2 down.\n\nFor L=2:\n\ni can be 0 and 1.\n\nsubstring at i=0 is 'zz'; i=1 is 'zz' → so when i=1, it's in seen → return 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about 'ababa' → len=5.\n\nL=4: possible substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates.\n\nSo proceed to L=3.\n\nCheck substrings:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bab'\n\ni=2: 'aba'\n\nWhen i=2, substring is 'aba' which was added at i=0. So return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → the maximum L is 3, as 'abc' appears twice.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but let's see another case: 'abacab'.\n\nWait, the string is 'a','b','a','c','a','b'.\n\nPossible substrings of length 3:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bac'\n\ni=2: 'aca'\n\ni=3: 'cab'\n\ni=4: 'aba' again. So when i=4, substring is 'aba', which was added at i=0. So for L=3, it returns 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nWhat about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: empty string? But the problem says the string is non-empty, so no need.\n\nCase 2: single character, like 'a'. Then L=0, but according to the code, the loop doesn't run (since len(s)-1 is 0, and the loop is from len(s)-1 (0) down to 1, which is not entered). So the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, for 'a', the maximum possible L is 1? Or no, because a substring must appear at least twice. Since the length is 1, and the string is only one 'a', it can't appear twice. So the code correctly returns 0.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' → the maximum L is 1. Because the substring 'a' appears twice. So when L=1, i=0: 'a' added. i=1: 'a' is in seen → return 1.\n\nWait, in the code, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1): for len(s)=2, len(s)-1 is 1. So L starts at 1, then stops. So in this case, L=1 is processed. i runs from 0 to 2-1=1.\n\nAt i=0, substring 'a' is added. At i=1, substring 'a' is in seen → return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but in the code, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, for len(s)=2, len(s)-1 is 1. So the range is from 1 down to 1, so only L=1 is considered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba'.\n\nCheck L=3: substrings 'abb' and 'bba' → no duplicates.\n\nThen L=2: 'ab', 'bb', 'ba' → no duplicates.\n\nThen L=1: 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a' → when i=0, 'a' is added. i=1, 'b' added. i=2, 'b' is in seen → return 1.\n\nBut wait, there's a longer substring. Wait, 'bb' is length 2, but it's in the string. Wait, 'abba' has 'bb' appearing once.\n\nNo, in 'abba', 'bb' is present once.\n\nWait, the string is 'a','b','b','a'. So substrings of length 2 are:\n\ni=0: 'ab'\n\ni=1: 'bb' → added.\n\ni=2: 'ba' → added.\n\nNo duplicates. So for L=2, no.\n\nSo the maximum is 1.\n\nWait, but the code for L=1 will process and return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWait, but in 'abba', the substring 'a' appears twice, but 'b' also appears twice. So the maximum is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 1.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings in the sample, but in practice, the input is a single string.\n\nWait, the first line is the string. So in the code, read from stdin, probably using input().strip().\n\nSo:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, for each L in range from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, wait, the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1? For example, for a string of length 3, the maximum possible L is 2, because a substring of length 2 can appear twice, but the entire string can't appear twice.\n\nWait, but for L= len(s) -1, it's possible for a substring of that length to appear twice. For example, 'ababa' is length 5. Substrings of length 4: 'abab' and 'baba' → no duplicates. So for L=4, no. Then L=3: 'aba' appears at i=0 and i=2 → yes.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait: for L in range(n-1, 0, -1). So for n=2, L=1.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but when n=2, L=1 is the maximum possible. For example, 'aa' → L=1, and 'a' appears twice.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → len is 6.\n\nCheck for L=5: substrings are 'aabba' and 'abbaa' → no duplicates.\n\nThen L=4: 'aabb', 'bbaa' → no.\n\nL=3: 'aab', 'bba', 'baa' → no.\n\nL=2: 'aa', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa' → when i=0: 'aa' added. i=3: 'aa' is in seen → return 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → len 4.\n\nCheck L=3: substrings 'abc', 'bcd' → no.\n\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no.\n\nL=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → no.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → len 5.\n\nL=4: no.\n\nL=3: i=0 → 'aba' added. i=1 → 'bab' added. i=2 → 'aba' is in seen → return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → len 3.\n\nL=2: i=0 → 'zz' added. i=1 → 'zz' is in seen → return 2.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should work. Now, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the same substring occurs multiple times beyond two? Like 'aaaaa' → the code will find L=4, since 'aaaa' occurs at i=0 and i=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abcabc' → len 6.\n\nCheck L=5: no.\n\nL=4: 'abca' and 'bcab' → no.\n\nL=3: 'abc' occurs at i=0 and i=3 → return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, the Python code will be:\n\nRead the string.\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   Create a set to track substrings.\n\n   For each i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen: print L and exit.\n\n       else, add to seen.\n\nAfter all L's, print 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. Once we find such a substring, we return its length as the result. If no such substring exists, we return 0.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length (which is one less than the length of the string) and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to track substrings we have seen. For each generated substring, check if it has been seen before. If it has, print the current length and exit.\n4. **Return Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and ensuring we check from the largest possible substrings downwards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the longest possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings starting from each position in the string.\n- **Track Substrings**: Using a set, we keep track of substrings we have encountered. If a substring is found again, it means it has appeared at least twice, and we print the length and exit.\n- **Handle No Duplicates**: If the loop completes without finding any repeating substrings, we print 0.\n\nThis method efficiently checks each possible substring length, ensuring we find the longest repeating substring in an optimal manner.",
