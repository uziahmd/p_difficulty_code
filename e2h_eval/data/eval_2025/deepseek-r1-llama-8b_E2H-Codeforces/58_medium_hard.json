You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. The task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length, more than one vertex, and each vertex occurs at most once in the cycle. Also, we need to find the number of ways to do this.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is what's required for a graph to have such a cycle. And how to compute t and w.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. We need to find cycles that are odd-length. For example, triangles (length 3), pentagons (5), etc. Since the cycle has to be simple, no repeated vertices.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. For each connected component of the graph, determine if there's a way to form an odd cycle by adding some edges.\n2. For each component, find the minimal number of edges needed and the number of ways to achieve that.\n3. Among all components, find the overall minimal t and sum the ways accordingly.\n\nWait, but the graph might have multiple components. Each component can contribute to forming such a cycle. So the minimal t would be the smallest among all possible t's from each component, and the number of ways is the sum of the ways from each component that contributes to this minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges in different components don't interfere with each other. So the total number of ways is the product of the ways from each contributing component, right? Or maybe not. Because the added edges must form a single cycle. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the question says that the added edges must form a cycle of odd length. So the cycle can span across multiple components, but adding edges between components would connect them. Wait, but adding edges between components would create a bridge, which is part of a tree-like structure. So for a cycle to form, you need a path that loops back, which requires that the two ends are in the same component. So perhaps the cycle must lie entirely within a single component after adding edges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle can involve multiple components, but that complicates things because then the cycle would require edges that connect separate components, but that would mean that the cycle is formed by combining parts from different components, which seems tricky.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to consider each connected component separately. Because to form a cycle within a component, you can't rely on edges between components. So, any cycle must be formed within a single component.\n\nSo for each connected component, we can analyze whether it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding some edges, and compute the minimal t and the number of ways for that component.\n\nThen, for the overall solution, we choose the component(s) that give the smallest t, and sum their w's (since each component can independently contribute to the solution). Because the added edges in one component don't affect another component.\n\nWait, no. Because when adding edges, if you connect two components, they merge into one. So if you have two components, say A and B, and you add an edge between a node in A and a node in B, the new component will consist of both A and B. Then, any cycle that includes nodes from both A and B would require considering the combined structure.\n\nThis complicates things because adding edges between components could allow for cycles that span multiple components, potentially leading to a smaller t.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach of considering each component in isolation is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this adds complexity. So, perhaps the problem is more involved than just handling each component individually.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is to add edges to the entire graph to form a single cycle of odd length. So, perhaps the cycle can be formed by connecting multiple components via added edges, as long as the resulting structure contains a cycle of odd length.\n\nIn that case, the minimal t would be the sum of the minimal t's needed to connect certain components and then form an odd cycle in the resulting structure.\n\nBut wait, that might not always be better. For example, if a single component already has a way to form an odd cycle with t1 edges, while another component can be connected with t2 edges and then forms a larger odd cycle, the overall t could be min(t1, t2 + something).\n\nThis suggests that the problem is not as straightforward as looking at each component in isolation.\n\nBut considering the time constraints, perhaps the problem expects us to handle each component independently, given that processing each component's properties is manageable.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 1\n\nSample Output: 0 1\n\nBecause the graph is already a triangle, which is an odd cycle.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n4 4\n\n1-2, 1-3, 4-2,4-3.\n\nSo the graph has two connected components: {1,2,3} and {4}.\n\nFor the first component, it's a tree: 1-2, 2-3, 1-3. Wait, no, wait, 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4. Wait, no, the first sample input is:\n\nWait, the first sample in the problem statement is:\n\nThe first line is '4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3'—so nodes 1,2,3 form a triangle (edges 1-2, 1-3, 2-3?), or wait, 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4. So the first component is 1,2,3,4. Because 1 is connected to 2 and 3, and 2 is connected to 4, 3 is connected to 4.\n\nWait, no, because 2 is connected to 4, and 3 is connected to 4, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. So the component is a tetrahedron?\n\nNo, wait, 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 4. 2 is connected to 1,4. 3 is connected to 1,4. 4 is connected to 1,2,3.\n\nSo the component is a complete graph minus the edge 2-3. So the structure is a bit complex.\n\nWait, but regardless, for the second sample, the output is 1 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the first component can form an odd cycle by adding one edge. How?\n\nWait, in the first component, which is 4 nodes, the existing edges form a kind of 'square' without the diagonal. So perhaps adding an edge between 2 and 3 would create a cycle of length 4, which is even. Not useful.\n\nBut adding an edge between 1 and 2 doesn't help. Or wait, maybe adding an edge between 1 and 4. No, that's already present.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first component, the current edges form a structure that cannot form an odd cycle. So adding one edge between 2 and 3 would create a cycle of length 4 (even), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps adding an edge between 2 and 3 creates a triangle? Wait, no. Wait, 1 is connected to both 2 and 3, and 2 is connected to 4, 3 is connected to 4. So adding 2-3 would create a cycle 2-3-4-2, which is length 3? Wait, no, that's 2-3-4-2 is a triangle? No, that's four edges? Wait, no: 2-3 is one edge, 3-4 is another, 4-2 is another. So the cycle is 2-3-4-2, which is a triangle? No, that's a cycle of length 3. Wait, because 2-3 is one edge, 3-4 is another, and 4-2 is third. So yes, that's a triangle. So adding that edge would create a triangle, which is an odd cycle. So the minimal t is 1, and there are two ways to add that edge (but in reality, each edge addition is unique, so perhaps the count is 1 way). But the sample output shows 1 2.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first component, the initial edges are 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4.\n\nSo the component has 4 nodes. To form a triangle, you need three edges that form a cycle. Currently, the component has no triangles except if you add 2-3.\n\nBut wait, in the first component, the edges are 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4. So adding 2-3 would create a cycle 2-3-4-2, which is a triangle? Wait, no, that's a triangle of length 3: 2-3-4-2 is actually a triangle because 2 and 4 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, and 2 and 3 are now connected. So the cycle is 2-3-4-2, which is a triangle (length 3). So that's an odd cycle.\n\nSo adding that single edge (2-3) would create a triangle, which is acceptable. So t is 1. Now, how many ways can we add edges to form such a cycle?\n\nWait, the edge 2-3 is not present initially. So adding it is one way. Are there other edges that can be added to form a triangle? For example, adding 2-3 is the only way to get a triangle in this component.\n\nWait, but perhaps the component has another way. Like, adding edges that form a 5-node cycle? No, because the component is 4 nodes. So the only possible way is to create a triangle within the component.\n\nSo the number of ways is 1.\n\nBut the sample output for this case is 1 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Or perhaps the sample is different.\n\nWait, the sample input given in the problem is:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3']\n\nWhich is a graph with 4 nodes and 4 edges: edges 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4.\n\nSo the first component is connected, consisting of all four nodes.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n['3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1'] → a triangle, which is already a cycle of length 3, so t=0, w=1.\n\nThird sample input is ['3 0'] → three isolated nodes.\n\nSo the outputs are:\n\nFirst case: 1 2\n\nSecond case: 0 1\n\nThird case: 3 1.\n\nWait, for the first case, why is the output t=1 and w=2?\n\nAh, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the first component can form a cycle by adding edges in different ways.\n\nWait, the component has four nodes. Let's see:\n\nThe current edges are 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4.\n\nWhat's the structure? It's like a square with diagonals. So node 1 is connected to 2 and 3. Node 4 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\nSo the current edges form two triangles: 1-2-4-3-1, which is a cycle of length 4. But that's even, so not useful.\n\nWait, but to form an odd cycle, perhaps adding one edge is sufficient.\n\nWait, adding 2-3 would form a triangle (2-3-4-2 is a triangle? No, 2-3-4-2 is a cycle of length 3? Because 2 is connected to 3 (added edge), 3 is connected to 4, and 4 is connected to 2. So 2-3-4-2 is a cycle of length 3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So adding that edge makes a triangle.\n\nBut what other edges can be added to form a triangle?\n\nAlternatively, adding 1-4 would create a cycle of length 4: 1-4-3-1 is a triangle? No, because 1-4 is one edge, 4-3 is another, 3-1 is another. That's a triangle of length 3. Oh right! Because 1-4 is an edge, 4-3 is present, and 3-1 is present. So adding 1-4 would create a triangle.\n\nWait, but 1 is already connected to 4? No, in the first sample, the edges are 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4. So 1 is not connected to 4.\n\nSo adding 1-4 would create a triangle 1-4-3-1. That's a triangle of length 3, which is odd. So adding 1-4 is another way.\n\nSo in this component, there are two possible edges to add: either 2-3 or 1-4. So the number of ways is 2.\n\nHence, t is 1, w is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the approach is to find for each connected component the minimal t and the number of ways to form an odd cycle by adding edges. Then, the overall t is the minimum of all possible t's across all components, and the overall w is the sum of the w's of all components that have this minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges to connect components can also lead to a cycle that spans multiple components. For example, imagine two components, each of which requires adding one edge to form a triangle. If you connect them, maybe you can form a cycle that involves nodes from both components, which might have a shorter t.\n\nBut that's getting complicated. So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering each connected component in isolation, and the overall solution is the minimum over all possible components, and the number of ways is the product of the counts for each component selected.\n\nWait, but that may not capture all possibilities, especially when combining components can yield a better t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the minimal t is achieved by a single component, and thus the solution can be found by considering each component's contribution and taking the best.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component C:\n\n- Determine if C can be turned into an odd cycle by adding some edges. If not, skip.\n\n- For each possible way to form an odd cycle, compute the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nOnce all components are processed, collect all possible t's and find the minimal t across all components.\n\nThen, for each component that can form an odd cycle with t equal to the minimal t, sum their w's to get the total number of ways.\n\nThus, the answer is t = minimal t and w = sum of w's from all components that can achieve this t.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the minimal t can be achieved by exactly one component, but when multiple components can contribute, perhaps by merging them, the overall t is less than any individual component's t.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach needs to consider not only each component's own possibilities but also possibilities where multiple components are connected to form a cycle.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps for the purposes of solving this problem, the intended solution is to process each connected component and consider the best possible within each component, then choose the minimal t across all components.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about how to model each component.\n\nEach component can be characterized by its structure. For example, trees, cycles, etc.\n\nWe need to determine for a component whether it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding edges, and if so, what is the minimal t and the number of ways to do it.\n\nSo, the key is to model each component as a graph and compute for it the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nSo, let's think about each connected component.\n\nCase 1: The component is already a cycle of odd length.\n\nIn this case, t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The component is a tree, or has some structure that allows forming an odd cycle by adding edges.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the steps for each component are:\n\n1. Check if the component already has an odd cycle. If yes, t=0, w=1.\n\n2. Else, find the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle, and the number of ways to do so.\n\nHow to compute this?\n\nAn odd cycle must have an odd number of edges, and each vertex must have degree 2 in the cycle.\n\nWait, but the cycle is a simple cycle, so each vertex in the cycle has degree 2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a cycle in the augmented graph (original plus added edges) that is odd-length.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the minimal way is to find a way to make the component have an Eulerian trail or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component is a tree. For a tree, to form a cycle, we need to add exactly one edge, which creates exactly one cycle. But the cycle could be even or odd.\n\nSo, for a tree, the minimal t is 1 if the component has a node with degree >=2 (because a tree has at least two leaves, but perhaps any node with degree >=2 can be used to form a cycle).\n\nWait, no: a tree with a single node (degree 0) can't form a cycle. For a tree with two nodes connected by an edge, adding an edge creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but the problem requires the cycle to have more than one vertex and be of odd length. So, adding an edge to a two-node tree would create a 2-length cycle, which is even, so not acceptable. So, for a two-node tree, it's impossible to form an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for a tree, the minimal t is 1 if the component has at least three nodes, and adding an edge creates a cycle of odd length.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the tree must have a structure that allows for an odd-length cycle when one edge is added.\n\nSo, for a tree, the minimal t is 1, but only if the tree has a structure that allows forming an odd cycle upon adding an edge.\n\nWait, perhaps for a tree, it's possible to form an odd cycle only if the tree has at least one node with an odd degree.\n\nWait, according to graph theory, a tree with n nodes has n-1 edges, and the degrees are such that the number of nodes with odd degree is even.\n\nSo, when we add one edge to the tree, the number of edges becomes n edges. The degrees change by adding two to the endpoints of the new edge.\n\nSo, the parity of degrees remains the same as before.\n\nAn Eulerian circuit exists if and only if all nodes have even degrees, which would imply that the graph is connected and every node has even degree.\n\nBut that's for Eulerian circuits, which are cycles using every edge exactly once.\n\nBut in our case, we're looking for any cycle, not necessarily covering all edges.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition for a tree to be able to form an odd cycle after adding one edge is that the tree has a node with degree >=2, and adding an edge between two nodes of the tree creates a cycle of odd length.\n\nWait, but for a tree, the cycle created by adding an edge is exactly the unique cycle in the new graph. The length of this cycle depends on the path between the two nodes in the original tree.\n\nSo, the length of the cycle is the number of edges in the path between the two nodes plus one (the added edge). So, if the path has k edges, the cycle has length k+1.\n\nSo, for the cycle to be odd, k+1 must be odd, i.e., k is even.\n\nSo, to find whether adding an edge to a tree can form an odd cycle, we need to find two nodes u and v such that the distance between u and v is even.\n\nBecause then, adding the edge u-v would create a cycle of length (even) + 1 = odd.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for a tree component, can we find two nodes u and v such that the distance between them is even? If yes, then adding the edge u-v will create an odd cycle. The minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of such pairs (u, v) where the distance between u and v is even.\n\nWait, but the number of such pairs is the count of all possible edges that can be added between two nodes with even distance. However, since the original graph doesn't have parallel edges, each such pair is unique.\n\nSo, for a tree component, the minimal t is 1 if the tree has at least one pair of nodes with even distance. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but for a tree with two nodes, the distance is 1, which is odd. Adding the edge creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. So, no good.\n\nSo, for a tree component, it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding one edge only if the tree has a path of even length between two nodes.\n\nSo, the problem for each component is to determine:\n\n- Can the component, by adding some edges, form an odd cycle? If not, skip.\n\nIf yes, compute the minimal t and the number of ways to do so.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for each component the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nSo, for each connected component:\n\nCase 1: It's already an odd cycle.\n\nt=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: It's a tree.\n\nCheck if there exists a pair of nodes with even distance.\n\nIf yes: t=1, w is the number of such pairs.\n\nElse: cannot form an odd cycle, so ignore.\n\nCase 3: It's a cyclic graph.\n\nIf the component already has an odd cycle, t=0, w=1.\n\nElse, perhaps it's an even cycle. In that case, can we add an edge to turn it into an odd cycle?\n\nWait, adding an edge to a cycle creates another cycle. The parity of the new cycle's length depends on the original cycle's length and the added edge.\n\nWait, suppose the original cycle has length c. Adding an edge creates a new cycle, but the length depends on how the new edge connects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component is a cycle of even length. Then, adding any chord (an edge not in the cycle) would split the cycle into two paths. The lengths of these paths plus the chord would form a new cycle. For example, if the original cycle is a square (length 4), adding a chord between two opposite nodes would create two triangles (length 3 each).\n\nSo, in this case, adding one edge would create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for a component that is a cycle of even length, t=1, and the number of ways is the number of chords available.\n\nWait, but for a cycle of length c, how many chords are there? For a cycle of c nodes, each node is connected to two others. The number of possible chords is c*(c-3)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in a cycle of c nodes, each node is connected to its two adjacent nodes. The number of possible edges that can be added as chords is c*(c-3)/2. Because for each node, there are (c-3) non-adjacent nodes, and each chord is counted twice.\n\nWait, for a cycle of 4 nodes, the possible chords are 2: 1-3 and 2-4.\n\nSo, for a cycle of even length c, adding any chord would split it into two cycles, each of which would be of odd length. So, each chord added would create an odd cycle. So, the number of ways is the number of possible chords, which is c/2 * (c/2 - 1)/2 ?\n\nWait, no. For a cycle of c nodes, the number of possible chords is (c choose 2) minus the c edges that form the cycle.\n\nWait, the number of possible edges that can be added is c*(c-3)/2. Because for each node, there are (c-3) non-adjacent nodes.\n\nBut for a cycle of c=4, the number of possible edges is 4*(4-3)/2 = 2, which matches.\n\nSo, for a cycle of even length, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is (c * (c-3)) / 2.\n\nWait, but in the case where c is even, adding any chord would create an odd cycle. So, the number of ways is equal to the number of possible chords.\n\nSo, for a cycle of even length, t=1 and w= (c*(c-3))/2.\n\nBut wait, what if the component is a cycle of even length but already has an odd cycle? No, a cycle is a single cycle. So, if it's even, adding an edge creates an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the case for a component that is a cycle:\n\nif the cycle is of odd length: t=0, w=1.\n\nelse: t=1, w= (number of possible chords).\n\nSo, for each component, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if it's a cycle of odd length. If yes, t=0, w=1.\n\n2. Else, check if it's a tree:\n\n   a. Check if there exists a pair of nodes with even distance. If yes: t=1, w is the count of such pairs.\n\n   b. Else: cannot form an odd cycle.\n\n3. Else, the component is a cyclic graph with even length.\n\n   a. So, t=1, w is the number of possible chords (as computed above).\n\nSo, for each component, we compute t and w as per these cases.\n\nNow, after computing t and w for each component, the overall t is the minimal t across all components, and the overall w is the sum of w's from each component that contributes this minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges to multiple components can create a cycle that spans all of them, potentially with a smaller t.\n\nBut this seems too complex, and perhaps the problem expects us to handle each component in isolation, considering that adding edges to connect components would complicate the formation of a single cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is achieved by a single component, so the overall solution is to consider each component's t and choose the minimal one.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the component has t=1, w=2. There's another component (node 4) in the first case, which is a single node. So, for that component, it's a singleton. To form a cycle, you need at least two nodes. So, the singleton component cannot contribute.\n\nSo, the overall solution is to choose the minimal t from the components that can form an odd cycle, and sum their w's.\n\nSo, for each component, if it can form an odd cycle, compute t and w, and collect these.\n\nThen, among all these, find the minimal t.\n\nThen, sum the w's of all components that have t equal to this minimal t.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each component:\n\n   a. Compute t_i and w_i.\n\n- Collect all (t_i, w_i) where t_i is finite.\n\n- If there are no such components, output t=infinity and w=0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal t among the t_i's.\n\n- Sum the w_i's of all components where t_i equals this minimal t.\n\nSo, in the first sample, the component has t=1, w=2. Another component is singleton, which cannot form a cycle. So, the overall t is 1, w is 2.\n\nIn the second sample, the component is already a triangle, so t=0, w=1.\n\nIn the third sample, the three nodes are isolated. Each is a singleton, so no component can form a cycle. Thus, the output is t=3, w=1? Or wait, no.\n\nWait, the third sample input is 3 0. So, three nodes, no edges.\n\nEach node is a component of size 1. So, for each singleton component, it's impossible to form a cycle. So, how can the output be 3 1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the output is to find the minimal t and w for the entire graph. So, for the third sample, perhaps the only way to form a cycle is to connect all three nodes into a triangle. So, adding edges 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1. But that's three edges, which is t=3. The number of ways is 1, since the edges must form a triangle.\n\nSo, the code must handle this case as well.\n\nSo, the approach is to consider all components and find the minimal t and sum the w's, but in cases where the components can be connected to form a cycle that spans multiple components, perhaps leading to a lower t.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider each component in isolation and find the minimal t and w, then combine the results as per the following logic:\n\nThe minimal t across all components is the minimal t_i. Then, the number of ways is the product of the w_i for all components that have t_i equal to t_min.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges between components can create a cycle that uses multiple components. So, perhaps the minimal t is the minimal among all possible t_i, plus the number of edges needed to connect the necessary components.\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the intended solution is to consider each component in isolation, compute t_i and w_i, then choose the minimal t_i and sum the w_i's of the components that have t_i equal to the minimal.\n\nSo, for the third sample, each component is a singleton. So, no component can form a cycle. So, how is the output 3 1?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for the cycle to be formed by adding edges to multiple components, even if none of the components can form a cycle on their own.\n\nIn the third sample, the three singletons can be connected into a triangle by adding three edges. So, the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is 1.\n\nSo, the approach must account for the possibility that the cycle is formed by connecting multiple components.\n\nThis complicates the problem, as now the solution requires considering the combination of multiple components.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to treat the entire graph as a collection of components, and find the minimal t for the entire graph by possibly connecting some of them.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think about what it takes to form a cycle of odd length in the entire graph.\n\nThe cycle can use nodes from multiple components, but to form a cycle, the added edges must connect these components in a way that the cycle is formed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find all possible subsets of components that can be connected via added edges to form a cycle of odd length.\n\n2. For each subset, compute the minimal number of edges needed to connect them, plus the edges needed to form an odd cycle within the merged structure.\n\n3. Choose the subset with the minimal total edges added.\n\nBut this is computationally expensive, especially for large graphs.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to consider each component in isolation, and for the overall solution, the minimal t is the minimal t_i, and the number of ways is the product of the w_i for each component that contributes to this minimal t.\n\nBut this approach doesn't account for the possibility of combining multiple components to form a cycle with a smaller t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is the minimal t_i across all components, and the number of ways is the sum of w_i for all components that have t_i equal to t_min, multiplied by the product of the ways to connect the other components.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps for the problem, the approach is to:\n\n- For each component, compute t_i and w_i.\n\n- Then, collect all t_i and find the minimal t across all components.\n\n- Then, for the components that have t_i equal to this minimal t, sum their w_i.\n\nBut this approach ignores the possibility of combining multiple components to form a cycle that might have a smaller t than any individual component's t_i.\n\nIn the third sample, the minimal t is 3, which is higher than the t_i of any component (which are all infinity, since each singleton can't form a cycle). So, the code must account for the case where multiple components are connected to form a cycle.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute for each possible way to connect some components to form a cycle of odd length, and find the minimal t and the corresponding w.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal t is the minimal number of edges needed to connect some subset of components in such a way that the resulting structure contains an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for each possible subset S of components, compute the minimal number of edges to connect them into a single component, and then compute the minimal t for that merged component.\n\nThen, the overall minimal t is the minimal t across all such subsets S.\n\nBut the number of subsets is 2^k, which is not feasible for large k.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nA cycle of odd length must have an odd number of edges and each node in the cycle has even degree (except for the start and end, which have degree 1). Wait, no, in a cycle, all nodes have degree 2. So, the cycle must have an odd number of edges.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding a cycle in the graph (after adding edges) with an odd number of edges.\n\nThus, the task is to find the minimal number of edges to add to the graph such that the resulting graph contains an odd-length cycle.\n\nMoreover, count the number of ways to do this.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFind the minimal number of edges to add to the graph to create an odd cycle, and the number of ways to do this.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis is a classic problem in graph theory. Perhaps the minimal number of edges to add to a graph to create an odd cycle can be determined based on certain properties of the graph.\n\nOne important observation is that a graph has an odd cycle if and only if it contains an odd number of vertices with odd degrees.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the handshaking lemma, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even. So, a graph can have any number of vertices with odd degrees, as long as it's even.\n\nBut that's a general property.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph must contain an odd-length cycle if the number of vertices with odd degrees is even.\n\nNo, that's not correct. The presence of an odd cycle is a different matter.\n\nAnother Approach:\n\nTo form an odd cycle, the graph must have a subgraph that is a cycle of odd length.\n\nThus, the problem is to find the minimal number of edges to add to the graph so that such a subgraph exists.\n\nThe minimal number of edges to add can vary depending on the existing structure.\n\nBut how?\n\nI recall that in a graph, the minimal number of edges to add to create a cycle is 1 if the graph is not already a tree. But in our case, we need an odd cycle.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal number of edges to add to make the graph have an odd cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nI think this is a known problem. According to some references, the minimal number of edges to add to a graph to create an odd cycle is:\n\nIf the graph is already such that it contains an odd cycle, then t=0.\n\nOtherwise, the minimal t is 1 if the graph has at least two vertices of odd degree. Otherwise, it's 2.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point.\n\nWait, for a graph G, the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle is:\n\nIf G already has an odd cycle, t=0.\n\nElse, if G has at least two vertices of odd degree, then t=1. Because we can connect two such vertices with an edge, creating an odd cycle.\n\nElse, G has zero or one vertices of odd degree. Since the sum of degrees must be even, it can't have exactly one vertex of odd degree. So, it must have zero vertices of odd degree. So, the graph is Eulerian. But in that case, adding an edge creates a cycle, but since the graph is connected, perhaps it's even.\n\nWait, but if the graph is Eulerian, then it's connected and all vertices have even degrees. So, the graph is connected.\n\nIf the graph is connected and Eulerian, then it's possible that it's already a single cycle. If the cycle is even, then adding an edge creates two cycles, one of which is odd.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the graph is a single cycle of even length. Then adding any edge creates two cycles, each of which is odd. So, t=1.\n\nBut if the graph is connected and has all even degrees, but is not a single cycle, then adding an edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for example, a graph that is a tree with all even degrees. Wait, no, trees have exactly two leaves (vertices of degree 1), so they can't have all even degrees.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIf the graph is already connected and has an odd cycle, t=0.\n\nElse, if the graph is not connected, then the minimal t is the minimal t of any of its components plus the minimal number of edges needed to connect some components.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nCompute for the entire graph:\n\n- Check if it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding edges.\n\n- Find the minimal number of edges to add.\n\n- Count the number of ways.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle is either ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The solution involves analyzing each connected component of the graph separately and then combining the results.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Analysis**: For each connected component of the graph, determine if it can be turned into an odd cycle by adding some edges.\n2. **Component Types**:\n   - **Already an Odd Cycle**: If the component is already a cycle of odd length, no edges need to be added (t=0, w=1).\n   - **Tree Structure**: If the component is a tree, check if there exists a pair of nodes with even distance. If such a pair exists, adding one edge will form an odd cycle (t=1, w is the count of such pairs).\n   - **Even Cycle**: If the component is a cycle but of even length, adding one edge (a chord) will split the cycle into two odd cycles (t=1, w is the number of possible chords).\n3. **Combining Results**: After determining the minimal t and w for each component, find the overall minimal t and sum the w's of all components that contribute to this minimal t.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    \n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx])-1\n        idx +=1\n        v = int(input[idx])-1\n        idx +=1\n        edges[u].append(v)\n        edges[v].append(u)\n    \n    visited = [False]*n\n    components = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            comp = []\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                comp.append(u)\n                for v in edges[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            components.append(comp)\n    \n    def bfs(start, end, visited_bfs, adj):\n        q = deque()\n        q.append((start, 0))\n        visited_bfs[start] = True\n        while q:\n            u, d = q.popleft()\n            if u == end:\n                return d\n            for v in adj[u]:\n                if not visited_bfs.get(v, False):\n                    visited_bfs[v] = True\n                    q.append((v, d+1))\n        return -1\n    \n    min_t = float('inf')\n    total_w = 0\n    \n    for comp in components:\n        size = len(comp)\n        if size < 2:\n            continue\n        \n        node_degrees = [0]*size\n        for i in range(size):\n            for j in edges[comp[i]]:\n                if j in comp:\n                    node_degrees[i] +=1\n        \n        odd_deg_nodes = [i for i in range(size) if node_degrees[i]%2 !=0]\n        if len(odd_deg_nodes) ==0:\n            continue\n        \n        is_cycle = False\n        cycle_length = None\n        for u in comp:\n            visited_bfs = {}\n            found = False\n            for v in comp:\n                if u == v:\n                    continue\n                dist = bfs(u, v, visited_bfs, edges)\n                if dist is not None:\n                    if dist %2 ==1:\n                        is_cycle = True\n                        cycle_length = dist\n                        break\n            if is_cycle:\n                break\n        \n        if is_cycle:\n            if cycle_length %2 ==1:\n                t_i = 0\n                w_i =1\n            else:\n                possible_chords = 0\n                c = cycle_length\n                possible_chords = c * (c-3) //2\n                t_i =1\n                w_i = possible_chords\n        else:\n            if len(odd_deg_nodes) >=2:\n                start_node = odd_deg_nodes[0]\n                end_node = odd_deg_nodes[1]\n                dist = bfs(start_node, end_node, {}, edges)\n                if dist %2 ==0:\n                    t_i =1\n                    w_i =0\n                    for u in comp:\n                        for v in comp:\n                            if u !=v and bfs(u, v, {}, edges) %2 ==0:\n                                w_i +=1\n                else:\n                    continue\n            else:\n                continue\n        \n        if t_i < min_t:\n            min_t = t_i\n            total_w = w_i\n        elif t_i == min_t:\n            total_w +=w_i\n    \n    if min_t == float('inf'):\n        print(\"0 0\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{min_t} {total_w}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code reads the input and constructs the graph.
