The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a snowflake graph with n vertices exists. The snowflake graph is defined in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe snowflake graph starts with one vertex. Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices, where k>1. So after this step, there are 1 + k = k+1 vertices. Then, each vertex that has only one edge (so those k new ones) must each connect to k more new vertices. This last step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when each of those k nodes adds another k leaves, making a total of 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWait, let's think: initial node has degree k. Each of the k nodes then adds k children. So each of those k nodes now has degree k+1. So after the second step, the graph has 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k² vertices.\n\nBut wait, what if we do more steps? Like, after adding the second layer, can we add a third layer? Because in the problem statement, it says each vertex with degree 1 (so the leaves from the previous step) must add k new nodes, and this step is done at least once. So for example, the minimal snowflake has two layers: the center, then the first layer, then the second layer (the leaves). So the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut maybe there are more layers beyond that. For instance, in the next step, each of the leaves (from the second layer) would add their own k children. So the number of vertices becomes 1 +k +k² +k³, and so on.\n\nSo the general form for the number of vertices is a sum of a geometric series. Let's formalize this.\n\nThe snowflake graph is built in layers. The initial node is layer 0. Layer 1 has k nodes. Each subsequent layer m (for m >=2) has k^{m-1} nodes. But the number of layers depends on how many times we perform the step of adding children.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because the problem says that the process must have the second step done at least once. So the minimal structure is when the initial node has k children, and each of them has k children as well. So that's two steps beyond the initial: layer 0, layer 1, layer 2. So total nodes: 1 + k + k².\n\nBut perhaps the process can have more steps. For example, layer 3 would have k^3 nodes. So the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³, but then again, each step must be done at least once. Wait no: the problem says that the second step is done at least once. So after the initial step (adding the first layer), the next step (adding the second layer) is done, and any further steps are optional.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Each vertex that is connected by only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, each of those nodes must add k nodes, and this must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when after the initial step, the second step is done once.\n\nBut what if, after the second step, another step is done again? Like, each leaf of the second layer adds their own k nodes. Then the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the number of vertices is a sum of a geometric series: 1 + k*(1 + k +k² + ... +k^{d}), where d is the number of steps after the initial one.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. The initial node is 1. Then, each node with only one edge (degree 1) must add k children. So the initial node has degree k, which is greater than 1, so it doesn't need to add any more children. Only the leaves (nodes with degree 1) need to add children. \n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Start with 1 node.\n2. Add k children to it. Now, 1 +k nodes. The root has degree k, others have degree 1.\n3. For each of these k nodes, add k children. Now, total nodes is 1 +k +k². The root has degree k, the first layer nodes have degree k+1, and the second layer nodes have degree 1.\n4. Now, since the problem requires that the second step is done at least once, but perhaps more steps can be done. So each of the second layer nodes (those with degree 1) must add k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can exist. The snowflake graph is defined in a specific way, starting with one vertex and expanding through a series of steps where each leaf node adds `k` new nodes. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one root node. In the first step, the root node connects to `k` new nodes. Each subsequent step involves each leaf node (nodes with only one connection) connecting to `k` new nodes. The process must perform this second step at least once.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Sum**: The total number of vertices in the snowflake graph can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. For example, after `m` steps beyond the initial root, the total number of vertices is given by `1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m)`.\n\n3. **Check for Valid `n`**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists an integer `m >= 1` such that `n` can be expressed as `1 + k * (k^m - 1)/(k - 1)`, where `k > 1`.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `k`**: For each possible `k` starting from 2 up to a reasonable limit, compute the maximum number of nodes for a given depth `m` and check if `n` matches any of these values.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**: Given the constraints, iterate over possible values of `k` and `m` efficiently to avoid redundant computations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # Check for k=2\n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is way larger than 1e18\n    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):\n        total = 1 + 2*(2**m - 1)\n        if total == n:\n            return True\n        elif total > n:\n            break\n    # Now check for other k's\n    max_k = int((n-1)**0.5) + 2\n    for k in range(3, max_k + 1):\n        s = 1\n        for step in range(1, 100):  # steps beyond the initial\n            s += k * (k**(step) - 1) // (k - 1)\n            if s > n:\n                break\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n        if k == 2 and m > 100:\n            continue\n    return False\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    found = False\n    for k in range(2, 200):  # k can't be too large because k^m grows quickly\n        # Compute the minimal and maximal possible total for this k\n        m_min = 1\n        total_min = 1 + k * (k ** m_min - 1) // (k - 1)\n        if total_min > n:\n            continue\n        # Find the maximum m such that total <= n\n        m_max = 0\n        while True:\n            m_max += 1\n            current_total = 1 + k * (k ** m_max - 1) // (k - 1)\n            if current_total > n:\n                break\n        for m in range(m_min, m_max + 1):\n            total = 1 + k * (k ** m - 1) // (k - 1)\n            if total == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution checks if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph by iterating over possible values of `k` and `m`. For each `k`, it calculates the total number of vertices for varying depths `m` and checks if `n` matches any of these totals. If a match is found, the function returns \"YES\"; otherwise, it returns \"NO\". This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and check all possible configurations.",
