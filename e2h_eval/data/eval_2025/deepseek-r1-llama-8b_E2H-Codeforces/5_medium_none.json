Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left boots with right boots based on their colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot that are compatible. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm, the compatibility rules: two colors are compatible if they are exactly the same or if one is '?'. So, for example, 'a' and '?' are compatible, as well as '?' and '?'. But 'a' and 'b' are not.\n\nSo, the input gives me two strings l and r, each of length n, representing the colors of the left and right boots respectively. Each character is either a lowercase letter or a '?'.\n\nMy task is to output the maximum number of such pairs, along with the indices of the left and right boots in each pair.\n\nAlright, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. Since each left can be paired with multiple rights, but each can only be used once, it's a bipartite graph matching problem. But since n can be up to 150000, standard algorithms like the Hungarian method won't work because they are too slow.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Maybe we can count for each possible color (including '?') how many lefts and rights match that condition.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this by grouping the left and right boots into their color categories. Then, for each color c, the maximum number of pairs we can form from the lefts in c and the rights in c is the minimum of the counts of lefts and rights in c. But also, we have to consider the '?' cases.\n\nBut wait, because a left with color '?' can pair with any right, including those with specific colors, and vice versa. So it's a bit more complex than just counting per color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to precompute for each left and right whether they are compatible, and then model this as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching. But again, with n up to 1.5e5, that's not feasible.\n\nSo, thinking differently: perhaps we can process the left and right arrays, group them by their color (including '?'), and compute for each group how much they can contribute to the total pairs.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet's create frequency dictionaries for the left and right boots.\n\nFor the left boots:\n- For each color c (including '?'), count how many times it appears. Let's call this left_counts[c].\n\nSimilarly, for the right boots:\n- For each color c, count how many times it appears. Call this right_counts[c].\n\nNow, for each color c, the number of pairs we can get from left and right in c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nAdditionally, the '?' in left can pair with any right, and the '?' in right can pair with any left.\n\nBut wait, how do we account for overlapping between these groups?\n\nBecause the '?' lefts can pair with non-'?' rights, but those rights might have already been counted in their specific color groups.\n\nThis suggests that handling '?' requires careful consideration.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\n1. Compute all possible pairs within each color, including '?', but ensure that when considering '?', we don't double-count.\n\n2. Then, handle the remaining lefts and rights that couldn't be paired in their own color or with others via specific rules.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate the maximum possible pairs without considering overlaps, and then adjust for overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two steps:\n\n- First, pair as many as possible within the same color, including '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because a left '?' can pair with any right, including those that are not '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) plus the product of the remaining lefts and rights that are '?', but that seems incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nLet me think about the problem as a bipartitioned graph where edges exist between compatible left and right nodes. We want to select the maximum number of edges such that each node is in at most one edge. This is the maximum bipartite matching problem.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms are too slow. So we need a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of the problem allows for a greedy approach. For example, if we can find a way to pair as many as possible by processing the left and right in some order.\n\nAnother idea: the problem is similar to the problem where you have two sets of people and you want to match as many as possible with certain constraints. In this case, the constraints are that a left can be matched to a right if their colors are compatible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum bipartite matching under the given constraints. However, given the size, it's impossible to use standard algorithms. So, perhaps we can find a way to model this as a flow problem and use a more efficient algorithm, but even that might not be feasible for 1.5e5 nodes.\n\nWait, but perhaps the bipartite graph has a special structure that allows for an efficient solution. For instance, if the edges are between certain groups, like left colors and right colors, perhaps we can model it in terms of frequencies and then find a way to compute the maximum using these frequencies.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of frequency counts.\n\nEach left can be considered as a node on one side, each right as a node on the other side. An edge exists between left i and right j if l[i] is compatible with r[j].\n\nWe need to select as many edges as possible such that each node is in at most one edge.\n\nIn such a scenario, the maximum matching can be found using a greedy algorithm if the graph has certain properties. For example, if the edges form a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to multiple right nodes, but the graph is such that the maximum matching can be determined by some kind of ordering.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where each left node has a certain set of possible right nodes it can connect to, and we can find the maximum matching in O(n) time using a greedy approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes it can pair with, and then the maximum matching can be found using a specific algorithm that takes advantage of the structure.\n\nWait, but what is the structure of the graph? Each left node can connect to multiple right nodes, and vice versa.\n\nAnother angle: since the compatibility is symmetric except for the direction (left to right), perhaps the problem can be approached by sorting the left and right arrays and then trying to pair them optimally.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that each left and right can be categorized by their color. Then, the maximum number of pairs is the sum for each color c of the minimum between the count of lefts in c and the count of rights in c, plus the product of the count of lefts with '?' and the count of rights with '?' minus any overlaps, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right '?', but that can't be right because the left '?' can pair with any right, including those that are not '?', but those may have already been counted.\n\nWait, no. Because if a right is '?', it's included in the initial sum, but a left '?' can pair with any right, including those that are '?', but the right '?' can only pair with lefts that are either '?', or specific colors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to outline a possible approach.\n\n1. For each color c, compute the number of lefts and rights. The number of pairs for c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Sum these across all c to get a base count.\n\n2. Additionally, consider the lefts that are '?'. They can pair with any right, including those that are not '?'. Similarly, rights that are '?' can pair with any left.\n\nBut wait, when we compute the base count in step 1, we've already accounted for the pairs where both are '?', because '?' is treated as a color. So, the left '?' and right '?' pairs are already counted in step 1.\n\nBut the left '?' can also pair with non-'?' rights. However, those non-'?' rights have already been paired with their specific color, but perhaps not all of them. So, the left '?' can potentially form additional pairs with non-'?' rights.\n\nSimilarly, the right '?' can form additional pairs with non-'?' lefts.\n\nWait, but in step 1, for each color c, we added min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). So for the color '?', it's min(left_?, right_?). So, the left_? and right_? have been accounted for.\n\nBut the left_? can pair with any right (even those not '?'), and similarly, the right_? can pair with any left (even those not '?'). So, perhaps after step 1, the left_? and right_? can form additional pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think with an example.\n\nSuppose left has 3 '?', and right has 5 'a's.\n\nIn step 1, for color 'a', right_counts['a'] is 5, left_counts['a'] is 0 (since all lefts are '?'). So min is 0. So step 1 contributes nothing for 'a'.\n\nThen, in step 1, for '?', left_counts['?'] is 3, right_counts['?'] is 0 (assuming no right is '?'). So min is 0. So step 1 contributes 0.\n\nSo, after step 1, total is 0.\n\nBut the left_? can pair with the 5 'a's on the right. So the maximum possible pairs is 3.\n\nSo, the step 1 approach is insufficient.\n\nThus, perhaps the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe need to model the problem by considering that the left '?' can pair with any right, and the right '?' can pair with any left. But how to account for this without double-counting.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = number of left_?\nB = number of right_?\n\nAfter step 1, we have some pairs formed by same colors, including when both are '?'. Now, the remaining left_? and right_? can be used to form additional pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the maximum possible pairs by first taking as many same-color pairs as possible, then take the product of the remaining left_? and right_?.\n\nBut that's not accurate because the left_? can also pair with non-'?' rights, and those non-'?' rights may have already been used in their own color groups.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nCompute the number of pairs where both are '?': that's min(left_?, right_?), which is added to the total.\n\nThen, compute the number of pairs where left is '?', right is not '?': that's left_? * (sum of right_non_? - sum of right_c where c is paired).\n\nWait, but this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be divided into four parts:\n\n1. Pairs where both are specific colors (c != ?). So, for each c, min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n2. Pairs where left is '?', right is specific color: left_? * (number of rights not yet paired).\n\n3. Pairs where right is '?', left is specific color: right_? * (number of lefts not yet paired).\n\n4. Pairs where both are '?': min(left_?, right_?).\n\nWait, but this seems too simplistic and may lead to overcounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum for each color c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]), plus the minimum of the remaining left_? and right_? after accounting for their own colors.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left can be connected to all compatible rights. The maximum bipartite matching in this graph would give the required answer.\n\nHowever, for n=1.5e5, this is not feasible with standard algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which is O(E√V) and may be manageable for E up to 1e7, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, but perhaps the bipartite graph has a certain structure that allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nEach left is connected to all rights that are compatible. Since compatibility is determined by color, perhaps the edges can be represented in a way that allows for efficient processing.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nGroup the left and right by their color, including '?'. For each group, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the count in left and right for that color.\n\nThen, for the '?', the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the remaining left_? and right_? after all other pairs have been formed.\n\nWait, but the '? can pair with any color, including their own group.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be split into:\n\n- For each color c (including '?'), the number of pairs is the minimum of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c].\n\nSum all these up, but this may overcount because when c is '?', left_? and right_? are being considered, and they can pair with other colors as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think in terms of the maximum possible pairs.\n\nEach pair can be of the form:\n\n- Left color is c, right color is c: contributes min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n- Left color is '?', right color is any: contributes left_? * 1, but only if the right hasn't been paired yet.\n\n- Right color is '?', left color is any: similar.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all colors c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]), plus the minimum of (left_? + right_?) and the sum of the remaining possible pairs.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the bipartitioned graph where each left can be connected to any right that is compatible, and the maximum matching is needed. But for n=1.5e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be reduced to the following:\n\nWe can model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible. The maximum matching is the desired answer.\n\nBut with n=1.5e5, this is challenging. So, perhaps the problem has a specific structure that allows for a greedy solution.\n\nWait, suppose that for each left, we sort the rights that are compatible with it in some order, and then pair them greedily.\n\nBut again, for 1.5e5 nodes, this could be manageable if done properly.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the bipartitioned graph as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and perform a topological sort, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where the left nodes are sorted in a certain way, and the right nodes are also sorted, allowing for a two-pointer approach to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me represent the problem as a bipartite graph where each left can be connected to multiple rights. The maximum matching in this graph is what I'm looking for.\n\nBut since n is 1.5e5, I need an algorithm that can handle this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the bipartitioned graph can be transformed into a flow network where each left is connected to a source, each right to a sink, and edges represent compatibility. Then, the maximum flow from source to sink would represent the maximum matching.\n\nBut even that approach may not be feasible for large n due to the size of the network.\n\nWait, but perhaps the edges can be represented in a way that allows for efficient computation.\n\nLet me model it as a flow problem:\n\n- Create a source node and a sink node.\n\n- For each left boot, create a node connected to the source with an edge capacity equal to 1.\n\n- For each right boot, create a node connected to the sink with an edge capacity equal to 1.\n\n- For each pair (i,j) where left i is compatible with right j, add an edge from left i's node to right j's node with capacity 1.\n\nThen, the maximum flow from source to sink will give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut with n=1.5e5, the number of edges could be up to 1.5e10, which is impossible to handle.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo, I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the characteristics of the problem.\n\nEach left can be connected to any right that is compatible with it. The compatibility depends on their colors.\n\nBut perhaps, instead of considering each individual right, I can group the rights by their color and compute the maximum possible for each group.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach:\n\nCompute for each color c, the number of lefts and rights that have color c. The maximum possible pairs for c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nThen, the remaining lefts and rights (those that are not in any c) can be handled by the '?'.\n\nSo, the total is the sum over all c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) plus the number of '?' lefts multiplied by the number of '?' rights, but that's not correct because the '?' lefts can pair with any rights, including those that are not '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the sum for all c (including '?') of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nThen, subtract the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for c != '?', and then compute the remaining left_? and right_? as the new left_? and right_?.\n\nWait, no. Because the '?' can pair with any color.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n1. For each color c (including '?'), compute min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) and add to the total.\n\n2. Then, the left_? can pair with any right, but those rights may have already been paired in their own color groups.\n\nWait, but this isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the minimum of the remaining left_? and right_? after subtracting their own usage.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be broken into two parts:\n\na) For each color c (excluding '?'), compute the number of pairs as min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nb) For the '?', compute the number of pairs as the minimum of (left_? * total_possible_rights - sum over c (min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])) ) and (right_? * ... )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be thought of as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the minimum of (left_? * (n - sum_r) + right_? * (n - sum_l)), but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as:\n\nEach left can be assigned to a right if compatible. The maximum number of such assignments is the desired result.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck on how to model this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that each left can be connected to any right that is compatible, and the problem is to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved using a greedy approach where we process the left and right in a certain order and match them as we go.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the exact way to do it.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Suppose I have a list of left and right colors, and for each left, I can find all rights that are compatible.\n\nIf I can find a way to match each left to a right quickly, perhaps using some data structures, I can find the maximum matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Summing this gives a base number of pairs. Then, the remaining left_? can pair with any right that hasn't been paired yet, and the remaining right_? can pair with any left that hasn't been paired yet.\n\nWait, but how to track which rights have been paired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the minimum of (left_? * (total_right_count - sum_r)) and (right_? * (total_left_count - sum_l)), where sum_r is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for c != '?').\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the sum for all c (including '?') of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nThen, the remaining left_? is left_? - min(left_?, right_?) (from the '? group), and the remaining right_? is right_? - min(left_?, right_?) (from the '? group).\n\nSo, the remaining left_? can pair with any right that hasn't been paired, regardless of their color.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining right_? can pair with any left that hasn't been paired.\n\nBut since the left_? can pair with any right, including those that were not part of their own color group.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nTotal pairs = sum_c min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) + max(0, (left_? + right_?) - min(left_?, right_?))).\n\nWait, no, because the left_? and right_? can form pairs beyond their own group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after summing min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for all c, the remaining left_? and right_? can form min(remaining_left_?, remaining_right_?).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the problem with the example given.\n\nIn the sample input, the output is 5 pairs.\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nl = codeforces (length 10)\nr = dodivthree (length 10)\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample, the maximum number of pairs is achieved by pairing certain left and right.\n\nBut without knowing the exact details, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be modeled by counting the number of pairs where the left is compatible with the right, regardless of color, and then using a two-pointer approach to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be seen as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all compatible rights, and the maximum matching is the answer. To find this, we can model it as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which is efficient for large bipartite graphs.\n\nBut with n=1.5e5, Hopcroft-Karp may not be feasible because the number of edges could be up to 1.5e5*1.5e5 = 2.25e10, which is way too big.\n\nThus, Hopcroft-Karp is impractical.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's note that the compatibility is symmetric except for '?'. So, for two specific colors, c1 and c2, if a left is c1, it can pair with any right that is c1 or '?'. Similarly, a right c1 can pair with any left that is c1 or '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem by grouping the lefts and rights into their color groups, including '?', and then compute the maximum possible pairs.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet me create a frequency dictionary for left and right.\n\nleft_counts: a dictionary mapping color to count of lefts with that color.\n\nright_counts: same for rights.\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nBut this counts the pairs where both are c, including when c is '?'.\n\nBut wait, the left '?' can pair with any right, including those not '?', but in the above approach, those rights are being counted in their own color groups.\n\nSo, the left '?' may still have some rights available to pair with.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, including '?'. Let's call this total_same.\n\nThen, compute the number of left_? and right_?.\n\nThe left_? can pair with any right that hasn't been paired yet, including those that are not '?'.\n\nBut in the total_same calculation, the right_? have already contributed to the total_same as min(left_?, right_?).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ntotal_pairs = total_same + max(0, (left_? + right_?) - min(left_?, right_?))\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me test this with the earlier example:\n\nExample: left_? = 3, right_? = 0.\n\ntotal_same includes min(3,0)=0.\n\nThen, (3+0) - 0 = 3. So total_pairs becomes 0 +3=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother Example: left_? =5, right_? =3.\n\ntotal_same includes min(5,3)=3.\n\nThen, (5+3)-3=5.\n\nSo, total_pairs is 3+5=8.\n\nWhich is correct, because the 3 pairs from same '?', and the remaining 2 left_? and 0 right_? can form 2 pairs.\n\nWait, no, because after same '?', 5-3=2 left_? remain, and 3-3=0 right_? remain.\n\nSo, 2 left_? can pair with 0 right_? : 0 pairs.\n\nSo, the formula would give 3 + (5+3 -3) = 3+5=8, which is wrong.\n\nAh, so the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nAfter computing total_same, the remaining left_? is left_? - right_? (since right_? can only be paired with left_? in the same group).\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute total_same = sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c.\n\nThen, the remaining left_? is left_? - right_? (since all right_? have been used in the same group).\n\nBut wait, no. Because right_? are part of their own group, but left_? can pair with any right, including non-'?'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ntotal_pairs = total_same + min(left_? - used_left_?, right_? - used_right_?)\n\nwhere used_left_? is the number of right_? used in the same group, etc.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the product of the number of left_? and the number of right_? that haven't been used yet.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the minimum of (left_? + right_?) and (left_? * right_?)).\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum_c min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) + min(left_?, right_?) + min(left_? + right_?, (left_? * right_?)/ something)\n\nNot sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think about the problem as a bipartite graph. Each left can be connected to multiple rights. The maximum matching is the desired result.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, the standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms are not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the bipartitioned graph has a certain structure that allows for a greedy approach to find the maximum matching.\n\nFor example, if the left nodes are sorted in a particular order, and the right nodes are also sorted, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nYes! That seems promising.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the left array and the right array.\n\n2. For each left, find the earliest right that is compatible and hasn't been paired yet.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but this might not capture all possibilities. So, perhaps a more efficient way is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where the left nodes are sorted, and for each left, the right nodes that are compatible are contiguous. Then, a greedy approach can be applied.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's sort the lefts and rights, and for each left, find the earliest possible right that is compatible and hasn't been matched yet.\n\nBut again, for n=1.5e5, this would require O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a maximum bipartite matching where the edges are between left and right, but the graph is structured such that it's a bipartite graph with all left nodes connected to a range of right nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by noting that the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for all c, plus the minimum of the remaining left_? and right_?.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for patterns in the problem.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of four variables:\n\n- A: the number of lefts that are '?'\n- B: the number of rights that are '?'\n- S: sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for all c != '?'\n\nThen, the maximum pairs is S + min(A, B) + max(0, A + B - min(A, B)).\n\nWait, no. Because the left_? can pair with any right, including those that are not '?', but those rights may have already been used in their own color groups.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nS is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for c != '?'\n\nThen, the maximum pairs is S + min(A, B) + min(A, C), where C is the number of rights that are not '?', but have not been paired yet.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is S + min(A, B) + (A + B - min(A, B)).\n\nBut that would be S + A + B.\n\nWhich is S + A + B.\n\nBut that's not correct because when A and B are large, the sum could exceed the total possible pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is S + min(A, B) + max(0, (A + B - min(A, B)) - (C + D)), where C is the number of rights that are not '?' and have not been paired, and D is the number of lefts that are not '?' and have not been paired.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps it's time to think of an alternative approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem as:\n\nEach left can be paired with a right if:\n\n- They have the same color, or\n- At least one of them is '?'\n\nSo, the problem is to find the maximum matching under these conditions.\n\nBut again, modeling this as a bipartite graph is impractical.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible, and the maximum matching can be found using a specific algorithm.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be thought of as a bipartitioned graph where the edges are grouped by color, and each group can be processed separately.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a pattern or an alternative approach.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible, but the graph is such that for any left, the compatible rights form a consecutive segment in the right array.\n\nIf this is the case, then a greedy approach using a two-pointer technique can be used to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, if the right array is sorted, then for each left, the compatible rights can be found quickly.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the right array can be in any order, so sorting may not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the right array can be preprocessed into a sorted structure, and for each left, the compatible rights can be found quickly.\n\nBut for 1.5e5 elements, this could be feasible.\n\nHere's an outline of a possible approach:\n\n1. Preprocess the right array into a sorted list, grouped by their color.\n\n2. For each left, determine which rights are compatible and can form pairs.\n\n3. Use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where the maximum matching is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) plus the product of the remaining left_? and right_?.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for hints or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be considered as a bipartite graph where the edges are between lefts and rights that are compatible, and the maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut the problem is that with n=1.5e5, the standard algorithms are not feasible.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem has a specific structure that allows for a solution in O(n) time.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is simply the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for all c, plus the minimum of left_? and right_?.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input provided.\n\nIn the sample input, the output is 5 pairs.\n\nLooking at the first line:\n\nInput for l is 'codeforces' which is 10 letters.\n\nr is 'dodivthree' which is 10 letters.\n\nI'm not sure how many pairs are formed from same colors, but perhaps the '?' is involved.\n\nBut without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's proceed to code a solution based on the approach of counting min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for each c, plus the min(left_?, right_?}.\n\nBut then, we can test it against the sample input.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this will work.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, the output is 5, which suggests that the sum is 5.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not sufficient.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioned graph where the left nodes are connected to all rights that are compatible, and the maximum matching is the answer. To compute this, perhaps we can represent the bipartitioned graph in a way that allows for a more efficient maximum matching algorithm.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach of counting min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c}) for each c, and then adding the min(left_?, right_?}.\n\nBut I'm not confident this is correct.\n\nWait, let's try an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nLeft: ['a', '?']\n\nRight: ['a', '?']\n\nleft_counts: a:1, ?:1\n\nright_counts: a:1, ?:1\n\nsum of min(c) for c in all colors: min(a:1, a:1) =1; min(? :1, ? :1) =1. Sum is 2.\n\nThen, min(left_? =1, right_? =1) is 1.\n\nSo, total is 2+1=3.\n\nBut the maximum possible pairs is 3:\n\nPair left 1 (a) with right 1 (a).\n\nPair left 2 (?) with right 2 (?).\n\nSo, yes, 3 pairs.\n\nAnother Example:\n\nLeft: ['a', '?'], Right: ['b', '?']\n\nsum of min(c): min(a:1, b:0) =0; min(? :1, ? :1) =1. Sum is 1.\n\nmin(left_? =1, right_? =1) is 1.\n\nTotal is 1 +1=2.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nPair left 2 (?) with right 2 (?).\n\nPair left 1 (a) with right 2 (?).\n\nSo, 2 pairs. Correct.\n\nAnother Example:\n\nLeft: ['a', 'b', '?'], Right: ['a', 'b', '?']\n\nsum of min(c):\n\na:1, b:1, ?:1. Sum is 3.\n\nmin(left_? =1, right_? =1) is 1.\n\nTotal is 4.\n\nWhich is correct, as all 4 can be paired.\n\nAnother Example:\n\nLeft: ['a', 'a', '?'], Right: ['a', 'a', '?']\n\nsum of min(c):\n\na:2, ?:1. Sum is 3.\n\nmin(left_? =1, right_? =1) is 1.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother Example:\n\nLeft: ['a', '?'], Right: ['a', 'b']\n\nsum of min(c):\n\na:1, ?:0.
