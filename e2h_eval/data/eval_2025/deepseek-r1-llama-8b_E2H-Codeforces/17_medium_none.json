He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a certain string s of length n. The output is a string where each character corresponds to one of the input strings, marking 'P' if it's a prefix, 'S' if it's a suffix.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. We need to process all the given strings and assign P or S correctly.\n\nFirst, the input is structured as follows: the first line is n, then 2n-2 lines follow, each representing either a prefix or a suffix of the unknown string s. These are provided in arbitrary order, but it's guaranteed that exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1 are present, and they form valid prefixes and suffixes of some s.\n\nSo, the task is to figure out which of these strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. But wait, the actual string s is not known, so we can't directly check each string against s. Instead, we have to infer based on the possible relationships between the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet me think about the approach here.\n\nI remember that in such problems, the correct string must be consistent with all the given prefixes and suffixes. So perhaps we can find the correct string by reconstructing it step by step.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as building the possible string s by considering the constraints from the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAnother idea: the correct string s must have its proper prefixes and suffixes among the given strings. So for each possible string s, we can check whether all given prefixes and suffixes are indeed prefixes and suffixes of s. However, since n can be up to 100, generating all possible strings (which would be 26^100) is impossible. That's not feasible.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the prefixes and suffixes. For a given s, the prefixes are the first k characters for k=1 to n-1, and the suffixes are the last k characters for k=1 to n-1.\n\nSo the key is to find a string s where each of its prefixes and suffixes is present in the input. But again, without knowing s, how?\n\nWait, but the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes of some s. So for each possible s, the set of prefixes and suffixes must match the input.\n\nBut how do I find s? Maybe by finding a candidate s that fits all the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this by building s step by step, checking at each step which possibilities are allowed.\n\nWait, another observation: The correct s must have the property that its prefix of length m is a prefix of its suffix of length m, except when m is less than n-m. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible s_candidate, we can collect all the prefixes and suffixes and see if they match the input.\n\nBut even that is computationally intensive, as there are 26^100 possibilities. So that's not practical.\n\nSo perhaps we can find a way to determine the correct labels (P/S) for each string in the input without explicitly knowing s.\n\nLet me think about the properties that the labels must satisfy.\n\nEach string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So, for each string t in the input, t is a prefix of s if and only if there exists no longer prefix in the input that starts with t and is also a prefix. Wait, not necessarily. Because the same string can appear multiple times.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to approach this is to find the minimal possible s that can explain all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider the entire collection of strings. For each possible string length l, there are two strings, which are the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l.\n\nWait, for each l (from 1 to n-1), exactly two strings of length l exist in the input. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l must have their last l-1 characters matching the other. Because the prefix of length l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s. So the prefix and suffix for length l must agree on the first l-1 characters.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose s is \"abcde\". Then the prefix of length 3 is \"abc\", and the suffix of length 3 is \"cde\". Wait, but the first two characters of the prefix (ab) should match the last two characters of the suffix (de) because they are the same in s. So, for each l, the two strings of length l must have their first l-1 characters in common.\n\nAh, right! So for each l, the two strings of length l must share their first l-1 characters. Otherwise, it's impossible for them to be a prefix and suffix of the same string.\n\nThis is a crucial insight.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings of length l, one must be the prefix, and the other the suffix. To determine which is which, we can compare their first l-1 characters. The one that is a prefix must have the same first l-1 characters as the other string, which is the suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because both the prefix and suffix of length l are part of s. So the prefix is s[0..l-1], the suffix is s[n-l..n-1]. So the prefix's first l-1 characters are s[0..l-2], and the suffix's first l-1 characters are s[n-l-1..n-2]. For the entire s to be consistent, the first l-1 characters of the suffix (s[n-l-1..n-2]) must equal the first l-1 characters of the prefix (s[0..l-2]).\n\nWait, maybe not. Because s is a single string, the prefix and suffix could have overlapping parts.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose s is \"ababa\" (length 5). For l=3, the prefix is \"aba\", and the suffix is \"aba\". Their first l-1=2 characters are \"ab\" for both. So they are compatible.\n\nIn another example, say s is \"aaa\". For l=2, the two strings are \"aa\" (prefix) and \"aa\" (suffix). They share the first l-1=1 character, which is 'a'.\n\nBut what if s is \"abacaba\"? For l=4, the prefix is \"abac\", the suffix is \"acab\". The first l-1=3 characters of the suffix are \"aca\", while the first 3 of the prefix are \"aba\". Are these the same? No. So, in this case, for l=4, the two strings of length 4 must have the same first 3 characters, otherwise it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that it is guaranteed that the given strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So for each l, the two strings of length l in the input must have the same first l-1 characters. Because otherwise, it's impossible to form s.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of length l in the input must have the same first l-1 characters.\n\nTherefore, for each l, we can group the two strings of that length. Let's call them A and B. Since both are of length l, the first l-1 characters of A must be equal to the first l-1 of B.\n\nOnce we've grouped them, the next step is to decide which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nHow?\n\nWell, the prefix is the first l characters of s, and the suffix is the last l characters of s. So, for the two strings A and B of length l, one of them is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nBut how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps by looking at the next level. For example, the prefix of length l+1 must start with the prefix of length l. Similarly, the suffix of length l+1 must end with the suffix of length l.\n\nWait, that's true. So, for l from 1 to n-2, the suffix of length l+1 must be the suffix of length l plus a new character at the beginning. Or, more precisely, the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1 characters of s, which must end with the suffix of l.\n\nWait, no. The suffix of length l+1 is s[n-(l+1)] ... s[n-1]. The suffix of length l is s[n-l] ... s[n-1]. So the suffix of l+1 starts with s[n-l-1], followed by the suffix of length l.\n\nWait, no. For example, if s is \"abcde\", the suffix of length 3 is \"cde\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"bcde\". So, the suffix of length 4 starts with 'b' followed by 'cde'. So, the suffix of length l+1 starts with a new character followed by the suffix of length l.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of length l+1 is the prefix of length l followed by a new character.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix of l+1 must be the prefix of l plus a new character at the end.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the idea is that for each l, the prefix of l+1 must be the prefix of l plus a new character. Similarly, the suffix of l+1 must be the suffix of l plus a new character at the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps for each l, the two strings of length l+1 must have a prefix that is the previous prefix plus a new character, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nWe can build the correct s by starting from the smallest l and moving upwards, checking which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nPerhaps the approach is as follows:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of length l. These are the candidates for prefix and suffix of that length.\n\n2. For each l, determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. How?\n\n   a. For l=1, the two strings are both length 1. Since any single-character string is both a prefix and a suffix of s. Wait, no. For l=1, the prefix is s[0], the suffix is s[n-1]. So the two strings can be different, but in the input, there are exactly two strings of each length.\n\n   So for l=1, the two strings could be the same, meaning that s has the same first and last character, or they could be different, meaning that the first and last characters are different.\n\n   So, for l=1, we can't directly determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix. So perhaps we need to proceed to higher l to get more information.\n\n3. Once we have determined for some l, which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, we can use that information to determine for higher l.\n\nFor example, suppose for l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. Then, the prefix of l=2 must be the prefix of l=1 plus a new character. So, if the prefix of l=1 is 'a', then the prefix of l=2 is 'ab'. Similarly, the suffix of l=1 is 'b', so the suffix of l=2 is 'ba'.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. We can check which one could be the prefix.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the prefix is s[0:2], which is the prefix of l=1 plus a new character. So, the prefix of l=2 must start with the prefix of l=1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l=2 must end with the suffix of l=1.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings (let's call them A and B) must have A being the prefix and B being the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, the prefix of l=2 must start with the prefix of l=1. The suffix of l=2 must end with the suffix of l=1.\n\nSo, for the two strings A and B of length 2, we can see:\n\nIf the prefix of l=1 is 'x', then the prefix of l=2 must be x followed by some character. So, A or B must be x followed by something.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l=1 is y, so the suffix of l=2 must end with y. So, the last character of A or B must be y.\n\nWait, perhaps for l=2, we can look at the two possible options:\n\nOption 1: A is the prefix of l=2, B is the suffix.\n\nThen, the prefix of l=1 is the first character of A, and the suffix of l=1 is the last character of B.\n\nThese must be consistent.\n\nOption 2: B is the prefix of l=2, A is the suffix.\n\nThen, the prefix of l=1 is the first character of B, and the suffix of l=1 is the last character of A.\n\nAgain, these must be consistent.\n\nSo, for l=2, we can check both possibilities and see which one aligns with the l=1 case.\n\nBut for l=1, we don't know which is the prefix or suffix, unless there's more information.\n\nWait, but for l=1, the two strings are just two single-character strings. So, for l=1, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of s.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings can be the same or different.\n\nBut regardless, for l=2, the prefix of l=2 must consist of the prefix of l=1 plus a character, and the suffix of l=2 must consist of a character plus the suffix of l=1.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two options (A is prefix, B is suffix or vice versa) must lead to a situation where the prefix of l=2 starts with the prefix of l=1, and the suffix of l=2 ends with the suffix of l=1.\n\nSo, for each l starting from 1, we can try to determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce we have that, for l+1, we can apply the same logic.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length.\n\n- For l=1, we don't know which is the prefix or suffix, so we'll have to make a choice based on higher l.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can proceed greedily, assuming that the first occurrence of a certain string is the prefix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be uniquely determined by the given prefixes and suffixes, so that there's only one possible assignment of P/S.\n\nBut according to the note in the problem statement, sometimes there are multiple possible s's, leading to different possible assignments. But our goal is to output any possible assignment that is consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Get the two strings of length l, say A and B.\n\n   b. Check if the first l-1 characters of A are equal to those of B. If not, it's impossible, but the problem says it's guaranteed to be possible.\n\n   c. Then, for each possible assignment (A is prefix, B is suffix; or B is prefix, A is suffix), check if it's consistent with the higher l cases.\n\n   d. Once assigned, proceed to l+1.\n\nBut how to handle the initial l=1 case.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph, where each step (for each l) depends on the previous step.\n\nAn alternative approach is to build the prefix chain and the suffix chain.\n\nLet's think about the prefix chain. Each prefix for l must be the previous prefix plus a new character. Similarly, the suffix chain must be built by adding a character to the front.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus one more character.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l is one more character plus the suffix of l-1.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- Start with l=1. The two strings are p1 and s1. We don't know which is which.\n\n- For l=2, the two strings are p2 and s2. We need to see which one starts with p1 (if p1 is the prefix of l=1), and which one ends with s1 (if s1 is the suffix of l=1).\n\nWait, but for l=2, the prefix is s[0..1], which is the prefix of l=1 (s[0]) plus s[1].\n\nSimilarly, the suffix is s[-2..-1], which is s[-1] (the suffix of l=1) plus s[-2].\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of p1 and s1, we can try to see which option leads to a consistent l=2.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think with an example.\n\nSuppose for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'b'.\n\nNow, for l=2, the two strings are 'aa' and 'ba'.\n\nCase 1: Assume 'a' is the prefix of l=1, 'b' is the suffix of l=1.\n\nThen, the prefix of l=2 must be 'a' followed by some character, say 'x', so 'ax'.\n\nThe suffix of l=2 must be 'y' followed by the suffix of l=1 (which is 'b'), so 'yb'.\n\nLooking at the l=2 options, 'aa' and 'ba':\n\nIf 'aa' is the prefix, then the suffix must be 'b' + 'a' = 'ba'. So in this case, 'aa' is the prefix, 'ba' is the suffix. Does this fit with the previous assumption?\n\nYes, because the prefix 'a' (from l=1) is the first character of 'aa', and the suffix 'b' (from l=1) is the second character of 'ba'.\n\nSo this is a valid case.\n\nCase 2: Assume 'b' is the prefix of l=1, 'a' is the suffix of l=1.\n\nThen, the prefix of l=2 must be 'b' followed by some character, say 'x', so 'bx'.\n\nThe suffix of l=2 must be 'a' followed by 'b' (since the suffix of l=1 is 'a')? Wait, no. Wait, the suffix of l=1 is 'a', so the suffix of l=2 is s[-2] followed by s[-1], which is 'a' + 'b'? Or is it 'b' + 'a'?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\ns is the string of length n.\n\nFor l=1:\n\nprefix is s[0], suffix is s[-1].\n\nFor l=2:\n\nprefix is s[0..1], which is s[0] + s[1].\n\nsuffix is s[-2..-1], which is s[-2] + s[-1].\n\nSo, if for l=1, the prefix is 'b' (s[0] = 'b') and the suffix is 'a' (s[-1] = 'a'), then the prefix of l=2 is 'b' followed by s[1], and the suffix is s[-2] followed by 'a'.\n\nIn this scenario, for l=2, the two strings are 'aa' and 'ba'.\n\nAssuming 'aa' is the prefix, then s[0] = 'a' (but earlier we assumed it was 'b'). So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if 'ba' is the prefix, then s[0] is 'b' and s[1] is 'a', which matches our assumption. Then, the suffix of l=2 would be s[-2] + s[-1]. But s[-1] is 'a', so the suffix is 'a' followed by 'a' → 'aa'.\n\nSo in this case, the suffix of l=2 is 'aa', which is one of the strings.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are 'aa' (prefix) and 'ba' (suffix). But wait, no. Wait, in this case, the suffix of l=2 is s[-2] + s[-1]. s[-2] is the character before the last, which in this example is 'b' (since s is 'ba...'), but wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me create a concrete example.\n\nAssume that for l=1, the prefix is 'b' and the suffix is 'a'.\n\nThen, for l=2, the prefix is 'ba' (assuming s[1] is 'a'), and the suffix is 'a' followed by 'a' (so 'aa').\n\nSo, the two strings for l=2 are 'ba' (prefix) and 'aa' (suffix).\n\nSo, in this case, the two strings for l=2 are 'aa' and 'ba'.\n\nSo, the two options are:\n\n- 'aa' is the suffix, 'ba' is the prefix.\n\nWhich implies that the suffix of l=2 is 'aa', which is the same as the suffix of l=1 plus a character. Wait, the suffix of l=1 is 'a', so the suffix of l=2 should be 'x' + 'a', where x is the character before the last. So, if the suffix of l=2 is 'aa', then x is 'a', which implies that the character before last is 'a'.\n\nBut in our assumption for l=1, s ends with 'a'. So the suffix of l=2 is 'a' followed by 'a', implying that the second last character is 'a'.\n\nSo, s could be 'baaa...' etc.\n\nSo, this seems possible.\n\nBut now, how to determine for l=1 whether 'a' is the prefix and 'b' is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nIt's unclear. So perhaps the approach is to try all possible combinations for l=1, and see which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut since l can be up to 99, trying all possible assignments for l=1 might not be efficient. But for n up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct assignment is unique, and thus we can find it by following the constraints step by step.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. For each possible assignment of the two strings of length l as prefix and suffix.\n\n   b. Check if this assignment is compatible with the previous assignments for l-1.\n\n   c. Proceed recursively, keeping track of possible assignments.\n\nBut this sounds like a backtracking approach, which may be feasible for n up to 100.\n\nWait, but n is 100, and for each step, the number of possibilities could multiply, making this approach computationally heavy.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe correct assignment must be such that for each l, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus a character, and the suffix of l is the suffix of l-1 plus a character at the front.\n\nSo, for each l, we can find the correct prefix and suffix based on the previous step.\n\nSo, let's assume that for l=1, we can choose which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nThen, for l=2, we can check which of the two possible assignments (swap or not) is compatible with l=1.\n\nOnce assigned, for l=3, we can do the same, and so on.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nPerhaps, for each l, after choosing which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, we can proceed.\n\nBut for l=1, since there's no previous l, any choice is possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps for l=1, the two strings are both the first and last character of s.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings could be the same (then, s starts and ends with the same character) or different (s starts with one and ends with the other).\n\nThus, for l=1, we have two possibilities.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nWe maintain for each l, the possible pairs of (prefix, suffix) that are compatible with the previous steps.\n\nAt l=1, we have two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: prefix is 'a', suffix is 'b'.\n\nPossibility 2: prefix is 'b', suffix is 'a'.\n\nThen, for l=2, for each possibility in l=1, we try both possible assignments for l=2 and see if they fit.\n\nFor each possibility, we proceed until l=n-1, and for each l, we track the possible pairs.\n\nBut for n=100, this would result in 2^(n-1) possibilities, which is way too large.\n\nThat's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the correct assignment is uniquely determined by the constraints, so that for each l, there's only one possible choice once the previous choices are fixed.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps for l=1, if the two strings are different, then for l=2, exactly one of the two options is compatible.\n\nSo, for example, for l=1, if the two strings are 'a' and 'b', then for l=2, we can try both options and see which one works.\n\nSo, let's formalize this:\n\nWe can represent the current state as the prefix of l and the suffix of l.\n\nFor each l starting from 1, we can try both possible assignments and see which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this could be too slow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct assignment is such that for each l, the two strings of length l can be ordered in a way that the first l-1 characters are the same, and the last character is determined by the previous step.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by building the prefix and suffix chains.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- For each l, the prefix of l is the first l characters of s.\n\n- The suffix of l is the last l characters of s.\n\nSo, for l=1, prefix is s[0], suffix is s[-1].\n\nFor l=2, prefix is s[0..1], suffix is s[-2..-1].\n\nNow, for each l, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus a new character.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l is a new character plus the suffix of l-1.\n\nSo, the way to build the correct assignment is to, for each l, find which of the two strings of length l is the prefix (i.e., it starts with the prefix of l-1), and which is the suffix (ends with the suffix of l-1).\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For l=1, collect the two strings. They are the candidates for prefix and suffix.\n\n2. For l=2, collect the two strings. Check which one starts with the prefix of l=1, and which one ends with the suffix of l=1.\n\n3. Once determined, proceed to l=3, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is that for l=1, we don't know which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps for l=1, we can try both possibilities and see which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother Idea: \n\nPerhaps the correct assignment can be determined by the fact that for l= n-1, the prefix of l is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. The full string s can be constructed as the prefix of l followed by the last character, which is the same as the last character of the suffix of l.\n\nWait, because s is of length n, and the prefix is n-1 characters. So the last character of the suffix of l must be equal to the last character of the prefix of l.\n\nWait, because the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, which includes the last character.\n\nWait, no. For example, if s is 'abcde', then the prefix of 4 is 'abcd', the suffix of 4 is 'bcde'. The last character of the prefix is 'd', the last character of the suffix is 'e'. These are different.\n\nSo, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nOnce we have determined the prefix for l and the suffix for l, the next step is to find which of the two possible strings for l+1 can be the prefix and which the suffix.\n\nSo, for l=1, we have two options.\n\nFor each option, we can proceed to l=2, and for each possible option in l=2, proceed to l=3, and so on until l=n-1.\n\nThis suggests a recursive approach, but for n=100, this could be computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows for a greedy approach, where for each l, the correct assignment can be determined uniquely based on the previous steps.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For l=1, collect the two strings. They are the possible prefix and suffix.\n\n- For l=2, collect the two strings. Check if one of them starts with the prefix of l=1 (it must be the prefix), and the other ends with the suffix of l=1 (it must be the suffix).\n\n- Assign accordingly and proceed.\n\nBut what if, for l=2, neither of the two strings starts with the l=1 prefix? That can't happen, because the problem states that the input is valid.\n\nSo, for each l, we can proceed by checking which of the two strings of length l starts with the prefix of l-1 (and thus must be the prefix for l), and which ends with the suffix of l-1 (thus must be the suffix for l).\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for l >= 2, the prefix of l must start with the prefix of l-1, and the suffix of l must end with the suffix of l-1.\n\nSo, for each l:\n\nprefix_l = prefix_{l-1} + c (some character)\n\nsuffix_l = c + suffix_{l-1} (some character added to the front)\n\nSo, for each l, given the two possible strings of length l, we can find which is the prefix and which is the suffix by checking which string starts with the prefix of l-1 and which ends with the suffix of l-1.\n\nBut for l=1, we don't have a previous l, so we have to make a choice.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be structured as:\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_prefix = None\n\nprev_suffix = None\n\nFor each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   if l == 1:\n\n       collect the two strings of length 1.\n\n       for each possible assignment (s1, s2):\n\n           if s1 is the prefix (prev_prefix = s1), then check for l=2.\n\n           else, s2 is the prefix.\n\n       proceed with the one that allows the rest of the l steps.\n\n   else:\n\n       collect the two strings of length l.\n\n       for each possible assignment (current_p, current_s):\n\n           if current_p starts with prev_prefix and current_s ends with prev_suffix:\n\n               assign current_p as new prefix, current_s as new suffix.\n\n               proceed to l+1.\n\n               break\n\nSo, the main challenge is handling the l=1 case.\n\nBut perhaps, for l=1, we can try both possibilities and see which leads to a consistent assignment for all l.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this could be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct assignment for l=1 is uniquely determined by the higher l's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for l=1, the two strings are the same. In that case, the prefix and suffix are the same, so it's easy to assign.\n\nOnly when the two strings for l=1 are different, we have to make a choice.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- For l=1:\n\n   if the two strings are the same:\n\n       assign both as the same (prefix and suffix are the same).\n\n   else:\n\n       for each possible assignment (a as prefix, b as suffix; or b as prefix, a as suffix), proceed to l=2 and see which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAnother Idea: \n\nThe correct assignment is such that for all l, the prefix of l is the longest possible common prefix with the suffix of l.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=5\n\nThe input strings are:\n\n'ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'\n\nWait, perhaps I should reorganize the input into groups by length.\n\nWait, the input has 2n-2 = 8 strings for n=5.\n\nGrouped by length:\n\nLength 1: 'a', 'a' → but wait, no, wait the input is:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a list of lines, each line being a string followed by a newline.\n\nSo, for the first example, the input lines are:\n\nline 0: '5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba'\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, the user input is a bit unclear, but perhaps the input is a list of lines, each containing a string of varying lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps the first line after n is the first string, then the next, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the code needs to read all lines except the first (n) and group them by their lengths.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read 2n-2 lines. For each line, strip the newline and group them into a dictionary keyed by length.\n\nSo, for each string, store it in a list per length.\n\nOnce that's done, for each l from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n\nNow, for each l, the two strings are the candidates for prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Group all strings by their lengths.\n\n2. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Get the two strings of length l, say s1 and s2.\n\n   b. For l=1:\n\n      i. If s1 and s2 are the same: then both are the same as the prefix and suffix. So, we can assign either as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n      ii. Else: we need to try both possibilities and see which leads to a consistent assignment for higher l.\n\n   c. For l>1:\n\n      i. Find which of the two strings starts with the prefix of l-1 (this must be the prefix of l).\n\n      ii. Find which of the two strings ends with the suffix of l-1 (this must be the suffix of l).\n\n      iii. Assign accordingly.\n\n3. Once all l are processed, construct the output string by assigning 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut the issue is how to handle l=1 when the two strings are different.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to try both possibilities for l=1 and see which one leads to a consistent solution for all l.\n\nBut for n=100, this could be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, in code, for l=1, if the two strings are different, we need to try both possible assignments.\n\nBut how to manage the two possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for l=1, the correct assignment is such that for l=2, the two strings can be uniquely assigned.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- For l=1, if the two strings are the same, assign both as prefix and suffix.\n\n- Else, try both possible assignments (s1 is prefix, s2 is suffix; and s2 is prefix, s1 is suffix).\n\n   For each assignment, proceed to l=2 and see if it can be resolved.\n\n   If any of the paths leads to a complete solution, choose that path.\n\n   Else, return any valid path.\n\nBut implementing this requires a way to backtrack and explore both possibilities.\n\nBut for n=100, this could be computationally expensive, but given that n is small (up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code can proceed by using a recursive function that, for each l, tries both possibilities if necessary, and returns the assignment if it can proceed.\n\nBut recursion may not be feasible for n=100, due to stack depth.\n\nAlternatively, the code can use memoization or dynamic programming.\n\nBut perhaps an iterative approach is better.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nOnce l=1 is handled, for higher l, the assignment is uniquely determined by the previous steps.\n\nSo, for l=1, if the two strings are different, we can try both possibilities and see which leads to a consistent assignment for l=2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn code, perhaps the following steps can be taken:\n\n- Read all the strings, group them by length.\n\n- For l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Get the two strings of length l.\n\n   b. For l=1:\n\n      i. If the two strings are the same, assign them as prefix and suffix.\n\n      ii. Else, try both possible assignments and see which leads to a consistent solution for higher l.\n\n   c. For l>1:\n\n      i. Check which string starts with the previous prefix.\n\n      ii. Check which string ends with the previous suffix.\n\n      iii. Assign accordingly.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\n- Create a dictionary to hold the group of strings by their lengths.\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Get the two strings of length l.\n\n   b.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the unknown string `s` of length `n`.

This helps us efficiently access the strings of each length when needed.\n2. **Determine Prefix and Suffix for Each Length**: For each length `l` from 1 to `n-1`, we determine which of the two strings of that length is the prefix and which is the suffix. \n   - For `l = 1`, if the two strings are different, we try both possibilities (one as prefix and the other as suffix) and check which leads to a consistent solution for higher lengths.\n   - For `l > 1`, we use the previously determined prefix and suffix to check which of the current strings fits the required pattern (starting with the previous prefix or ending with the previous suffix).\n3. **Construct the Result String**: Based on the determined prefixes and suffixes, we construct the result string where each character is 'P' if the corresponding string is a prefix and 'S' if it is a suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nlength_groups = defaultdict(list)\nfor s in strings:\n    length_groups[len(s)].append(s)\n\nprefix_suffix = {}\n\nfor l in range(1, n):\n    candidates = length_groups[l]\n    if l == 1:\n        if len(candidates) != 2:\n            pass\n        if candidates[0] == candidates[1]:\n            prefix = candidates[0]\n            suffix = candidates[1]\n        else:\n            # Try both possibilities\n            possible_prefixes = []\n            possible_suffices = []\n            for candidate in candidates:\n                if candidate not in possible_prefixes and candidate not in possible_suffices:\n                    possible_prefixes.append(candidate)\n                    possible_suffices.append(candidate)\n            # Try first as prefix\n            p1, s1 = possible_prefixes[0], possible_suffices[0]\n            success1 = True\n            for next_l in range(2, n):\n                if next_l not in prefix_suffix:\n                    continue\n                current_p, current_s = prefix_suffix[next_l]\n                # Check if p1 starts with current_p\n                if not (p1.startswith(current_p)):\n                    success1 = False\n                    break\n                # Check if s1 ends with current_s\n                if not (s1.endswith(current_s)):\n                    success1 = False\n                    break\n                # Assign next level\n                p1 += current_p[-1]\n                s1 = current_s[0] + s1\n            # Try second as prefix\n            p2, s2 = possible_prefixes[1], possible_suffices[1]\n            success2 = True\n            for next_l in range(2, n):\n                if next_l not in prefix_suffix:\n                    continue\n                current_p, current_s = prefix_suffix[next_l]\n                # Check if p2 starts with current_p\n                if not (p2.startswith(current_p)):\n                    success2 = False\n                    break\n                # Check if s2 ends with current_s\n                if not (s2.endswith(current_s)):\n                    success2 = False\n                    break\n                # Assign next level\n                p2 += current_p[-1]\n                s2 = current_s[0] + s2\n            if success1:\n                prefix, suffix = p1, s1\n            elif success2:\n                prefix, suffix = p2, s2\n            else:\n                # If neither works, pick one arbitrarily\n                prefix, suffix = candidates[0], candidates[1]\n    else:\n        current_p, current_s = prefix_suffix.get(l-1, (None, None))\n        candidates = length_groups[l]\n        possible_p = []\n        possible_s = []\n        for candidate in candidates:\n            if candidate.startswith(current_p) and (candidate[-1:] == current_s[-1]):\n                possible_p.append(candidate)\n                possible_s.append(candidate)\n        if len(possible_p) == 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            # Choose the first possible as prefix\n            prefix = possible_p[0]\n            suffix = possible_s[0]\n    prefix_suffix[l] = (prefix, suffix)\n\n# Now, assign P/S to each original string\nresult = [''] * len(strings)\nfor i, s in enumerate(strings):\n    l = len(s)\n    if l in prefix_suffix:\n        p, suff = prefix_suffix[l]\n        if s == p:\n            result[i] = 'P'\n        elif s == suff:\n            result[i] = 'S'\n        else:\n            # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n            pass\n    else:\n        # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n        pass\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input strings and groups them by their lengths. It then iteratively determines which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for each length starting from 1 up to `n-1`. For each length, it checks the possible assignments based on the constraints from the previous length. Finally, it constructs the result string by marking each input string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it is identified as a prefix or suffix.",
