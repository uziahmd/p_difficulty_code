The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. I need to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out for each round whether Nikephoros (let's call him N) wins or loses, and same for Polycarpus (P). Then count the losses.\n\nBut wait, how do their strategies work? Oh right, both have sequences A and B that they cycle through. So for each round i (from 0 to n-1), N's choice is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, P's choice is B[i % k], with k being the length of B.\n\nFor each round, determine who loses based on the choices. If N's choice beats P's, then P gets a pinch. Otherwise if P's choice beats N's, then N gets a pinch. If it's a draw, no one gets a pinch.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Read the input: n, A string, B string.\n2. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get N's choice: A[i % len(A)]\n   b. Get P's choice: B[i % len(B)]\n   c. Determine the winner and update the counts.\n3. After processing all rounds, output the counts.\n\nWait, but what's the order of the rounds? Are the rounds determined by the ith index, starting from 0? Yes, because it's cyclic.\n\nNow, the main challenge is efficiently determining the outcome of each round. Let's think about the rules:\n\n- Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n- Scissors (S) beat Paper (P)\n- Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo for each pair of choices (a, b), we can determine the outcome.\n\nLet me create a helper function or a way to map each possible pair to whether a wins over b.\n\nAlternatively, for each a in A and b in B, we can precompute the outcome.\n\nBut since the sequences can be up to 1000 in length, and n can be up to 200,000 (since 2*10^9?), wait no, the input says 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·1e5? Wait, the problem statement says n is up to 2·109, which is 2*1e9? Or maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's 2*1e5?\n\nWait, looking back, the input says n is up to 2e9? Because 2·109 is written as 2·109, which is 2*1009? Wait, no, 2·109 is 2 multiplied by 109, which is 218. But that's not possible because for n=2e9, you can't process each round in O(1) time. Wait, no, the problem statement says 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·1e9, which is 2 billion. That's a lot. So processing each round in a loop is impossible because it would take O(n) time, which is way too slow.\n\nOh wait, that's a big problem. Because for n up to 2e9, we can't iterate each round step by step. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the initial approach of looping through each round is not feasible for large n. We need to find a way to compute the total number of times each possible pair (a, b) occurs across all rounds, and then compute the total red spots based on that.\n\nBecause for each possible a and b, we can compute whether a beats b or not. Then, for each such pair, multiply the number of times it occurs by the contribution to the red spots (i.e., 1 if a beats b, else 0 if it's a loss for a or b, or 0 if it's a draw).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the frequency of each (a, b) pair across all n rounds.\n2. For each pair (a, b), determine if a beats b, in which case P gets a red spot. Or if b beats a, in which case N gets a red spot. Or it's a draw.\n\nBut how to compute the frequencies efficiently.\n\nEach round is determined by i, and for each i, N's choice is A[i % m], and P's is B[i % k]. So the sequence of (A_i, B_j) is determined by the indices i mod m and i mod k.\n\nWe need to find, for each possible (x, y) in the alphabet R/S/P, the number of times x appears in A's sequence and y in B's sequence, but only when the index i satisfies i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k, for some a and b.\n\nWait, that sounds like a Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) problem. For each a in 0..m-1, and b in 0..k-1, find the number of i's in 0..n-1 such that i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k.\n\nThis will give us the count for each (a, b) pair, which are the possible choices of A and B in each round.\n\nOnce we have the count for each (a, b), we can compute how many times each player lost.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding, for each possible pair (a, b), how many times it occurs in the n rounds, then for each such occurrence, determine whether a beats b (so P gets a point) or vice versa.\n\nSo first, let's model the problem as finding, for each a in A's characters, and for each b in B's characters, the number of times they appear in the same round, given their respective cycles.\n\nBut how to compute this count efficiently.\n\nThe CRT tells us that the system of congruences i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k has a solution if and only if a ≡ b mod d, where d = gcd(m, k). If there's a solution, the number of solutions modulo LCM(m, k) is either 0 or 1.\n\nWait, more precisely, the number of solutions in 0 <= i < n is either floor((n - x)/t) + 1, where t is the period (LCM(m, k)), and x is the smallest non-negative solution. Or zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as: for each a (0 to m-1), and each b (0 to k-1), check if i exists such that i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k. If so, compute the minimal x that satisfies these, and then the number of times x occurs in [0, n-1].\n\nWait, but for each a and b, the condition is that a ≡ b mod d, where d = gcd(m, k). Because for i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k, this is equivalent to a ≡ b mod d.\n\nSo for each a and b, if (a - b) mod d != 0, then there's no solution, and thus the pair (a, b) never occurs.\n\nOtherwise, the number of times this pair occurs is equal to the number of i in [0, n-1] that satisfy i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k.\n\nSo for each a and b, we can compute the count c(a,b) as follows:\n\n- Check if a ≡ b mod d, where d = gcd(m, k). If not, c(a,b) = 0.\n- Else, find the smallest i0 >=0 such that i0 ≡ a mod m and i0 ≡ b mod k. Then, the next solutions are i0 + t*LCM(m,k), for t >=0.\n- Compute how many such i are less than n.\n\nWait, but n is up to 2e9, so we need an efficient way to compute this without iterating.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute d = gcd(m, k).\n2. For each a in 0..m-1:\n   a. For each b in 0..k-1:\n      i. Check if (a - b) mod d == 0. If not, continue.\n      ii. Else, find x = the minimal i that satisfies x ≡ a mod m and x ≡ b mod k.\n         This x can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n      iii. Once x is found, compute the period T = LCM(m, k).\n      iv. Compute how many times x + t*T < n, for t >=0.\n         The count is floor( (n - x) / T ) + 1, if x < n.\n         Or zero if x >=n.\n3. Sum all c(a,b) for each (a, b) to get the total occurrences of each possible pair.\n\nWait, but how to compute x, the minimal i that satisfies the congruences.\n\nYes, the extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve for x in the equation:\n\ni ≡ a mod m\ni ≡ b mod k\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ni = a + m * t1\ni = b + k * t2\n\nSetting them equal: a + m*t1 = b + k*t2 => m*t1 - k*t2 = b - a.\n\nWe can find t1 and t2 such that this holds. The minimal non-negative solution can be found.\n\nBut implementing this might be a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the CRT.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that the solution exists iff a ≡ b mod d, and then the solution is x = a + (b - a) * inv(d) * (m/d)^-1 mod something. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, I can find x using the following method:\n\nWe can write i = a + m * t.\n\nSubstituting into the second congruence: a + m*t ≡ b mod k.\n\nSo m*t ≡ (b - a) mod k.\n\nWe can solve for t: t ≡ (b -a)/d * inv(m/d) mod (k/d), where d = gcd(m, k).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe equation is m * t ≡ (b - a) mod k.\n\nSince d = gcd(m, k), we can divide both sides by d:\n\n(m/d)*t ≡ (b - a)/d mod (k/d).\n\nSince m/d and k/d are coprime, we can find the inverse of m/d modulo k/d.\n\nSo t ≡ ((b - a)/d) * inv(m/d mod k/d) mod (k/d).\n\nThus, t0 = ((b - a)/d) * inv mod (k/d), and then the minimal positive t is t0.\n\nThen x = a + m * t0.\n\nBut wait, sometimes x could be negative, so we need to ensure it's positive.\n\nHmm, okay, but implementing this requires careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CRT function from the math library, but I'm not sure if Python has built-in functions for that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each a in 0..m-1 and b in 0..k-1:\n\n1. Check if (a - b) mod d != 0. If so, skip.\n2. Else, find x as the minimal i that satisfies i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k.\n3. If x >=n, then this pair doesn't occur.\n4. Else, compute the number of times x, x+T, x+2T, etc., are <n. The count is floor( (n - x - 1) / T ) +1.\n\nWait, but what if T is larger than n? Then there might be zero or one occurrence.\n\nBut how to compute T, which is LCM(m, k) = m*k / d.\n\nOnce we have x and T, the count is max(0, (n - x + T -1) // T )\n\nWait, because the number of terms in the arithmetic progression x, x+T, x+2T, ..., <=n-1.\n\nSo for example, if x is 5, T is 10, n is 15. Then the numbers are 5, 15, which is beyond n=15 (since rounds are 0-based). So 5 is included, 15 is not. So count is 1.\n\nIf x is 5, T is 10, n is 16: 5,15 are within 0<=i<16. So count is 2.\n\nSo the formula should be: count = (n - x) // T + 1 if x <=n-1.\n\nBut wait, if x is 10, T is 10, and n is 10: i can be 10, which is >=n (since n=10 is 0-based up to 9). So no.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nif x >=n: 0\n\nelse:\n\nnumber of terms = ((n -1 - x) // T) + 1\n\nYes, because for i <n, so the maximum i is n-1.\n\nSo for x, x+T, ... <=n-1.\n\nSo the number is floor( (n-1 -x)/T ) +1.\n\nWait, let's test some examples.\n\nCase 1:\n\nx=5, T=10, n=15.\n\nn-1=14.\n\n(14-5)=9. 9//10=0. So 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nCase 2:\n\nx=5, T=10, n=16.\n\n14-5=9. 9//10=0. So 1.\n\nWait, but 5,15 are both <16, so 2 terms. Wait, no: 15 is <16, yes. So why is the count 2?\n\nWait, according to the formula, (14-5) is 9, divided by 10 is 0, plus 1 gives 1. But 5 and 15 are two terms.\n\nHmm, that suggests the formula is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is ((n - x) + T -1) // T ?\n\nWait, let's re-calculate.\n\nIn case 1: x=5, T=10, n=15.\n\nn-x=10. (10 + 10-1)=19. 19//10=1. So count is 1. Correct.\n\nIn case 2: x=5, T=10, n=16.\n\nn-x=11. (11+9)=20. 20//10=2. So count is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: x=5, T=10, n=25.\n\nn-x=20. 20+9=29//10=2. 2+1=3? No, wait: 5,15,25. But 25 is >=25, so only 5 and 15 are included. So count is 2.\n\nWait, (25-5) is 20. 20//10=2. So count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula is: count = (n - x + T -1) // T.\n\nWait, but what if x >n-1?\n\nLike x=10, n=10: then 10 is not less than 10, so count is zero.\n\nSo the overall steps for each pair (a, b) are:\n\nCompute d = gcd(m, k).\n\nIf (a - b) mod d != 0: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute x = the minimal i that satisfies i ≡ a mod m and i ≡ b mod k.\n\nIf x >=n: count is zero.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k) = (m*k) // d.\n\ncount = ((n - x) + T -1) // T.\n\nAdd count to the total for (a, b).\n\nOnce we have the count for each (a, b), we can compute the number of times each player loses.\n\nNow, how to compute x.\n\nI think the way to compute x is to solve for i in:\n\ni ≡ a mod m\n\ni ≡ b mod k\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo, the steps to compute x are:\n\nWe have i ≡ a mod m → i = a + m * t1.\n\nSubstitute into i ≡ b mod k:\n\na + m*t1 ≡ b mod k → m*t1 ≡ (b -a) mod k.\n\nLet’s denote g = gcd(m, k). Let’s set m = g*m', k = g*k'.\n\nThen, the equation becomes m'*t1 ≡ ((b -a)/g) mod k'.\n\nSince m' and k' are coprime, we can find the modular inverse of m' modulo k'.\n\nLet inv_m' = inverse of m' mod k'. Then:\n\nt1 ≡ ( (b -a)/g ) * inv_m' mod k'\n\nSo t1 = t0 + s*k' for integer s.\n\nThe minimal t1 is t0.\n\nThen x = a + m*t0.\n\nBut since t0 can be negative, we need to adjust it to be non-negative.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to compute x as follows.\n\nImplement the extended Euclidean algorithm to solve for t1 in the equation m*t1 ≡ (b -a) mod k.\n\nWait, but the equation is m*t1 ≡ (b - a) mod k.\n\nLet me denote c = b - a.\n\nSo, m*t1 ≡ c mod k.\n\nWe can compute the solution for t1 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, check if d = gcd(m, k) divides c. If not, no solution.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo, let's compute g = gcd(m, k). Check if c mod g == 0. If not, no solution.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, reduce the equation:\n\nm/g * t1 ≡ c/g mod (k/g).\n\nSince m/g and k/g are coprime, we can find the inverse of m/g modulo k/g.\n\nLet inv = inverse of (m/g) mod (k/g).\n\nThen, t1 ≡ inv * (c/g) mod (k/g).\n\nSo t1 = t0 + s*(k/g), for s ∈ integers.\n\nThe minimal t1 is t0, which can be negative.\n\nOnce t1 is found, x = a + m * t1.\n\nWait, but m is the original value.\n\nWait, no, m is part of the initial equation. So perhaps m is the original value.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal equation: m*t1 ≡ c mod k.\n\nAfter dividing by g, it becomes (m/g)*t1 ≡ (c/g) mod (k/g).\n\nSo t1 ≡ (c/g) * inv(m/g, k/g) mod (k/g).\n\nThus, t1 can be written as t1 = t0 + s*(k/g), where s is any integer.\n\nTo find the minimal x, we can choose s such that t1 is the smallest non-negative solution.\n\nWait, but perhaps x can be negative, so we need to make sure x is within the valid range.\n\nAlternatively, once x is computed, if x is negative, add multiples of T until it's positive.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way.\n\nSo, putting it all together, for each a and b:\n\nCompute d = gcd(m, k).\n\nIf (a - b) mod d != 0 → continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute c = b - a.\n\nWe have to solve m*t1 ≡ c mod k.\n\nCompute g = gcd(m, k).\n\nCheck if c mod g != 0 → no solution.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nCompute m' = m/g, k' = k/g, c' = c/g.\n\nFind the modular inverse of m' mod k'. Let inv_m_prime = inv.\n\nThen t1 = (c' * inv_m_prime) mod k'.\n\nSo t1 is the minimal non-negative solution.\n\nThen x = a + m * t1.\n\nWait, but this x may not satisfy i ≡ b mod k.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, x = a + m * t1.\n\nBut t1 was found to satisfy m*t1 ≡ c mod k.\n\nc is b -a → m*t1 ≡ (b -a) mod k → a + m*t1 ≡ a + (b -a) mod k → a + m*t1 ≡ b mod k.\n\nWhich is exactly the condition.\n\nSo x will satisfy x ≡ a mod m and x ≡ b mod k.\n\nSo x is a solution.\n\nBut x could be negative. So we need to find the minimal x >=0.\n\nWait, but t1 can be negative, which would make x negative.\n\nSo how to find the minimal x >=0.\n\nWell, perhaps after computing x, we can compute x modulo T, where T is LCM(m, k).\n\nBecause adding or subtracting T won't change the congruence.\n\nSo, x can be adjusted to be within [0, T-1].\n\nWait, but perhaps x is already in that range.\n\nAlternatively, x can be negative, so we can compute x mod T to bring it into the correct range.\n\nWait, but for example, x could be negative and T is large, so adding T enough times would bring x into the [0, T) range.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal x is x + k*T for some k.\n\nBut since we're dealing with modulo T, the minimal positive solution is x mod T.\n\nWait, no, because x can be negative.\n\nWait, for example, x = -5, T=10 → x mod 10 is 5, which is the correct minimal positive solution.\n\nYes, so perhaps x can be represented as x = x0 + s*T, where s is chosen to make x >=0.\n\nSo after computing x, the minimal non-negative solution is x mod T.\n\nWait, but T is the LCM of m and k, which is m*k / g.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute x as x = (x_initial) mod T, and then if x <0, add T.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers in a way that the result is non-negative.\n\nWait, in Python, (-5) % 10 is 5.\n\nSo perhaps x = x_initial % T.\n\nBut wait, if x_initial is negative, this will give the correct minimal positive solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute x_initial as a + m * t1.\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // g.\n\nx = x_initial % T.\n\nBut wait, what if x_initial is negative? For example, x_initial is -5, T is 10 → x is 5, which is correct.\n\nBut in that case, x would be 5, which is less than T, so it's the minimal positive solution.\n\nWait, but does x represent the minimal solution? Because x could be negative, but mod T makes it positive.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, after computing x_initial, compute x = x_initial % T.\n\nIf x >=n → count is 0.\n\nElse, compute how many times x appears in [0, n-1].\n\nSo the count is ((n -1 - x) // T) + 1.\n\nWait, because the last term is x + t*T <= n-1.\n\nSo t can be 0, 1, ..., up to t_max where x + t_max*T <=n-1.\n\nSo t_max = (n-1 -x) // T.\n\nNumber of terms is t_max +1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each a in 0..m-1:\n\n   for each b in 0..k-1:\n\n       if (a -b) mod d !=0 → continue.\n\n       compute c = b -a.\n\n       m, k, d = compute_gcd(m, k).\n\n       if c mod d !=0 → no solution.\n\n       else:\n\n           m_prime = m//d\n\n           k_prime = k//d\n\n           c_prime = c//d\n\n           # Find inverse of m_prime modulo k_prime.\n\n           try:\n\n               inv = pow(m_prime, -1, k_prime)\n\n           except ValueError:\n\n               # Inverse doesn't exist, which shouldn't happen since m_prime and k_prime are coprimes.\n\n               continue\n\n           t1 = (c_prime * inv) % k_prime\n\n           x_initial = a + m * t1\n\n           T = (m * k) // d\n\n           x = x_initial % T\n\n           if x >=n:\n\n               count =0\n\n           else:\n\n               max_i = n-1\n\n               count = (max_i - x) // T +1\n\n           # Now, for each occurrence, check if a beats b, else if b beats a.\n\n           # So for each such occurrence, determine the outcome.\n\n           # So, for each count, compute how much each player loses.\n\n           # So for each (a_char, b_char), for each occurrence, if a_char beats b_char → P loses → N gains a point.\n\n           # Else if b_char beats a_char → N loses → P gains a point.\n\n           # Else → no points.\n\n           # So, for each pair (a, b), compute how many times a beats b.\n\n           # So, for a_char and b_char, if a beats b, then P gets a point per count.\n\n           # Else if b beats a, then N gets a point per count.\n\n           # Else, nothing.\n\n           # So, for each (a_char, b_char):\n\n           # Determine if a beats b → contributes count to P's points.\n\n           # Else if b beats a → contributes count to N's points.\n\n           # Else, nothing.\n\n           # So, we need to precompute for all possible pairs (a, b) whether a beats b.\n\n           # Then, multiply by count to get the total for each player.\n\n           # So, for each (a_char, b_char), store a beats b.\n\n           # Then, for each occurrence, add to N or P accordingly.\n\nSo, the next step is to model the beats relationship.\n\nLet's create a dictionary or a matrix that for each pair (a_char, b_char) indicates whether a beats b.\n\nFor example:\n\nbeats = {\n\n    'R': {'S': True},\n\n    'S': {'P': True},\n\n    'P': {'R': True}\n\n}\n\nSo, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', R beats S → P gets a point.\n\nSimilarly for other cases.\n\nSo, for a given a_char and b_char, we can look up whether a beats b.\n\nThus, for each pair (a, b) in the loops:\n\na_char = A[a]\n\nb_char = B[b]\n\nif a_char beats b_char → P's points += count.\n\nelif b_char beats a_char → N's points += count.\n\nelse → do nothing.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n, A, B.\n\n2. Precompute for each a in 0..m-1 and b in 0..k-1, the count c(a,b) as described.\n\n3. For each a and b, compute a_char = A[a], b_char = B[b].\n\n4. For each such pair, if a_char beats b_char → add c(a,b) to P's points.\n\n5. Else, if b_char beats a_char → add c(a,b) to N's points.\n\n6. Else, add nothing.\n\nFinally, output N's points and P's points.\n\nNow, the question is: how to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut considering that m and k can be up to 1000 each, so the total number of (a, b) pairs is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over each a from 0 to m-1.\n\n   For each a, get A[a] as a_char.\n\n   Then, for each b from 0 to k-1:\n\n      get B[b] as b_char.\n\n      Compute d = gcd(m, k).\n\n      Check if (a - b) mod d == 0.\n\n      If not, continue.\n\n      Else:\n\n          compute c = b - a.\n\n          m, k, d = current m, k, d.\n\n          check if c mod d !=0 → continue.\n\n          else:\n\n              m_prime = m//d\n\n              k_prime = k//d\n\n              c_prime = c//d\n\n              try:\n\n                  inv = pow(m_prime, -1, k_prime)\n\n              except ValueError:\n\n                  # This should not happen since m_prime and k_prime are coprimes.\n\n                  continue\n\n              t1 = (c_prime * inv) % k_prime\n\n              x_initial = a + m * t1\n\n              T = (m * k) // d\n\n              x = x_initial % T\n\n              if x >=n:\n\n                  count =0\n\n              else:\n\n                  max_i = n-1\n\n                  count = (max_i - x) // T +1\n\n              # Now, for this count, determine if a_char beats b_char.\n\n              # Compute whether a_char beats b_char.\n\n              if a_char == b_char:\n\n                  continue\n\n              elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n\n                  p_count += count\n\n              elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n\n                  n_count += count\n\nSo, in code.\n\nBut wait, in code, for each a and b, we have to perform these steps.\n\nBut m and k can be up to 1000 each, leading to 1e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the next thing is to precompute the beats relationships.\n\nSo, for a given a_char and b_char, determine if a beats b.\n\nWe can create a helper function:\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n    if a == 'R' and b == 'S':\n        return True\n    elif a == 'S' and b == 'P':\n        return True\n    elif a == 'P' and b == 'R':\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nSo, in code, for a_char and b_char, if beats(a_char, b_char) is True → P gains count.\n\nElse, if beats(b_char, a_char) is True → N gains count.\n\nElse → no change.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string.\n\nRead B as a string.\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nn_rounds = n\n\nn_points = 0\n\np_points = 0\n\nfor a in range(m):\n\n    a_char = A[a]\n\n    for b in range(k):\n\n        b_char = B[b]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Check if (a - b) mod d ==0.\n\n        d = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n        if (a - b) % d !=0:\n\n            continue\n\n        c = b - a\n\n        if c % d !=0:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Now, compute x.\n\n        m_prime = m // d\n\n        k_prime = k // d\n\n        c_prime = c // d\n\n        try:\n\n            inv = pow(m_prime, -1, k_prime)\n\n        except ValueError:\n\n            # Should not happen as m_prime and k_prime are coprime.\n\n            continue\n\n        t1 = (c_prime * inv) % k_prime\n\n        x_initial = a + m * t1\n\n        T = (m * k) // d\n\n        x = x_initial % T\n\n        if x >=n_rounds:\n\n            count =0\n\n        else:\n\n            max_i = n_rounds -1\n\n            count = (max_i - x) // T +1\n\n        # Now, determine if a_char beats b_char.\n\n        if beats(a_char, b_char):\n\n            p_points += count\n\n        elif beats(b_char, a_char):\n\n            n_points += count\n\nprint(n_points, p_points)\n\nWait, but what about the case where x_initial is very large, but mod T brings it down.\n\nBut the code seems to handle it correctly.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" → m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\" → k=4.\n\nn=7.\n\nLet's compute for all a and b.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's see the sample output is 3 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the code works.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nWait, in the sample explanation:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → P loses.\n\nRound 2: S vs P → S beats P → P loses again.\n\nRound 3: R vs P → R loses.\n\nRound 4: P vs R → P loses.\n\nRound 5: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 6: R vs P → R loses.\n\nSo, in total:\n\nN has 3 losses (rounds 1, 3, 6): P gains 3 points.\n\nP has 2 losses (rounds 2,4): N gains 2 points.\n\nSo the output is 2 3.\n\nWait, but the sample output is '3 2'. Wait, no, the sample output shows 3 and 2.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I got the direction reversed.\n\nWait, when a beats b, then P is the loser, so P gets a point.\n\nWhen b beats a, N is the loser, so N gets a point.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → draw.\n\nNo points.\n\nRound 1: P (A[1]) vs S (B[1]). A is 'P' (since A is \"RPS\", a=1 is 'P').\n\nB is 'S' (since B is \"RSPP\", b=1 is 'S'). So P vs S: S beats P → P is the loser, so N gains a point.\n\nRound 2: A is S (a=2), B is P (b=2). S vs P: S beats P → P loses. N gains a point.\n\nRound3: a=0, which is R. B is P (b=3). R vs P: R loses, so P gains a point.\n\nRound4: a=0 (R) vs B[0]=R → draw.\n\nRound5: a=2 (S) vs B[3]=P → S beats P → P loses, N gains.\n\nRound6: a=0 (R) vs B[3]=P → R loses, P gains.\n\nSo in total:\n\nN gains points in rounds 1,2,5: 3 points.\n\nP gains points in rounds3,6: 2 points.\n\nSo the output is 3 2.\n\nSo the code should count that.\n\nIn the code, for each a and b, compute the count, and then for each occurrence, add to N or P.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, for a=0, b=1:\n\nA[0] is 'R', B[1] is 'S'.\n\nSo R vs S: R beats S → P gains.\n\nBut the code checks if a_char beats b_char: yes. So p_points += count.\n\nWait, but in the sample, a=0, b=1 is one of the rounds.\n\nSo the code should capture that.\n\nBut how many times does a=0, b=1 occur in the 7 rounds?\n\nLooking at the sample, it's once.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\nCompute for a=0, b=1.\n\nd = gcd(3,4)=1.\n\nCheck (0-1) mod 1 = -1 mod 1=0 → ok.\n\nc=1-0=1.\n\n1 mod 1=0 → ok.\n\nm_prime=3, k_prime=4, c_prime=1.\n\ninv = inverse of 3 mod4. 3*3=9 mod4=1 → inv is 3.\n\nt1= (1 *3) mod4=3.\n\nx_initial=0 +3*3=9.\n\nT=12.\n\nx=9 mod12=9.\n\nn=7: 9 >=7 → count=0.\n\nSo this pair (a=0, b=1) doesn't contribute.\n\nWait, but in the sample, this is round 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the way x is calculated.\n\nWait, for a=0, b=1:\n\nx_initial = 0 +3*3=9.\n\nBut n=7, so x=9 is >=7 → count=0.\n\nBut in reality, the round is the first round (i=0?), but according to the code, it's not counted.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the indexing.\n\nWait, in the code, the rounds are 0-based: i ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\nSo for n=7, i runs from 0 to6.\n\nBut for a=0, b=1, x=9, which is >=7 → count is zero.\n\nSo the code is not counting that round.\n\nBut in reality, that's the second round (i=1) in the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding about how the rounds are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is missing some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have a bug in the calculation of x.\n\nWait, for a=0, b=1.\n\nWe have i must be ≡0 mod3 and ≡1 mod4.\n\nWhat is the smallest i that satisfies this?\n\ni must be 0 mod3, 1 mod4.\n\nPossible i's: 3*0=0 → 0 mod4=0 → no.\n\n3*1=3 → 3 mod4=3 → no.\n\n3*2=6 → 6 mod4=2 → no.\n\n3*3=9 → 9 mod4=1 → yes.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. The solution involves efficiently calculating the outcomes of each round based on their respective strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each player follows a cyclic strategy, choosing between Rock (R), Paper (P), and Scissors (S). The goal is to count the number of times each player loses, which results in a red spot.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each round, determine if the first player's choice beats the second player's choice. If it does, the second player gets a red spot, and vice versa. If they choose the same, no one gets a red spot.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating through each round, we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to compute how often each pair of choices (from the two players' sequences) occurs over `n` rounds. This allows us to handle very large values of `n` efficiently.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: For each possible pair of choices, determine the minimal index that satisfies both players' cyclic strategies using modular arithmetic. Compute how many times each valid pair occurs within `n` rounds.\n\n5. **Counting Losses**: For each valid occurrence, determine the winner and update the count of red spots accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n    if a == 'R' and b == 'S':\n        return True\n    elif a == 'S' and b == 'P':\n        return True\n    elif a == 'P' and b == 'R':\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    A = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    B = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    n_points = 0\n    p_points = 0\n    \n    for a in range(m):\n        a_char = A[a]\n        for b in range(k):\n            b_char = B[b]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            d = math.gcd(m, k)\n            if (a - b) % d != 0:\n                continue\n            c = b - a\n            if c % d != 0:\n                continue\n            \n            m_prime = m // d\n            k_prime = k // d\n            c_prime = c // d\n            \n            try:\n                inv = pow(m_prime, -1, k_prime)\n            except ValueError:\n                continue\n            \n            t1 = (c_prime * inv) % k_prime\n            x_initial = a + m * t1\n            T = (m * k) // d\n            x = x_initial % T\n            \n            if x >= n:\n                count = 0\n            else:\n                max_i = n - 1\n                count = (max_i - x) // T + 1\n            \n            if beats(a_char, b_char):\n                p_points += count\n            elif beats(b_char, a_char):\n                n_points += count\n    \n    print(n_points, p_points)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n\n2. **Helper Function**: `beats(a, b)` checks if the choice `a` beats `b` according to the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: For each possible pair of choices from the sequences `A` and `B`, compute the minimal index using modular arithmetic and CRT.
