She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has n tabs open in her browser. The tabs are numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right within the currently open tabs, or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to model what actions she can take and figure out the optimal sequence to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. There are a few possibilities here.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs. For example, if some tabs to the left of l are open, she needs to get to the left end of the desired segment and close those. Similarly for the right.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when she's closing tabs, it's either all to the left or all to the right of the current cursor. So she can choose which side to close each time.\n\nSo let's break down the problem into parts:\n\n1. Determine which tabs need to be closed. That's all tabs except those in [l, r]. So any tab less than l or greater than r needs to be closed.\n\n2. How to efficiently move the cursor and close these tabs.\n\nLet me consider the initial state. The cursor is at 'pos', and the current a and b (the min and max of open tabs) are 1 and n, because initially, all tabs are open.\n\nBut after some operations, a and b will change as tabs are closed.\n\nWait, but when she closes tabs, the a and b are determined by the remaining open tabs. For example, if she closes everything to the left of i, then the new a becomes i.\n\nSo during the process, a and b can change, which affects how she can move the cursor.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe we can model the process in terms of moving to certain points and then closing the tabs on either side.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Move to a position where she can close the left tabs (if needed).\n- Close them.\n- Then, move to a position where she can close the right tabs (if needed).\n- Or perhaps do it in the reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close both sides in one step if possible.\n\nWait, but each operation takes a second. So each move or close counts as a second.\n\nSo let's outline the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: No need to close any tabs. If l=1 and r=n, then she doesn't need to do anything. So the answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: She needs to close tabs on both sides. For example, some tabs to the left of l and some to the right of r.\n\nIn this case, she'll need to:\n\na. Move to the left end (l), close the left tabs.\n\nb. Move to the right end (r), close the right tabs.\n\nc. Alternatively, she might need to close the right first, then the left, depending on which is closer.\n\nWait, but how do the movements work?\n\nEach movement from position i to j takes |i-j| seconds, but considering that you can only move within the current a and b, which may change as you close tabs.\n\nWait, but initially, a is 1 and b is n.\n\nSo for example, suppose she wants to close the left side first. She needs to get to position l, then close all to the left. But wait, when she's at l, the a is l (since after closing left, the min becomes l). So moving to l from pos might take some steps.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nSo let's think about the steps required.\n\nSuppose she has to close both left and right.\n\nShe needs to reach l to close the left, and reach r to close the right.\n\nBut between closing left and right, the available tabs change.\n\nWait, but when she closes left, the a increases to l. So the right side is now from l to r. So when she moves to r after that, she's within the same a and b as before, except a is now l.\n\nWait, no. After closing left, the a is l, so the new range is l to r.\n\nSo when she moves to r, it's within l to r.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Move from pos to l: cost is |pos - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: 1 step.\n\n- Then, move from l to r: cost is (r - l) steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. For example, maybe she can close the right first, then the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close both in a single move, but I don't think so because each close operation is a separate step.\n\nWait, but maybe she can do something smarter. Like, if she's already near l or r, she can save steps.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nSo first, she can move to 2, close left. Then move to 4, close right.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the a is 2, so the available tabs are 2-4. Moving from 2 to 4 takes 2 steps. Then close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 6 3 1 3. So she needs to close 4 and 5 and 6. So she can just close all to the right of 3.\n\nBecause the current pos is 3, and she can close all to the right in one step.\n\nSo steps: 1.\n\nAnother test case is 5 2 1 5. She doesn't need to do anything.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate the minimal steps required to handle both left and right closures, if necessary.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if l is not 1 or r is not n. Because if l is 1 and r is n, nothing to do.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the steps needed to close left and right.\n\nBut also, whether she needs to close left, right, both, or none.\n\nSo:\n\nIf l > 1: She needs to close the left.\n\nIf r < n: She needs to close the right.\n\nSo, for each of these, determine the steps.\n\nNow, the steps for closing left:\n\nTo close the left, she must be at position l. So she needs to move from current pos to l, which takes |pos - l| steps.\n\nThen, close left: 1 step.\n\nSimilarly for right: move to r, close right: 1 step.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the a becomes l. So when moving towards r, she can't go beyond l, but in this case, since r >= l, she can move from l to r without issues.\n\nWait, after closing left, the available tabs are l to r, because the initial a was 1, so after closing left, a becomes l. So she can move from l to r.\n\nBut what if she had to close right first? Then the available tabs would be l to r, but the b would be r.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to always close left first, then right, but sometimes it's more efficient to do the other way.\n\nWait, but what's the difference in steps? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have to close both left and right.\n\nOption 1: Close left first.\n\nSteps:\n\nMove to l: |pos - l|.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove to r: (r - l).\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first.\n\nMove to r: |pos - r|.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nMove to l: (r - l).\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWhich is better depends on which is shorter.\n\nWait, for option 1, the total is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nFor option 2, it's |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo the difference is |pos - l| vs |pos - r|. So which ever is smaller.\n\nBut in reality, when you close left first, you're moving to l, which may require more steps than moving to r first.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to choose the order that requires fewer steps.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of the steps to move to the farthest point first, then the nearest.\n\nWait, no. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose pos is 3, l=2, r=4.\n\nAs in the first sample.\n\nOption 1: close left first.\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove from 2 to 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption 2: close right first.\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nMove from 4 to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSame steps.\n\nAnother example: pos=5, l=2, r=4.\n\nWe need to close left and right.\n\nOption 1: close left first.\n\nMove from 5 to 2: 3 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove from 2 to 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 3+1+2+1=7.\n\nOption 2: close right first.\n\nMove from 5 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove from 4 to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nAh, so in this case, closing right first is better.\n\nSo the order matters.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the steps for both orders and choose the minimal.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed:\n\nCompute the steps for closing left first and right first, then take the minimum.\n\nIf only left needs to be closed:\n\nSteps: move to l, close left.\n\nIf only right needs to be closed:\n\nSteps: move to r, close right.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's a scenario where you don't need to close both, but only one.\n\nWait, no. Because if l>1, you have to close all tabs left of l. Similarly, if r <n, you have to close all tabs right of r.\n\nSo, the steps are as follows:\n\nCalculate the steps required based on whether left and right need to be closed.\n\nLet's formalize:\n\nleft_needs = (l > 1)\n\nright_needs = (r < n)\n\nSo, if neither is needed, output 0.\n\nIf only left is needed:\n\nsteps = distance from pos to l + 1 (for closing left).\n\nIf only right is needed:\n\nsteps = distance from pos to r + 1.\n\nIf both are needed:\n\nWe need to compute two options:\n\nOption A: close left first, then right.\n\nSteps: (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nOption B: close right first, then left.\n\nSteps: (distance from pos to r) + 1 (close right) + (distance from r to l) + 1 (close left).\n\nTake the minimum of A and B.\n\nWait, but wait. When you close left, the a becomes l. So moving from l to r is possible, because the new a is l, and r is within l to r.\n\nSimilarly, when you close right first, the b becomes r, and moving from r to l is allowed because l is >= a.\n\nSo, the steps for option A and B are correctly calculated as such.\n\nSo, let's code this logic.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r ==n.\n\nOutput is 0.\n\nCase 2: l==1, r<n.\n\nOnly right needs to be closed.\n\nCompute steps: move to r, close right.\n\nCase 3: r ==n, l>1.\n\nOnly left needs to be closed.\n\nCompute steps: move to l, close left.\n\nCase 4: Both left and right need to be closed.\n\nCompute steps for both options, choose the minimal.\n\nAnother edge case: l and r are adjacent, like l=2, r=3.\n\nBut the logic should still hold.\n\nWhat about when l=1 and r=1?\n\nThen, she needs to close all except 1.\n\nSo, she needs to close left (but l=1, so no left to close) and right (all from 2 to n).\n\nSo, steps: move to 1 (if not already there), then close right.\n\nWait, no. Because l=1, so left is already closed.\n\nWait, l=1: she needs to leave 1 to r. So, if r <n, then she needs to close all to the right of r.\n\nSo, for l=1 and r=3, n=6: she needs to close 4,5,6.\n\nSo steps: move to r=3, close right.\n\nSo, the steps are (distance from pos to 3) +1.\n\nAnother edge case: when pos is already at l.\n\nIn that case, moving to l is 0 steps.\n\nSimilarly for r.\n\nSo, the code should account for that.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nIf l >1 or r <n:\n\n   if both left and right need to be closed:\n\n       option1 = (distance from pos to l) + 1 + (distance from l to r) + 1\n\n       option2 = (distance from pos to r) + 1 + (distance from r to l) + 1\n\n       steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n   elif only left needs to be closed:\n\n       steps = (distance from pos to l) + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       steps = (distance from pos to r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   steps = 0\n\nWait, but in the case when l>1 and r <n, but after closing left, the a becomes l, but the right closure is from r onwards, which may now be beyond the current b.\n\nWait, no. Because when you close left, the a becomes l, but the b remains as the maximum of the current open tabs. Initially, when you close left, the b is n. So after closing left, the open tabs are from l to n. Then, when you close right, the r is within l to n.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial r is given, but after closing left, the right part to close is from r+1 to the current b.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things.\n\nWait, the initial problem says that she needs to leave exactly the segment [l, r] open. So any tabs outside this are to be closed.\n\nSo regardless of the order, the steps involve moving to l or r, then closing the respective sides.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as four integers.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   left_needs = l > 1\n\n   right_needs = r < n\n\n   if not left_needs and not right_needs:\n\n       print(0)\n\n   elif not left_needs:\n\n       # Only close right\n\n       steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n       print(steps)\n\n   elif not right_needs:\n\n       # Only close left\n\n       steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n       print(steps)\n\n   else:\n\n       # Both need to be closed\n\n       # Compute option1: close left first\n\n       option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n       # option1: move to l, close left, then move to r, close right.\n\n       # Compute option2: close right first\n\n       option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n       # Wait, no. Because moving from r to l is (r - l) steps.\n\n       # So option2 is move to r, close right (1 step), then move to l, close left (1 step).\n\n       # So the steps are (pos to r) + 1 + (r to l) + 1.\n\n       # Which is same as option1.\n\n       # Wait, no, in option1 it's l to r, which is (r - l) steps.\n\n       # In option2, it's r to l, which is (r - l) steps as well.\n\n       # So option1 is (pos to l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\n       # option2 is (pos to r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\n       # So the difference is (pos to l) vs (pos to r).\n\n       # So the minimal steps would be the min between the two options.\n\n       # So compute option1 and option2 as above.\n\n       option1 = (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (r - l) + 1\n\n       option2 = (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (r - l) + 1\n\n       steps = min(option1, option2)\n\n       print(steps)\n\nWait, but wait. The (r - l) is the steps from l to r or r to l. Because moving from l to r is (r - l) steps, and moving from r to l is (r - l) steps as well. So the sum is the same.\n\nSo, the minimal steps are determined by which of the two options (close left first or close right first) requires fewer steps.\n\nWait, but option1 is pos to l, plus (r-l), plus 2 steps for closing.\n\nOption2 is pos to r, plus (r-l), plus 2 steps.\n\nSo the difference is only the initial movement.\n\nSo the minimal steps is the minimum of (pos to l + 2) and (pos to r + 2), but adding (r-l) in both cases.\n\nWait, no. Because (r-l) is added in both options.\n\nSo, the minimal steps is:\n\nmin( (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (r - l + 1), (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (r - l + 1) )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nmin( (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2 ), (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 ) )\n\nSo, the minimal steps is min( (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2 ), (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2 ) )\n\nWait, because (r-l) is the steps between l and r.\n\nSo, in code:\n\noption1 = (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2)\n\noption2 = (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2)\n\nsteps = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(steps)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4\n\nleft_needs = True (2>1)\n\nright_needs = False (4 <6?)\n\nWait, no. r is 4, n is 6, so right_needs is True because 4 <6.\n\nWait, no. r is 4, n is 6. So she needs to close 5 and 6.\n\nSo, both left and right need to be closed.\n\nSo:\n\noption1 = |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 +2 +2=5.\n\noption2 = |3-4| + (4-2) +2 →1 +2 +2=5.\n\nSo steps is 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:6 3 1 3.\n\nSo l=1, r=3.\n\nleft_needs = 1>1 →False.\n\nright_needs= 3<6 →True.\n\nSo steps: move to 3, close right.\n\n|3-3| +1 =0+1=1.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSample Input 3:5 2 1 5.\n\nl=1, r=5.\n\nNo need to close anything. Steps:0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needs=True (2>1), right_needs=True (4<5).\n\noption1: |5-2|=3, plus (4-2)=2, plus 2. Total 3+2+2=7.\n\noption2: |5-4|=1, plus 2, plus 2. Total 1+2+2=5.\n\nSo steps is 5.\n\nWhich aligns with earlier thinking.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needs:3>1→yes.\n\nright_needs:5<7→yes.\n\noption1: |4-3|=1 + (5-3)=2 +2 →5 steps.\n\noption2: |4-5|=1 +2 +2 →5 steps.\n\nSo steps is 5.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nOption1: move to 3, close left (1 step), then move to 5 (2 steps), close right (1 step). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption2: move to5, close right (1 step), then move to3 (2 steps), close left (1 step). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=10, pos=1, l=3, r=7.\n\nleft_needs:3>1→yes.\n\nright_needs:7<10→yes.\n\noption1: |1-3|=2 + (7-3)=4 +2 →8.\n\noption2: |1-7|=6 +4 +2 →12.\n\nSo steps is 8.\n\nSo she closes left first, then right.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=9, l=5, r=6.\n\nleft_needs:5>1→yes.\n\nright_needs:6<10→yes.\n\noption1: |9-5|=4 + (6-5)=1 +2 →7 steps.\n\noption2: |9-6|=3 +1 +2 →6 steps.\n\nSo steps is 6.\n\nSo the code correctly chooses the minimal.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code.\n\nRead the four integers.\n\nCheck if l==1 and r ==n. If yes, print 0.\n\nElse, check if left and right need to be closed.\n\nIf only left or right is needed, compute accordingly.\n\nElse, compute option1 and option2.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needs = l > 1\n    right_needs = r < n\n\n    if not left_needs and not right_needs:\n        print(0)\n    elif not left_needs:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(steps)\n    elif not right_needs:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(steps)\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n        print(steps)\n\nWait, but in the code, when both left and right are needed, we add (r-l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, (r-l) is the steps between l and r, and 2 comes from the two close operations.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample:\n\noption1: 1 + 2 + 2 =5.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n\nSo, this should work.\n",

Choose the scenario with fewer steps.\n3. **Compute Steps**: For each scenario, compute the total steps as the sum of movements and closings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needs = l > 1\n    right_needs = r < n\n\n    if not left_needs and not right_needs:\n        print(0)\n    elif not left_needs:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(steps)\n    elif not right_needs:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(steps)\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n        print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Check for No Action Needed**: If the segment [l, r] includes all tabs from 1 to n, no action is needed.\n- **Single Side Closure**: If only one side needs closing, compute the steps required to move to the respective end and close those tabs.\n- **Both Sides Closure**: When both sides need closing, compute the steps for both possible orders (closing left first or right first) and choose the one with fewer steps. This ensures the optimal solution by considering both movement paths and their respective costs.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures minimal steps by considering both possible scenarios when both sides need to be closed.",
