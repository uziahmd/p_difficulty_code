    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add k to both a and b. Wait, let's think about the expressions (a + k) and (b + k). Since they are being added by the same k, their difference remains the same as (b - a), but wait, no, because if a < b, then b +k - (a +k) = b -a. So the difference between them is fixed.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. The difference between a +k and b +k is the same as the original difference between a and b. Because (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the two numbers are always d apart, where d is |a - b|. Or wait, actually, if a > b, then the difference would be negative, but since we take absolute value, it's the same as |a - b|.\n\nSo, the two numbers x and y are x = a +k, y = b +k, and x - y = b - a, assuming a < b. So the two numbers are always at a fixed distance from each other.\n\nNow, the LCM of x and y can be expressed in terms of their GCD. Because LCM(x, y) = x * y / GCD(x, y). So to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the GCD, or perhaps find a point where the product x*y is minimized while the GCD is as large as possible.\n\nBut how do we find k such that x and y have a large GCD?\n\nWait, since x and y differ by d, which is fixed, let's denote d = |a - b|. So x = y + d or y = x + d. So the GCD of x and y must divide d. Because any common divisor of x and y must also divide their difference, which is d.\n\nSo, the maximum possible GCD is the largest divisor of d. So perhaps the optimal k is chosen such that x and y are multiples of some divisor g of d, and the GCD is maximized.\n\nSo the approach is: for all possible divisors g of d, compute the minimal k that makes both x and y divisible by g, and then compute the LCM for each such g, choosing the one that gives the smallest LCM.\n\nWait, but d could be zero. Oh right, if a == b, then d is zero. Then x = y = a +k. So LCM is just x, which is minimized when k is 0. So that's an easy case.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Otherwise, find all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, find the minimal k >=0 such that (a +k) is divisible by g and (b +k) is divisible by g. Since a and b differ by d, adding k to both will make them congruent modulo g. So (a +k) mod g must be zero, which implies k ≡ (-a) mod g. Similarly, since (b +k) mod g must also be zero, but since b = a ±d, which is the same as a mod g plus d mod g? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, since x = a +k and y = b +k, and x - y = d, which is divisible by g. So if g divides x, then x = g * m, and y = x - d = g*m - d. But for y to be divisible by g, g must divide d. So yes, g must be a divisor of d.\n\nSo for each g that divides d, we can find the required k.\n\nBut wait, for each g, what is the minimal k such that both x and y are divisible by g?\n\nSince x = a +k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ (-a) mod g.\n\nSimilarly, y = b +k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\nBut since g divides d = |a - b|, we can write a = b + m*g, where m is some integer.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but let me see. Let's say g is a divisor of d. Then d = g * t for some t.\n\nThen, a = b + s*g → a +k = (b +s*g) +k.\n\nWe need a +k ≡ 0 mod g → (b +s*g +k) ≡0 mod g → since s*g is 0 mod g, this implies b +k ≡0 mod g → k ≡ -b mod g.\n\nSimilarly, since d = g*t, we can express b as a + d = a +g*t.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since d = g * t, and a and b differ by g*t.\n\nSo, for a +k to be divisible by g, k must be congruent to (-a) mod g.\n\nSimilarly, b +k must be congruent to (-b) mod g.\n\nBut since d = g*t, then (a +k) + (b +k) = a + b + 2k. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b differ by g*t, then (a +k) and (b +k) are a +k and a +k + g*t.\n\nSo, their GCD is the same as the GCD of a +k and g*t.\n\nSo, to have a +k and b +k both divisible by g, we can set k such that a +k is divisible by g. Then, since b +k is a +k + d = a +k +g*t, which is also divisible by g.\n\nSo, the condition is that a +k ≡0 mod g. So k must be congruent to (-a) mod g.\n\nSo, the minimal non-negative k for this g is (g - (a mod g)) % g. Because if a mod g is r, then k must be (g - r) mod g to make a +k ≡0 mod g.\n\nWait, but if a mod g is zero, then k can be zero. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each g (divisor of d), the minimal k is (g - (a mod g)) % g, but wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\nLet me see: k must satisfy a +k ≡0 mod g → k ≡ (-a) mod g.\n\nSo, the smallest non-negative k is (g - (a mod g)) % g.\n\nBecause, for example, if a mod g is 3 and g is 5, then k is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal k_g as (g - (a mod g)) % g.\n\nOnce we have k_g, we can compute the LCM of (a +k_g) and (b +k_g).\n\nBut since (a +k_g) and (b +k_g) are both multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. So the LCM would be (a +k_g) * (b +k_g) / g.\n\nBut how does this help us find the minimal LCM?\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute all divisors of d = |a - b|.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute k_g as (g - (a mod g)) % g.\n\n- Compute x = a +k_g, y = b +k_g.\n\n- Compute the LCM(x, y).\n\n- Among all these, find the g that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple g's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k_g.\n\nAdditionally, we should also consider k=0, which is the case where g is 1, but perhaps there are larger g's that give better results.\n\nWait, but the divisors of d include all possible g's, including 1. So considering all of them should cover all possibilities.\n\nSo now, the question is, how do I efficiently compute all the divisors of d, given that d can be up to 1e9 (since a and b can be up to 1e9).\n\nComputing all the divisors of a number n is O(sqrt(n)) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1e9.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a - b).\n\n2. If d is zero, output k=0.\n\n3. Else, compute all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g, compute k_g = (g - (a mod g)) % g.\n\n5. For each g, compute x = a +k_g, y = b +k_g. The LCM is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). But since x and y are both multiples of g, their gcd is at least g. So, we can compute the gcd as g multiplied by the gcd of (x/g) and (y/g).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the LCM as (x * y) // g, because x and y are both multiples of g. So, x = g * m, y = g * n. Then, LCM(x, y) = g * LCM(m, n). But since LCM(m, n) = m*n / GCD(m, n), then overall, LCM(x, y) = g * m *n / GCD(m,n) = (g*m*n) / GCD(m, n).\n\nBut since m and n are x/g and y/g, perhaps it's more efficient to compute their GCD.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the LCM directly using the formula (x * y) // GCD(x, y).\n\nBut in code, for each g, after computing x and y, compute the GCD of x and y, then the LCM.\n\nBut that might be computationally expensive if done naively for each g. However, since the number of divisors is at most around 1e5 (for d=1e9, the maximum number of divisors is 100 for 735134400 etc.), it's manageable.\n\nWait, for d=1e9, the maximum number of divisors is when d is a product of primes raised to high exponents. For example, 1e9 is 2^9 *5^9, which has (9+1)*(9+1)=100 divisors. So for each test case, even with d=1e9, we have about 100 divisors to process, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for each g in divisors of d:\n\n- Compute k_g.\n\n- Compute x = a +k_g, y = b +k_g.\n\n- Compute GCD(x, y). Since x and y are (a +k_g) and (b +k_g), which are equal to (a +k_g) and (a +k_g) + d, since d = |a -b|.\n\nWait, but wait: d is the absolute difference. So, if a < b, then x = a +k_g, y = b +k_g = x + d.\n\nSo, x and y differ by d, which is a multiple of g. So, GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d) since y = x +d.\n\nBut since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is GCD(g * m, g * t) = g * GCD(m, t), where m = x/g, t = d/g.\n\nSo, the GCD(x, y) is g * GCD(m, t), and thus the LCM is (x*y)/(g*GCD(m, t)) ) → (g*m * g*t) / (g* GCD(m, t)) ) → (g^2 * m t ) / (g GCD(m,t)) ) → (g m t ) / GCD(m,t) = g * (m t) / GCD(m, t) = g * LCM(m, t).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute GCD(x, y) as GCD(x, d) since y = x +d.\n\nWait, because y = x +d → GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d).\n\nYes, that's a standard property.\n\nSo, for x and y, GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d).\n\nBut since x = a +k_g, and d is |a -b|, and k_g is chosen such that x is divisible by g, so x is a multiple of g.\n\nThus, GCD(x, d) is equal to GCD(g*m, g*t) = g * GCD(m, t), as before.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute it as GCD(x, d), which is the same as GCD(g*m, g*t) = g * GCD(m, t).\n\nSo, in code, for each g:\n\nCompute x = a +k_g.\n\nCompute current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n\nlcm = x * (d +x) // current_gcd\n\nWait, wait, because y = x +d. So, y = x +d.\n\nSo, x and y differ by d, so GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncurrent_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n\nlcm_candidate = (x * y) // current_gcd → which is (x*(x+d))//current_gcd.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y = x +d, and current_gcd is the GCD of x and d, then the LCM is (x * (x +d)) // current_gcd.\n\nBut perhaps another way: since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then x = g * m, d = g * t.\n\nSo, current_gcd = g * GCD(m, t).\n\nAnd the LCM is (g*m * g*t) / (g * GCD(m, t)) ) → g * m *t / GCD(m, t) → g * LCM(m, t).\n\nWhich is the same as g * (m*t // GCD(m, t)).\n\nSo, to compute the LCM for each g, we can do this.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute it as (x * y) // current_gcd, which is straightforward.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each g in divisors:\n\n    k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n    x = a +k\n\n    y = b +k\n\n    current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n    lcm_candidate = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\nBut wait, since y = x +d, and d is a multiple of g, x is a multiple of g. So, perhaps computing current_gcd as math.gcd(x, d) is sufficient and more efficient.\n\nBut regardless, in code, we can compute it either way.\n\nSo, once we have all the lcm_candidates for each g, we need to select the one with the smallest value. If multiple g's lead to the same minimal lcm, pick the one with the smallest k.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the minimal k is required if there are multiple k's leading to the same minimal LCM.\n\nSo, for all g's, we calculate the corresponding k, then for each such k, compute the LCM, and keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nThen, among all the k's that achieve the minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize min_lcm as a very large number, best_k as 0.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n    compute k_g as (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n    compute x = a +k_g, y = b +k_g\n\n    compute current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n    lcm_candidate = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n    if lcm_candidate < min_lcm:\n\n        min_lcm = lcm_candidate\n\n        best_k = k_g\n\n    elif lcm_candidate == min_lcm:\n\n        if k_g < best_k:\n\n            best_k = k_g\n\nAfter processing all divisors, compare with the case when k=0, but wait, isn't k=0 already considered in the loop when g=1?\n\nBecause when g=1, which is a divisor of any d, the k_g would be (1 - (a mod 1)) %1 = 0, since a mod 1 is 0.\n\nSo, the loop already considers k=0.\n\nWait, but what about when d is zero? Because when a == b, d is zero, and the code returns k=0.\n\nSo, in the code, the first step is to compute d = abs(a - b). If d is zero, output k=0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nBut wait, in the case when a == b, d is zero, and adding k to both makes x = y, so LCM is x, which is minimized when k is zero.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: a = 5, b=10. So d=5.\n\nDivisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk_g = (1 -5%1) mod1 → (1-0) mod1 = 0.\n\nx=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nk_g = (5 -5%5) mod5 → 5-0 mod5 →0.\n\nx=5, y=10. Same as above.\n\nSo, both g=1 and g=5 give k=0, same LCM. So the best is k=0.\n\nBut in the sample input, when a=5 and b=10, the output is 0, which matches.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=10. d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk_g= (1 -6%1) mod1 → 0.\n\nx=6, y=10. LCM(6,10)=30.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nk_g = (2 -6%2) mod2 → 2 -0 mod2 →0.\n\nx=6, y=10. Same as before.\n\nWait, no, wait: 6 mod2 is 0, so 2 -0 mod2 is 0.\n\nSo x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\nBut wait, what if k_g is 2, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, for g=2:\n\na=6, b=10.\n\nk_g is (2 - (6 mod2 )) mod2.\n\n6 mod2 is 0.\n\nSo 2-0 mod2 → 0.\n\nSo x=6, y=10.\n\nBut wait, what is the alternative?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because for g=2, adding k=2 would make x=8, y=12, whose LCM is 24.\n\nAh, right! So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, why? Because in the code, for each g, we compute k_g as (g - a mod g) mod g.\n\nBut in this case, for g=2, a mod g is 0, so k_g is 0. So x is 6, y is 10.\n\nBut the optimal k is 2, which gives x=8, y=12, which have a higher GCD (4) and lower LCM (24).\n\nSo, the initial approach may miss this case.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, why didn't the code pick this?\n\nBecause for g=4, which is a divisor of 4, let's see:\n\nk_g = (4 -6 mod4) mod4 →6 mod4 is 2. So 4-2=2 mod4 is 2.\n\nSo x=6+2=8, y=10+2=12.\n\nSo the LCM is 24, which is better than the previous 30.\n\nSo, for g=4, the k_g is 2, and the LCM is 24.\n\nSo, in this case, the code will process g=4, compute k_g=2, and the LCM is 24, which is better than the earlier candidates.\n\nThus, the code will correctly find that the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when k=2.\n\nSo, the initial approach works because for each g, it computes the minimal k_g for that g, and then among all possible g's, finds the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the case where a=6 and b=10, d=4.\n\nThe code computes all divisors of 4: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k=0 → x=6, y=10 → LCM 30.\n\ng=2: k=0 → x=6, y=10 → LCM 30.\n\ng=4: k=2 → x=8, y=12 → LCM 24.\n\nSo, the minimal is 24, so the code picks k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=21, b=31. d=10.\n\nSo, d=10, divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=21, y=31 → LCM 21*31 /1=651.\n\ng=2: a mod2 is 1. So k=(2-1) mod2=1.\n\nx=22, y=32. LCM is 352.\n\ng=5: a mod5 is 1. k=5-1=4 mod5=4.\n\nx=25, y=35 → LCM is (25*35)/5=175.\n\ng=10: a mod10 is 1. k=10-1=9 mod10=9.\n\nx=30, y=40 → LCM is 120.\n\nSo, the LCMs for the four g's are 651, 352, 175, 120.\n\nSo the minimal is 120, achieved at k=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the code needs to:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a -b). If d is 0, output 0.\n\n2. Compute all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g, compute k_g = (g - (a mod g)) % g.\n\n4. Compute x = a +k_g, y = b +k_g.\n\n5. Compute current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y).\n\n6. Compute lcm_candidate = (x*y)// current_gcd.\n\n7. Keep track of the minimal lcm and the smallest k that achieves it.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut how to compute all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, for that, I can write a function that finds all the divisors of a number n.\n\nThe function will iterate from 1 to sqrt(n), and for each i that divides n, add i and n/i to the list of divisors, ensuring no duplicates when n is a perfect square.\n\nSo, the code for getting divisors would look something like this.\n\nAlso, note that for each g, we need to process it as a positive integer. But since d is non-negative, and for a != b, d is positive, so that's okay.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nIf d == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute all divisors of d.\n\n    initialize min_lcm to a very large number (like infinity), best_k to 0.\n\n    for each g in divisors:\n\n        k_g = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n        x = a + k_g\n\n        y = b + k_g\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        lcm_candidate = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        if lcm_candidate < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = lcm_candidate\n\n            best_k = k_g\n\n        elif lcm_candidate == min_lcm:\n\n            if k_g < best_k:\n\n                best_k = k_g\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but in the case where a=5 and b=10, the code would process g=1 and g=5.\n\nFor g=1, k=0 → x=5, y=10 → LCM 10.\n\nFor g=5, k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo, the code correctly selects k=0.\n\nBut what about when d is 1?\n\nSay a=2, b=3. d=1.\n\nDivisors of 1: [1].\n\nk_g = (1 - 2%1) mod1 → 0.\n\nx=2, y=3. LCM is 6.\n\nSo, output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6.\n\nd=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=4, y=6 → LCM 12.\n\ng=2: a mod2 is 0 → k= (2-0) mod2=0. x=4, y=6. Same as above.\n\nSo, no change.\n\nBut wait, what if a=7, b=9. d=2.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=7, y=9 → LCM 63.\n\ng=2: a mod2 is 1 → k= (2-1) mod2=1.\n\nx=8, y=10. GCD is 2, LCM is (8*10)/2=40.\n\nWhich is better than 63.\n\nSo, code correctly chooses k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut now, how to implement the function to get all divisors.\n\nImplementing a function to get all divisors of n:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but this returns the divisors in a set, which is unsorted. But in the code, the order doesn't matter because we're trying all possible g's.\n\nSo, that's fine.\n\nWait, but for n=0, but in our case, d is zero only when a ==b, which is handled separately.\n\nSo, the function can handle n>0.\n\nTesting the function for n=4:\n\nLoop i from 1 to 2.\n\ni=1: 4%1=0 → add 1 and 4.\n\ni=2: 4%2=0 → add 2 and 2 (but set avoids duplicates).\n\nSo, divisors are {1,2,4}.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=10.\n\nDivisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nIf d ==0: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute divisors of d.\n\nProcess each g in divisors.\n\nCompute k_g, x, y, current_gcd, lcm_candidate.\n\nTrack min_lcm and best_k.\n\nFinally, print best_k.\n\nWait, but what about when a >b? For example, a=10, b=6. d=4.\n\nIn this case, the code still works because the function uses the absolute difference.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=8. d=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: k=0 → x=3, y=8 → LCM 24.\n\nFor g=5: a mod5 is 3 → k=5-3=2.\n\nx=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nSo, the code picks k=2, which is better.\n\nSo, output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling large d: for d up to 1e9, the function to compute divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable.\n\n- When a mod g is zero, then k_g is zero, which is correct.\n\n- What if a mod g is negative? No, because a mod g is always non-negative in Python.\n\nWait, in Python, the modulus operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor.\n\nWait, for example, (-3) %5 is 2.\n\nBut in our case, a is a positive integer, so a mod g is always in 0 <= ... <g.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nAnother thing to note: when a is less than g.\n\nFor example, a=3, g=5. a mod g is 3.\n\nSo, k_g = (5 -3) mod5=2.\n\nSo x=5, y=... ?\n\nWait, in code, for a=3 and g=5:\n\nk_g = (5 -3) mod5 → 2.\n\nx=3+2=5, which is divisible by 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: when a is 0. But according to the problem statement, a and b are at least 1, so this won't happen.\n\nSo, now, the code can be written.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2', '9', '0']\n\nTesting the code:\n\nCase 1: a=6, b=10.\n\nd=4.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk=0 → x=6, y=10 → LCM 30.\n\ng=2:\n\nk=0 → x=6, y=10 → LCM 30.\n\ng=4:\n\nk=2 → x=8, y=12 → LCM 24.\n\nSo, the code picks k=2.\n\nCase 2: a=21, b=31.\n\nd=10.\n\ndivisors 1,2,5,10.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=21, y=31 → LCM 21*31=651.\n\ng=2: a mod2 is 1 → k=1.\n\nx=22, y=32. GCD 2. LCM 22*32/2= 352.\n\ng=5: a mod5 is 1 →k=4.\n\nx=25, y=35. GCD 5. LCM 25*35/5=175.\n\ng=10: a mod10 is 1 →k=9.\n\nx=30, y=40. GCD 10. LCM 30*40/10= 120.\n\nSo, the minimal is 120, so k=9.\n\nCase3: a=5, b=10.\n\nd=5.\n\ndivisors 1,5.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=5, y=10 → LCM 10.\n\ng=5: k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal is 10, achieved at k=0.\n\nSo, code outputs 0.\n\nSo, the sample is correctly handled.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, import math.\n\nThen, read the input line as a and b.\n\nCompute d.\n\nIf d is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, compute the divisors.\n\nThen, for each g in divisors:\n\nCompute k_g.\n\nCompute x and y.\n\nCompute current_gcd.\n\nCompute lcm_candidate.\n\nCompare to min_lcm.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n        return sorted(divisors)\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # Compute k_g\n        remainder = a % g\n        k = (g - remainder) % g\n        \n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        \n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm_candidate = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if lcm_candidate < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = lcm_candidate\n            best_k = k\n        elif lcm_candidate == min_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n                \n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but wait: for x and y, when d is zero, but the code handles that case upfront.\n\nAnother thing: the get_divisors function uses math.isqrt, which is available in Python 3.8 and above. Since the problem allows for any Python version, perhaps it's better to use int(math.sqrt(n)).\n\nSo, modifying the function:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n%i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich the code produces.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=9.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors 1,2.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=7, y=9 → LCM 63.\n\ng=2: a mod2 is 1 →k=1.\n\nx=8, y=10 → LCM 40.\n\nSo, code outputs 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors 1,2.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=4, y=6 → LCM 12.\n\ng=2: a mod2 is 0 →k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo, output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key observation is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) remains constant as \\( |a - b| \\). This difference, denoted as \\( d \\), plays a crucial role in determining the optimal \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we can find a \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are multiples of \\( g \\). This helps in maximizing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\), thereby minimizing their LCM.\n\n3. **Finding the Optimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is calculated as \\( (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n\n4. **Calculate LCM for Each \\( k \\)**: For each candidate \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\). If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same minimum LCM, select the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n        return sorted(divisors)\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = a % g\n        k = (g - remainder) % g\n        \n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        \n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        lcm_candidate = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if lcm_candidate < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = lcm_candidate\n            best_k = k\n        elif lcm_candidate == min_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n                \n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the input.\n2. **Compute \\( d \\)**: The absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is computed.\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, \\( d \\) is zero, and the optimal \\( k \\) is zero.\n4. **Divisors Calculation**: A function to compute all divisors of \\( d \\) is implemented using a loop up to the square root of \\( d \\).\n5. **Optimal \\( k \\) Calculation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the corresponding \\( k \\) and evaluate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n6. **Track Minimum LCM**: The code keeps track of the minimum LCM and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
