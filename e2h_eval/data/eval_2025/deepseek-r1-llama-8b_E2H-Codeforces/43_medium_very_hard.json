He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A starts with a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's added must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C adds the 'c's. Or it could be equal to both.\n\nOur task is to determine for a given string whether it could have been produced through this process.\n\nHmm, so the string must first consist of a bunch of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the structure must be aaaabbbbc ccc... but more precisely, all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. If there are any other characters out of order, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but what about the counts? Let me think.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- After A: all 'a's, count_a = x, where x >= 1.\n- After B: same 'a's, then 'b's. count_b = y, y >=1. So total length is x + y, which is at least 2.\n- Then C appends some 'c's. The count_c must be equal to count_a (x) or count_b (y). Also, since C appends, all 'c's must come after the 'b's. So the structure is a^x b^y c^z, where z = x or z = y or z = min(x,y)? Wait no, because z can be either x or y, whichever. So for example, if x=3 and y=5, z can be 3 or 5.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: when C appends, the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's before C appends. So z must be either x or y. But wait, x and y are the counts before C adds. So when C adds, the new counts become x, y, z, where z = x or y.\n\nSo for the string, the counts of a, b, c must satisfy:\n\ncount_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the order matters. The string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nSo first, let's split the string into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. If any part is empty except possibly the last, but wait, no: A gives to B, so there must be at least one 'a'. B appends 'b's, so there must be at least one 'b'. And C appends 'c's, so there must be at least one 'c'. So the string must have all three parts.\n\nSo the string structure is a+ b+ c+, where each part is non-empty.\n\nSo first, I'll need to check that the string is in the form of all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. If not, it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo how to do that?\n\nWe can scan the string and make sure that once we move past 'a's, we don't encounter any more 'a's, only 'b's until we reach 'c's, and then no more letters after that.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst test case: 'aaabccc'\n\nBreaking it down:\naaa -> 3 a's\nb -> 1 b\nccc -> 3 c's. So count_c is 3, which equals count_a. So yes.\n\nSecond test case: 'bbacc' → the string starts with 'b's, which can't happen because the initial step is 'a's. So immediately invalid.\n\nThird test case: 'aabc' → structure is a a b c. Wait, no, that's a a b c. So the a's are two, then b is one, then c is one. So count_c is 1, which is equal to count_b (1). So yes.\n\nWait, but let's think about how to parse the string into a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check that the string starts with one or more a's, followed by one or more b's, followed by one or more c's. Any deviation makes it invalid.\n\nIf the string does not meet this structure, output NO.\n\nElse, compute the counts:\n\ncount_a = number of a's (must be >=1)\ncount_b = number of b's (must be >=1)\ncount_c = number of c's (must be >=1)\n\nThen, check whether count_c equals count_a OR count_c equals count_b.\n\nIf either condition is true, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c', which is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\nWait, the string before C appends is the string after B appends. So in that string, the count of 'a's is count_a, count of 'b's is count_b. So when C appends, the count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, yes, our approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Split the string into a's, b's, c's. Check the order is correct. If not, return NO.\n\n- Compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n- Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. Also, count_c must be >=1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, C appends some number of 'c's, which implies count_c >=1. So the overall string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nSo, in our code:\n\nCheck that the string is in the form a+ b+ c+. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's think about writing code.\n\nIn Python, read the input string S.\n\nFirst, check the structure.\n\nWe can do this by checking the transitions between characters.\n\nInitialize state to 'a'.\n\nLoop through each character in S:\n\n- If current character is 'a' and state is 'a': continue.\n\n- If current is 'b' and state is 'a': change state to 'b'.\n\n- If current is 'c' and state is 'b': change state to 'c'.\n\n- If any other transition (like from a to b to a, or from b to c to a, etc.), then the structure is invalid.\n\nSo, during iteration, if at any point, the next character is not allowed based on the current state, we break and mark as invalid.\n\nAlso, ensure that all 'a's are first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nAdditionally, after processing all characters, the state should be 'c'; otherwise, the string may end in a or b, which is invalid.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nstate = 'a'\n\nfor char in S:\n\n    if state == 'a':\n\n        if char == 'a':\n\n            continue\n\n        elif char == 'b':\n\n            state = 'b'\n\n        else:  # char is 'c' but not allowed yet\n\n            structure_valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    elif state == 'b':\n\n        if char == 'b':\n\n            continue\n\n        elif char == 'c':\n\n            state = 'c'\n\n        else:  # 'a' again\n\n            structure_valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    elif state == 'c':\n\n        if char == 'c':\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            structure_valid = False\n\n            break\n\nif not structure_valid:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # Now compute counts\n\n    count_a = S.count('a')\n\n    count_b = S.count('b')\n\n    count_c = S.count('c')\n\n    if (count_c == count_a) or (count_c == count_b):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nProcessing:\n\nState starts as 'a'.\n\nAll a's: state remains 'a'.\n\nThen 'b' comes: state becomes 'b'.\n\nThen 'c's: state becomes 'c'.\n\nStructure is valid.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c equals count_a (3 ==3), so output YES.\n\nSample 2: 'bbacc'\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst character is 'b', state is 'a' → invalid. So structure is invalid. Output NO.\n\nSample 3: 'aabc'\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst 'a's: state 'a'.\n\nThen 'a' again: still 'a'.\n\nWait, no: 'a a b c' → let's see.\n\nWait the string is 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the first two are 'a's, then 'b', then 'c'.\n\nSo state transitions:\n\nAfter first 'a' → state 'a'.\n\nSecond 'a' → state 'a'.\n\nThird is 'b' → state 'b'.\n\nFourth is 'c' → state 'c'.\n\nSo structure is valid.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc'\n\nStructure is a's, b's, c's.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 3. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → structure invalid because after 'a's, 'b's come, but then another 'a' appears. So structure invalid.\n\nWhat about 'abbbc'? Structure is a's followed by b's and c's.\n\nWait, after 'a', 'b's come, then 'c's.\n\nSo count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals count_a. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → structure is valid. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is 1, which is neither 2 nor 2. So output NO.\n\nWait, but wait: count_c is 1, which doesn't equal count_a (2) or count_b (2). So no.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → count_c=3. count_a=3, count_b=3. So 3 equals both. So output YES.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where the string is 'abc'.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c=1 equals both a and b. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals a. So yes.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbbc' → count_a=3, count_b=4, count_c=1. 1 !=3 and 4 → no.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these.\n\nNow, what about the string being exactly 'ac'?\n\nNo, because after a's, you have a 'c' without any 'b's. So the structure is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, 'acb' is invalid because after 'a's, you get a 'c' which is invalid.\n\nSo, in code, any such case will be marked as invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → structure is valid.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2.\n\ncount_c equals both. So output yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues.\n\nWait, what if the string is 'ab'? No, because after B appends, there must be 'b's, but C must append 'c's. So the string must have 'c's as well. So if the string doesn't have 'c's, it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo, in our code, after checking structure, count_c must be >=1.\n\nWait, in the code above, the code computes count_c, but in the structure check, the state ends at 'c', which ensures that there is at least one 'c' because state was changed to 'c' only after seeing a 'c' after 'b's.\n\nWait, no: the state changes to 'c' only when a 'c' is encountered after 'b's. So if the string is 'ab', the state after processing 'b' is 'b', and the loop ends. So in that case, the structure is invalid because the state remains 'b' and never reaches 'c'.\n\nSo, the code correctly marks 'ab' as invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'ac' → structure invalid because after 'a's, a 'c' is found without any 'b's.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is handling all these cases.\n\nPotential issue: what about 'a' followed by 'b's and then 'c's, but in the middle, say 'abac'?\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial state 'a'.\n\nFirst 'a' → okay.\n\nThen 'b' → state 'b'.\n\nThen 'a' → invalid, so structure invalid.\n\nSo code correctly returns no.\n\nAnother thing: the counts must be correct. For example, suppose after the structure is valid, count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, for 'aaabbbbc' → count_a=3, count_b=4, count_c=1. 1 !=3 or 4 → invalid.\n\nSo code correctly returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' → structure invalid because after 'a's, 'b's are present, then 'a's again. So structure invalid.\n\nSo, code handles that.\n\nI think the code is solid.\n\nSo now, implementing this in Python.\n\nRead the input as a string, perhaps using input().strip().\n\nThen perform the structure check as described.\n\nIf the structure is invalid, print 'NO'.\n\nElse, compute the counts and check if count_c equals a or b.\n\nIf yes, print 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nstate = 'a'\nstructure_valid = True\n\nfor c in s:\n    if state == 'a':\n        if c == 'a':\n            continue\n        elif c == 'b':\n            state = 'b'\n        else:\n            structure_valid = False\n            break\n    elif state == 'b':\n        if c == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif c == 'c':\n            state = 'c'\n        else:\n            structure_valid = False\n            break\n    elif state == 'c':\n        if c == 'c':\n            continue\n        else:\n            structure_valid = False\n            break\n\nif not structure_valid:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, what if the string is 'a' followed by 'b's and 'c's, but the counts of 'c' equal to 'a' or 'b'? Like 'aaabbbcc' → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=2. So count_c is 2, which is not equal to 3 or 3. So output is NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about 'aaabbbccc' → count_c=3. So it equals both. So output is YES.\n\nTesting the code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 'aaabccc'\n\nStructure check: passes. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 → 3 ==3 → output YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 'bbacc' → structure check fails, because first character is 'b' in state 'a'. So output NO.\n\nSample3: 'aabc' → structure is a,a,b,c → count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1 → count_c equals count_b. So output YES.\n\nSo code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1 → 1 equals a. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → a=1, b=1, c=1 → c equals both, so yes.\n\nWhat about 'aabbc' → a=2, b=2, c=1 → c is 1, which is not equal to 2. So output no.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, think about time constraints.\n\nThe maximum length is 5000. So counting the occurrences is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nThe structure check is O(n), which is also acceptable.\n\nSo the code is efficient.\n\nThus, this solution should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of appending operations.
