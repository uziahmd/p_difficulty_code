They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to determine all the winning integers x for a given tournament setup. The problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nSo, the tournament is structured in phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one remains. The way the matches are arranged and which team wins depends on the string s provided. For each character in s, if it's 0, then in that phase, lower-skilled teams win against higher-skilled ones. If it's 1, the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe key point is that p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n, meaning each team has a unique skill level. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where team x becomes the champion.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem where we track possible groupings of teams and their outcomes based on the phases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think recursively. Each phase affects which teams can potentially reach the next round. For example, in the first phase, teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), etc. The winners of these pairs proceed to the next phase, which has larger groupings.\n\nBut the pairing structure depends on the phase. So for each phase i (starting from 0 to n-1?), the number of games is 2^(n-i-1), and the way teams are grouped depends on the phase.\n\nAlternatively, each phase i corresponds to grouping the remaining teams into blocks of size 2^i. So, for phase i, the teams are divided into blocks of 2^i, and within each block, they play in a certain way based on s[i].\n\nWait, maybe the way the tournament progresses is that each phase i (from 0 to n-1) has 2^(n - i -1) games. Each game is between two consecutive teams in a certain grouping. So for phase i, the teams are grouped into blocks of 2^(i+1), and within each block, they form 2^i games, each determining a winner who proceeds to the next phase.\n\nSo the tournament can be seen as a series of rounds, each with its own grouping and rules.\n\nI think the approach here is to model the possible sets of winners after each phase, keeping track of which teams can be in the next phase based on the current phase's rules.\n\nLet me think about the process step by step.\n\nInitially, in phase 0, the teams are grouped into 2^1 = 2 per group. So games are 1v2, 3v4, etc. For each pair, depending on s[0], either the lower or higher skilled team wins.\n\nAfter phase 0, 2^(n-1) teams remain. These are the winners from phase 0.\n\nThen, phase 1: group into 4 teams, split into 2 groups of 2. Then, within each group, the winners from phase 0 are paired again, and the same s[1] rule applies. This continues until phase n-1, where only one team remains.\n\nSo, the challenge is to model for each phase the possible groupings and the outcomes, ensuring that the chosen permutation allows a particular x to be the champion.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be addressed using bitmask DP, where each state represents the set of possible winners up to a certain phase.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, 2^18 is 262,144, which is manageable. Wait, but wait—each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So for each phase, the number of possible subsets doubles. But for n=18, the total number of possible states across all phases might be too large.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to represent the possible winners at each phase. For each phase i, we can represent the possible sets of winners as a subset of the initial teams. Each step involves applying the current phase's rules to split this set into pairs, determine possible winners based on s[i], and proceed to the next phase.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the full set of teams (1 to 2^n).\n\n2. For each phase from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Split the current set of possible winners into groups of size 2^(i+1).\n   b. Within each group, pair the consecutive two teams.\n   c. For each pair, determine which team can win based on s[i].\n   d. The winners of these pairs form the next set of possible winners for the next phase.\n\n3. After processing all phases, the remaining possible winners are the potential champions. Collect all such x.\n\nBut how do I implement this efficiently?\n\nWait, the order in which the teams are paired in each phase matters. For phase i, the group size is 2^(i+1). So for phase 0, group size is 2, phase 1 group size is 4, etc.\n\nWait, no. Phase 0 has group size 2, phase 1 has group size 4, etc., because each phase processes the winners from the previous phase. So for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, for phase i, the number of games is 2^{n - i -1}, which implies that the number of teams is 2^{n - i}. So each group is 2^{i+1} teams, because in phase i, each game is between two consecutive teams in the group.\n\nWait, perhaps an example will help. Suppose n=3, so 8 teams. Phases are 0,1,2.\n\nPhase 0: 8 teams → 4 games. Each game is between consecutive pairs (1v2, 3v4, ...,7v8). So group size is 2.\n\nPhase 1: 4 teams → 2 games. Each group is 4 teams, so the first group is 1-4, second is 5-8. Wait, no. Because in phase 1, the winners of phase 0 are grouped into 4, but how are they paired?\n\nWait, the way the problem describes phase 1: the first game is the winner of 1v2 vs winner of 3v4; the second is winner of 5v6 vs 7v8. So the grouping is every four consecutive teams.\n\nAh, so for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and within each group, the teams are processed in consecutive pairs.\n\nSo for phase i, the teams are grouped into chunks of 2^{i+1} teams. Within each chunk, they are paired as (a, a+1), (a+2, a+3), etc., and each pair plays a game, with the outcome determined by s[i].\n\nSo for phase 0, group size is 2, phase 1 is 4, phase 2 is 8, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because for phase 0, group size is 2, so 4 games, each within a group of 2.\n\nPhase 1 has group size 4, so 2 games, each grouping 4 teams into two pairs.\n\nSo, the process is that for each phase i, the current set of teams is divided into groups of size 2^{i+1}, and within each group, the teams are split into consecutive pairs, each of which plays a game. The winners of these games form the next set of possible winners.\n\nThus, for each phase, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the number of games is (group size / 2) / 2^{i} }? Not sure.\n\nNow, the main idea is to model the possible winners at each phase.\n\nWe can represent the possible winners as a bitmask, where each bit represents whether a particular team is still in the running. For example, a bitmask of 0b101 means teams 1 and 3 are possible winners up to the current phase.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the bitmask can be represented as an integer with 18 bits.\n\nWait, but 2^18 is 262,144, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for each phase, we process the current possible winners and generate the next set based on the phase's rule.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Initialize the possible winners as all teams (bitmask with all bits set).\n- For each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n   - Group the current possible winners into chunks of size 2^{i+1}.\n   - For each chunk, process it into the next phase's possible winners by considering all possible ways the pairs can be resolved according to s[i].\n   - Update the possible winners for the next phase.\n- After all phases, collect all x where the corresponding bit is set in the final possible winners.\n\nBut how do I group the current possible winners into chunks of 2^{i+1}?\n\nWait, perhaps the current possible winners are stored as a list of team indices. For each phase i, we need to partition this list into groups of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the current possible winners are [1,3,5,7], and phase i has group size 2^{i+1}=4. Then, the group is [1,3,5,7]. They are split into two pairs: (1,3) and (5,7). Then, depending on s[i], either the lower or higher team wins.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase i, each group is of 2^{i+1} teams. So for i=0, group size is 2, for i=1, group size is 4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about how the tournament proceeds:\n\nEach phase i corresponds to a certain level of the tournament. The first phase (i=0) has 2^{n-0-1} = 2^{n-1} games, which is correct.\n\nIn phase i, the teams are grouped into blocks of 2^{i+1}, and within each block, there are 2^i games. Each game is between consecutive two teams in the block.\n\nSo, for each block of 2^{i+1} teams, the possible winners from that block are determined by the outcome of the 2^i games.\n\nFor each block, the possible winners are a subset of the 2^{i+1} teams, determined by the s[i] rule.\n\nSo, for each phase, the possible winners are built by taking the previous possible winners, grouping them into blocks of 2^{i+1}, and for each block, applying the rules of s[i] to compute the possible winners.\n\nThus, the algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\nWe maintain a set of possible winners. Initially, it's all teams.\n\nFor each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   group_size = 2^(i+1)\n   new_possible_winners = empty set\n\n   for each group in the current possible winners, taken in groups of group_size:\n       for each possible way to choose winners within this group according to s[i]:\n           add the resulting single winner to new_possible_winners\n\n   current_possible_winners = new_possible_winners\n\nOnce all phases are processed, the current_possible_winners contains all possible x's.\n\nBut how to model the 'possible ways' for each group? Since the group is a list of consecutive teams, and s[i] determines whether lower or higher skills win.\n\nWait, for a group of m teams (m being a multiple of 2^{i+1}), during phase i, the group is split into pairs of consecutive teams, each pair playing a game. The outcome of each game depends on s[i]. The winners of these games form a subset of the group.\n\nBut how do we model all possible ways that the group can produce a single winner for the next phase?\n\nWait, for a group of k teams (k=2^{i+1}), the number of games is k/2, each producing one winner. So, the group's possible winners are those who can emerge from this process.\n\nBut for each group, the way the games are played can lead to different possible winners. So, for each group, we need to consider all possible sequences of wins that result in a single team emerging.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for a group of size m = 2^{i+1}, the possible winners are the maximum possible under s[i]'s rules.\n\nWait, no. Because the way the games are structured, the winners are determined by pairwise matches, and the overall winner is the last remaining team.\n\nBut when s[i] is 0, in each pair, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for a group of 4 teams a < b < c < d, the pairings are a vs b and c vs d.\n\nIf s[i] is 0, then a and c win. Then, in the next round (for phase i+1), these two (a and c) will form a group of 2, and their winner is the minimum of a and c.\n\nWait, no. Because phase i is for determining the next phase's participants. So, for phase i, each group of 2^{i+1} teams is split into 2^i pairs, each pair plays a game, and the winners of each pair form a group of 2^i teams that move to phase i+1.\n\nWait, no. For phase i, each group is 2^{i+1} teams, and in that group, 2^i games are played, each eliminating one team. So, the number of winners from a group is 2^i, which is exactly the number of teams moving to phase i+1.\n\nSo, for each group of size 2^{i+1}, the next phase's possible winners from this group are a subset of 2^i teams, which themselves are the winners of the games in phase i.\n\nBut how do I model all possible ways that a group can produce a subset of 2^i teams as winners?\n\nThis seems tricky because for each group, the possible winners can vary based on the order of the teams and the s[i] value.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for a group of 2^{i+1} teams, the possible winners for the next phase are the teams that can be the maximum in their respective subtrees, considering the s[i] rules.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a binary tree. Each game in a phase corresponds to a node in the tree. The leaves are the original group of teams, and each internal node represents a game, which combines two children (winners of sub-games) according to the s[i] rule.\n\nSo, for a group of size 2^{i+1}, the possible winners are determined by building a binary tournament tree for that group, where each game's outcome is determined by s[i].\n\nBut even that might be computationally expensive for n=18, as each phase could involve many groups.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each phase, the group size is fixed, and the way the games are structured is predictable. So, for a group of size m, the structure of the games is fixed as consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, for a group of size 2^k, the games are in levels: level 0 is the initial pairs, level 1 is the winners of level 0, etc., until level k-1, where each game is between two teams, and the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model each group as a binary heap-like structure, where each pair in the group is processed in a specific way.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: for each phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the games are structured as 2^i consecutive pairs within the group.\n\nSo, for a group of 4 teams (i=0), the games are (1,2) and (3,4). The winners (say a and c) then proceed to phase 1, which will be grouped into a group of 4, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, phase 1's group size is 4, which is 2^{1+1} = 4. So the next phase's group is formed by the winners from phase 0's groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the group structure is such that in each phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the group consists of consecutive 2^{i+1} teams from the current possible winners.\n\nSo, for phase i, the current possible winners are ordered as a list, and they are split into consecutive groups of size 2^{i+1}. For each such group, the winners are determined based on s[i].\n\nBut how to process each group into the next phase's possible winners.\n\nLet me take an example.\n\nSuppose n=3, s='101'.\n\nPhase 0: group size is 2, s[0] = '1' (higher wins). So for any group of 2, the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nPhase 1: group size is 4, s[1] = '0' (lower wins). So for any group of 4, each pair of consecutive teams plays a game, and the lower-skilled team wins. So for a group of 4 a < b < c < d:\n\n- a vs b: a wins.\n- c vs d: c wins.\nThen, a and c proceed to phase 2.\n\nPhase 2: group size is 8, s[2] = '1' (higher wins). So, a and c play, and the higher-skilled team (c) wins.\n\nSo the champion is c.\n\nBut let's see how this would be modeled.\n\nStarting with all 8 teams. Phase 0 groups them into 4 groups of 2.\n\nEach group is processed: higher wins, so the winners are 2,4,6,8.\n\nThese are the possible winners after phase 0.\n\nPhase 1: group size is 4. The current possible winners are [2,4,6,8]. They are split into two groups of 4: [2,4,6,8] is one group? Or wait, no. Because the group size is 4, so the current possible winners (size 4) is one group.\n\nWithin this group, the teams are split into pairs: (2,4), (6,8).\n\nSince s[1] is 0, lower-skilled wins. So in (2,4), 2 wins. In (6,8), 6 wins. So the winners are 2 and 6.\n\nThese are the possible winners for phase 2.\n\nPhase 2: group size is 8. So the current possible winners are [2,6]. Split into one group of 8? No, wait, the group size is 2^{2+1} = 8, but our possible winners are only 2 and 6. So how does this fit?\n\nWait, perhaps the current possible winners are a list, and for phase i, we group them into consecutive chunks of 2^{i+1}, regardless of their actual values.\n\nWait, in phase 2, group size is 8. But the current possible winners are 2 and 6, which are only two teams. So the group is just [2,6, ... nothing else? Or perhaps the group is considered as a single group of size 8, but only two teams are in the possible winners.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the current possible winners are treated as a list, and for phase i, they are split into groups of size 2^{i+1}, and for each group, the process is applied.\n\nSo in phase 2, group size is 8, but the current possible winners are [2,6]. How to split them into groups of 8? It's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the current possible winners are considered to be in a contiguous range. For example, the possible winners after phase 0 are 2,4,6,8. Then, for phase 1, group size is 4, so the entire group is considered as one group. For phase 2, group size is 8, but the current possible winners are [2,6], which are less than 8. So how do they form groups of 8? Maybe they don't, but perhaps the group is formed as the first 2^{i+1} elements.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: For each phase, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and within each group, the teams are consecutive in the current possible winners. So, the group is a consecutive subset of the current possible winners, of length 2^{i+1}.\n\nSo, for phase i, the current possible winners are a list, say W. The group size is 2^{i+1}, so we split W into consecutive chunks of size 2^{i+1}. For each such chunk, we process it into the next possible winners.\n\nSo, for phase 0, group size is 2, W is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Split into 4 groups of 2: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8).\n\nEach group is processed into one winner, based on s[0]. For s[0]=1, higher wins. So group (1,2) → 2, group (3,4) →4, etc. So W becomes [2,4,6,8].\n\nPhase 1: group size is 4. W is [2,4,6,8]. Split into one group of 4: [2,4,6,8]. Process this group with s[1]=0 (lower wins).\n\nWithin this group, the teams are 2,4,6,8. They are split into pairs: (2,4) and (6,8). Each pair plays, and the lower-skilled team wins.\n\nSo, 2 and 6 are the winners. Now, W becomes [2,6].\n\nPhase 2: group size is 8. W is [2,6], which is of length 2. Split into groups of 8: but only 2 elements. So, perhaps the group is [2,6], but since 2 < 6, and group size is 8, which is more than 2. Wait, no. Because group size is 2^{2+1}=8, but W is only 2 elements. So, perhaps for this case, the group is [2,6], but how to process it.\n\nWait, perhaps the group must have exactly 2^{i+1} teams. Otherwise, it's impossible to form the required number of games.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because for phase 2, the group size is 8, but the current possible winners are only 2. So, perhaps this means that this group cannot form a valid tournament, and thus, the possible winners are none. But that can't be right because phase 2 is the last phase, and the group must have exactly 2 teams.\n\nWait, phase 2 is the last phase, which has group size 8. But the current possible winners are [2,6], which is 2 teams, exactly equal to the group size 2^{2}? Wait, 2^{2} is 4, but 2^{2+1} is 8. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the group size for phase i is 2^{i+1}, but in the last phase, the group is the entire set of possible winners. So for phase i, the number of teams must be exactly 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, no. Because for phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n - i}, which for i=2, when n=3, is 2^{1}=2.\n\nSo, phase 2 has group size 2^{2+1}=8, but the number of teams is 2, which is less than 8. So how do you form groups of 8?\n\nThis suggests that my earlier understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the group size is 2^{i} for phase i. Let me re-express.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe tournament has 2^n teams. The first phase has 2^{n-1} games, each pairing consecutive teams.\n\nIn the second phase, 2^{n-2} games, each pairing the winners of the first phase's games in a way that groups are formed by merging two consecutive groups of size 2^{n-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps the group sizes decrease as the phases progress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group size for phase i is 2^{n - i}.\n\nWait, in the first phase, n=3, 8 teams. Phase 0 has group size 2, which is 2^{3-0 -1} = 2^{2} =4? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the number of games in phase i is 2^{n - i -1}.\n\nSo for phase i, the number of games is G = 2^{n - i -1}.\n\nEach game has two teams, so the number of teams in phase i is 2 * G = 2^{n - i}.\n\nBut the group size for phase i is 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the number of teams is 2^{n - i}.\n\nSo 2^{i+1} must divide 2^{n -i}, which is true because 2^{i+1} * 2^{n-i - (i+1)} } = 2^{n -i}.\n\nWait, perhaps the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the number of groups in phase i is 2^{n - i - (i+1)} } = 2^{n - 2i -1}.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the number of teams is 2^{n - i}, so each group has 2^{i+1} teams, and the number of groups is 2^{n - i} / 2^{i+1} = 2^{n - 2i -1}.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nPerhaps it's better to model the problem as a series of rounds, and for each round, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the way the games are arranged is that the current possible winners are divided into consecutive groups of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nEach such group is processed into a single winner, and these winners form the next possible winners.\n\nSo, for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, and the current possible winners are a list of numbers. The list is split into consecutive groups of size 2^{i+1}, and for each group, the possible winners are determined.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the current possible winners list is not a multiple of 2^{i+1} in length?\n\nFor example, if after phase i-1, the possible winners are [2,6], and phase i has group size 4 (since i=1), then the group would consist of [2,6], but 2<6<... but there's no more teams. So how to process this.\n\nWait, perhaps the group is formed by taking the first 2^{i+1} teams from the current possible winners, and the rest are ignored. But that would lose information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group must have exactly 2^{i+1} teams. So, if the current possible winners list isn't a multiple of 2^{i+1}, then it's impossible to process this phase, and thus, no possible winners remain.\n\nBut that can't be right, because the tournament must have exactly one champion.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the current possible winners must always be a multiple of 2^{i+1} in each phase.\n\nWait, initially, the number of teams is 2^n, which is 2^{n}.\n\nIn phase 0, the number of winners is 2^{n-1}.\n\nIn phase 1, the number is 2^{n-2}.\n\n...\n\nIn phase i, the number is 2^{n -i -1}.\n\nWait, no. Because each phase reduces the number of teams by half.\n\nSo phase 0: 2^n → 2^{n-1}\n\nphase 1: 2^{n-1} → 2^{n-2}\n\n...\n\nphase i: 2^{n-i} → 2^{n-i-1}\n\n...\n\nphase n-1: 2 → 1.\n\nSo, for phase i, the number of teams is 2^{n -i}.\n\nGroup size for phase i is 2^{i+1}.\n\nSo, 2^{n-i} must be divisible by 2^{i+1}.\n\nWhich is true because 2^{n-i} / 2^{i+1} = 2^{n-2i-1}.\n\nSo, the number of groups is 2^{n-2i-1}, each of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the current possible winners can be split into groups of 2^{i+1}.\n\nThus, in code, for each phase i, we can take the current possible winners list and split it into consecutive groups of 2^{i+1}.\n\nFor each group, we need to determine all possible winners that can emerge from this group based on s[i], and add them to the next possible winners.\n\nBut how to model this for a group.\n\nFor a group of size m=2^{i+1}, the games are arranged in a way that each game is between consecutive two teams in the group.\n\nThe outcome of each game is determined by s[i], and the winners of the games are the ones that proceed to the next phase.\n\nSo, for a group of m=4 teams (i=0), the games are between (t1,t2) and (t3,t4). The winners are t2, t4, etc., depending on s[i].\n\nBut for a group of m=4, the next phase's group is formed by the two winners, which are 2^{i} =2^0=1 teams. So, for phase i=0, each group produces one winner, which moves to phase i=1.\n\nFor phase i=1, the group size is 4, and each group must have 4 teams, which are split into two pairs, each pair producing one winner.\n\nSo, for a group of 4, the next phase's group will have 2 winners.\n\nThus, for a group of 4, the next phase's possible winners are 2 teams.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for a group, the possible winners are all possible combinations of winners that could come from the games in that phase, given the s[i] rule.\n\nBut for a group of 4, the possible winners are the two highest teams, assuming s[i]=1, or the two lowest, assuming s[i]=0.\n\nWait, no. Because in a group of 4, the games are played in a way that the winners are determined by pairwise matches, but the exact way they proceed may allow for multiple possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps for a group of m=2^k, the possible winners are the maximal elements under the given rules.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a group of m teams, the possible winners are all the teams that can be the maximum in some way, considering the s[i] rule.\n\nWait, for s[i]=1, higher-skilled teams win. So, in each pair, the higher-skilled team wins. Thus, for a group of 4, the winner is the highest-skilled team in the group.\n\nBecause in each pair, the higher-skilled team wins, and then those two winners play each other, and the higher-skilled of those wins.\n\nSo, for s[i]=1, the overall winner of the group is the maximum in the group.\n\nSimilarly, for s[i]=0, the overall winner is the minimum in the group.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me test with a small example.\n\nGroup of 4: a < b < c < d.\n\ns[i]=1: higher wins.\n\nPairs are (a,b) → b wins; (c,d) → d wins.\n\nNext phase: b and d play, higher wins → d.\n\nSo, overall winner is d, which is the maximum.\n\nFor s[i]=0: higher doesn't win.\n\nPairs are (a,b) → a wins; (c,d) → c wins.\n\nNext phase: a and c play, lower wins → a.\n\nSo, overall winner is a, the minimum.\n\nThus, for a group of 4, the overall winner is the maximum (if s[i]=1) or the minimum (if s[i]=0).\n\nWhat about a group of 8?\n\nGroup of 8: a < b < c < d < e < f < g < h.\n\ns[i]=1: higher wins.\n\nPairs are (a,b) → b, (c,d) →d, (e,f)→f, (g,h)→h.\n\nNext phase: b, d, f, h.\n\nRepeat for s[i]=1: higher wins.\n\nPairs are (b,d) →d, (f,h)→h.\n\nNext phase: d, h.\n\ns[i]=1: higher wins → h.\n\nSo, overall winner is h, which is the maximum.\n\nSimilarly, for s[i]=0, the winner is a.\n\nSo, yes, for a group of 2^k, the overall winner is the maximum if s[i]=1, and the minimum if s[i]=0.\n\nWow, that's a crucial insight!\n\nSo, for any group of size 2^k, the overall winner is determined by the maximum (if s[i]=1) or the minimum (if s[i]=0).\n\nThus, for each group of 2^{i+1} teams in phase i, the possible winner is either the maximum or the minimum, depending on s[i].\n\nWait, no. Because in phase i, the group is processed into a single winner for the next phase.\n\nSo, for a group of 2^{i+1} teams, the possible winner is the maximum (if s[i]=1) or the minimum (if s[i]=0).\n\nThus, for each group in phase i, the next possible winners are just the maximum or the minimum of the group.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm simplifies as follows:\n\nInitialize possible_winners as the list [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n\nFor each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   group_size = 2^{i+1}\n   next_possible_winners = empty set\n   for each group in possible_winners, taken consecutively as group_size elements:\n       if s[i] == '1':\n           winner = max(group)\n       else:\n           winner = min(group)\n       add winner to next_possible_winners\n   possible_winners = list of unique winners in next_possible_winners\n\nBut wait, what about the order of the groups in possible_winners?\n\nNo, because the groups are formed by consecutive elements in the possible_winners list, which represents the current possible winners.\n\nBut for the group processing, the order in which the teams are paired depends on the current group's ordering.\n\nWait, in the group of 2^{i+1} teams, the order is determined by the current possible_winners list. So, the group is a consecutive subset of the possible_winners list, which represents the teams that can be in the group.\n\nThus, the group is processed in the order they appear in the possible_winners list, which is arbitrary. However, since the group's winner is either the min or max, the order within the group doesn't matter for the outcome.\n\nWait, no. Because the group is a consecutive subset of the possible_winners list. So, the group is a sublist, and the min and max are computed over that sublist.\n\nThus, for each group of 2^{i+1} consecutive teams in the possible_winners list, the winner is the min or max, depending on s[i].\n\nSo, the algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\nFor each phase i:\n\n   group_size = 2^{i+1}\n   new_winners = set()\n   for j in 0 to len(possible_winners) step group_size:\n       group = possible_winners[j : j + group_size]\n       if s[i] == '1':\n           winner = max(group)\n       else:\n           winner = min(group)\n       new_winners.add(winner)\n   possible_winners = list(new_winners)\n\nWait, but for each group, the winner is added to the new_winners set. So, duplicates are avoided.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nStart with possible_winners = list(1..2^n).\n\nFor each phase i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   group_size = 2^{i+1}\n\n   new_possible_winners = empty set.\n\n   for j in 0 to len(possible_winners) step group_size:\n\n       group = possible_winners[j : j + group_size]\n\n       if s[i] is '1':\n\n           winner = max(group)\n\n       else:\n\n           winner = min(group)\n\n       add winner to new_possible_winners.\n\n   possible_winners = list of unique elements in new_possible_winners.\n\nOnce all phases are processed, the possible_winners contains all possible x's.\n\nYes! This seems manageable.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut for n=18, 2^18=262,144. So, for phase i=17, group_size is 2^18, which is 262,144. So, each phase could require O(2^18 / 2^18) = O(1) steps, but for earlier phases, it could require O(2^18 / 2^{i+1}) steps.\n\nWait, but for each phase i, the group_size is 2^{i+1}, and the possible_winners list has size 2^{n - i}.\n\nThus, the number of groups per phase is (2^{n -i}) / 2^{",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers for a given tournament setup. The tournament is structured in phases where each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one remains. The outcome of each game depends on a given string `s`, where each character determines whether the higher-skilled or lower-skilled team wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with all teams as possible winners.\n2. **Phase Processing**: For each phase, split the current set of possible winners into groups of size `2^(i+1)`, where `i` is the current phase index.\n3. **Determine Winners**: For each group, determine the winner based on the current phase's rule (either the higher-skilled or lower-skilled team). Update the set of possible winners for the next phase.\n4. **Iterate Through Phases**: Repeat the process for each phase until all phases are processed.\n5. **Collect Results**: After processing all phases, collect all possible winning integers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    max_team = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    possible_winners = list(range(1, max_team + 1))\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        group_size = 1 << (i + 1)\n        new_possible = set()\n        for j in range(0, len(possible_winners), group_size):\n            group = possible_winners[j:j + group_size]\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                winner = max(group)\n            else:\n                winner = min(group)\n            new_possible.add(winner)\n        possible_winners = list(new_possible)\n        if not possible_winners:\n            break\n    \n    result = sorted(possible_winners)\n    for r in result:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, r)), end=' ')\n    print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with all teams from 1 to `2^n` as possible winners.\n- **Phase Processing**: For each phase, we split the current possible winners into groups of size `2^(i+1)`. Each group is processed to determine the winner based on the current phase's rule.\n- **Determine Winners**: For each group, if the current phase rule is '1', the higher-skilled team wins; otherwise, the lower-skilled team wins.\n- **Update Possible Winners**: The winners from each group form the new set of possible winners for the next phase.\n- **Result Collection**: After processing all phases, the remaining possible winners are collected and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each phase and updates the possible winners, ensuring that we correctly determine all potential champions based on the given rules.",
