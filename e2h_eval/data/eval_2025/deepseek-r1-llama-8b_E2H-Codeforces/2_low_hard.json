Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The definition they give is specific. So, Valera's paper is a square with n x n letters, where n is odd. The letters form an 'X' if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nHmm. Let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Check that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all the same character.\n- Check that the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is all the same character.\n- Ensure that both diagonals have the same character. Because if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', that's not acceptable.\n- Then, check that every cell not on either diagonal has the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nWait, right. So step by step:\n\n1. Read n and then read n lines each containing n characters.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line after n is a string like '5\\nxooox', etc. So each line represents a row. So each row is a string, and each character in the string is part of the grid.\n\nSo the grid can be represented as a list of lists. For example, grid[i][j] would be the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nSo, first, read the input correctly.\n\nThen, process the grid:\n\nCheck the two diagonals:\n\nFor the main diagonal: positions where i == j.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal: positions where i + j == n - 1.\n\nWait, since n is odd, the center is at (n//2, n//2). So for n=3, the center is (1,1), but in zero-based or one-based indexing?\n\nWait, the grid is n rows, each with n characters. So, assuming zero-based indices, for a 3x3 grid:\n\nIndices are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nMain diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nAnti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each of these diagonals, collect their characters and check if all are the same.\n\nSo, steps for checking:\n\n- Collect all the characters on the main diagonal. Check if they are all the same.\n\n- Collect all the characters on the anti-diagonal. Check if they are all the same.\n\n- Also, check that the main diagonal's character is equal to the anti-diagonal's. Because they must be the same.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, output NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNext step: check all the non-diagonal cells.\n\nEach cell that's not on either diagonal must have the same character, and this character must be different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i != j and i + j != n-1 → then check its value.\n\nCollect all such values and see if they are all the same. Also, ensure that this value is different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n lines, each as a string. So grid is a list of strings, each of length n.\n\n3. For each row in grid, make sure it's length is n.\n\n4. Now, collect the main diagonal's characters: for i in 0..n-1: grid[i][i].\n\n   Check if all are the same. Let's call this d_char.\n\n5. Similarly, collect the anti-diagonal's characters: for i in 0..n-1: grid[i][n-1 -i].\n\n   Check if all are the same. Call this a_char.\n\n6. If d_char != a_char → output NO.\n\n7. Else, proceed.\n\n8. Now, check all the non-diagonal cells.\n\n   For each cell (i,j):\n\n   if i != j and i + j != n-1 → collect grid[i][j].\n\n   All these collected cells must be same, say o_char.\n\n   Also, o_char must not equal d_char (since d_char is same as a_char).\n\n9. If all these conditions are met → output YES. Else, NO.\n\nNow, think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if n=3? Like the sample input.\n\nIn the second sample input, the grid is:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must meet specific criteria for this to be true.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the integer `n` and then read the next `n` lines to form the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** \n   - Extract characters from the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n   - Extract characters from the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).\n   - Ensure both diagonals have the same character.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Characters:**\n   - Collect characters from all cells not on either diagonal.\n   - Ensure all these characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result:** If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n    # Check main diagonal\n    d_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        if d_char is None:\n            d_char = grid[i][i]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n                return False\n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    a_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if a_char is None:\n            a_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n                return False\n    # Both diagonals must be the same\n    if d_char != a_char:\n        return False\n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    o_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n                if o_char is None:\n                    o_char = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n                        return False\n    # Also check that o_char is different from d_char\n    if o_char == d_char:\n        return False\n    return True\n\nif is_x(grid, n):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The grid is read as a list of strings, each string representing a row.\n- **Diagonal Check:** We iterate through the main and anti-diagonals to ensure all characters are the same.\n- **Non-Diagonal Check:** We collect characters from cells not on the diagonals and ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n- **Efficiency:** The solution efficiently checks each cell exactly once, making it linear in terms of the grid size, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
