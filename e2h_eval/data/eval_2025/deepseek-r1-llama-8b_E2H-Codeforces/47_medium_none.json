    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what affects the LCM when we add the same k to both a and b.\n\nLet me think about the LCM formula. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So for a+k and b+k, their LCM depends on their product and their GCD.\n\nWait, but a and b could be in any order. Maybe I should compute the difference between a and b. Because adding k to both would make their difference remain the same as (a - b), but wait, no. Wait, a +k minus b +k is a - b. So the difference between them is fixed. That's an important point.\n\nSo let's denote d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a and b are equal. Then a+k and b+k are the same, so their LCM is just a+k (or b+k). So in this case, the minimal LCM is achieved when k is 0, because any larger k would just make the number bigger. So the answer is 0.\n\nBut when d is not zero, things get more interesting. Because when d is positive, say a > b, then a +k = b +k +d. So the two numbers differ by d.\n\nSo the two numbers are x and x+d, where x = b +k. Or x = a -k, depending on which is larger.\n\nWait, actually, regardless of which is larger, the two numbers can be written as x and x + d, where d is |a - b|.\n\nSo the LCM of x and x+d is what we need to minimize, and x is equal to a +k or b +k, depending on which is larger.\n\nWait, no. Let's say a is larger than b. Then a +k is (b +k) + d. So x is b +k, and x +d is a +k. So the two numbers are x and x +d.\n\nSo for each x >= 0 (since k is non-negative), the two numbers are x and x +d.\n\nWhat's the LCM of x and x +d?\n\nWell, let's denote m = x. Then the two numbers are m and m +d. Their GCD is the same as the GCD of m and d. Because GCD(m, m +d) = GCD(m, d).\n\nSo LCM(m, m +d) = m*(m +d) / GCD(m, d).\n\nOur goal is to find the x (which is b +k, or a +k depending on which is larger) that makes this value as small as possible.\n\nWait, but since x = b +k, and k is non-negative, x can be as large as needed. But maybe the minimal LCM occurs at a certain x.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when d divides m, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when m is a divisor of d, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal LCM occurs when the GCD of m and d is as large as possible.\n\nBecause if the GCD is larger, then the LCM is smaller.\n\nYes, because the LCM is m*(m +d)/g, where g is GCD(m, d). So to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize g.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible, and then among all x that have the maximum possible GCD with d, pick the smallest x (since x = b +k, so k is x - b, but wait, no. Wait, when a > b, then x is b +k, and a +k = x +d. So k can be expressed as x - b, but only if x >= b. Otherwise, if x < b, then a +k would be less than b +k, which contradicts our initial assumption that a is larger. So I think we can assume that x is at least max(a, b), but wait, no. Wait, when a is less than b, then x is a +k, and b +k is x +d, but d is now b -a.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to set d as the absolute difference between a and b, and then proceed accordingly.\n\nLet me try to rephrase:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|\n\nIf d is zero, return k=0.\n\nElse, we have two cases: a >= b or a < b.\n\nBut regardless, the two numbers after adding k become x and x +d, where x is the smaller of a and b plus k, and d is the difference.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose a > b: then a +k = (b +k) + d. So the two numbers are (b +k) and (b +k) +d.\n\nIf a < b: then the two numbers are (a +k) and (a +k) + (b - a), which is (a +k) and (b +k).\n\nSo in either case, the two numbers can be written as x and x +d, where x is the smaller of a and b plus k, and d is the absolute difference.\n\nSo regardless of which is larger, the two numbers are x and x +d, where x is min(a, b) +k.\n\nWait, no. Because if a is larger, then x is b +k, and x +d is a +k. If a is smaller, then x is a +k, and x +d is b +k.\n\nSo in both cases, the two numbers are x and x +d, but x is the smaller of the original two plus k.\n\nSo x must be at least as big as the minimum of a and b. Because k is non-negative.\n\nWait, no. For example, if a is 5 and b is 10, then d is 5. Suppose k is 3. Then a +k is 8, b +k is 13. So x is 8, and x +d is 13, but d is 5, 8 +5 is 13. So yes.\n\nWait, but x is the smaller of a and b plus k? No, because in this case, a is 5, which is smaller than 10. So x is 5 +3 =8, which is correct.\n\nSo the two numbers are x and x +d, where x = min(a, b) +k.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: find x >= min(a, b) such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nAnd x can be any value >= min(a, b), because k is non-negative.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if a is smaller than b, then x is a +k, and since k can be zero, x can be a, which is allowed.\n\nSo the key is to model the problem as finding x >= s (where s is min(a,b)), such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nWe need to find x such that x is as small as possible, but also the GCD(x, d) is as large as possible.\n\nWait, because LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d).\n\nSo to minimize this, for a given x, we want gcd(x, d) to be as large as possible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal x is the one that has the largest possible divisor of d.\n\nBut how do we find such x?\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to find all the divisors of d, and for each divisor g of d, find the smallest x >= s where x is a multiple of g.\n\nWait, but why? Because if x is a multiple of g, then the GCD(x, d) will be at least g, perhaps more.\n\nWait, but since g is a divisor of d, the GCD(x, d) can't be larger than g. Or can it?\n\nNo, because if x is a multiple of g, then the GCD(x, d) is at least the GCD(g, d/g), but since d is divisible by g, the GCD is exactly g if x is a multiple of g.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose d is 12, and g is 4. x is 8. Then GCD(8, 12) is 4, which is equal to g.\n\nSo if x is a multiple of g, then the GCD(x, d) is exactly g only if g is the maximum divisor of d that divides x.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is the greatest divisor of d that is <= x.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is the largest divisor of d that is <= x.\n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, x should be a multiple of a large divisor of d.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest possible s (min(a, b)) plus some k such that x is a multiple of a large divisor of d.\n\nWait, but how to find which divisor of d gives the best result.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible divisor g of d, find the smallest x >= s such that g divides x. Then, for each such x, compute the LCM(x, x +d) and see which is the smallest.\n\nBut trying all divisors might be computationally expensive, especially since d can be up to 1e9.\n\nWait, but the number of divisors of d is up to around 1e5 for d=1e9, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d ==0, return k=0.\n\n2. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, find the smallest x >= s (s is min(a, b)) such that x is a multiple of g.\n\n   The x would be the smallest multiple of g that is >= s.\n\n4. For each such x, compute the LCM(x, x +d). Since x +d = x + (d) = x + (g * k), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but for each x, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g', where g' = GCD(x, d).\n\nBut since g is a divisor of d, and x is a multiple of g, the GCD(x, d) is exactly g' = GCD(x, d) = GCD(m*g, d), where m is some integer.\n\nWait, no. If x is a multiple of g, then x = g * k for some k. Then, d = g * t, since g is a divisor of d.\n\nSo GCD(g*k, g*t) = g * GCD(k, t). So the GCD is at least g. It could be higher if k and t share factors.\n\nBut to maximize the GCD, perhaps it's best to have k and t share as many factors as possible.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when x is a multiple of g, and the minimal x is chosen for each g.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, compute x as the smallest multiple of g that is >= s.\n\nThen, for each such x, compute the LCM and find the minimal one.\n\nAdditionally, since x can vary, but the minimal x for each g is s if s is a multiple of g, else s + (g - s % g).\n\nSo, for each g, compute x_min_g.\n\nOnce we have x_min_g, we can compute the LCM for each g, and select the one with the smallest LCM.\n\nIf there are multiple g's that lead to the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x.\n\nWait, but how to handle all possible divisors, including those that may not be factors of d.\n\nWait, no, because we're considering all divisors of d, which are the possible g's that can influence the GCD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should also consider other values of x that are not multiples of any divisor of d, but that might not be necessary because the GCD of x and d is maximized when x is a multiple of a large divisor of d.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|. If d is 0, output 0.\n\n- Compute s = min(a, b).\n\n- Find all divisors of d. Include 1 and d itself.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute x_min = the smallest x >= s such that x is a multiple of g.\n\n- For each x_min, compute the LCM of x_min and x_min +d.\n\n- Find the x_min that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple x_min's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x_min.\n\n- Also, note that the x_min can't be less than s, so we have to ensure x_min >= s.\n\nBut wait, is it sufficient to consider only the multiples of the divisors of d?\n\nBecause suppose x is such that GCD(x, d) is larger than any of the divisors considered. But since all the divisors are already considered, that's not possible.\n\nWait, for example, suppose d is 12, and x is 18. The GCD(18, 12) is 6. So 6 is a divisor of 12.\n\nSo, considering all the divisors of d should cover all possible maximum possible GCDs.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d, then for each, compute x_min, then compute the LCM for x_min, and track the minimal LCM and the corresponding x.\n\nBut what about x's that are not multiples of any divisor of d? Because their GCD with d would be smaller than any of the divisors considered.\n\nYes, because the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that divides x.\n\nSo, if x is not a multiple of any divisor of d, then the GCD(x, d) is less than the maximum possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose d is 12, x is 8. The divisors of 12 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. 8 is not a multiple of any of these except 1 and 2. So GCD(8, 12)=4. But 4 is a divisor of 12.\n\nSo perhaps all possible x's have a GCD with d that is a divisor of d.\n\nTherefore, considering all the divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute x_min as the smallest multiple of g that is >= s.\n\n- Compute the LCM for x_min and x_min +d.\n\n- Keep track of the x_min that gives the minimal LCM.\n\n- Also, compute the initial case where x is s, without any consideration of divisors. Because maybe for some d, the minimal LCM is achieved at x = s.\n\nWait, no. Because for x = s, the GCD(s, d) could be less than some other g's, leading to a higher LCM.\n\nSo, in the process of considering all g's, we will automatically compute x = s if s is a multiple of some g.\n\nBut wait, for example, if d is 6, s is 4. Then, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor g=2: x_min is 4, since 4 is a multiple of 2.\n\nFor g=3: x_min is 6 (since 4 is not a multiple of 3, so next is 6).\n\nSo in this case, x=4 is considered.\n\nBut what if d is 5, and s is 4.\n\nDivisors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n\nFor g=1: x_min is 4 (since 4 is >= s=4, and 4 is a multiple of 1).\n\nFor g=5: x_min is 5.\n\nSo x=4 is considered.\n\nIn that case, the minimal LCM is when x=4, which is the s.\n\nSo the process covers that.\n\nAnother example: when s is 5, d is 7.\n\nThe divisors are 1 and 7.\n\nFor g=1: x_min is 5.\n\nFor g=7: x_min is 7.\n\nSo x=5 is considered, which is s.\n\nSo the process correctly includes x=s.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute all the divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g, compute x_min = ((s + g - 1) // g) * g.\n\nThen, compute the LCM for x_min and x_min +d.\n\nFind the x_min that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple x_min's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest x.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where x is s, but not a multiple of any divisor except 1? Like when d=5, s=3.\n\nWait, d=5, s=3.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nfor g=1: x_min is 3.\n\nfor g=5: x_min is 5.\n\nSo x=3 is considered.\n\nSo the process works.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. If d ==0, output k=0.\n\n3. Else, compute s = min(a, b).\n\n4. Generate all divisors of d.\n\n5. For each divisor g, compute x_min = ((s + g -1) // g) * g.\n\n6. For each x_min, compute the LCM of x_min and x_min +d.\n\n7. Among all these x_min's, find the one with the smallest LCM. If multiple, choose the smallest x.\n\n8. Also, note that the initial x (x = s) is included because for g=1, x_min is s.\n\nWait, but in the case where d=0, it's handled separately.\n\nNow, the question is, how to efficiently generate all the divisors of d.\n\nSo, how to find all the divisors of d.\n\nAn efficient way is to factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products of these factors.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nFunction to find all divisors of n:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n ==0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n %i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but n can be up to 1e9, and sqrt(1e9) is about 3e4, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, for n=1e9, sqrt is 31622, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code will loop from 1 to 31622, check if i divides n, and collect the divisors.\n\nOnce all the divisors are collected, we proceed.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nif d ==0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ns = min(a, b)\n\ncompute all divisors of d.\n\ninitialize variables to track the minimal LCM and the best x.\n\nminimal_lcm = infinity\n\nbest_x = None\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n    x_min = ((s + g -1) // g) * g\n\n    current_lcm = (x_min * (x_min +d)) // gcd(x_min, d)\n\n    # wait, but d is a multiple of g, since g is a divisor.\n\n    # but wait, x_min is a multiple of g, so gcd(x_min, d) is at least g.\n\n    # but d = g * (d/g), and x_min = g * k.\n\n    # so gcd(g*k, g*(d/g)) = g * gcd(k, d/g).\n\n    # So, it's possible that the GCD is larger than g.\n\n    # So, to compute the actual GCD, perhaps it's better to use math.gcd.\n\n    # So, let's compute current_gcd = gcd(x_min, d).\n\n    # current_lcm = (x_min * (x_min +d)) // current_gcd.\n\n    current_gcd = math.gcd(x_min, d)\n\n    current_lcm = (x_min * (x_min +d)) // current_gcd\n\n    if current_lcm < minimal_lcm:\n\n        minimal_lcm = current_lcm\n\n        best_x = x_min\n\n    elif current_lcm == minimal_lcm:\n\n        if x_min < best_x:\n\n            best_x = x_min\n\nSo, after processing all g's, the best_x is the x that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nThen, the k is best_x - s.\n\nBecause s = min(a, b), and x = s +k.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when a >= b, then x is b +k, and s =b.\n\nSo, k = x - b.\n\nSimilarly, when a < b, x is a +k, so k =x -a.\n\nWhich is x - s.\n\nSo, yes, k = best_x - s.\n\nBut wait, what about when x_min is s itself?\n\nLike when d=5, s=3, g=1.\n\nx_min is 3.\n\nSo k =3-3=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case from the example:\n\nInput: 6 10 → a=6, b=10.\n\nd=4.\n\ns=6.\n\ndivisors of 4: 1, 2,4.\n\nfor g=1:\n\nx_min = 6.\n\nlcm(6, 10) = 30.\n\nfor g=2:\n\nx_min is 6.\n\nsince 6 is a multiple of 2.\n\nlcm(6, 10) is 30.\n\nfor g=4:\n\nx_min is 8.\n\nlcm(8, 12) is 24.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, achieved at x=8.\n\nk =8 -6=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\ninput 21 31 → a=21, b=31.\n\nd=10.\n\ns=21.\n\ndivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nfor g=1: x_min=21. lcm(21, 31) = 651.\n\ng=2: x_min=22. 22 and 32: gcd(22, 10)=2. lcm is 22*32/2= 352.\n\ng=5: x_min=25. 25 and 35: gcd is 5. lcm is 25*35/5=175.\n\ng=10: x_min=30. 30 and 40: gcd is 10. lcm is 30*40/10=120.\n\nSo the minimal is 120, achieved at x=30. So k=30-21=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird test case: 5 10 → d=5.\n\ns=5.\n\ndivisors: 1,5.\n\ng=1: x_min=5. lcm(5, 10)=10.\n\ng=5: x_min=5. lcm is 10.\n\nSo, both options give the same LCM. So choose the smaller x, which is 5. So k=0.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nBut wait, what about when d is 1? Like a=3, b=4. d=1.\n\ndivisors are 1.\n\nx_min is 3.\n\nlcm(3,4) =12.\n\nIs that the minimal possible?\n\nYes, because any k>0 will increase the numbers.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=6 → d=2.\n\ndivisors: 1,2.\n\nfor g=1: x=4 → lcm(4,6)=12.\n\ng=2: x=4 → lcm(4,6)=12.\n\nSo both give the same LCM. Choose the smallest x, which is 4. So k=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=14 → d=7.\n\ndivisors:1,7.\n\ng=1: x=7 → lcm(7,14)=14.\n\ng=7: x=7 → same.\n\nSo, minimal is 14, k=0.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=8 → d=5.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1: x=3 → lcm(3,8)=24.\n\ng=5: x=5 → lcm(5,10)=10.\n\nSo, the minimal is 10, achieved at x=5.\n\nk=5-3=2.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, we need to import math.\n\nThen, read a and b.\n\nCompute d=abs(a-b).\n\nif d==0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ns = min(a, b).\n\nfind all divisors of d.\n\nthen, for each g in divisors:\n\ncompute x_min = ((s + g -1) // g ) * g.\n\nthen, compute current_gcd = math.gcd(x_min, d).\n\ncurrent_lcm = (x_min * (x_min +d)) // current_gcd.\n\nkeep track of the minimal lcm and best x.\n\nFinally, compute k = best_x - s.\n\nprint k.\n\nWait, but what about the case where d is zero? We handled that.\n\nBut what about when d is 1?\n\nNo, the code handles it.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1, b=1. d=0. Output 0.\n\nAnother edge case: a=0, b=5. Wait, but the problem statement says 1<=a, b <=1e9. Oh, wait, the input constraints are 1 <=a, b <=1e9. So a and b are at least 1.\n\nSo no need to handle a=0.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code.\n\nImplementing the get_divisors function.\n\nWait, but in Python, the standard way is to write a function that returns all divisors.\n\nAlso, note that the code should handle d=0, but that's already handled before.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    s = min(a, b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    minimal_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_x = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        x_min = ((s + g - 1) // g) * g\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x_min, d)\n        current_lcm = (x_min * (x_min + d)) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < minimal_lcm:\n            minimal_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_x = x_min\n        elif current_lcm == minimal_lcm:\n            if x_min < best_x:\n                best_x = x_min\n    k = best_x - s\n    print(k)\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 10 → d=4.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nProcessing:\n\ng=1: x_min=6. current_gcd=4. lcm=6*10/4=60/4=15? Wait, no.\n\nWait, wait, 6 and 10 have a GCD of 2.\n\nSo current_lcm is (6*16)/2 = 48.\n\nWait, no. Wait, x_min is 6, x_min +d is 6+4=10. So the two numbers are 6 and 10. Their GCD is 2. So LCM is (6*10)/2=30.\n\nAh, right. So current_lcm is 30.\n\ng=2: x_min=6. x_min +4=10. GCD(6,4) is 2. So LCM=30.\n\ng=4: x_min=8. x_min +4=12. GCD(8,4)=4. So LCM=8*12/4=24.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, best_x=8. k=8-6=2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:21 31 → d=10.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\ng=1: x=21. LCM(21, 31) is 21*31=651.\n\ng=2: x=22. LCM(22,32)= (22*32)/2= 352.\n\ng=5: x=25. LCM(25,35)= 25*35/5=175.\n\ng=10: x=30. LCM(30,40)= 30*40/(10)= 120.\n\nSo minimal is 120, k=30-21=9.\n\nSample 3:5 10 → d=5.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1: x=5. LCM(5,10)=10.\n\ng=5: x=5. same.\n\nso best_x is 5. k=0.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=8 → d=5.\n\ndivisors:1,5.\n\ng=1: x=3 → LCM(3,8)=24.\n\ng=5: x=5 → LCM(5,10)=10.\n\nSo code picks x=5, k=2.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6 →d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=1: x=4 → LCM(4,6)=12.\n\ng=2: x=4 → same.\n\nso best_x=4, k=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=14 →d=7.\n\ndivisors:1,7.\n\ng=1: x=7 → LCM(7,14)=14.\n\ng=7: x=7 → same.\n\nso best_x=7, k=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=8.\n\nd=5.\n\ng=5: x=5.\n\nSo code correctly finds k=2.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is crucial. Let \\( d = |a - b| \\). If \\( d = 0 \\), then \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, and the optimal \\( k \\) is 0.\n   - For \\( d \\neq 0 \\), we need to find \\( k \\) such that the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. This translates to finding the optimal value of \\( x \\) where \\( x \\) is the smaller of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) plus \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( x + d \\) can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). This is because the LCM formula is \\( \\text{LCM}(x, x + d) = \\frac{x \\cdot (x + d)}{\\text{GCD}(x, d)} \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute all divisors of \\( d \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) (denoted as \\( x_{\\text{min}} \\)) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and is at least the minimum of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each \\( x_{\\text{min}} \\) and track the minimal LCM and corresponding \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**:\n   - Finding all divisors of \\( d \\) using trial division is efficient given the constraints (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    s = min(a, b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    minimal_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_x = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        x_min = ((s + g - 1) // g) * g\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x_min, d)\n        current_lcm = (x_min * (x_min + d)) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < minimal_lcm:\n            minimal_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_x = x_min\n        elif current_lcm == minimal_lcm:\n            if x_min < best_x:\n                best_x = x_min\n    k = best_x - s\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Divisor Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of \\( d \\) efficiently by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\).\n- **Optimal \\( x \\) Calculation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and at least the minimum of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is computed.\n- **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate \\( x \\), the LCM is computed using the GCD to determine the minimal LCM efficiently.\n- **Result**: The smallest \\( k \\) that achieves the minimal LCM is determined and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) while considering all possible divisors of \\( d \\) to maximize the GCD, thus minimizing the LCM.",
