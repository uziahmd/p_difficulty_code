Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So it's a perfect matching between R spaceships and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional constraint: the paths from a base to its spaceship shouldn't intersect any other path. These paths are straight lines in the galaxy plane (2D). So, for any two paths, their corresponding lines can't cross each other.\n\nHmm. So the assignment must not only be a perfect matching but also ensure that none of the connecting lines cross each other.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. The key is to find a bipartite matching where the edges don't cross any other edges. But wait, what does it mean for the edges not to cross? It's not just about non-crossing edges in the graph, but geometrically in 2D.\n\nWait, no. The edges are the straight lines connecting each base to its assigned spaceship. So all these lines must be non-intersecting. So for any two edges (lines), they cannot cross each other.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in the bipartite graph where the edges (connections) don't cross each other in the 2D plane.\n\nHow can I model this? It seems like a problem where the matching must form a non-crossing structure.\n\nI remember that in computational geometry, a non-crossing matching is sometimes called a planar matching. So maybe we can model this as a planar bipartite graph.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider the problem as trying to connect points in such a way that the lines don't cross. So, perhaps the matching needs to form a structure where the order of the points on each side (spaceships and bases) is such that when connected, the lines don't cross.\n\nWait, that reminds me of the concept of convex hulls or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matching must be such that when both the spaceships and the bases are ordered along a certain direction, say, sorted by x-coordinate, then the i-th spaceship is connected to the i-th base, ensuring that the lines don't cross.\n\nWait, that might not always hold. For example, if the bases are not sorted, but the lines could still cross even if the i-th is connected to i-th.\n\nNo, that's not necessarily the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking whether the bipartite graph can be matched in such a way that the edges form a non-crossing structure. How can I represent this?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each possible perfect matching, check if the corresponding lines don't cross each other.\n\nBut since R and B can be up to 10, the number of possible perfect matchings is (R choose B) * B! / (R-B)! ), which for R=10, B=5, is 10*9*8*7*6/(5! )= 3024 possibilities. Wait, no, more accurately, the number is R! / (R-B)! since it's a bipartite graph. For R=10, B=5, it's 10*9*8*7*6 = 30240. So 30k possibilities, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each matching, I need to check all pairs of edges (lines) to see if any two cross. So for each matching, the number of pairs is C(B, 2) = B*(B-1)/2. So for B=10, that's 45 checks per matching. So total operations would be 30k * 45 = 1.35 million. That's acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n2. For each matching:\n   a. Check if all the lines connecting the pairs do not cross each other.\n3. If any matching satisfies the condition, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, how do I generate all perfect matchings efficiently?\n\nHmm, generating all possible permutations where each base is matched exactly once. But since the bases are fixed, each matching is a permutation of the bases assigned to the spaceships.\n\nWait, for R spaceships and B bases, each spaceship must be assigned to a unique base. So it's a bijection between the spaceships and bases.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the B bases, we can create a mapping from spaceships to bases. Then, for each such permutation, check if the lines don't cross.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For all possible bijections (permutations) from the spaceships to the bases:\n   - For each pair (ship, base) in the permutation:\n      - Compute the line between ship and base.\n   - Check all pairs of lines to see if any two cross.\n   - If any matching has no crossing lines, return \"Yes\".\n- After checking all, if none found, return \"No\".\n\nNow, the key is to efficiently implement the checking of whether lines cross.\n\nHow to check if two lines cross?\n\nTwo lines can be represented as line segments between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), and (x3,y3) and (x4,y4).\n\nWe can use the standard method to determine if two line segments intersect.\n\nThe method involves checking the orientation of the endpoints. Let's denote the four points as A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the orientations of (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D):\n\n- Orientation of three points p, q, r is:\n   - 0 if colinear,\n   - 1 if clockwise,\n   - 2 if counter-clockwise.\n\nIf the orientations are different for (A, C) and (A, D), then C and D lie on opposite sides of line AD. Similarly for B.\n\nIf the orientations of (A, C) and (B, D) are different, and the orientations of (A, D) and (B, C) are different, then the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nSo, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is as follows:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 != ccw2) and (ccw3 != ccw4):\n        return True\n    # Check if any point is on the other segment.\n    # This is a bit more complex. Maybe for the problem, it's enough to check for proper crossings, but in our case, the input ensures that no three points are colinear, so line segments won't share endpoints.\n    # Since the input says no two points coincide and no three points are colinear, we can ignore the cases where a point is on the other segment.\n    return False\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, no three points are on the same line, so the line segments can't share any points except endpoints. And since the input ensures no two points are the same, the line segments are either non-overlapping or crossing properly.\n\nSo, the above function should suffice.\n\nSo, for each matching, I'll collect all the line segments between ships and bases, and then for every pair of segments, check if any of them intersect using this function. If any pair does, then this matching is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nNow, the next step is to generate all possible perfect matchings.\n\nIn Python, for B bases, the number of possible permutations is B! So, for B=10, that's 3.6 million, but with B up to 10, 10! is 3,628,800. Hmm, that's manageable for small B, but for B=10, it's over 3 million. Each requires B*(B-1)/2 segment checks, which for 10 is 45. So 3.6e6 *45 = 162 million operations. Wait, that's a lot.\n\nWait, but for R=10, B=10, it's R=B, so the matching is a bijection. So 10! is 3.6 million, which multiplied by 45 is 162 million. That's a lot, but perhaps manageable in Python for the constraints given.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, R and B can be up to 10 each. So for R=10 and B=10, it's 10! = 3.6e6 permutations. Each permutation has 10 segments. We need to check all C(10,2)=45 pairs of segments.\n\nSo 3.6e6 *45 = 162e6 operations. That's 162 million. That might be tight for Python, as each iteration isn't that fast.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe we can optimize by precomputing all possible matchings, but I don't see an obvious way. Alternatively, perhaps some pruning can be done during the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached differently, such as considering that the matching must be non-crossing. So, perhaps the matching corresponds to a planar structure, such as a convex polygon.\n\nWait, another idea: the non-crossing condition implies that the matching is a non-crossing bipartite graph, which can be checked via a certain ordering.\n\nWait, perhaps if we sort the spaceships and bases along a certain axis, and then check if the matching is a non-decreasing sequence. For example, sort the spaceships and bases based on their x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), and then check if the permutation is such that the i-th spaceship is connected to the i-th base in the sorted order.\n\nBut this isn't sufficient because the non-crossing condition is more general than that. For example, imagine that after sorting, the connections are not in order but still non-crossing.\n\nWait, but perhaps the non-crossing condition implies that the matching can be represented as a set of nested intervals or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph and finding a matching that forms a non-crossing tree, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible matching, compute the convex hull of all the points involved and see if the matching can be arranged in a way that the lines don't cross. But I'm not sure how to apply this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a bipartition where the edges are non-crossing. In such cases, the problem is known as the non-crossing bipartite matching problem.\n\nWait, I recall that when you have two sets of points on a circle, and you want a non-crossing bipartite matching, the solution is to find a cyclic order and then match points accordingly. But perhaps that's specific to circular arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a matching that corresponds to a triangulation or something similar.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with the exact algorithms for this.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach of generating all possible matchings and checking for non-crossing is feasible for the given constraints.\n\nLet me proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read R and B.\n\n2. Read R spaceships' coordinates.\n\n3. Read B bases' coordinates.\n\n4. For all possible permutations of B bases (since each base must be matched to exactly one spaceship):\n\n   a. For each permutation p (which is a list where p[i] is the index of the base assigned to the i-th spaceship):\n\n      i. For each spaceship index i, get the coordinates of the spaceship and the base p[i], and create a line segment.\n\n   b. For all pairs of line segments, check if any pair intersects.\n\n      i. If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   c. If all line segments do not intersect, then the permutation is a valid solution. Return \"Yes\".\n\n5. After checking all permutations, if none are valid, return \"No\".\n\nNow, the key is to generate all possible permutations of the B bases.\n\nWait, but the B bases are given in a certain order, but for the permutation, any reordering is allowed as long as each base is used exactly once.\n\nSo, for the code, the permutation will be a list where each element is the index of the base (from 0 to B-1) assigned to the spaceship at that position.\n\nFor example, for B=3, the permutations are [0,1,2], [0,2,1], [1,0,2], etc.\n\nSo, the code can generate all possible permutations of the range(B) and for each, assign the i-th spaceship to the permutation's i-th element.\n\nWait, but the spaceships are R in number, but B may be less than R. So in the code, the permutation is of size B, but the spaceships are R. So, perhaps the code is a bit more involved.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that R and B are equal? No, wait, no. Wait, the problem says 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. So, R and B can be different. Wait, but wait: for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and vice versa. So, R must equal B.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the first line contains R and B. Then, R spaceships and B bases follow. The output is whether it's possible to assign R spaceships to B bases such that it's a perfect matching.\n\nWait, that's impossible if R != B. Because a perfect matching requires that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned exactly one spaceship. So, the problem's constraints imply that R must equal B.\n\nWait, but the input allows R and B to be different. So, perhaps in that case, it's impossible, and the answer is 'No'.\n\nSo, the first thing the code should do is check if R != B. If yes, output 'No'.\n\nWait, but let's look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\nThen 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nSample Output: Yes.\n\nSo, in that case, R equals B.\n\nSo, for the code, the first step is to check if R != B. If so, output 'No' immediately.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo, that's an important optimization.\n\nNext, the code will handle the case when R == B.\n\nSo, now, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse, read R space ships and B bases.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the B bases, and for each permutation, check if the corresponding assignment is a non-crossing matching.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nWait, but for R=3, B=3, the number of permutations is 3! = 6. For each, we have 3 line segments, and check all 3 pairs.\n\nSo, 6 *3 =18 segment checks, which is trivial.\n\nBut for R=10, B=10, it's 10! = 3.6 million permutations, each requiring 45 segment checks. That's 162 million operations, which may be too slow for Python.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, R and B are up to 10, which gives 10! = 3.6 million permutations, which is manageable? Or perhaps not, depending on how much time each iteration takes.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: find a way to represent the problem as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching that is non-crossing.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching between the two sets of points.\n\nIn computational geometry, there's a concept of a non-crossing bipartite graph. One way to model this is that the edges form a structure where they don't cross, which can be achieved by having the edges form a convex polygon or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartition where the edges are non-crossing, which can be checked by a certain ordering.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the convex hull trick.\n\nSort the spaceships and the bases in a certain order, such as their x-coordinates. Then, the matching must be such that the i-th spaceship is connected to the i-th base in the sorted order. If this holds, then the lines can't cross.\n\nBut is this sufficient?\n\nWait, suppose the bases are sorted, and the spaceships are sorted, and the matching is in the same order. Then, the lines are non-crossing because the slopes would be increasing or decreasing, preventing crossings.\n\nBut is this the only way?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the spaceships are sorted in x-order, and the bases are also sorted in x-order. Then, if the i-th spaceship is connected to the i-th base, the lines are non-crossing.\n\nBut what if the i-th spaceship is connected to a base j > i? Then, the line might cross with others.\n\nSo, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that the matching is order-preserving when both points are sorted.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartition where the edges form a non-crossing structure, which can be checked via a greedy algorithm.\n\nBut I'm not aware of an efficient way to do this.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach of generating all possible permutations and checking each is the way to go, but with optimizations.\n\nWait, but for R=10, B=10, 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 segment checks, that's a lot.\n\nBut perhaps in Python, it's manageable, especially since the per-iteration cost is low.\n\nSo, perhaps proceed with that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\n1. Read R and B.\n\n   If R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\n2. Read R space ships' coordinates: list of tuples.\n\n3. Read B bases' coordinates: list of tuples.\n\n4. Generate all possible permutations of the B bases. For each permutation:\n\n   a. Create a list of line segments, each between a spaceship and a base, according to the permutation.\n\n   b. For all pairs of segments in the current matching, check if any two intersect.\n\n      i. If any pair does, break early and mark this permutation as invalid.\n\n   c. If no intersections, return 'Yes'.\n\n5. After all permutations, if none are valid, return 'No'.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this.\n\nBut in Python, generating all permutations is straightforward using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutation is for the B bases, which are in the order 0..B-1. So, for each permutation, the i-th spaceship is assigned to the base at permutation[i].\n\nBut the spaceships are in order 0..R-1, but R = B.\n\nSo, for the code, the permutation is a tuple of length B, where each element is the index of the base (from 0 to B-1).\n\nEach spaceship is assigned to the base in the permutation.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, generate all possible permutations of the B bases\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n    # For this permutation, create the line segments\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        s = ships[i]\n        b = bases[perm[i]]\n        segments.append( (s, b) )\n    \n    # Now, check all pairs of segments for intersection\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            s1, b1 = segments[i]\n            s2, b2 = segments[j]\n            \n            # Check if line segments s1-b1 and s2-b2 intersect\n            # Implement the ccw function as before\n            def ccw(A, B, C):\n                return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n            \n            ccw1 = ccw(s1, b1, s2)\n            ccw2 = ccw(s1, b1, b2)\n            ccw3 = ccw(s2, b2, s1)\n            ccw4 = ccw(s2, b2, b1)\n            \n            if (ccw1 != ccw2) and (ccw3 != ccw4):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    \n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif found:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\nWait, but wait. The function is defined inside the loop, which is not very efficient, but for small B, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for R=10, B=10, that's 3.6e6 loops, each with 45 inner loops, each with 4 ccw calculations.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to precompute the ccw function outside the loop.\n\nSo, move the ccw function outside.\n\nAlso, for each pair of segments, the function can be optimized.\n\nBut regardless, for the problem, perhaps this code will work.\n\nTesting on the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n\nBases:\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nWait, the first sample's output is 'Yes'.\n\nIn the code, when perm is (0,1,2), meaning the first spaceship is assigned to base 0 (-2,1), the second to base 1 (0,3), the third to base 2 (2,2).\n\nWait, but no, the permutation is (0, 1, 2) for the bases, but the code is considering the permutation of the indices.\n\nWait, the permutation is generated as all possible orderings of 0,1,2.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the code creates the line segments.\n\nIn the first sample, one of the permutations is (0,1,2), which connects:\n\nShip 0: (-2,1)\n\nShip 1: (0,3)\n\nShip 2: (2,2)\n\nWait, but no. Ship 0 is (0,0), ship 1 is (2,0), ship 2 is (3,1). Bases are:\n\nBase 0: (-2,1)\n\nBase 1: (0,3)\n\nBase 2: (2,2)\n\nSo, the segments are:\n\n(0,0) to (-2,1): line between (0,0) and (-2,1)\n\n(2,0) to (0,3): line between (2,0) and (0,3)\n\n(3,1) to (2,2): line between (3,1) and (2,2)\n\nDo these lines cross any of each other?\n\nCheck each pair.\n\nPair 1-2: (2,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCompute ccw for points (2,0), (0,3), (3,1):\n\nccw1 = (0-2)(1-0) - (3-0)(3-2) → (-2)(1) - (3)(1) → -2-3=-5.\n\nccw2 = (0-2)(2-0) - (3-0)(3-2) → (-2)(2) -3*1 →-4-3=-7.\n\nccw3 = (3,1) to (2,2) to (2,0): \n\nCompute ccw(s2, b2, s1) where s1 is (2,0), b2 is (3,1). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute for all four points.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the two lines cross.\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLine 1: from (2,0) to (0,3). The slope is (3-0)/(0-2) = 3/-2 = -1.5.\n\nLine 2: from (3,1) to (2,2). Slope is (2-1)/(2-3) = 1/-1 = -1.\n\nSo, two lines with different slopes. Do they cross?\n\nCalculate the intersection.\n\nEquation of line 1: y = -1.5x + c. When x=2, y=0 → c=3. So equation is y = -1.5x +3.\n\nEquation of line 2: from (3,1) to (2,2). Using two-point form: (y-1)/(x-3) = (2-1)/(2-3) → (y-1)/(-1) = 1 → y-1 = -1 → y=0. So, equation is y = -x +4.\n\nSet equal: -1.5x +3 = -x +4 → -0.5x = 1 → x= -2.\n\nAt x=-2, y= -(-2) +4= 2+4=6. So, the lines intersect at (-2,6), which is outside the segments. So, the segments do not cross.\n\nWait, but wait, the segments are from (2,0) to (0,3) and from (3,1) to (2,2). The lines intersect at (-2,6), which is far away from both segments. So, they don't cross within the segments.\n\nThus, the matching for permutation (0,1,2) is valid.\n\nSo, the code would find this and return 'Yes'.\n\nFor the second sample input:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships:\n2 1\n3 1\n\nBases:\n3 1\n2 2\n\nWait, the output is 'No' because there's no perfect matching.\n\nSo, the code would generate the two permutations:\n\n[0,1] and [1,0].\n\nFor [0,1]:\n\nSegments are:\n\nShip 0 (2,1) to base 0 (3,1): line from (2,1) to (3,1) → horizontal line y=1.\n\nShip 1 (3,1) to base 1 (2,2): line from (3,1) to (2,2). Slope is (2-1)/(2-3) = 1/-1 = -1.\n\nCheck if these two segments cross.\n\nThe first segment is from (2,1) to (3,1), which is a horizontal line.\n\nThe second segment is from (3,1) to (2,2), which goes from (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nThese two segments meet at (3,1), but they don't cross elsewhere because the first is to the right and the second is going up-left. So, they share a common endpoint, but the problem says that no three points are colinear, but two points can be the same, but the problem says no two points coincide. Wait, in the problem statement, it says that no two points coincide, but two line segments can share an endpoint.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the condition is that any two paths (segments) do not intersect in the galaxy plane. So, if two segments share an endpoint, but that's allowed because the path is from the base to the spaceship, which is a single point.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the condition is that the paths do not intersect. So, the lines representing the paths can't cross each other, but they can share endpoints.\n\nSo, in the case where two segments share an endpoint, that's allowed.\n\nSo, in the second sample, the two segments are (2,1)-(3,1) and (3,1)-(2,2). They share the point (3,1), but they don't cross elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the first segment is from (2,1) to (3,1), which is a horizontal line. The second is from (3,1) to (2,2), which is a line going up and left.\n\nDo these two segments cross elsewhere?\n\nWell, the first segment is from (2,1) to (3,1). The second starts at (3,1) and goes to (2,2). So, the two segments meet at (3,1) but don't cross elsewhere. So, the lines don't cross each other except at the shared point.\n\nSo, why does the sample output say 'No'?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that the two paths share a common point, which is the base (3,1). But that's a base assigned to two spaceships, which is impossible. Because in the permutation [0,1], ship 0 is assigned to base 0 (3,1), ship 1 is assigned to base 1 (2,2). So, the two segments are (2,1)-(3,1) and (3,1)-(2,2). They meet at (3,1), but that's a base assigned to ship 0. So, ship 1's segment starts at (3,1), but that's the base's location. So, in this case, the two segments share the same base point, which is allowed.\n\nWait, but then why does the sample output say 'No'? Because the problem's note says that in the second example, there's no perfect matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nWait, the second sample input is:\n\nThe second part of the input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nSo, the bases are:\n\nBase 0: 2 1\n\nBase 1: 1 0\n\nBase 2: 2 2\n\nWait, no, wait, the input is for R=2, B=2.\n\nWait, the first input is 3 3, then the spaceships, then the bases.\n\nThe second input is 2 1, followed by 2 spaceships and 1 base? No, wait, no. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps it's written as two separate inputs, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWhich would make R=3, B=3, and then R=2, B=1. But that's impossible because R must equal B.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misread the sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '3 3', then 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nThen, the second line is '2 1', then 2 spaceships, then 1 base. But that would be R=3, B=3 and R=2, B=1, which is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '3 3', then 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nThen, the second part is '2 1', which is R=2, B=1.\n\nBut then, the code would have to process R=3 and B=3, and then R=2 and B=1, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is provided as a multi-line string, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nFirst line: '3 3'\n\nThen 3 lines for spaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen 3 lines for bases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThen, the second part is another test case:\n\nFirst line: '2 1'\n\nThen 2 lines for spaceships:\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nThen 1 line for bases:\n\n3 1\n\nSo, the sample output is 'Yes' and 'No' for these two cases.\n\nSo, in the second case, R=2, B=1. Which is impossible because R != B. So, the code would output 'No'.\n\nWait, but in that case, R=2, B=1. The code would immediately output 'No' without checking anything.\n\nSo, the sample outputs are 'Yes' and 'No' for the two test cases.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's efficiency.\n\nFor R=10, B=10, it's 3.6 million permutations. Each permutation requires 45 segment checks. Each segment check involves 4 ccw computations.\n\nBut in Python, even 100 million operations can be handled in a few seconds, but 3.6 million *45 = 162 million operations, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but 162 million is a lot, but perhaps the code can be optimized.\n\nBut for the problem constraints, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAnother optimization: precompute the line segments and check for intersections.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given permutation, once one pair of segments is found to intersect, we can break early.\n\nYes, the code already does that.\n\nSo, in the code, for each permutation:\n\n- create the list of segments.\n\n- for each pair of segments, check if they intersect.\n\n- if any pair does, break and try next permutation.\n\n- else, if all pairs are okay, return 'Yes'.\n\nThus, for most permutations, the code will break early upon finding the first intersecting pair.\n\nThis can save time.\n\nAnother optimization: pre-sort the segments in a way that allows for early termination.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each permutation, when adding a new segment, check against all existing segments to see if any new segment crosses any existing one.\n\nYes, that's what the code does.\n\nAnother idea: for each permutation, as the segments are added, keep track of their bounding boxes, and if a new segment's bounding box doesn't overlap with any previous segment's, then they can't cross. But this is an approximation and may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, for each new segment, compare it with all previously added segments, and check for intersection.\n\nBut that's what the code already does.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships at (0,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases at (1,1) and (3,3).\n\nThe two possible matchings are:\n\n[0,1]: ship0 → base0 (1,1); ship1 → base1 (3,3).\n\nCheck if the lines cross.\n\nLine between (0,0) and (1,1) is y=x.\n\nLine between (2,2) and (3,3) is y=x.\n\nThese lines are parallel and do not cross.\n\nThus, the matching is valid.\n\nAnother permutation: [1,0].\n\nShip0 → base1 (3,3); ship1 → base0 (1,1).\n\nLines are from (0,0) to (3,3), and (2,2) to (1,1).\n\nThese lines are also parallel and do not cross.\n\nThus, the code would output 'Yes'.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles this case.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships at (0,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases at (1,0) and (1,2).\n\nSo, possible matchings:\n\n[0,1]: ship0→base0 (1,0); ship1→base1 (1,2).\n\nLines: (0,0)-(1,0) is a horizontal line. (2,2)-(1,2) is a horizontal line.\n\nThey are parallel and do not cross.\n\nThus, the code returns 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShip positions: (0,0), (1,1).\n\nBase positions: (0,1), (1,0).\n\nMatching [0,1]: ship0→base0 (0,1); ship1→base1 (1,0).\n\nSegments: (0,0)-(0,1) is vertical; (1,1)-(1,0) is vertical. They are parallel and don't cross.\n\nThus, the code returns 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShip positions: (0,0), (2,0).\n\nBase positions: (1,1), (3,3).\n\nMatching [0,1]: (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(3,3).\n\nLines are y = x and y = x. Parallel, no cross.\n\nThus, 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case where it's impossible:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nShip positions: (0,0), (2,0).\n\nBase positions: (1,1), (3,3).\n\nAny matching will result in two lines that are parallel, thus no crossing.\n\nSo, 'Yes'.\n\nWait, but what if the ships are (0,0) and (2,0), and the bases are (1,2) and (3,4).\n\nMatching [0,1]: (0,0)-(1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect with any other path in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching between R spaceships and B bases where no two connecting paths intersect. This can be checked using computational geometry techniques.\n2. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, ensure that the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\".\n3. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible permutation of bases, check if the corresponding assignment forms non-intersecting paths.\n4. **Check for Intersection**: For each permutation, create line segments between spaceships and their assigned bases. Check all pairs of these line segments to see if any intersect using the cross product method to determine orientation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, b1, s2, b2):\n    ccw1 = ccw(s1, b1, s2)\n    ccw2 = ccw(s1, b1, b2)\n    ccw3 = ccw(s2, b2, s1)\n    ccw4 = ccw(s2, b2, b1)\n    \n    if (ccw1 != ccw2) and (ccw3 != ccw4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append((x, y))\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append((x, y))\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            s = ships[i]\n            b = bases[perm[i]]\n            segments.append((s, b))\n        \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            s_i, b_i = segments[i]\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):\n                s_j, b_j = segments[j]\n                if segments_intersect(s_i, b_i, s_j, b_j):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n    \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n2. **Check for Equality**: If the number of spaceships does not equal the number of bases, immediately output \"No\".\n3. **Permutations**: Generate all permutations of the bases to explore every possible assignment.\n4. **Segment Creation**: For each permutation, create line segments between each spaceship and its assigned base.\n5. **Intersection Check**: Use the cross product to check if any two line segments intersect. If any intersection is found, discard the permutation.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid permutation is found, output \"Yes\".
