They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the information from some roads. Each road gives two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of mushrooms that satisfies all these constraints and output it, or say it's impossible.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to model this. It seems like a graph problem where each node (lawn) has a value, and edges impose constraints between pairs of nodes. So, for each edge, the GCD of the two nodes' values must equal the given GCD, and the LCM must equal the given LCM.\n\nWait, but wait. The GCD and LCM are related in a specific way. For any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge, the product of the given GCD and LCM must equal the product of the two nodes' values.\n\nSo for each edge, the equation is:\nGCD(e) * LCM(e) = x_u * x_v\n\nWhere x_u and x_v are the values at the two ends of the edge.\n\nThis looks like a system of equations with variables being the x_i's. But solving such a system can be tricky because the equations are multiplicative.\n\nWhat's the approach here? Maybe model each variable as its prime factors, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps represent the variables in terms of their divisors, considering that each equation imposes certain constraints.\n\nAnother thought: since the product of the two variables equals the product of the edge's GCD and LCM, maybe we can express each variable in terms of others.\n\nWait, but with multiple edges and variables, this could get complex. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base variables, and then find a consistent assignment.\n\nLet me think about building a system where each variable is a multiple of some initial variables. Maybe using a Union-Find data structure with additional information, like keeping track of the relationships between the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model each node's value as a product of primes raised to certain exponents, but that might be too involved.\n\nWait, another idea: each x_i can be represented as a product of primes. The constraints from the edges would then give us equations on the exponents of each prime in the two connected nodes.\n\nBut that's probably not feasible for arbitrary numbers, especially since the input can have up to 106, which isn't too big, but handling all possible primes in the factorization of each number could get complicated.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model each x_i as a number, and for each edge, enforce that x_u * x_v = g * l, where g is the GCD and l is the LCM.\n\nWait, but when you have multiple edges involving the same nodes, these constraints must all be satisfied. So, for example, if node A is connected to B with a certain g1, l1, and also connected to C with g2, l2, then x_A * x_B = g1 * l1, x_A * x_C = g2 * l2, etc.\n\nThis forms a system of equations where the variables are the x_i's. Solving such a system requires that all the equations are compatible.\n\nBut how do we handle this in code?\n\nI think this is similar to systems of equations where variables are multiplied together, which can be tricky. One way to handle it is to represent each variable in terms of a base variable. Like, for each connected component, choose a root node and express all other variables in terms of the root's value.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we pick a root, say node R, then all other nodes can be expressed as multiples or factors based on the edges. Then, we can assign a value to R and compute the others accordingly, checking for consistency.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. For each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node.\n- Express each other node's value as a function of the root's value.\n- Then, substitute these expressions into all the constraints (edges) of the component.\n- If any constraint is violated, the system is inconsistent, return \"NO\".\n- Otherwise, assign a value to the root (which can be any value that satisfies all constraints) and compute the values for all other nodes.\n\nBut wait, what's the degree of freedom here? For example, the root's value can be any divisor of the product of all the edge products, but that's not necessarily true. It depends on the system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root's value can be determined uniquely up to a multiplicative factor. Or maybe not even that. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's consider an example. Suppose we have two nodes A and B connected by an edge with GCD=2 and LCM=3. Then x_A * x_B = 2*3 =6.\n\nIf there's another edge between B and C with GCD=3 and LCM=4, then x_B * x_C = 12. Also, if there's a third edge between A and C with GCD=1 and LCM=12, then x_A *x_C =12.\n\nSo, from the first equation, x_A =6 /x_B. Substituting into the third equation: (6/x_B)*x_C =12 → x_C = 2x_B.\n\nThen, from the second equation, x_B * (2x_B) = 2 x_B² =12 → x_B²=6 → x_B = sqrt(6). But that's not an integer, but according to the problem statement, the mushrooms are integers. Wait, no—wait, the problem says the initial map had numbers on the roads which were integers between 1 and 106, but the actual x_i's can be any integers that satisfy the constraints.\n\nWait, no, the problem doesn't specify that the x_i's have to be integers. They just have to be positive integers since they're counts of mushrooms. Oh right, because you can't have a fraction of a mushroom. So all x_i's must be positive integers.\n\nSo, in the example above, if x_B is sqrt(6), that's not an integer, so the system is invalid.\n\nSo, the solution is only valid if all x_i's computed are positive integers.\n\nTherefore, when building the system, after expressing variables in terms of the root, we need to ensure that all the computed x_i's are integers.\n\nSo, how do we model this in code?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: n lawns, m edges. Each edge has u, v, g, l.\n\n2. For each edge, create a constraint x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n3. Build a system where each variable is connected via these constraints. Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure with some additional information, perhaps the relationship between variables.\n\nBut traditional Union-Find isn't sufficient here because the constraints involve multiplication. So perhaps we need a more advanced data structure, like a bipartition with some kind of constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is connected via edges representing the multiplicative constraints. Then, we can model this as a system of equations and perform some kind of BFS/DFS to assign values consistently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent each variable as a node, and each equation as a directed hyper-edge. Then, performing a BFS to assign variables, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps using a BFS approach where we assign variables step by step, checking for consistency.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n- Create a graph where each node represents a variable (x_i).\n- Each edge represents the constraint x_u * x_v = k, where k is g*l from the input.\n- For each node, maintain a list of constraints that it's involved in.\n\nWe can model this as a graph where each node can have multiple edges, each representing a different equation.\n\nWe can then try to assign values to the variables in a way that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nBut how do we handle this in code?\n\nOne approach is to process the constraints in a way similar to topological sorting. However, since the equations are multiplicative, it's unclear how to order them.\n\nAnother idea is to represent each variable in terms of its prime factors and set up equations accordingly, but this might get too complex.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the variables using logarithms. Taking the log of each equation turns multiplicative constraints into additive ones. Then, it becomes a system of linear equations, which can be solved using standard methods.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that x_i's are integers, so taking logs won't directly help because logs can be real numbers. So this approach might not work unless all the constraints lead to x_i's that are exact powers of a common base, which is not guaranteed.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternative idea: since each equation is x_u * x_v = k, perhaps we can represent each variable as a product of primes, and then model the equations as constraints on the exponents of each prime in the variables.\n\nBut again, this could be complicated, especially for variables that are not prime.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent each variable as a product of primes, and for each equation, track how the exponents of each prime are distributed between the two variables.\n\nFor example, if x_a = p^a * q^b and x_b = p^c * q^d, then the equation x_a * x_b = k implies that k must have exponents a + c for p and b + d for q, etc.\n\nBut this would require factorizing all the k's (g*l) into their prime factors, and then setting up equations for each prime's exponent in the variables.\n\nThis seems manageable but may be computationally heavy, especially since for each edge, we have to factorize g*l.\n\nBut given that the maximum g*l is 106*106=11236, which isn't too bad, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nSo here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. For each edge, compute the product k = g * l.\n\n2. Factorize k into its prime factors.\n\n3. For each prime factor p, create an equation that relates the exponents in x_u and x_v.\n\n   For example, if x_u has exponent a for p, and x_v has exponent b, then a + b = exponent of p in k.\n\n4. These equations form a system that must be satisfied for all edges.\n\n5. We can model each variable as a dictionary mapping primes to exponents.\n\n6. Using BFS or DFS, assign exponents to each variable, ensuring that all equations are satisfied.\n\n7. Once all variables are assigned, check if any variable has a negative exponent (which would make x_i non-integer).\n\n8. If all variables have non-negative exponents, then the x_i's are valid and can be computed by multiplying the primes raised to their exponents.\n\nBut implementing this requires handling the prime factors and setting up equations for each edge.\n\nBut how do we manage the system of equations? For example, when processing an edge, if one of the variables is already assigned, we can compute the required exponents for the other variable and see if it's consistent with existing assignments.\n\nWait, but this approach may not scale well for large graphs, but given the constraints of the problem (n up to 10^5?), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the problem statement, the input is up to n lawns and m roads. Oh, but the sample inputs have n up to 4, but in general, n can be up to 10^5 or something, but the code needs to handle it efficiently.\n\nWait, actually, the problem statement says that the roads have GCD and LCM up to 106, so k = GCD * LCM is up to 106*106=11236. So the factorization is manageable.\n\nBut n can be up to, say, 10^5, but m is also up to 1e5 or so, depending on the problem.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each edge, compute k = g * l.\n\n- Factorize k into its prime factors.\n\n- For each prime in the factorization, create an equation that the sum of exponents in the two variables equals the exponent in k.\n\n- Now, for each variable (node), keep track of the exponents for each prime.\n\n- When processing each edge, if both variables have been assigned exponents for all primes, check if the sum matches k's exponents. If either variable hasn't been assigned, assign the exponents based on the current edge and propagate.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all constraints correctly. For example, if a variable is connected to multiple others, all those constraints must be satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a state indicating whether its exponents are known or not, and for each edge, when processing, if one node's exponents are known, compute the other's exponents and update accordingly.\n\nThis sounds like a BFS approach where each time we assign exponents to a node, we process all edges connected to it, propagating the exponents as needed.\n\nSo here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize each node's exponents as a dictionary (empty initially).\n\n2. For each edge, compute k = g * l, factorize into primes.\n\n3. For each prime p in k's factors, add a constraint that in the connected edge, the exponents of p in u and v must sum to the exponent in k.\n\n4. Create a queue for BFS. Initially, add all unassigned nodes, but perhaps it's better to process based on constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process edges in a way that whenever a node's exponents are known, process the edges to assign exponents to connected nodes.\n\nSo the algorithm could look like this:\n\n- For each edge (u, v, k), factorize k into primes.\n\n- For each prime p in k's factors:\n\n   - If u's exponents for p are known and v's exponents for p are known: check if their sum equals the exponent in k. If not, the system is invalid.\n\n   - Else if u's exponents for p are known: assign v's exponents for p as (exponent in k) - (u's exponent for p).\n\n   - Else if v's exponents for p are known: assign u's exponents for p as (exponent in k) - (v's exponent for p).\n\n   - Else: mark that this edge introduces new unknowns for u and v.\n\nOnce all edges are processed, check if any variables have unknown exponents. If yes, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but how do we process the edges in an order that allows us to assign exponents correctly? Because sometimes, an edge may depend on another edge's assignment.\n\nPerhaps using a Union-Find data structure isn't sufficient here because the constraints are more complex than simple connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system of equations can be represented as a graph, and we can perform a BFS where each node is visited once, and for each edge, we check if the exponents can be assigned.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n- For each edge, create a constraint between u and v for each prime p in k's factors.\n\n- For each node, keep track of the exponents for each prime p.\n\n- When processing a node, for each edge, check if the other node's exponents for p are known. If yes, compute and assign. If not, mark the edge as needing to be processed later.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAnother idea: for each edge, the exponents for each prime p in u and v must sum to the exponent in k. So, for each edge, if u has p's exponent known, then v's exponent is determined, and vice versa.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can represent it as a constraint that links the exponents of u and v for each prime p.\n\nWe can model this as a graph where each node is a (u, p) pair, and each edge represents the constraint that (u, p)'s exponent plus (v, p)'s exponent equals the exponent of p in k.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node u, we can track for each prime p, whether u's exponent is known. Then, for each edge, when one of u or v has p's exponent known, we can compute the other's exponent and update accordingly.\n\nThis suggests a BFS-like approach:\n\n- Start with nodes that have no primes, i.e., their exponents are all zero.\n\n- For each such node, process all edges connected to it.\n\n- For each edge, for each prime p in k's factors:\n\n   - If u's exponent for p is known and v's exponent for p is known: check if they sum to the required exponent. If not, invalid.\n\n   - If u's exponent for p is known: compute v's exponent and assign.\n\n   - If v's exponent for p is known: compute u's exponent and assign.\n\n   - Else: this edge's primes are unknown, so perhaps we can't process further yet.\n\nWait, but this could lead to cycles where nodes depend on each other. So, perhaps we need a way to detect cycles or ensure that all exponents can be determined without contradictions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system of equations must form a directed acyclic graph, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if the graph is bipartitioned in a certain way.\n\nWait, another approach: since x_u * x_v = k for each edge, perhaps we can model each variable as a product of a base variable and some factor. Then, for each edge, we can write the equation as:\n\nx_u = a * u_base\n\nx_v = b * v_base\n\nand k = a * b * (u_base * v_base)\n\nBut this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent each variable in terms of a root variable, say r, such that x_i = r * m_i, where m_i is an integer.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation x_u * x_v = k gives r^2 * m_u m_v = k.\n\nBut this would imply that k must be divisible by r^2, which may not always be the case.\n\nWait, but perhaps the root r can be determined such that for all edges, r^2 divides k.\n\nBut that seems restrictive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose a variable to be the root, and express all others in terms of it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for similar problems or algorithms.\n\nUpon thinking, I recall that this type of problem can be modeled using a system where each variable is connected via multiplicative constraints, which can be represented using a Union-Find structure with additional information about the ratios or products.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Union-Find with path compression, but storing for each node a parent and the product of the edge from the node to the parent.\n\nWait, yes, that's an approach I've heard of before. It's used in problems where variables are connected by multiplicative constraints.\n\nSo, the idea is to model the variables as a graph where each node has a parent, and the edge from the node to the parent represents a multiplicative factor.\n\nWhen merging two sets, we can compute the necessary factors to maintain consistency.\n\nLet me elaborate:\n\nEach node u has a parent p(u), and a value f(u) such that x_p(u) = x_u * f(u).\n\nSo, for any edge (u, v) with k = g * l, we have x_u * x_v = k.\n\nIf u and v are in different sets, we can merge them by setting the parent of one to the other, and adjusting the factors accordingly.\n\nIf u and v are in the same set, we need to check that x_u * x_v =k, which may not hold, leading to a contradiction.\n\nThis approach is similar to the Union-Find with weighted unions, but instead of sums, we're dealing with multiplicative factors.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. For each edge, compute k = g * l.\n\n2. For each edge, process the equation x_u * x_v = k.\n\n3. Use the Union-Find structure to manage the variables, ensuring that all equations are satisfied.\n\n4. If any inconsistency is found during the union operations, output \"NO\".\n\n5. If all are consistent, then compute the x_i's by choosing a root (like the representative of the set) and computing all x_i's in terms of it.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the x_i's once all unions are done?\n\nOnce the Union-Find structure is built, for each node, we can express x_i as x_root * f(i), where f(i) is the product of the factors along the path from the root to i.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each node, compute the product of all f(u) along the path from the root to u, giving x_u = x_root * product(f(u)).\n\nBut how do we determine x_root?\n\nSince x_root can be any value that makes all x_i's integers, but we need to find a consistent assignment.\n\nWait, but the product of all the equations in the system must be consistent. So, perhaps x_root can be set to 1, and then all other x_i's are determined relative to it.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because in some cases, x_root could be multiplied by a common factor, and all x_i's would scale accordingly. So, the x_i's are determined up to a multiplicative constant.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to find any possible assignment, so perhaps setting x_root to 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, setting x_root to 1 might not be possible due to the constraints. For example, if x_root's x is determined by other variables.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it this way:\n\nAfter building the Union-Find structure, for each node u, x_u can be expressed as x_root * f(u), where f(u) is the product of the factors along the path from the root to u.\n\nTo find x_root, we can choose any value, but since all x_i's must be integers, perhaps x_root must be chosen such that all f(u)'s are integers, and their product with x_root gives an integer.\n\nWait, but since all x_i's are determined up to a multiplicative factor, perhaps the problem can be scaled by choosing x_root as a common factor.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, any valid assignment is acceptable, so perhaps we can set x_root to 1, and then compute all other x_i's as per their f(u)'s.\n\nWait, but let's test this with an example.\n\nSuppose we have two nodes A and B connected by an edge with k=6.\n\nUsing the Union-Find approach:\n\nInitially, A and B are in separate sets.\n\nWe link A to B, with f(A) = 6/(x_B * x_A). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong.\n\nWait, in the Union-Find approach, each node u has a parent p(u) and a value f(u) such that x_u = x_p(u) * f(u).\n\nSo, when we link u and v, we have to ensure that x_u * x_v = k.\n\nSo, suppose u and v are in different sets. We can make v the parent of u, and set f(u) = k / x_v.\n\nBut x_v is not known yet, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the standard approach for solving multiplicative constraints with Union-Find.\n\nUpon recalling, the standard method for this is to use a Union-Find structure where each node has a parent and a weight, which represents the ratio between the node's value and its parent's value.\n\nFor example, for node u, x_u = x_parent(u) * weight(u).\n\nSo, when processing an edge (u, v) with k = x_u * x_v, we can:\n\n1. Find the roots of u and v.\n\n2. If the roots are different, we merge them, setting the weight of the new root based on the weights of u and v.\n\n3. If the roots are the same, we check if x_u * x_v equals k. If not, it's a contradiction.\n\nThis approach is similar to the Union-Find with path compression, but uses multiplicative weights instead of additive ones.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n- For each edge (u, v, k), find the roots of u and v.\n\n- If the roots are different, merge them and set the weights so that the equation holds.\n\n- If the roots are the same, check if x_u * x_v equals k. If not, output \"NO\".\n\nOnce all edges are processed, if no contradictions are found, then we can compute the values for each node relative to the root.\n\nSo, let's model this:\n\nEach node u has a parent p(u) and a weight w(u), such that x_u = x_p(u) * w(u).\n\nThe find function will return the root of u and update the weights along the path to the root.\n\nThe union function will merge two trees, ensuring that the multiplicative constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, the find function:\n\ndef find(u):\n    if parent[u] != u:\n        orig_parent = parent[u]\n        parent[u] = find(parent[u])\n        weight[u] *= weight[orig_parent]\n    return parent[u]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the weight represents the ratio from the node to its parent. So, when path compressing, we need to update the weight to reflect the correct ratio from the node to the new parent.\n\nSo, the find function would adjust the parent pointers and the weights accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, when finding the root of u, we can keep track of the accumulated weight from u to the root, and then update u's parent to point directly to the root, with the weight being the product of the weights along the path.\n\nThis way, subsequent finds for u will be faster.\n\nSo, the find function would be implemented with path compression.\n\nNow, for the union function:\n\nWhen merging u and v, with the constraint x_u * x_v = k.\n\nWe find the roots of u and v.\n\nIf the roots are different:\n\n- Make one the parent of the other.\n\n- Compute the new weight such that the equation holds.\n\nFor example, if root_u becomes the parent of root_v, then x_root_v = x_root_u * (x_v / x_u).\n\nWait, let's think.\n\nWe have:\n\nx_u = w_u * x_p(u)\nx_v = w_v * x_p(v)\n\nWhen we merge u and v, we want x_u * x_v = k.\n\nBut since u and v are now part of the same tree, their x values can be expressed in terms of the new root.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express the equation in terms of the roots.\n\nSo, x_u * x_v = k.\n\nBut x_u = w_u * x_root_u, and x_v = w_v * x_root_v.\n\nSo, w_u * x_root_u * w_v * x_root_v = k.\n\nIf we make root_u the parent of root_v, then x_root_v = x_root_u * (w_v * x_root_v) / (w_u * x_root_u) ?\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, when we merge u and v, we can compute the required weight between the roots.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nx_root_u * x_root_v = (k) / (w_u * w_v).\n\nBecause:\n\nx_u = w_u * x_root_u\nx_v = w_v * x_root_v\nx_u * x_v = (w_u * w_v) * x_root_u * x_root_v = k.\n\nSo, rearranged, x_root_u * x_root_v = k / (w_u * w_v).\n\nIf we make root_u the parent of root_v, then:\n\nx_root_v = x_root_u * (k / (w_u * w_v)).\n\nThus, the weight for root_v is (k) / (w_u * w_v * x_root_u).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weight for root_v is (k) / (w_u * w_v) / x_root_u.\n\nNo, that might not be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should refer to the standard solution for this type of problem.\n\nUpon recalling, the standard way to handle this is:\n\nWhen merging u and v, with the equation x_u * x_v = k:\n\nFind the roots of u and v.\n\nIf they are different, set the parent of one root to the other, and adjust the weight so that the equation holds.\n\nSpecifically, if we make root_v's parent be root_u, then:\n\nx_root_v = (k) / (x_u * x_v / (x_root_u * x_root_v)) )\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to write it as:\n\nx_u = w_u * x_root_u\nx_v = w_v * x_root_v\nx_u * x_v = k\n\nSo, substituting, (w_u * x_root_u) * (w_v * x_root_v) = k\n=> x_root_u * x_root_v = k / (w_u * w_v)\n\nIf we make root_v's parent root_u, then x_root_v = w_v' * x_root_u.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nx_root_u * (w_v' * x_root_u) = k / (w_u * w_v)\n=> w_v' = (k) / (w_u * w_v * x_root_u^2 )\n\nWait, but this introduces a dependency on x_root_u, which is not known until we process all the edges.\n\nThis seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the way to handle it is to represent the equation x_u * x_v = k as a ratio between x_u and x_v.\n\nSo, x_u / x_v = k / x_v^2.\n\nWait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be represented as x_u / x_v = k / x_v^2.\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to represent x_u as proportional to x_v, with the proportionality constant being k / x_v.\n\nBut this brings back the earlier issue of how to manage the proportions when merging.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of it as x_u = (k / x_v) * x_v, but that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio between x_u and x_v is k / x_v^2.\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation x_u * x_v = k can be rewritten as x_u = k / x_v. So, x_u is proportional to 1/x_v.\n\nBut this complicates the Union-Find approach.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the Union-Find approach can't handle this situation, and another method is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system of equations where each equation is x_u = m * x_v, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, because x_u * x_v = k can be rewritten as x_u = k / x_v, which is a nonlinear equation.\n\nSo, perhaps this problem is inherently difficult to model with Union-Find, and a different approach is needed.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find a multiplicative function over the graph's connected components.\n\nEach connected component must form a tree where the product of any two connected variables equals k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each connected component, choose a variable as the root, say x_r. Then, for all other variables in the component, x_i is a multiple of x_r. But this isn't necessarily the case, as variables can be co-prime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, the variables can be expressed as x_i = c_i * r, where r is the root's value, and c_i is a coefficient.\n\nSubstituting into the equation x_u * x_v = k gives (c_u * r) * (c_v * r) = k → c_u * c_v * r^2 = k.\n\nSo, for each edge, c_u * c_v * r^2 = k.\n\nBut this leads to a system where for each edge in the component, the product of the coefficients times r squared equals k.\n\nThis implies that all edges in the component must have the same k divided by r squared.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case unless all edges in the component have the same k.\n\nWait, but in reality, each edge can have a different k, so this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component must have a consistent r such that for all edges in the component, k = c_u * c_v * r^2.\n\nBut again, this requires that all edges in the component have the same product of their c's and r squared.\n\nWhich may not be possible unless all edges are consistent with each other.\n\nSo, perhaps the system is solvable only if for each connected component, all edges in it satisfy that their k's are equal to c_u * c_v * r^2, for some r.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nGiven that x_u * x_v = k for each edge, perhaps the x_i's can be represented as products of certain factors, and the constraints must be consistent across the graph.\n\nBut again, this is not directly helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for examples to understand.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 0\n\nSo, n=1, m=0. So, no edges. So, the number of mushrooms can be any positive integer. So, output YES and assign 1.\n\nSample Output: YES\\n1.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n\nThe road connects 1 and 2, with GCD=1 and LCM=2. So, k=1*2=2.\n\nSo, x_1 * x_2 = 2.\n\nSo, possible solutions are (1,2), (2,1). So, output YES and assign 1 and 2.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n3 2\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2: GCD=1, LCM=2 → k=2.\n\n2-3: GCD=2, LCM=1 → k=2*1=2.\n\nSo, x1*x2=2, x2*x3=2.\n\nSo, x1 = 2/x2.\n\nx3 = 2/x2.\n\nSo, substituting, x1 * x2 * x3 = (2/x2) * x2 * (2/x2) )= 4/(x2) → but this doesn't directly help.\n\nBut, let's think: x1 * x2 = 2 → x1 = 2/x2.\n\nx2 * x3 = 2 → x3 = 2/x2.\n\nSo, x1 = 2/x2, x3=2/x2.\n\nBut all x's must be positive integers. So, x2 must divide 2.\n\nPossible x2 values: 1, 2.\n\nCase 1: x2=1 → x1=2, x3=2.\n\nCheck if all edges are satisfied.\n\nEdge 1-2: x1 * x2 =2 → yes.\n\nEdge 2-3: x2 *x3= 1*2=2 → yes.\n\nSo, valid.\n\nThus, output YES with 2,1,2.\n\nAnother case: x2=2 → x1=1, x3=1.\n\nCheck edges:\n\n1-2: 1*2=2 → yes.\n\n2-3:2*1=2 → yes.\n\nSo, another valid solution.\n\nThus, the answer can be either.\n\nSo, the system can have multiple solutions.\n\nThus, the approach is to model each x_i as a variable, and for each edge, create an equation x_u * x_v =k.\n\nThe problem is to find any assignment of x_i's that satisfies all equations.\n\nThus, the approach is to find such an assignment.\n\nNow, back to the Union-Find approach.\n\nI think that the standard way to handle multiplicative constraints is to use the Union-Find with path compression and maintaining the product of the edge weights.\n\nSo, let's try to implement this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure where each node has a parent and a weight, which represents the ratio between the node's value and its parent's value.\n\nFor each edge (u, v, k):\n\n- Find the roots of u and v.\n\n- If the roots are different, merge them, updating the weights so that the equation x_u * x_v =k is satisfied.\n\n- If the roots are the same, check if x_u * x_v ==k. If not, output \"NO\".\n\nOnce all edges are processed, if no inconsistencies are found, assign a value to the root (say, 1) and compute all x_i's.\n\nWait, but the root's value can be any positive integer. How do we determine it?\n\nBecause the system is underdetermined, but for the purpose of this problem, any valid assignment is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps we can assign the root's value as 1, and then compute all other x_i's as x_root multiplied by their path weights.\n\nBut wait, the root's value is arbitrary. So, perhaps any value would work, but for the sake of the problem, we can choose 1, and then compute the other x_i's.\n\nBut then, the x_i's could be fractions, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but in the Union-Find approach, the weights are such that the x_i's are determined in terms of the root's value.\n\nSo, for example, if the root's x is R, then each x_i is R multiplied by the product of the weights along the path from the root to i.\n\nSo, R must be chosen such that all x_i's are positive integers.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nIn the sample above, when we have two edges (1-2: k=2, 2-3: k=2), the root is 2, and the x's are 2, 1, 1.\n\nSo, R is 2.\n\nWait, but how do we know",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to restore the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given roads and their GCD and LCM values. If possible, we should output any valid arrangement; otherwise, we should indicate that it is impossible.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be modeled as a system of multiplicative constraints where each edge between two lawns (u, v) specifies that the product of the number of mushrooms on these lawns equals the product of their GCD and LCM. This can be efficiently solved using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure with path compression and union by rank, maintaining additional information about the multiplicative relationships between nodes.\n\n1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We use a DSU where each node has a parent and a weight. The weight represents the ratio of the number of mushrooms on the node to the number on its parent.\n2. **Path Compression and Union by Rank**: These optimizations ensure efficient find and union operations, keeping the time complexity nearly linear.\n3. **Processing Each Edge**: For each edge, compute the product of the GCD and LCM. Use the DSU to merge the sets of the two nodes connected by the edge, ensuring the multiplicative constraint is satisfied.\n4. **Consistency Check**: If merging nodes from different sets leads to a contradiction (i.e., the product constraint cannot be satisfied), output \"NO\".\n5. **Compute Mushrooms Count**: After processing all edges, if consistent, compute the number of mushrooms on each lawn relative to a chosen root node, starting with a value of 1 for simplicity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom sys import stdin\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v, g, l = map(int, stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((u-1, v-1, g * l))  #
