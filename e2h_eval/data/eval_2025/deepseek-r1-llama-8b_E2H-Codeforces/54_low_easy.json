Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them (v2) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options, any will do.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to understand what kind of angles can be formed in a regular polygon. Since it's regular, all central angles are equal. The measure of each central angle is 360/n degrees. But when considering the internal angles formed by three vertices, especially in a convex polygon, the angles can vary based on how many steps apart the vertices are.\n\nWait, let me think. For a regular polygon, the internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the angle at each vertex of the polygon. However, when we choose three vertices, the angle formed can be different depending on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), choosing three consecutive vertices would form a 90-degree angle, but if you skip a vertex, maybe you can get a 45-degree angle.\n\nSo the idea is to find all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3) where v2 is between v1 and v3 in the polygon, and calculate the angle at v2. Then find which triplet gives the angle closest to 'a'.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, so the number of triplets is O(n^3), which is manageable because 105^3 is around a million, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut calculating the angle for each triplet might be computationally expensive. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible angles and find the optimal without checking every possible triplet.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the angle at v2 when you have k steps from v1 and m steps from v3 (with k + m = s, the step count in the other direction) can be determined based on the central angles.\n\nWait, the angle at v2 in a regular polygon can be calculated using the formula: angle = 180 - (k * (360/(n))) * 2, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's more about the arcs between the points.\n\nWait, another approach: when you have a regular polygon, the central angles between consecutive vertices are equal. So the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 in both directions. For example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2 and m steps counter-clockwise, then the angle is determined by the arcs between them.\n\nLet me think. The internal angle of a regular polygon is known, but when you pick three points, the angle formed depends on the arc lengths between them.\n\nWait, another thought: in a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. So, for a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the angle at v2 would be half the sum of the central angles of the arcs between v1-v2 and v3-v2.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the polygon is regular, but when you choose points, the angle depends on the arcs opposite to the angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if they are on the same side. Or maybe it's the difference in the arcs.\n\nNo, perhaps I should look up the formula for the angle formed by three points on a circle.\n\nOh right! In a circle, the angle at a point v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. So, if v1 and v3 are two points on either side of v2, then the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that doesn't contain v2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if you have three points on a circle, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for a regular polygon, all the points lie on a circle. So, the angle at v2 is (arc_length(v1 to v3 not passing through v2)) / 2.\n\nSo, for a regular n-gon, each edge corresponds to a central angle of 360/n degrees. So, the arc length between two consecutive vertices is 360/n.\n\nSo, if in the polygon, v1 is k steps away from v2 in one direction, and m steps away in the other direction, then the total steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is (k + m) steps? Or wait, perhaps it's the minimal arc between v1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any valid solution will suffice.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon and Angles**: A regular convex n-gon has all its vertices on a circle. The internal angles at each vertex can vary depending on how the vertices are chosen. The key insight is that the angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, and v3 (with v2 being the vertex of the angle) can be computed using the properties of circles and arcs.\n\n2. **Angle Calculation Using Arcs**: For a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the angle at vertex v2 is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. This arc is the minimal arc between the other two vertices v1 and v3 when viewed from the center of the circle.\n\n3. **Iterative Check for Optimal Angle**: We iterate over all possible triplets of vertices (v1, v2, v3). For each triplet, we calculate the angle at v2 and keep track of the triplet that gives the angle closest to 'a'.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints (n ≤ 105), checking all possible triplets is feasible since the number of triplets is manageable (O(n^3)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_tri = []\n    \n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        for step in range(1, n//2 +1):\n            k = (v2 - step) % n\n            m = (v2 + step) % n\n            \n            # Calculate the angle\n            arc = 2 * step * (360 / n)\n            angle = arc // 2  # Since it's in degrees and integer division\n            \n            # Compute difference\n            diff = abs(angle - a)\n            \n            if diff < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff\n                best_tri = [k, v2, m]\n                # Update the best found\n                # Also check the other way around (since step could be in either direction)\n                # Wait, perhaps not necessary because step covers both directions?\n                # Or maybe step goes from 1 to n//2, so it covers both clockwise and counter-clockwise.\n                # So no need to check again.\n                \n            # Also check the mirror case where step is larger than n//2\n            # Because sometimes the minimal arc is the other way.\n            # So for example, if step is larger than n//2, the arc would be 2*(n - step)*(360/n)\n            # Wait, but since step ranges up to n//2, perhaps it's sufficient.\n            # Hmm, perhaps I should also consider steps beyond n//2.\n            # Alternatively, for each v2, consider all possible steps from 1 to n-1, but that would be O(n^2).\n            # But since n is up to 105, O(n^2) is acceptable.\n            # But in the initial approach, step is only up to n//2, which may miss some cases.\n            # So perhaps we need to adjust the loop to cover all possible steps, but that might not be efficient.\n            # Alternatively, compute the minimal arc and then the corresponding angle.\n            # So perhaps the initial approach is insufficient.\n            # So let's think differently: for each v2, and for each possible pair of points (v1, v3) that are not adjacent to v2, compute the angle.\n            # But that would be O(n^3), which is manageable for n=105.\n            # So perhaps instead of limiting step, just try all possible pairs.\n            # Let me adjust the approach.\n    \n    # Re-evaluate: Instead of limiting step, perhaps for each v2, iterate through all possible pairs of v1 and v3 that are not equal to v2.\n    # But that's O(n^3), which is acceptable for n=105.\n    # So perhaps the initial approach was incorrect because it limited step, potentially missing some angles.\n    \n    # So, correct approach:\n    # For each triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute the angle at v2.\n    # The angle is determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2, divided by 2.\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_tri = []\n    \n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        for v1 in range(1, n+1):\n            if v1 == v2:\n                continue\n            for v3 in range(1, n+1):\n                if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Compute the minimal arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2\n                # The positions are arranged in a circle, so the minimal arc can be found by considering the order\n                # Find the distance from v1 to v2 in one direction, and from v2 to v3 in the same direction\n                # The sum gives the arc length from v1 to v3 not passing through v2\n                # Then, the angle is half of that.\n                \n                # Calculate the number of steps from v1 to v2 in clockwise direction\n                cw1 = (v2 - v1) % n\n                cw2 = (v3 - v2) % n\n                total_steps = cw1 + cw2\n                if total_steps > n/2:\n                    total_steps = n - total_steps\n                angle = (total_steps * 360) // (n * 2)\n                \n                # Calculate the absolute difference\n                diff = abs(angle - a)\n                \n                if diff < best_diff:\n                    best_diff = diff\n                    best_tri = [v1, v2, v3]\n                elif diff == best_diff and (best_tri[0] != v1 or best_tri[1] != v2 or best_tri[2] != v3):\n                    # Choose the one with the smallest indices to ensure uniqueness\n                    # Wait, but how?
