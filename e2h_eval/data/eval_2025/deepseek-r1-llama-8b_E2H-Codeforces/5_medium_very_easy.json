    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot has a color which is a lowercase letter or '?'. Two boots are compatible if they are the same specific color, or one is '?'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about what makes two boots compatible. For a left boot l_i and right boot r_j:\n\n- If l_i is not '?' and r_j is not '?', then they must be the same character.\n- If either is '?', then they are compatible.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that an indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color. So:\n\n- If l_i is '?', it's compatible with any r_j.\n- Similarly, if r_j is '?', it's compatible with any l_i.\n- And when both are specific and same, they are compatible.\n\nSo, for each possible pair (i,j), we need to check if l_i and r_j are compatible.\n\nBut n can be up to 150,000, so checking all possible pairs is O(n²), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible number of pairs? It's min(number of lefts, number of rights) but perhaps less due to color constraints.\n\nSo, the plan is to count how many left and right boots can form compatible pairs, and find a way to match them optimally.\n\nWait, but the order matters because each left can only be paired once, and each right as well.\n\nThis feels like a bipartite graph matching problem, where lefts are on one side and rights on the other. An edge exists between l_i and r_j if they are compatible. We need to find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp won't work because they are O(E√V), and E could be up to (1.5e5)^2 = 2.25e10, which is way too big.\n\nSo, we need a way to model this without explicitly building the graph.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can categorize the left and right boots based on their colors and count how many can be matched in each category.\n\nLet me think: for each possible color c (a-z plus '?'), count the number of lefts with color c and the number of rights with color c or '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because a left with color c can only pair with rights that are c or '?'. Or wait, no: the right can be '?', which would pair with any left, including those with specific colors.\n\nWait, the compatibility rules:\n\n- Left 'a' can pair with right 'a' or '?'.\n- Left '?' can pair with any right.\n\nSo, perhaps for each color c, we can compute how many lefts have color c and how many rights have color c or '?'.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: for each right boot, determine how many lefts are compatible with it, and select the best possible.\n\nBut again, that's O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nAlternative idea: group the lefts and rights by their color categories, and then compute how many can be matched in each possible way.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Let's create a frequency map for lefts and rights.\n\nThen, for each possible color c, the number of lefts with c is L_c, and the number of rights with c is R_c, and the number of rights with '?' is R_q.\n\nWait, but the right '?' can pair with any left. So, perhaps we can process the specific colors first and then handle the '?' separately.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Precompute for each color c, the number of lefts with c (L[c]) and the number of rights with c (R[c]).\n\n2. Then, calculate the number of pairs that can be formed from specific colors, i.e., for each c, the minimum of L[c] and R[c]. Sum all these min values, that's the base number of pairs.\n\n3. Then, for the remaining lefts and rights (after subtracting the specific pairs), consider the '?' cases.\n\n4. The lefts that are '?', can be paired with any rights that are not yet paired.\n\nSimilarly, rights that are '?', can be paired with any lefts that are not yet paired.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Compute the number of pairs from specific colors.\n\n- For the remaining lefts and rights, add the number of pairs possible by pairing '?' with any.\n\nWait, but how to count the remaining.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nTotal possible pairs is equal to:\n\nsum over c (min(L[c], R[c])) + (number of left ?) * (number of right ?) \n\nWait, no. Because the left ? can pair with any right, including those that are specific. But after pairing the specific ones, the remaining rights can be paired with left ?.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because some rights may have been used in specific pairings, others not.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong because the '?' can be used in multiple ways.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach right that is a specific color c can only pair with lefts that are c or ?. Wait, no. Because for a right with c, the left must have c or ?, right? No, wait: the right's color is c, and the left's color can be c (compatible) or ? (compatible). So, for a right with c, it can pair with lefts that are c or ?.\n\nBut when considering all rights, some may be c, others may be ?.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe total number of pairs is:\n\nsum for each c: min(lefts[c], rights[c]) → this gives the number of pairs between specific c.\n\nPlus, the number of lefts that are ? and the number of rights that are ? → since each can pair with each other.\n\nWait, no. Because after using some rights in the specific c pairs, the remaining rights can also be paired with the left ?.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the left ? can pair with any right, regardless of whether the right is specific or ?.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial sum for specific c is not sufficient, because for some c, the lefts and rights may overlap with other colors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of it as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right nodes if they are compatible.\n\nWe need to find a maximum matching in this graph.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, standard maximum matching algorithms are too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: model this as a flow problem, but again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where each left and right is a node, and edges represent compatibility. Then, finding the maximum matching in this graph would give the solution.\n\nBut again, with 3e5 nodes, it's impossible to process.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a way to count the maximum possible pairs without explicitly building the graph.\n\nAnother approach: since each pair is a left and a right, and each can be used once, perhaps we can sort the lefts and rights in a way that allows us to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, maybe we can model it as a greedy algorithm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about all possible lefts and rights:\n\nFor each left boot, we can list the possible right boots it can pair with.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot, the possible lefts.\n\nBut again, this seems too slow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each left, the number of rights it can pair with is equal to the number of rights that are either its own color or '?'.\n\nSo, for left i, the count is R[l_i] + R['?'], where R[c] is the number of rights with color c.\n\nBut that's just the count, not the actual selection.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Pairs where both are specific colors.\n\n2. Pairs where at least one is a '?'.\n\nBecause when both are specific, they must match exactly. When one is '?', they can match anything.\n\nSo, let's first compute the maximum number of specific pairs.\n\nFor each color c, the number of lefts with c is L[c], and the number of rights with c is R[c]. The number of pairs contributed by c is the minimum of L[c] and R[c].\n\nSumming this over all c gives the number of specific pairs.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a right with color c can be paired with a left with color c or a left with '?'. But in our current approach, we're pairing lefts with c only with rights with c. The lefts with '?' are considered in the next step.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each c, min(L[c], R[c]) → specific pairs.\n\nPlus the number of lefts that are '?' multiplied by the number of rights that are not yet matched, but only if they can pair with them.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after handling the specific pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can be matched as follows:\n\nThe remaining lefts are those that couldn't find a specific right. These can be either '?', or specific colors that didn't have enough rights.\n\nThe remaining rights are those that couldn't find a specific left. These can be either '?', or specific colors that didn't have enough lefts.\n\nSo, for the remaining lefts and rights:\n\n- The lefts that are '?' can pair with any remaining rights.\n\n- The lefts that are specific colors can only pair with the remaining rights that have the same color.\n\nWait, no. Because a left with color c can only pair with rights that have color c or '?'. But since we already handled specific c, perhaps the remaining rights are those that couldn't find a left of their specific color. So, for a left with color d, the remaining rights that can be paired with it are those that are d or '?'.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's count the number of lefts and rights that are '?'. Let Q_l be the number of lefts with '?', and Q_r the number of rights with '?'. \n\nThen, the total pairs from specific colors is S = sum(min(L[c], R[c])) for all c.\n\nThen, the remaining lefts are (total_lefts - S), but wait no: some lefts may have been used in S.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each c, min(L[c], R[c]) is the number of pairs taken from lefts with c and rights with c. So, the remaining lefts are the ones that couldn't find a specific right. Similarly, the remaining rights are those that couldn't find a specific left.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts can be:\n\nLefts that are '?': any of them can pair with any remaining right.\n\nLefts that are specific: they can only pair with remaining rights that have the same color.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining rights can be:\n\nRights that are '?': can pair with any left.\n\nRights that are specific: can only pair with lefts that have the same color.\n\nSo, the total additional pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each c, the number of lefts with c that couldn't find a specific right (i.e., L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])), multiplied by the number of rights with c that couldn't find a specific left (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])). Wait, no. Because for each c, the lefts that are c and couldn't find a right can only pair with the remaining rights that are c or '?'.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as:\n\nAfter handling the specific pairs:\n\nFor each color c, the number of lefts that are c and not paired is L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nSimilarly, the number of rights that are c and not paired is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nThese lefts can only pair with rights that are c or '?'.\n\nBut the rights that are c and unpaired can only pair with lefts that are c or '?'.\n\nWait, but the '?' rights can pair with any lefts.\n\nSo, the additional pairs can be computed as:\n\nFor each color c:\n\nadd min( (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])), (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) ) → no, because that's zero if either is negative.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the lefts that are c and unpaired can pair with rights that are c or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, the rights that are c and unpaired can pair with lefts that are c or '?'.\n\nSo, for each c, the number of additional pairs is the number of unpaired lefts with c multiplied by the number of unpaired rights with c plus the number of unpaired lefts with c multiplied by the number of unpaired rights with '?'.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right.\n\nAlternatively, the additional pairs can be calculated as:\n\nleft_remaining = sum over c (max(0, L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))) → but only for lefts that are specific.\n\nright_remaining = sum over c (max(0, R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))) → only for rights that are specific.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the right_remaining includes all rights that are specific and couldn't find a left.\n\nNow, for these left_remaining and right_remaining:\n\nEach left in left_remaining can only pair with rights that are the same color or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, each right in right_remaining can only pair with lefts of the same color or '?'.\n\nAnd the '?' rights can pair with any left.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nleft_remaining is the number of lefts that are specific and couldn't find a specific right.\n\nSimilarly, right_remaining is the number of rights that are specific and couldn't find a specific left.\n\nAdditionally, Q_l is the number of lefts that are '?'.\n\nQ_r is the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs can be:\n\n1. Pairs between lefts that are specific (in left_remaining) and rights that are specific (in right_remaining) and have the same color.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if a left is c and in left_remaining, it means that all R[c] rights have been used in specific pairs. So, the right_remaining for c is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because R[c] is the total number of rights with c. So, min(L[c], R[c]) is the number of specific pairs for c. So, for the left_remaining for c, it's L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]), which could be positive only if L[c] > R[c].\n\nIn that case, the lefts that are c and couldn't find a right are L[c] - R[c]. These can't pair with any other rights except those that are '?'. Because their color is c, and the right must be c or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, the rights that are c and couldn't find a left are R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]). But if R[c] < L[c], then R[c] - min is zero. So, the left_remaining for c is non-zero only if L[c] > R[c].\n\nSo, for each c, the number of lefts in left_remaining is max(0, L[c] - R[c]).\n\nThese lefts can only pair with rights that are c or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, the number of rights in right_remaining is max(0, R[c] - L[c]).\n\nWait, no. Because R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]) is zero if R[c] <= L[c]. So, right_remaining for c is zero in that case.\n\nWait, perhaps right_remaining is the sum over c of max(0, R[c] - L[c]).\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe it's better to model the problem in terms of counts:\n\nCompute for each color c:\n\n- L[c] = number of lefts with color c.\n\n- R[c] = number of rights with color c.\n\nCompute S = sum over c min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nThen, the remaining lefts are:\n\nfor each c, L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]) → which is L[c] - R[c] if L[c] > R[c], else zero.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining rights are R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]) → which is R[c] - L[c] if R[c] > L[c], else zero.\n\nBut these remaining lefts and rights can only form pairs if the right's color is c or '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the additional pairs come from the following:\n\nFor each c, the remaining lefts (which are c) can be paired with the remaining rights that are c or '?'.\n\nWait, but the remaining rights that are c can only pair with lefts that are c or '?'.\n\nBut the remaining rights that are c are (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) → which is R[c] - L[c] if R[c] > L[c], else zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the additional pairs as:\n\nadditional = 0\n\nfor each c in colors:\n\n   add_pairs = min( (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])), (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) )\n\n   additional += add_pairs\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional pairs can be found as:\n\nThe number of lefts that are '?' plus the number of rights that are '?' minus the number of specific pairs that could have overlapped.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, after computing S, the number of specific pairs, the remaining lefts are (total_lefts - S) and the remaining rights are (total_rights - S).\n\nWait, no. Because S is the sum of min(L[c], R[c]), which is the number of specific pairs.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: the total possible specific pairs is S, which uses up some lefts and rights.\n\nThe remaining lefts are the ones not used in S: these can be either '?', or specific colors where L[c] > R[c].\n\nSimilarly, the remaining rights are the ones not used in S: specific colors where R[c] > L[c], and the '?' rights.\n\nSo, the additional pairs can be formed as:\n\nthe number of lefts that are '?': Q_l.\n\nplus the number of rights that are '?': Q_r.\n\nBut since each can pair with any, the maximum possible is min(Q_l, Q_r).\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate because some lefts that are specific might still be able to pair with rights that are '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps after S is computed, the remaining lefts and rights can be processed as follows:\n\nThe remaining lefts are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum over c (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))\n\nWhich is the number of lefts that are specific and couldn't find a right of the same color.\n\nThe remaining rights are:\n\nright_remaining = sum over c (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))\n\nWhich is the number of rights that are specific and couldn't find a left of the same color.\n\nAdditionally, there are Q_l lefts that are '?' and Q_r rights that are '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs can be:\n\nleft_remaining can pair with rights that are their color or '?'\n\nBut wait, the left_remaining are specific colors. So, for a left with color c, it can pair with rights that are c or '?'.\n\nBut the remaining rights that are c have already been considered in S and right_remaining.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right if they are compatible. Then, the maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, this is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a flow problem where we can compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that each left can connect to certain rights, and vice versa.\n\nBut even then, it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the '?' can pair with any, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of specific pairs plus the minimum between the number of '?' on left and '?' on right, plus the number of specific pairs that can be made between lefts that are '?' and rights that are specific.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem can be thought of as a bipartitioned graph where each left can connect to all compatible rights. The maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut given the size, we need an O(n) approach.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to compute:\n\nThe maximum possible pairs is S + T, where S is the number of specific pairs, and T is the number of pairs between lefts and rights that are '?'.\n\nBut that's not correct, because some specific lefts can pair with '?' rights.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is S plus the number of lefts that are '?' multiplied by the number of rights that are '?', but that's not right because some specific lefts can pair with '?' rights.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = S + (number of lefts that are '?' + number of rights that are '?') → but no, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right if they are compatible. The maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, it's impossible to compute directly.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model it as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible, and then find the maximum matching. But again, it's impossible with n=1.5e5.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to realize that the maximum matching is S plus the number of lefts that are '?' plus the number of rights that are '?' minus the number of specific pairs that could have used a '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is S plus the minimum of Q_l and Q_r plus the number of lefts that are specific and couldn't be paired, multiplied by the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute S as before.\n\nThen, the number of additional pairs is the number of lefts that are '?', plus the number of rights that are '?', but subtract the overlapping pairs where a left is specific and a right is '?'.\n\nWait, no.\n\nAlternatively, the additional pairs can be formed as:\n\nlefts_remaining = (number of lefts that are '?') + (number of lefts that are specific and couldn't be paired in S)\n\nrights_remaining = (number of rights that are '?') + (number of rights that are specific and couldn't be paired in S)\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the '?' can pair with any, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is S plus the number of '?' lefts plus the number of '?' rights, but that's not correct because some of the '?' lefts could have been used in S.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in S, some lefts are specific and some are '?'. So, the '?' lefts are separate.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to think of an example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces → each character is a specific color.\n\nr = dodivthree → each character is a specific color.\n\nIn this case, S is the sum of min(l_counts, r_counts) for each color.\n\nBut in the sample output, the maximum pairs is 5.\n\nSo, perhaps after computing S, the additional pairs are limited.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum pairs is S plus the number of lefts that are '?' plus the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nBut that doesn't hold because in the first sample, there are no '?' lefts or rights, so the maximum is S.\n\nAnother example: suppose l has one '?', and r has one '?'. Then, S is zero, and the additional pair is 1.\n\nIf l has one 'a' and r has one '?', then S is zero, and the pair is (l's a, r's ?) is allowed because r is '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(L[c], R[c]) for all c.\n\nCompute Ql = number of lefts that are '?'.\n\nCompute Qr = number of rights that are '?'.\n\nCompute additional pairs as min(Ql, Qr).\n\nThen, the total is S + additional.\n\nBut in the previous example where l is 'a' and r is '?', S is zero, Ql is zero, Qr is 1. So, additional is zero, but the pair is allowed. So, the approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, so that's a problem.\n\nSo, that approach misses some cases.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe additional pairs are:\n\nnumber of lefts that are '?' + number of rights that are '?' + sum for each color c of min( (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])), (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the additional pairs can be the number of lefts that are '?', plus the number of rights that are '?', plus the sum over c of min( (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])), (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) ) ?\n\nNo, that would double count.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute S = sum min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nCompute the remaining lefts that are not in S: these are lefts that are either '?', or specific colors where L[c] > R[c].\n\nCompute the remaining rights that are not in S: these are rights that are either '?', or specific colors where R[c] > L[c].\n\nThen, the additional pairs are the number of '?' on left plus the number of '?' on right, plus the number of specific lefts (where L[c] > R[c]) multiplied by the number of '?' on right.\n\nWait, but that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, the additional pairs can be:\n\nleft_remaining = (number of lefts that are '?') + sum over c (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))\n\nright_remaining = (number of rights that are '?') + sum over c (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))\n\nBut that's the same as (Ql + sum (L[c] - min)) + (Qr + sum (R[c] - min)).\n\nWait, no, because sum (L[c] - min) is the same as sum (R[c] - min) because for each c, L[c] - min is either zero or equal to R[c] - min.\n\nWait, yes, because min(L[c], R[c]) is either L[c] or R[c]. So, if L[c] >= R[c], then L[c] - min is L[c] - R[c], and R[c] - min is zero. Else, it's zero.\n\nSo, sum over c (L[c] - min) = sum over c (R[c] - min) = sum over c (max(0, L[c]-R[c])).\n\nSo, the remaining lefts are:\n\nleft_remaining = Ql + sum (max(0, L[c] - R[c]))\n\nThe remaining rights are:\n\nright_remaining = Qr + sum (max(0, R[c] - L[c]))\n\nBut now, how to find the maximum possible pairs from left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nBecause the left_remaining can be:\n\n- '?': can pair with any right_remaining.\n\n- Specific: can only pair with rights that are same color or '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum additional pairs would be:\n\nthe number of '?' on left (Ql) multiplied by the number of '?' on right (Qr).\n\nPlus the sum over c of min( (number of lefts with c in left_remaining), (number of rights with c in right_remaining) )\n\nWait, but the left_remaining for color c is (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) → which is L[c] - R[c] if L[c] > R[c], else 0.\n\nSimilarly, the right_remaining for color c is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]) → which is R[c] - L[c] if R[c] > L[c], else 0.\n\nSo, for each color c:\n\nif L[c] > R[c], then left_remaining[c] = L[c] - R[c]\n\nright_remaining[c] = 0.\n\nso, for such c, the additional pairs is min(left_remaining[c], right_remaining[c]) → which is zero.\n\nElse, if R[c] > L[c], then left_remaining[c] is zero, right_remaining[c] is R[c] - L[c], but no lefts are available, so no pairs.\n\nElse, both are zero.\n\nSo, for each color c, the additional pairs from specific lefts and specific rights is zero.\n\nTherefore, the only possible additional pairs are:\n\nQl * Qr → the number of pairs between left '?' and right '?'.\n\nPlus the number of pairs where a specific left (not in S) is paired with a right that is '?'.\n\nWait, but the right that is '?' can be paired with any left, including those that are specific.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, the left_remaining includes specific lefts that couldn't find a right of their color.\n\nSo, for these lefts, they can be paired with any right, including those that are '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs are:\n\nnumber of lefts in left_remaining (including specific lefts) multiplied by number of rights in right_remaining (including '?') ?\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nBecause the left_remaining includes lefts that are specific, and they can only pair with rights that are same color or '?'. But the right_remaining includes rights that are '?', which can pair with any left.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe additional pairs are:\n\nA: the number of lefts that are '?' multiplied by the number of rights that are '?' → because each can pair with each other.\n\nB: the number of lefts that are specific and in left_remaining multiplied by the number of rights that are '?'. Because these lefts can't pair with any specific rights, but can pair with '?' rights.\n\nC: the number of rights that are specific and in right_remaining multiplied by the number of lefts that are '?'. Because these rights can't pair with any specific lefts, but can pair with '?' lefts.\n\nWait, but this may lead to double-counting.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because A is left ? and right ?, B is left specific and right ?, C is right specific and left ?.\n\nBut when a left is specific and in left_remaining, and a right is '?', they can form a pair.\n\nSimilarly, a right is specific and in right_remaining can pair with a left that is '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs would be:\n\nA + B + C.\n\nBut how to compute B and C.\n\nWait, perhaps B is the number of lefts that are specific and in left_remaining multiplied by the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nSimilarly, C is the number of rights that are specific and in right_remaining multiplied by the number of lefts that are '?'.\n\nBut then, adding A, B, C gives the total additional pairs.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute S.\n\nCompute Ql, Qr.\n\nCompute left_remaining = Ql + sum (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])).\n\nCompute right_remaining = Qr + sum (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])).\n\nCompute A = Ql * Qr.\n\nCompute B = (sum (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))) * Qr.\n\nCompute C = (sum (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]))) * Ql.\n\nBut wait, because:\n\n- sum (L[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) is the number of specific lefts that couldn't find a specific right.\n\nEach of these can pair with any right that is '?'.\n\nSimilarly, sum (R[c] - min(L[c], R[c])) is the number of specific rights that couldn't find a specific left.\n\nEach of these can pair with any left that is '?'.\n\nSo, the additional pairs are A + B + C.\n\nSo, the total maximum pairs is S + A + B + C.\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nLet's test it against some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nn=1\n\nl='a'\n\nr='b'\n\nS=0.\n\nQl=0, Qr=0.\n\nleft_remaining=0+0=0.\n\nright_remaining=0+0=0.\n\nA=0*0=0.\n\nB=0*0=0.\n\nC=0*0=0.\n\nTotal pairs=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=1.\n\nl='?'\n\nr='c'.\n\nS=0.\n\nQl=1.\n\nQr=0.\n\nleft_remaining=1+0=1.\n\nright_remaining=0+0=0.\n\nA=1*0=0.\n\nB=0 * 0 =0.\n\nC=0 *1=0.\n\nWait, but the pair (l=1, r=1) is allowed because l is '?'.\n\nSo, the total should be 1.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's S + A + B + C = 0 +0 +0 +0=0. Which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the formula is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the approach.\n\nIn this example, the right is 'c', which is a specific color.\n\nThe left is '?', which can pair with any right.\n\nSo, the pair is allowed, but the formula didn't count it.\n\nBecause in the formula, A is Ql * Qr = 1*0=0.\n\nB is (sum L[c]-min) * Qr = 0 *0=0.\n\nC is (sum R[c]-min)* Ql = 0 *1=0.\n\nSo, total is zero.\n\nBut the correct answer is 1.\n\nSo, the formula is missing this case.\n\nAh, so perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, what's the issue here.\n\nIn this case, the right is not a '?', but the left is '?', which can pair with any right, including specific ones.\n\nSo, the pair is allowed.\n\nSo, in the formula, S is 0, because the left is '?', but the right is 'c', which requires that the left is 'c' or '?'.\n\nSo, in S, the left is '?', but the right is 'c', which is specific.\n\nSo, the pair is allowed, but in the formula, it's not being counted.\n\nThus, the approach is missing these cases.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative Idea: The maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each left that is '?', the number of rights it can pair with.\n\nBut how to count this.\n\nBut again, with n=1e5, it's impossible to process each individually.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem needs to be modeled as a bipartite graph, but with a way to count edges quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is specific (S).\n\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is '?'.\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?' and right is specific.\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?' and right is '?'.\n\nSo, the total is S + (A) + (B) + (C).\n\nWhere:\n\nA: number of specific lefts paired with '?' rights.\n\nB: number of '?' lefts paired with specific rights.\n\nC: number of '?' lefts paired with '?' rights.\n\nBut how to compute A and B.\n\nHmm.\n\nTo compute A:\n\nFor each color c, the number of lefts with c is L[c].\n\nThe number of rights with '?' is Qr.\n\nSo, the maximum possible A is min( sum L[c], Qr ).\n\nBut wait, no. Because each left can be paired only once.\n\nWait, but perhaps:\n\nA is the minimum of (sum L[c]) and Qr, but also considering that some lefts are already used in S.\n\nWait, this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps, it's better to model the problem as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\nS (specific pairs) + (number of lefts that are '?') × (number of rights that are '?') + (number of lefts that are '?') × (number of rights that are not '?') + (number of rights that are '?') × (number of lefts that are not '?') - S.\n\nWait, that's not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = S + (Ql × Qr) + (Ql × (total_rights - S - Qr)) + ((total_lefts - S - Ql) × Qr).\n\nBut that's also unclear.\n\nI think I'm stuck trying to find a mathematical formula.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's precompute for each left and right whether they are compatible and then model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are compatible pairs, and then find the maximum matching.\n\nBut with n=1.5e5, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the bipartition can be represented as two sets, and the edges can be determined by certain properties that can be processed quickly.\n\nFor example, for each left, the compatible rights are those that are same color or '?'.\n\nSo, for each left, the compatible rights are a subset of the entire set.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to find the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to counting:\n\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is same.\n\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is '?'.\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?' and right is specific.\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?' and right is '?'.\n\nBut then, each of these needs to be maximized without overlapping.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nCompute S = sum min",
