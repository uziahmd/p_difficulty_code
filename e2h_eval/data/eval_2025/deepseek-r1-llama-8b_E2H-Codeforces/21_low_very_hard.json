The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Neko finding treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible by using the keys in a way that a_i + b_j is odd. So, for a key j and chest i, if one is even and the other is odd, their sum is odd.\n\nHmm, wait, because adding two evens gives even, two odds give even too. Only even and odd sums are odd. So, the condition a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2 means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, for each key, it can only unlock chests of the opposite parity. That is, a key with an even number can only unlock chests with odd numbers, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that we need to separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly, the keys should be split into even and odd.\n\nThen, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the number of keys of even parity and the number of chests with odd parity plus the minimum of the number of keys of odd parity and the number of chests with even parity.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can only be used once, and each chest can only be opened once. So, the approach is:\n\n- Count how many keys are even (let's call this E) and how many are odd (O).\n- Count how many chests are even (C_even) and how many are odd (C_odd).\n- Then, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of E and C_odd, and O and C_even.\nBecause, for each even key, you can match it with an odd chest, and each odd key with an even chest.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the list of a's and count how many are even and odd.\n3. Read the list of b's and count how many are even and odd.\n4. Compute the maximum possible as min(E, C_odd) + min(O, C_even).\n\nThat's the plan. But wait, let me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo a = [9,14,6,2,11]\na_i values: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\nSo C_odd is 2, C_even is 3.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n8 is even, 4 even,7 odd,20 even.\nSo E = 3 (8,4,20), O=1 (7).\n\nSo the maximum would be min(3, 2) + min(1,3) = 2+1=3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n5 1\n2 4 6 8 10\n5\n\na is all even (5 chests). So C_even=5, C_odd=0.\n\nb has 5, which is odd. So E=0, O=1.\n\nSo the max is min(0,0) + min(1,5) =0+1=1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput:\n1 4\n10\n20 30 40 50\n\na is 10, even. C_even=1, C_odd=0.\n\nb has all even (20,30,40,50): E=4, O=0.\n\nSo min(E, C_odd) is min(4,0)=0. min(O, C_even)=min(0,1)=0. Total 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works for these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all keys are even and all chests are even.\n\nThen, since a_i is even and b_j is even, their sum is even, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So no chests can be opened.\n\nAnother case: all keys are even, some chests are even and some are odd.\n\nWe can use the even keys on the odd chests. So the number of even keys determines how many odd chests can be opened.\n\nAnd any odd keys? Well, if any, they can't be used on anything because the chests have even a_i. So they're unused.\n\nSimilarly, if all keys are odd, then they can be used on even chests.\n\nWhat if there are more keys than needed? For example, E=10, C_odd=5. Then we can only use 5 even keys on 5 odd chests. The remaining 5 even keys can't be used",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, we count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and the keys. This helps us determine how many keys can potentially unlock each type of chest.\n2. **Match Keys to Chests**: For each key, it can either be used to unlock an even or an odd chest. We calculate the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by considering the minimum of the available keys of each parity and the chests of the opposite parity.\n3. **Sum the Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the maximum possible matches for each parity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    # Count a's even and odd\n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a += 1\n        else:\n            odd_a += 1\n    \n    # Count b's even and odd\n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b += 1\n        else:\n            odd_b += 1\n    \n    # Calculate max possible\n    max_even_odd = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    max_odd_even = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    total = max_even_odd + max_odd_even\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests, keys, and their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Matching Keys and Chests**: Using the counts from the previous step, we determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by matching even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is the sum of these two matchings, which gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we maximize the number of chests opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.",
