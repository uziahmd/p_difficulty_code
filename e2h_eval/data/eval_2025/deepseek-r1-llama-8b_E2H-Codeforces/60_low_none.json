Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain sequences after each modification to a string S. Hmm. So each character added to S is either a '0' or '1', representing a dot or dash. After each addition, I need to find the number of non-empty substrings that correspond to a valid English letter's Morse code representation.\n\nWait, but Morse code letters are represented as unique strings of 1-4 characters, except four specific invalid ones. So any substring of S that matches one of these valid codes contributes to the count.\n\nSo, for each step, after adding a new character, I need to consider all possible substrings ending at that position and see how many are valid Morse codes.\n\nHmm. How can I model this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe for each position i, I can track some state that represents the possible endings of valid Morse code sequences.\n\nFor example, when processing each new character, I can look back at previous characters and see what new substrings ending here are valid.\n\nBut considering that Morse code letters are up to 4 characters long, I can represent the current state as the last k characters, where k ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I can keep a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid sequences ending at position i with a length of i - j + 1 (where j is the starting position). Or maybe more precisely, for each position, track the count of valid sequences that end there and have lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nAlternatively, since each valid Morse code is exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters long, I can represent the state as the last few characters that form a prefix of a valid Morse code. For example, for each new character, I can check if adding it to the current state forms a valid code of length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, that's an interesting approach. Let's say I have a variable that keeps track of the current suffix of the string S. For example, after adding a new character, the suffix could be up to 4 characters long. If adding this new character completes a valid Morse code, then we can add to the total count.\n\nWait, but the total count isn't just the sum of all such completed codes. Because longer sequences can be formed by combining multiple valid codes.\n\nNo, wait no. Because a substring can be any length, as long as it's a valid Morse code. So for example, if S is \"111\", the substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", which are all valid, contributing to the count. Also, any longer substring beyond 4 is not considered because Morse code only goes up to 4.\n\nSo, for each new character, I need to consider all possible substrings ending at this new character that are valid Morse codes. Each such substring adds 1 to the total count.\n\nBut considering all possible substrings each time would be O(n^2) for each step, which would be too slow for m=3000 steps. So I need a way to compute this in O(1) per step, using some state tracking.\n\nHmm. So let's think of the problem as, after each step, the total number of valid Morse code substrings is the sum over all possible valid substrings ending at the current position.\n\nEach valid substring is a sequence of 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters that forms a valid Morse code.\n\nSo, for each new character, I can look back 1, 2, 3, or 4 steps and check if the substring of that length is a valid Morse code. If so, add the count accordingly.\n\nWait, but that's manageable because each step can only add up to 4 new valid substrings (for lengths 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nSo, perhaps for each position i, I can track the maximum possible valid length ending at i. For example, if the current character is '1', I can check if the substring of length 1 is valid. Then, check if the substring of length 2 (current plus previous) is valid. And so on up to 4.\n\nBut how do I efficiently track whether a substring of length k ending at i is a valid Morse code?\n\nIdea: Precompute all valid Morse code strings. Since there are 26 letters, each with a unique code, and excluding four invalid strings, the total valid is 26*4 = 104? Wait, no. Wait, each code is unique except for those four. Wait, the problem says that each string of length 1-4 is a possible Morse code, except those four. So the number of valid codes is 30-4=26? Yes, because 2^1 + 2^2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty substrings of a given string that correspond to valid Morse code representations after each modification. The solution involves using dynamic programming to efficiently track valid Morse code sequences as the string grows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: Identify all valid Morse code strings of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4. These are the valid English letters' Morse code representations.\n2. **Dynamic Programming with State Tracking**: Use a dynamic programming array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid Morse code sequences ending at position `i`. Track the last few characters (up to 4) to check if they form a valid Morse code when a new character is added.\n3. **Iterative Checking**: For each new character added to the string, check the substrings ending at this character of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4. If any of these substrings match a valid Morse code, update the count of valid sequences.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse codes\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0': ['0'],\n    '1': ['1'],\n    '00': ['00'],\n    '01': ['01'],\n    '10': ['10'],\n    '11': ['11'],\n    '000': ['000'],\n    '001': ['001'],\n    '010': ['010'],\n    '011': ['011'],\n    '100': ['100'],\n    '101': ['101'],\n    '110': ['110'],\n    '111': ['111'],\n}\n\n# List of all valid codes for quick lookup\nvalid_list = []\nfor s in valid_codes.values():\n    valid_list += list(s)\n\nm = int(input())\ncurrent = []\ntotal = 0\ndp = [0] * 5  # dp[i] represents the count ending at position i, considering up to i-1 steps back\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    current.append(c)\n    # Check all possible substrings ending at this position with lengths 1,2,3,4\n    max_len = min(4, len(current))\n    for l in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        substr = ''.join(current[-l:])\n        if substr in valid_list:\n            if l <= 4:\n                dp[l] = (dp[l] + dp[l-1]) % MOD\n            else:\n                dp[4] = (dp[4] + dp[3]) % MOD\n    # Update total\n    total = (total + sum(dp)) % MOD\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: We first identify all valid Morse code strings and store them in a set for quick lookup.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position, considering the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each new character added, we check all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring matches a valid Morse code, we update the `dp` array accordingly.\n4. **Update Total Count**: The total number of valid sequences is updated by summing the values in the `dp` array after each modification, ensuring the result is modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences using dynamic programming, ensuring the solution is optimal and handles up to 3000 modifications efficiently.",
