A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends wanting to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some amount of drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make, given the constraints on the available resources.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. All positive integers, not exceeding 1000.\n\nWait, what do these variables represent?\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles of drink. Each bottle has l milliliters.\nSo total drink is k * l ml.\n\nc: number of limes. Each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices are c * d.\n\np: grams of salt available.\n\nEach toast requires:\n- nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, all n friends need n * nl ml in total.\nWait, no, wait. The problem says, \"each friend needs nl milliliters\". So for one toast round, each of the n friends takes one nl. So total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires each friend to have one slice of lime. So total slices needed per toast is n * 1 = n slices.\n\nSalt: each friend uses np grams per toast. So per toast, total salt used is n * np grams.\n\nSo, the maximum number of toasts possible is limited by three factors:\n\n1. How much drink is available divided by (n * nl).\n2. How many lime slices are available divided by n.\n3. How much salt is available divided by (n * np).\n\nThen, the minimum of these three values will be the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the problem asks for the number of toasts each friend can make. So for each toast, each friend makes one. So the total toasts possible is t, and each friend can do t.\n\nBut how do we compute t? It's the minimum of (total_drink / (n * nl)), (total_lime_slices / n), (total_salt / (n * np)).\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l.\n   Then, drinks_per_toast = n * nl.\n   So max_toasts_from_drink = total_drink // drinks_per_toast.\n\n2. Calculate total_lime_slices = c * d.\n   Each toast needs n slices. So max_toasts_from_lime = total_lime_slices // n.\n\n3. Calculate total_salt = p.\n   Each toast uses n * np grams. So max_toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but wait: since all three must be satisfied, we take the minimum.\n\nOnce we have that t, then each friend can make t toasts.\n\nSo, for each test case, compute these three, find the min, and output that.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20ml\ndrinks_per_toast = 3 *3=9ml. 20/9 is 2.222, so integer division gives 2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices =10*8=80\neach toast needs 3 slices. 80/3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts.\n\nsalt: 100g. Each toast uses 3*1=3g. 100/3 is 33.333, so 33 toasts.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nWait, let's parse the second input line correctly. Wait, the sample input has multiple lines, but according to the note, the input is a single line. Oh right, the initial description shows that the sample input is a list, but probably, it's a single line with all the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is like:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that would be three separate test cases. So the code should read each line as a separate input.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"the first and only line\" contains the integers. So maybe the sample is written as three lines, but in reality, it's just one line with all 8 numbers.\n\nWait, the note says that the sample input is ['3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n2. **Compute Resource Requirements per Toast**: Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource per friend.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts from Each Resource**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on each resource alone.\n4. **Find the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the resource that allows the fewest toasts. This is found by taking the minimum value from the three calculated toast limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input line as a list of integers\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = data\n    \n    # Total resources calculation\n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Compute the required per toast for each resource\n    required_drink_per_toast = n * nl\n    required_lime_per_toast = n\n    required_salt_per_toast = n * np\n    \n    # Calculate how many toasts each resource allows\n    max_drinks = total_drink // required_drink_per_toast\n    max_limes = total_lime // required_lime_per_toast\n    max_salt = total_salt // required_salt_per_toast\n    \n    # The limiting factor is the smallest of these\n    max_toasts = min(max_drinks, max_limes, max_salt)\n    \n    print(max_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the given parameters.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt are computed by multiplying their respective quantities.\n- **Resource Requirements per Toast**: For each resource, the amount needed per toast (per friend) is calculated.\n- **Maximum Toasts Calculation**: Using integer division, the maximum number of toasts each resource can support is determined.\n- **Limiting Factor**: The smallest value among the maximum possible toasts from each resource determines the actual number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while considering all constraints.",
