Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if the pile of letters found in the morning can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. That means all the letters from the guest and host should be present in the pile, and no extra letters should be there.\n\nHmm, how to approach this? Well, I think the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Combine the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n2. Count the frequency of each character in this combined string.\n3. Do the same for the pile of letters.\n4. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they match exactly, output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, right. So the first thing I need to do is read the three lines of input: guest, host, and pile. Then process them.\n\nSo, let's think about the structure. In Python, I can read the three lines using input().strip(), but wait, the sample input shows that each line is a separate string, like ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', ...]. So I'll read each line separately.\n\nOnce I have the three strings, I can concatenate guest + host to get all the required letters. Then, compare the counts with the pile.\n\nTo count the letters, I can use a dictionary or a Counter from the collections module. Oh right, using Counter would make this easier. So import Counter from collections.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three lines.\n- Concatenate guest and host to get expected_letters.\n- Create a Counter for expected_letters.\n- Create a Counter for the pile.\n- If the two Counters are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter compares based on element counts. So regardless of the order in which letters appear, the counts must match.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All letters are the same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". That should work.\n\nCase 2: Letters in different cases. But the problem says all letters are uppercase, so no issue.\n\nCase 3: The sum of the lengths of guest and host is not equal to the length of pile. Then immediately, we can return NO without further checks.\n\nYes! That's an important optimization. Because if the total number of letters in guest plus host doesn't match the pile's length, it's impossible. So before creating the Counters, I should check this.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Read guest, host, pile.\n2. Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n3. Else, create Counter for (guest + host) and for pile.\n4. Compare the two Counters. If equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nThat makes sense. Because if the lengths don't match, it's definitely a NO.\n\nSo now, in code:\n\nRead the three lines:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, check the lengths:\n\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # proceed to count\n\nBut wait, what about empty lines? The problem statement says each line is not empty, so no need to worry.\n\nNow, create the expected:\n\nexpected = guest + host\nfrom collections import Counter\ncount_expected = Counter(expected)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif count_expected == count_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the core logic.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input in the problem shows that the first line is the guest's name, second the host's, third the pile.\n\nIn the first example, the expected is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ, and the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, let me see: SANTACLAUS is 10 letters, DEDMOROZ is 8 letters. So 18 letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUSâ€”wait, that's 18 letters as well.\n\nAnd when we combine guest and host, their letters should match the pile.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample, where the pile has an extra L and is missing a P.\n\nSo the code will correctly detect that.\n\nWhat about when the pile has more letters than expected? For example, guest+host is length 5, pile is 6. Then the initial length check fails, and code outputs NO.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the pile is exactly the same as guest+host? Then it's",

This means that all letters from the guest and host should be present in the pile, and there should be no extra letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths:** Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in the combined guest and host names, and separately count the letters in the pile.\n4. **Compare Counters:** If the two counters are identical, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines of input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the total number of letters matches\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Combine guest and host to get the expected letters\n    expected = guest + host\n    # Create counters for expected and pile\n    count_expected = Counter(expected)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counters\n    if count_expected == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input consists of three lines which are read using `input().strip()`.\n2. **Length Check:** Before proceeding further, we check if the sum of the lengths of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. This is an early exit condition to avoid unnecessary processing.\n3. **Combining Names:** We concatenate the guest's and host's names to form a single string representing all the expected letters.\n4. **Counting Letters:** Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined expected string and the pile.\n5. **Comparison:** Finally, we compare the two counters. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names, and we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".",
